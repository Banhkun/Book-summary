## Part 6: Master Physical and Sexual Practices

In this section, we’ll discuss the goal of sexual intimacy, your role in it, and what you can do to give your greatest sexual gift.

### Channel Your Energy Through Your Breath

The Superior Man releases the tension of others by releasing his own, through them, and sharing his gift of openness with the world. In this section, you’ll learn how to use your breath to channel your energy.

#### Breathe Into Your Tension

**As you move through your day, facing fear, sadness, uncertainty, and stress, the front of your body tightens.** When you think hard, your forehead wrinkles; when you feel threatened, your solar plexus gets queasy; when you’re nervous, your stomach becomes tight. As this continues from day to day, you begin to curl into yourself—you hunch forward, grit your teeth, and your breathing shallows. Your thoughts become centered on yourself, your energy becomes constricted, and your presence shrinks into your body.

Much of your energetic power rests in your belly and abdomen; to unlock it, focus on your breath. **Through conscious breathing, you can release the fear and anxiety that accumulate in your body as tension.**

**What to Do:**

As you curl into yourself, you turn your unexpressed energy into tension. That tension is a manifestation of the energy you are unable to turn outwards. **Instead of curling inward, give that energy as a gift.** Use it to do the dishes, or to build a business that helps others. Convert your blocked energy into service instead of storing it as tension.

At random times throughout the day inhale deeply through your nose, ballooning your breath into areas of tightness and stretching the front of your body open.

  1. Inhale: fill your lower belly, and exhale smoothly and fully.
  2. Inhale: fill your belly, then your solar plexus and your lower chest, and exhale.
  3. Inhale: fill your belly, your solar plexus, and then your entire chest.



Repeat this several times.

**Your breath is the primary expression of your energy** ; it’s one of the most powerful ways to give your gift to the world. In the same way you breathe open your own tension, you can breathe open the tension of others.

Whether at work, with your woman, or with a crowd on a bus, you can feel the tensions of others and inhale into them. Allow your fullness to expand out into them and fill them, forcing the tension out. In this way,**send your attention out into the world** , all day, dissolving its unease with the force of your love. Not only will _you_ feel less tense, but the people around you will be calmed by the freedom and openness of your loving energy.

#### Channel Your Lust

Most men waste the energy of lust by letting it stagnate in their head, through sexual fantasy, or in their genitals, through ejaculation.

**Lust is the desire to unite with the feminine, to lose yourself in giving.** The Superior Man channels his lust into energy, using it to empower him in the giving of his unique gift.

**What to Do:**

Your head and your genitals are the two poles of your body; instead of letting your lust settle in one pole, circulate it through your entire body. **Use your breath to move and magnify the energy of lust, letting it fill your heart, and then turn it outward.** Use the sexiness of women to empower your ability to give your gift and pour your love into the world.

**When you embrace your woman sexually, open her body and heart with your breath.** Inhale down the front of her body as you would through your own, filling her with the force of your love—genitals, belly, and heart. Exhale, and let the both of you dissolve into the ocean of your shared loving. Breathe _through_ her, replacing the tension and closure of her body and heart with the force of your love.

### Give Her Everything

The Superior Man prioritizes connection over pleasure. He gives his _greatest_ gift to his woman, matching her unrestrained surrender with his wholehearted ravishment.

#### Ejaculate Consciously, or Not at All

Your woman may enjoy making you ejaculate—she may even say she doesn’t feel sexually fulfilled unless you do—but when you ejaculate and lose your erection you disappoint her. **She feels the loss of desire that accompanies your release** —feels you turning away from her and detaching from your intimacy, as much emotionally and spiritually as physically.

Ejaculation without conscious choice or control weakens you physically, spiritually, and relationally. **Your addiction to ejaculation prevents you from experiencing the full union of sexual love.**

Most women have the capacity for multiple, deepening orgasms, each further opening her heart and spirit, releasing her fear and inhibition, and dissolving her consciousness into love. **When you choose the temporary pleasure of an ejaculation and retreat into disinterest, you subtly inform her that you don’t value the full depth of her openness.** And if you truly prefer the transient pleasure of ejaculation over your shared unity of body and heart, why _should_ she open herself fully to you?

When your woman sees that you’re satisfied with a quick release—that your _goal_ is release, rather than a perfect union—you show her that’s your priority. That in all things, you will seek release over completion, and you will lose her trust in life as you have in sex. **As long as you’re addicted to ejaculation, your woman will remain sexually, emotionally, and spiritually unfulfilled.**

The Superior Man chooses—even in sex—to be conscious and aware, never compromising his ability to give his greatest gift to his fullest capacity.

Your goal in sex should be to achieve the highest degree of intimacy and sexual fulfillment available to you—your woman is giving you the gift of her full and open surrender; **you owe her your greatest gift in return.**

#### Practice Conscious Sexual Intercourse

The Superior Man’s focus is on giving. He gives his greatest gift at every opportunity—learning, practicing, and growing in sex, as he would in elsewhere.

**The following techniques will be effective only if you practice love during sex.** The natural energy of love guides the circulation of your energy in the most healthy way.

**In sex with your partner, your attention must be focused outward** : on your partner, your shared experience, and your love. Relax your muscles when you feel yourself squinching up. Breathe deeply and slowly when you notice the pace of your breathing increase. Feel the sensations of your partner more than your own.

To fully realize the transformative potential of sex, you must recondition your body and nervous system. There are two steps to this: pelvic floor contraction and energy circulation via the breath.

##### Strengthen Your Pelvic Floor

First, learn to consciously contract the muscles in your pelvic floor: your genitals, anus, and perineum****(the space between your genitals and your anus). When you contract the muscles in this area, focus on pulling it upward toward your spine, and into your body. It’ll feel much like trying to hold it on your way to the bathroom.

Practice this in sets of 15 or 20, contracting those muscles and holding them for as long as you can. **Do it three or four times a day** ; eventually, it will become easy, and you’ll be able to hold it as long as you want.

##### Practice Circulating Your Energy

Practice breathing such that your inhale moves energy down the front of your body and your exhale moves energy up your spine.**Breathe in this circle throughout the day** , moving your energy so it doesn’t become stuck in your genitals or head.

Then, practice moving your sexual energy up your spine. You already feel it when it builds up behind and inside of your genitals, swelling and pushing to be released; this same energy can be moved upward instead of out. It may be easiest for you to do this on a deep inhale or a slow exhale. Experiment to see what works best for you.

At first, you’ll have to visualize it, but the more you practice, the more you’ll feel the energy moving. When the energy of orgasm moves _up_ your body instead of out, you’ll discover a more pleasurable orgasm than the typical quick-release burst you’re used to. It’ll feel healing and revitalizing instead of draining and exhausting.

##### Combine the Two to Extend Your Connection

**During sex, relax the front of your body and keep your breath full.** Don’t focus on a particular sensation; feel fully and openly, and feel outward—even beyond your own sensations and those of your partner. Feel out toward infinity.

**When you come close to orgasm, stop moving** , pull your pelvic floor in and up, and breathe the energy of your orgasm up your spine. When you combine the pulling contraction with the breath up your spine, you should feel the strength of your erection as well as your need to ejaculate decrease slightly. Repeat this as often as necessary during sex to extend your connection with your partner until you achieve the perfect union you desire.

You may find it helpful to clench your hands and teeth and look upwards, though as you become more practiced you’ll find that breathing, feeling, and intending are enough to move the energy. As it shoots up your spine, enjoy the feelings, colors, and bliss that rain down through your body. Once you’re good at this, you’ll be able to feel into your partner as you experience this form of orgasm, and evoke the same feeling in them. **Moving your energy upward will magnetically draw hers along with it.**
