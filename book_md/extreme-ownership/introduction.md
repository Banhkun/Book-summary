## Introduction: The Many Facets of Leadership

In this chapter we get an introduction to the concept of Extreme Ownership and several leadership principles and strategies. Each of the principles will get a more in-depth explanation in later chapters.

### There Is No “I” in Leader

While many leadership books and training courses focus on developing individual habits and traits, leadership is inextricably tied to the _team’s_ performance. There are only two types of leaders — effective and ineffective — and **the only way to measure a leader’s effectiveness is based on whether her team succeeds or fails**.

As the person at the top of the chain of command, everything ultimately reflects back on you. You must make decisions quickly and definitively, and accept their consequences, good or bad.

Additionally, you need to believe in your mission or plan, and have no doubt about why you and your team are working to achieve it. When a leader displays that confidence and certainty, her team will also feel confident and can carry out the plan effectively and with conviction. If someone on the team doesn’t agree with or understand the purpose — the “why” — of a plan, then the leader must be able to thoroughly explain it. We’ll explore this more in Chapter 3.

Finally, every leader will inevitably face failure. How leaders respond to failure is a key indicator of how well they will be able to adapt, improve, and move forward for ultimate success. **Owning your mistakes is a critical aspect of Extreme Ownership and requires leaders to have the humility to admit and address their mistakes in order to find a better strategy for next time.**

The same principles apply to leaders at every level, from senior officers to junior officers, and from C-suite executives to middle managers. Each leader has her own team to direct and supervise, and the top leaders can’t succeed unless the lower-level leaders do.

Similarly, leaders should not only accept but also encourage input from all team members, down to the lowest seniority. Each person on the team has a distinct role and insight, and they are all necessary to collectively accomplish the team’s goals.

### Battle Story: Stay Calm, Execute, and Carry On

The SEALs are on a nighttime mission in a small village near Ramadi, where intelligence reports claim a terrorist leader (and possibly his armored group of fighters) are staying. After three months spent trying to capture the terrorist, a leader for al Qaeda in Iraq, the SEALs are determined tonight to find and kill him so that he can’t orchestrate any more attacks on U.S. and friendly forces or innocent civilians.

As troops enter the house they are targeting, a SEAL spots a squirter — someone escaping from the targeted building. The SEAL and Babin, the ground force commander and leader for this operation, chase the unidentified man, unsure whether he’s the terrorist leader himself or has information about the leader’s whereabouts. They chase the man around the corner and finally catch him, but Babin realizes that not only are they now separated from their team and surrounded by buildings that haven’t been cleared for safety, but the other SEALs don’t even know where they are. Worse, a group of men are now approaching with AK-47s and other heavy weapons.

Babin’s mind is spinning with the four tasks that all need immediate action:

  * Search the captive for weapons or a suicide belt
  * Escape from the group of approaching enemies
  * Link back up with the rest of the troops on the mission
  * Resume his role as leader of the operation to ensure the mission’s success



Babin remembers the words of his boss, Lieutenant Commander Willink: **“Relax. Look around. Make a call.”** He implements one of the Laws of Combat, **Prioritize and Execute**.

Babin’s first priority is to handle the group of enemy fighters. If he doesn’t address this first, he will likely be killed, and the enemies could move on to attack the rest of the nearby SEAL forces. He shoots at the group of men, killing and wounding some and dispersing the rest.

His second priority is to get himself and his fellow SEAL back to the rest of their force, in case the enemies who managed to escape regroup and come back with more fighters. To get back to their team, the two implement another Law of Combat, Cover and Move; on or off the battlefield, this strategy is all about teamwork. Babin provides cover while the other SEAL moves forward, then the SEAL provides cover as Babin moves ahead. Using this method, they essentially leapfrog back to the team, bringing their prisoner along with them.

Babin’s third priority is to check the captive for explosives. Now that he and his teammate are with the rest of their force, they can hand off the captive to the SEAL team responsible for dealing with prisoners.

The final priority is for Babin to resume his role as leader of the mission. He can safely turn his attention back to the operation now that the three more pressing and dangerous matters have been addressed.

**By strategically prioritizing, Babin actually accomplishes everything more efficiently** , as handing off the prisoner to his teammates saves him the time and trouble of checking the captive himself, while also putting the task in the hands of the experts.

The mission is not entirely successful because the SEALs don’t ultimately find or capture the terrorist leader; however, they make their presence felt and, presumably, temporarily distract the terrorist from orchestrating another attack while he finds a new place to hide.

As he does after every mission, Babin assesses what can be done better next time. He determines that he and his team can study the map more carefully to be more familiar with the area in and around the mission; in this case, that would have helped him be better oriented to his surroundings when he chased the man out of the main mission area without having his map on hand. In the future, Babin can also develop clearer guidelines to determine how far anyone should chase squirters without the rest of the team being alerted.

Babin uses several critical leadership principles to get himself and his team out safely.

  * First, he implements Prioritize and Execute to determine in what order to handle the problems in front of him when everything is urgent and every second counts. 
  * Second, Babin acts decisively. He prioritizes quickly and leads his fellow SEAL through each step without second-guessing himself or displaying anything less than a confident, get-’er-done attitude. 
  * Third, Babin has the humility and open-mindedness to review the operation’s strengths and weaknesses and find ways to improve in the future. 



### The Book’s Organization

_Extreme Ownership_ is divided into three sections.

  * Part I, Chapters 1-4 discuss the foundation and mindset that leaders need in order to succeed. Although leadership is all about the team, a leader sets the tone for the team culture. Change starts with the person at the top, and a leader can’t expect her team to make changes that she doesn’t model herself. 
  * Part II, Chapters 5-8 explain the four rules leaders should implement to help their teams work efficiently and achieve their goals. 
    * Cover and Move
    * Simple
    * Prioritize and Execute
    * Decentralized Command
  * Part III, Chapters 9-12 explore how leaders can successfully navigate the difficult situations that inevitably come with the role. Leaders must maintain a careful balance to effectively carry out the principles and strategies previously discussed. 



Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of Extreme Ownership, illustrating the principle in three parts:

  * An explanation of the principle or strategy
  * A wartime story illustrating a situation when that concept proved critical
  * An anecdote from their corporate consulting experience when that same rule was applied in a business setting



(The authors clarify that the accounts from Iraq are not meant for historic reference and that some details have been changed or omitted as necessary. Additionally, some of the business stories have been modified or are composites of multiple similar situations.)
