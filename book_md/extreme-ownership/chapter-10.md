## Chapter 10: Lead Your Team and Your Boss

A leader needs to coordinate the efforts of her team as well as her senior leaders in order to accomplish any goal. This is called leading up and down the chain of command, and requires careful balance of your role as both a leader and a subordinate, effective communication, and Extreme Ownership. In order to successfully lead up and down the chain of command, keep three things in mind.

**First, take ownership of leading everyone in your world, from the junior team members below you to the bosses above you.** It is your responsibility to inform everyone of your plan, how that fits into the larger vision and goal, and what you need to accomplish that.

An effective leader makes a point of interacting with her team members and observing the challenges and reality that employees face in the field. Understanding employees’ roles and challenges can be a huge asset in making future plans and decisions for the team. However, **leaders don’t need to know every detail of frontline employees’ jobs, and junior employees don’t need to know every aspect of the big picture** ; it can distract and overwhelm them. Having a whole team of people who all know the same insight and information is not helpful.

**Second, if you aren’t getting what you need from either a boss or an employee, first look at what you can do to help them help you.** Did you clearly explain what you need? Does this person have all the information and resources she needs to deliver what you want? Does she understand how her contribution affects the success of the overall mission?

When directing her team, a leader must make sure all team members understand their duties in the plan and how they’re contributing to the larger goal. (Shortform note: This overlaps with what we discussed in Chapter 3 about ensuring that team members thoroughly understand the “why” of each plan they execute.)

In order to effectively lead her team, a leader also needs to have the information and resources she needs from her higher-ups. **If you aren’t getting the information or support you need to lead your team, Extreme Ownership requires you to take responsibility and talk to your boss about what you need and what you can do to make it easier for your boss to provide it to you** (e.g. deliver information more efficiently so she can make key decisions, or communicate more clearly what support you need for your team).

A leader needs to be able to tactfully communicate with her boss to explain her needs and give the boss situational awareness. This requires more finesse than leading down the chain of command, when the leader’s authority over her employees holds a lot of persuasive power in its own right. When leading up the chain of command, a leader needs to demonstrate her skill, knowledge, experience, and professionalism to get what she needs from her boss.If done well, your boss will appreciate that you are doing what you can to help her do what you’re asking, and she may be more inclined to provide support and resources in the future.

**Third, instead of _asking_ your boss what to do, _tell_ her what you plan to do.** Be proactive and show your boss that you have the knowledge and confidence to effectively lead. This shows that you are doing everything you can within your authority to make things run smoothly, taking some weight off the boss’s shoulders and hopefully freeing up her energy to do what you need from her.

However, as a leader, you must also keep in mind that your boss has to consider the bigger picture when making decisions — just as you do with your own team — and you should respect your boss’s decision whether or not it comes down in your favor. **Even when you disagree with your boss, it’s critical to the entire company’s success that leadership presents a united front** ; therefore, you should relay all decisions and plans to your team as if they were your own.

### Battle Story: Leaders Interpret Information to Their Teams and Their Bosses

#### Leading Down the Chain of Command

Willink and Babin have just returned home from Iraq, and Willink is tasked with creating a presentation for the head of the U.S. Navy to explain what his task unit achieved in Ramadi. Willink takes a map of Ramadi and overlays a visual representation of all the areas where the team pushed out the enemy and built a combat outpost to spread the presence and power of U.S. and Iraqi forces; when Babin sees the illustration, it’s the first time he grasps the breadth of their impact.

During their deployment, Babin was involved in just about every mission represented on the map, but he had been so caught up in the details of each operation that he never took a step back to see the big picture of what they were accomplishing. He realizes that if he didn’t recognize the full impact of their efforts, there was no way his troops had. As a leader, he should have kept a better sense of the big picture, and in turn imparted that to his team.

Leaders often overestimate their teams’ understanding of how a plan or their individual duties tie in with the overarching goal. **A leader is responsible for helping her team connect the dots between their performance and the larger organization’s success, for the sake of their morale, conviction, and quality of work.**

Upon reflection, Babin feels he should have taken more time to explain the “why” to his team and delegated more planning to his troops so that they would have more ownership of the mission. A strong sense of investment in each mission and conviction that their work was making a significant difference in the region was essential for the SEALs to endure the difficult and extreme conditions they faced in Ramadi — from the intense desert heat to the constant threat of death.

#### Leading Up the Chain of Command

Babin receives an email from higher-ups with questions about a mission he’s planning to begin in a few hours. He’s frustrated and furious that he has to spend precious time explaining details to officers who are in another city and don’t understand the day-to-day reality of the conditions he and his team face in Ramadi.

Babin vents to Willink, who is stationed with him in Ramadi and holds the position above Babin and below the commanding officer who sent the email. Willink has also been frustrated by the never-ending — and often seemingly obvious — questions, but he reasons with Babin that the senior leaders aren’t trying to make things more difficult. Granted, the officers don’t fully understand life and battle in Ramadi. But they are part of the same organization and have the same overall goals.

Willink points out the officer’s perspective: He is in charge of the larger-scale operation and has to green-light every mission, so he can’t know all the details of every unit’s frontline experience. **Instead of blaming the officer for his lack of understanding, Babin and Willink can make a point of providing all the information he’ll need to approve their missions and allow them to move forward** ; they need to lead up the chain of command. The officer needs to feel confident in each mission before he can approve it, so Babin and Willink’s best course of action is to work with him — not against him — to make him feel comfortable and confident. If the officer still has questions, it’s their own fault for not offering enough or the right kind of information.

Babin and Willink explain to the team leaders below them that their course of action going forward will be to provide as much detailed information as possible to the commanding officer to help build his understanding of their efforts in Ramadi. They invite the officer and other senior leaders to Ramadi to accompany them on combat operations. Through these efforts, the officer gains not only a better understanding but also more trust in what the SEALs are doing in Ramadi; from that point forward, he approves every mission they submit.

### Business Application: Don’t Resent Your Superiors; Help Them Help You

A field manager is frustrated that his company’s corporate leaders don’t seem to understand what his team is dealing with in the field. He feels he is forced to spend so much time submitting paperwork and fielding questions from the higher-ups, who are located in headquarters hundreds of miles away, that it pulls him and his team away from doing their job.

Babin asks the manager if he thinks the company leaders want his field leadership team to fail. **The manager realizes that his bosses obviously aren’t trying to impede him, being that his team’s performance in the field essentially determines the business’s success or failure.** Then, Babin goes on, the senior executives must need information.

Ultimately, it’s the field manager’s fault for not providing adequate information if his bosses are asking for more. The manager needs to effectively lead up the chain of command — working with senior leadership instead of resenting them — for the sake of his team’s performance; the power is in his hands, not his bosses’. In order to do this, he has to let go of the “us versus them” mentality that is so common and easy to fall into.

The field manager takes the advice to heart: He finds out what kind of information the corporate executives specifically need, goes above and beyond to provide them with that information, and even hosts them for a field visit to see his team in action. As a result, the field leadership team develops a camaraderie with the senior leaders, and the senior leaders gain a better understanding of the field team’s challenges.
