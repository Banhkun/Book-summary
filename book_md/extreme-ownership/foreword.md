## Foreword

The book’s authors, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin, are both former U.S. Navy SEALs who trained SEAL leaders and led teams of their own as officers during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Willink was a lieutenant commander and Babin served under him as a ground force commander in Ramadi, Iraq, the deadly and hostile center of Iraqi insurgency. After their military careers, they went on to advise businesses in a wide range of industries through their consulting firm, Echelon Front.

Willink and Babin found combat to be a more intense, amplified version of regular life. But the principles of decision-making and leadership that they developed in combat still hold true in business and day-to-day life. Whether on the battlefield or in corporate America, Willink and Babin found one primary trait among all successful leaders: Extreme Ownership. Leaders are responsible for the direction and success of their teams, and practicing **Extreme Ownership entails taking responsibility for every aspect of their team and the task they’re working to accomplish**. This leaves no room for blame or excuses, only an honest assessment of what works and what doesn’t in order to constantly improve.

When a leader exercises Extreme Ownership, she puts her own ego aside for the good of the group. It sets an example and creates an environment in which everyone on the team can do the same on an individual level. Again, this discourages people from spending time and energy making excuses and placing blame on other people or circumstances, and instead puts all the focus on how to work together to achieve the task at hand.

Willink and Babin intermittently repeat the caveat that the concept of Extreme Ownership, although simple, is not easy. However, when executed, it makes for more effective leaders, more productive employees, more supportive spouses, and more successful individuals.
