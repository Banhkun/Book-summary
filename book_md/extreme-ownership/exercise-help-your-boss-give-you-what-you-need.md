## Exercise: Help Your Boss Give You What You Need

Although sometimes it feels like your boss is creating hurdles for you to do your job, Extreme Ownership requires you to analyze what _you_ can do to break down that barrier.

* * *

Describe a recent occasion when you felt your superiors were impeding your work more than supporting it. Specifically, how were they creating roadblocks?

Ideally, what kind of support did you need from them to help you be successful?

Step into your bossesâ€™ shoes: What would have helped them provide that support (e.g. more information or a better understanding of your workflow)?

What could you have done to provide them with what they needed to better support you? What could you have communicated?
