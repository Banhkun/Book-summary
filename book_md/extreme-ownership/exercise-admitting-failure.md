## Exercise: Admitting Failure

Accepting fault and admitting failure is one of the hardest things to do as a leader. Use this exercise to practice recognizing and admitting your own shortcomings in order to improve for the future.

Describe a recent incident in which you were working with at least one other person to accomplish something, and either you didn’t achieve it or things didn’t go as planned.

What are one or two major reasons the plan failed?

What was your role or involvement in each of these factors? Or — if they were based on other people’s actions — how could you have intervened to help and increase the odds of successfully achieving the goal?

Do you now feel like you are taking Extreme Ownership of this failure? Why or why not?
