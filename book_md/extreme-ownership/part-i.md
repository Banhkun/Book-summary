## Part I: Mindset | Chapter 1: Leaders Take Responsibility and Give Credit

The first four chapters discuss the mindset a leader must have to lead her team successfully. The foundation of good leadership starts within, and a leader needs the right attitude to implement the strategies in Part II. An effective leader takes responsibility for her team’s shortcomings, establishes and maintains high standards, understands and clearly communicates the purpose of each goal, and checks her ego.

* * *

This chapter focuses on how leaders can practice Extreme Ownership by taking accountability for everything that happens under their direction. Leadership carries great responsibility, and a leader’s authority to direct her team means that she is also the one who must answer for the team’s performance.

If an employee or subordinate makes a mistake, a leader should not blame him. Instead, the leader has to question whether she adequately explained the mission and the plan, and if she gave the team member the training and resources he would need to be successful.

If a member of your team is underperforming, you must take it upon yourself to train and mentor that person for the good of the team. However, if the team member continues to fall short, the leader eventually needs to make the call to fire that person and replace him with someone more competent. **The success of the team as a whole (and its goals) is always more important than any one individual, whether the boss or an employee.**

Extreme Ownership calls for leaders to take full responsibility for their failures. This is one of the hardest aspects of leadership: It’s tough enough admitting your mistakes as an individual, but it’s even harder when you’ve been charged with leading a whole team of people and have to own up to leading them astray or failing them in some way. Nonetheless, this is absolutely necessary to learn, grow, and succeed.

**If you deny or try to shift the blame for a failure, you can’t learn or grow from it.** Taking responsibility allows leaders to unflinchingly and objectively analyze a team’s problems and challenges; this process is critical to succeeding in the long run and continually improving.

This is even harder when you have to admit your — or your team’s — shortcomings to senior leadership. It may feel like professional suicide to call attention to your mistakes, but most likely your bosses are already aware of the lacking performance and will be impressed if you can own it and commit to improving it.

**Don’t let your successes cloud your ability to see your failures** (or areas that could use improvement).**** You may develop a great plan but come up short in leading your team to carry it out, or you perhaps you avoid one pitfall but fall victim to another. You can pat yourself on the back for your good work, but don’t neglect to take an objective view of _everything_ and fix the issues that exist or find the ways you can be more effective next time. No person or plan is perfect, and there is always room for improvement. A good leader seeks constructive criticism and constantly looks for ways to perform better.

As a leader, **don’t take credit for your team’s success**. Instead, pass on the credit to all the team members and lower-level leaders who made success possible. This sets the tone for everyone on the team that **success is achieved as a unit** , creating a culture that is entirely focused on the good of the team.

When a leader takes responsibility for failures and gives credit to her team for successes, it serves as an example to the lower leaders to adopt the same mindset of Extreme Ownership. Infecting the whole team with an attitude of Extreme Ownership causes everyone to operate with the team and its mission as the main priority, and this puts the whole organization in the best position to succeed.

### Battle Story: Taking Blame for a Battlefield Mistake

It’s the spring of 2006 and Willink is leading his forces in their first major operation in Ramadi, Iraq, where they’ll be deployed for nearly six months. Their mission involves about 300 U.S. and Iraqi troops, including SEALs, Army Soldiers, and Marines. The operation aims to wrest control of a particularly dangerous, enemy-held neighborhood called Mala’ab District from the enemy insurgent fighters.

The troops are progressing from building to building, clearing each one of enemy fighters as they go. A few hours into the mission, several gunfights are blazing between U.S. troops and insurgents.

A Marine sergeant reports to Willink that he is targeting a building where he suspects that enemies are hiding and have killed and wounded several Iraqi soldiers. A U.S. tank is positioned to shoot at the building, and the sergeant is coordinating airstrikes to also drop bombs on the building. However, Willink feels that something is off.

One of the SEAL sniper teams was originally stationed nearby, abandoned its post, and was in the midst of relocating when the gunfire went off at this building. The sniper team hasn’t yet reported their new location, and Willink worries that in the confusion of battle the SEALs could be in the targeted building.

Against the advice of the Marine sergeant, Willink insists on checking out the building before attacking. When he enters, rifle drawn, he comes face to face with a fellow SEAL.

The SEAL explains to Willink what happened: The SEAL sniper team had mistakenly shot the Iraqi soldiers, not recognizing them as friendly forces in the early morning darkness. Thinking they were under attack, the SEALs then called in for backup, and the Marines and Army troops responded by attacking this building, assuming it where the enemy fighters were located. The SEALs in the building couldn’t tell that it was U.S. troops shooting at them, so they fired back, and each side was convinced they were under vicious enemy attack.

**Willink’s calm, clear thinking under (literal) fire prevented a bomb from dropping on the SEAL team.** However, with one Iraqi soldier dead plus a SEAL and several Iraqi soldiers wounded, there had still been blue-on-blue (the term for friendly fire, or fratricide), which he explains is the absolute worst thing that can happen in battle. As a leader, he feels guilty and gravely responsible.

Higher-ranking commanding officers get word of the blue-on-blue, shut down the operation, and come to the base in Ramadi to investigate — and likely fire whoever’s to blame. As Willink gathers information, he sees many mistakes made by various people during the planning and execution phases that led to the blue-on-blue. **But at the end of the day, as the leader, he sees himself as being ultimately responsible for any and all mishaps.**

When Willink presents this information to the troops and the commanding officers, he outlines what went wrong and takes full responsibility as the mission’s commander. He takes the blame (even pardoning SEALs who suggest that the failure was their fault in one way or another) and vows never to let such a mistake happen again. **As a result of Willink’s humility and Extreme Ownership of the situation, his bosses actually gain more trust and respect for him.** He speculates that had he blamed others instead, he would have been fired.

Willink and his team go on to analyze what happened and how to take lessons from this situation to improve procedures and missions — and hopefully prevent any more fratricide — in the future.

### Business Application: A Manager Must Step Up

The vice president of manufacturing at a large company proposed a plan the previous year that aimed to cut production costs. But so far it isn’t working, and the board of directors wants an explanation and solution.

The plan includes several strategies:

  * Consolidate manufacturing plants to cut out redundancy
  * Use incentivized bonuses to spur employee productivity
  * Streamline manufacturing



The strategies seem solid, so the issue must be in the execution. The VP assesses how and why the company is facing problems carrying out the plan.

First, distribution managers worry that consolidating the manufacturing plants will curtail in-person interaction between the plants and distribution centers, and that this will hinder communication to be able to adjust orders on short notice. The VP had dismissed the concerns, reasoning that phone or video calls would suffice.

Second, plant managers and other leaders resist the bonus program, saying that it would cut employees’ earnings and prompt them to leave for other companies that pay more. The VP tried pushing harder, and in response the manufacturing managers and sales managers teamed up to oppose the plan.

Third, nearly everyone is resisting streamlining manufacturing because they don’t see a reason to change the way things have always been done.

The VP has explained all this to the board of directors. Additionally, the VP has told the board that other factors — including tough market conditions, learning curves for new technologies, and several products that pulled attention away from making these changes — are contributing to the plan’s failure so far. But after a year of little progress, these all sound like excuses and the board is getting frustrated.

The VP has to confront the fact that, despite all the legitimate barriers, he is ultimately responsible for the plan’s failure. He needs to lead his team to understand the plan, which will help them to support and successfully execute it.

First, **the VP must acknowledge that he is not infallible. If he thinks that he is always right, then when something goes wrong, the only place for blame is on others.** This mindset prevents him from objectively assessing what’s standing in the way of success, and considering that it could include his approach to the situation. Good leaders own their failures and constantly seek ways to improve; great leaders keep their egos in check, accept blame, consistently ask for constructive criticism, and carefully note how they can improve in the future.

Second, the VP has to tell the board that the plan’s failure thus far is his fault. Although it feels like taking the fall for others’ noncompliance, he begins to see the logic when he is confronted with a hypothetical question: If one of the manufacturing managers he oversees told him that her team is failing, would his response be to blame the team? No, says the VP, he would blame the manager.

The VP ultimately takes responsibility for the failure and presents the board with his plan to correct the issues and get everyone on track to successfully execute the plan. (Shortform note: The book doesn’t offer many details about how he will resolve the issues, but illustrates the importance of taking responsibility as a leader and implies that the resolution will involve explaining the purpose of the plan to its critics in a way that alleviates their concerns and helps them understand why this is the best approach to take for the good of the company as a whole.)
