## Chapter 6: Keep It Simple

Life always brings surprises, so you must always expect the unexpected. If you keep plans simple, you control what you can while minimizing confusion when something inevitably goes off course. Simplifying a plan also requires you to narrow your focus to the most critical priorities, which helps reinforce the overarching goal for both you and your team.

By contrast, when plans are complicated, you increase the chances of people not understanding them. **If people don’t understand the basic plan, how can they execute it? Furthermore, they are less able to adapt when things go wrong with complicated plans.**

A team works more effectively when communication is simple and straightforward. Everyone on the team should strive to relay information to each other simply, explicitly, and concisely, especially in times of stress. This reduces the chance of wasted time and effort due to confusion or misunderstanding.

**Plans must be made to be simple, and leaders need to explain them in a simple, clear, and concise way.** A leader should also encourage all team members, no matter how junior, to speak up if they have questions or concerns. (As we discussed in Chapter 3, a leader is responsible for getting every member of her team to understand a plan or goal — and conversely, team members are responsible for speaking up if they don’t understand.)

### Battle Story: Simplify for Safety

The SEALs and Army are working together on a mission to clear an enemy-held area of Ramadi and establish an outpost. Although enemy fighters are attacking the U.S. troops as they build this outpost, the U.S. and (friendly) Iraqi forces have chosen this specific location to do a presence patrol, which entails establishing a presence in enemy-held territory to show strength and to indicate to the local civilians that U.S. forces are determined to take the city back from insurgents.

A military transition team (U.S. Army Soldiers and Marines who train and advise Iraqi soldiers), known as MiTT, joins the effort by creating a plan to patrol the neighborhood with Iraqi soldiers. But when Willink hears the MiTT leader’s operation, he worries that the plan reflects a poor understanding of the reality and risks of a city as dangerous as Ramadi.

First, the route the MiTT plans to take winds through some of the most hostile areas of the city, on roads that the minesweeping teams haven’t cleared for safety.

Second, the route takes the team through several different U.S. military territories — including multiple Army and Marine Corps companies and an Army battalion — that each have distinct SOPs and radio networks. Passing through all those groups’ battle spaces would require coordinating with all of them, adding unnecessary complexity to the plan.

Third, the long proposed route in the intense heat of the Iraqi summer calls for lots of water, and its path through such hostile enemy territory requires immense amounts of ammunition.

Willink suggests that the MiTT leader simplify the plan, at least for the team’s first few operations. After some skepticism and resistance, the leader agrees to a shorter route that passes only through SEAL-controlled battlespace.

As the MiTT and Iraqi soldiers review the plan before going out on patrol, Willink notices that everyone seems a little too casual and unconcerned about the operation. He doubts that they realize the risks involved. Willink directs a team of SEAL snipers to cover the patrol from an overwatch position for extra protection.

Twelve minutes after the patrol begins, gunfire starts and the MiTT and Iraqi soldiers are attacked. Willink gets a report that two are wounded and need help. **A SEAL leader relays the information to Willink — simply and clearly, despite the chaos and confusion — so that he can send help to the right location**.

When the MiTT returns, Willink discovers two Iraqi soldiers have been killed. The MiTT leader is rattled by the experience, and recognizes that **the operation would have been even riskier had he not agreed to simplify the plan**.

### Business Application: Simple = Effective

A company is rolling out a new bonus program for its manufacturing plant, but the employees are baffled by it: They don’t understand how bonuses are calculated and what aspects of their performance the new plan intends to reward or punish.

The chief engineer and plant manager developed the bonus plan to maximize the production staff’s efficiency, factoring in several factors:

  * The complexity of each product’s assembly
  * The demand for each product
  * The quality of the product’s assembly
  * The relative number of bonuses being awarded
  * Each employee’s performance history 



The engineer and manager worked so hard to create a system that reflected every level of complexity, that they overlooked how that complexity makes the system virtually useless to their employees;**if the plan is too confusing for workers to understand, then it does nothing to incentivize them.** The elaborate system created to maximize efficiency is not accomplishing that goal, so it’s a failed plan.

The chief engineer and plant manager simplify the bonus system to capture the main priorities of production — the demand for various products, and the quality at which they’re being produced. The engineer and manager explain the simpler plan to employees, and the workers finally have a solid understanding of how they can improve their performance to earn bonuses. As a result, the company sees an uptick in productivity almost immediately.

Additionally, as the higher-performing employees work even harder, now incentivized by the bonuses, the low-performing employees have fewer orders to fill. The company is able to identify and let go of these weak links, which helps the success of the entire team. **The employees and the company as a whole benefit from having a much simpler plan that everyone can understand and execute.**
