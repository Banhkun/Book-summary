## Chapter 4: Keep Your Ego In Check

Too much ego — whether the leader’s or a team member’s — inhibits a team’s or company’s ability to succeed. You must be humble and open-minded to practice Extreme Ownership, and that requires you to check your ego.

The team and its mission must always come first; **no one person can be more important than the collective team.** As a leader, you set the tone for your team; establishing a culture that encourages teamwork and discourages competitiveness and ego sets your team up for success.

Too much ego can cause a leader or team member to put herself and her own personal goals above the team’s mission. As soon as someone is acting in their own interest, instead of the best interest of the team, it is detrimental to the team and its success. No matter how talented a person is, having too much ego can jeopardize an entire organization’s success. Leaders need to recognize when an employee’s ego is outweighing her strengths, and they must cut her if she is holding back the team or company.

Ego impedes progress; **you can’t objectively assess your performance and continually look for ways to improve in the future if your ego is telling you that you did everything right.** As a leader, a dominating ego doesn’t allow you to take the blame for something that you didn’t directly do (but someone on your team did). But putting your ego aside and humbly accepting that responsibility allows you and your team to be open to constructive criticism, learn from the mistake, and move forward.

Ego also causes you to be reactive and inhibits your ability to have productive conversations. If you are approaching a subordinate, your ego can make her less receptive to your message. On the other hand, if you are taking directions from a superior, your ego will make _you_ less receptive to hearing and benefitting from the information.

Keeping your focus on the team and its larger goal will help you keep your ego in check. Recognize others’ strengths and expertise and how they can help the team achieve its mission. **Don’t let your ego lure you into seeing others’ strengths as competition, but rather appreciate them as assets.**

If someone’s actions bruised your ego, consider her perspective and what might have led her to act in that way. For example, if an employee did something outside her authority or your boss seems to be questioning you excessively, think about what her motive might be and that it likely has nothing to do with trying to show you up in some way. Furthermore, Extreme Ownership calls for you to **consider how _you_ may have mistakenly contributed to those actions**, by not giving your employee explicit instructions, or not providing enough information to your boss.

### Battle Story: Ego Gets In The Way Of A Team’s Success

The U.S. troops in Ramadi — including the Army, Marines, and SEALs — must work together to successfully tamp down insurgent forces. The insurgents’ attacks are well planned and executed, so Willink tries to instill a culture among his SEALs of constantly improving and never getting cocky or complacent.

Although SEAL units have a reputation for not always keeping their hair and uniform to typical military standards, Willink makes the members of his task unit keep their uniforms neat and haircuts short. He makes this mandate out of respect for the Army and Marine forces they work with, to show that the SEALs will maintain the same standards as those who are fighting alongside them. The SEALs who are stationed at Camp Corregidor with the Army forces even wear the same Army Combat Uniform as the Soldiers, which fosters camaraderie.

A group of extremely well-trained Iraqi soldiers and American advisers are preparing to arrive at Camp Corregidor, and one of the SEAL commanders at the camp tells Willink he is worried that the new arrivals will be better than his own troops and take over the mission. The commander even considers withholding some help and information from the new arrivals. But Willink reminds the commander that the U.S. and friendly forces must all work together to defeat the outside enemy. **The commander can’t let his ego get in the way of the team’s overall success and ability to complete the mission.**

Unfortunately, some of the new arrivals have their own ego issues. First, several don’t abide by the same standards for neat uniforms and military haircuts as the Army Soldiers and SEALs at Camp Corregidor. This attitude sends the message that they think they are above the colonel’s grooming rules, which fosters resentment among others at the base.

Second, some of the American advisers fail to show proper respect to their colleagues at camp, talking down to the Army Soldiers and even the senior leaders.

Third, the newly arrived unit shows little interest in learning from the SEAL commander and troops, despite the fact that the SEALs’ experience in Ramadi has given them invaluable knowledge about what works and what doesn’t in this environment.

And fourth, the new unit doesn’t share details of its plans and operations with the other troops, even though it is critical that all forces are in the loop about each other’s missions for the sake of everyone’s success (and survival). Failing to coordinate could also put the other U.S. forces in danger; this unit could get itself in a sticky situation and need backup from the troops. The supporting troops — who weren’t given an opportunity before the operation to bring up possibly preventable issues — now wouldn’t have basic information about the mission they’re coming in to rescue. In a worst-case scenario, failing to share information can even lead to blue-on-blue (friendly fire), meaning that the unit’s ego and behavior could jeopardize everyone involved.

After a few weeks, the colonel orders the new unit to leave Camp Corregidor. **Although the unit’s skill and equipment could have been a big help to the U.S. Army Soldiers and SEALs at the camp, the troops’ egos make them more of a risk than an asset.**

### Business Application: Don’t Act on Ego and Emotion

Gary, a middle manager for a company’s operations department, is dealing with a superintendent who failed to consult him before making a decision that violated the company’s standard operating procedures (SOP). Gary has made it clear to the superintendent in the past how things should operate, and here the superintendent ignored it.

Gary is frustrated by the superintendent’s defiance, and also worried about confronting him. The superintendent has been in the industry longer than Gary; not only does Gary feel that the superintendent looks down on Gary as having inferior knowledge and experience, but Gary also feels that the company can’t afford to lose the superintendent.

Babin is working with Gary and points out that although his ego was bruised by the superintendent’s actions, **Gary must check his ego in order to have a productive conversation with the superintendent.**

Gary realizes that the superintendent is extremely knowledgeable about the hands-on aspects of the business, but doesn’t deal with the big-picture vision of the company; the superintendent probably thought he was doing what was best, without realizing how his actions would impact the rest of the business. With his insight, Gary can approach the superintendent in a constructive way, without feeling personally burned by the superintendent’s actions.

**Gary must also practice Extreme Ownership and take responsibility for not adequately explaining the bigger picture to the superintendent, which allowed the superintendent to have the false impression that he was making a better choice by disregarding SOP.** This approach creates space for the superintendent to understand the root of the problem without feeling that Gary is attacking him because his ego is hurt. The superintendent can then put his own ego aside and recognize that, despite his vast knowledge and experience, there is a bigger company mission that he didn’t understand when he acted.

Setting both egos aside puts the entire company and its success at a higher priority than either Gary or the superintendent.
