## Chapter 12: Leadership Requires Careful Balance

Leaders set the tone and example for their teams, and as they navigate challenging situations leaders must constantly keep a careful balance of seemingly opposite forces. **When a leader struggles or is ineffective, it is typically a sign that she has veered too far to either side of one of these dichotomies** ; in this way, a leader’s greatest strength can become her weakness if she doesn’t keep it balanced.

  1. Leaders need the**confidence and competence to lead, but also the humility to follow**. If a member of the team is better informed to make a decision or lead the team through a situation, a confident leader can put her ego aside and follow. This comes back to the concept we discussed in Chapter 4, which calls for leaders to put aside their egos and make the team’s success the highest priority. 
     * A leader who resists stepping aside to let a team member take charge often lacks confidence in herself and fears the prospect of a subordinate outperforming her. 
  2. Leaders must be **aggressive but not overbearing**. On one hand, big risks can lead to big rewards. On the other hand, a leader needs to create an open environment where team members can approach her with any questions, concerns or disagreements; the leader should listen thoughtfully, discuss the plan and its purpose, and be open to adjusting her plan if need be. 
  3. A leader has to **balance remaining calm and showing emotion** — whether it is anger, frustration, excitement, or sadness. As the head of her team, a leader needs to show that she has control of herself to reinforce her team’s confidence that she also has control of the situation. However, her team also needs to understand that she is human and genuinely cares about them and the mission; how can they be emotionally invested if their leader appears robotic?
  4. A leader needs to be **confident but not cocky**. Confidence allows a leader to act decisively, and gives everyone on her team confidence in the team’s mission. Cockiness, however, goes hand-in-hand with arrogance and undermines the diligence a leader needs to thoroughly check, question, and prepare for each mission. (The military transition team, or MiTT, in Chapter 6 showed cockiness as they headed into their operation, and they ended up facing a brutal reality check.)
  5. Leaders must be **brave but not reckless**. Leaders need to accept the fact that there will always be risk and uncertainty — and, as we discussed in Chapter 11, they must be able to be decisive despite that uncertainty — but they should mitigate every risk they can.
     * In fact, the certainty that there will be unknowns and that some things are almost sure to go wrong is even more reason to minimize risks and create contingency plans whenever possible. 
  6. Leaders need to be **competitive but also able to lose graciously**. Like a coach, a leader must push her team to do their best and constantly improve. But there will inevitably be times when that effort falls short, and a leader has to be able to deal with those losses and focus on how to do better next time. If unchecked, the ego behind one person’s or one department’s individual success and competitiveness can work against the goals of the entire organization (like when that creates internal competition that impedes collaboration, as in Eduardo and Nigel’s case in Chapter 11); instead, the team’s collective, long-term success must always be the top priority.
  7. A leader has to be **detail-oriented without losing sight of the big picture**. The leader can’t effectively direct her team if she doesn’t understand the specifics of an operation, but she doesn’t need to know every single detail because her job is to maintain perspective of the overall mission and goal. (This is a key aspect of implementing Decentralized Command, as we discussed in Chapter 8.)
  8. Leaders need to be **physically and mentally strong, and also have endurance**. Leadership requires a great deal of mental toughness to navigate through difficult situations and bear the responsibility of an entire team’s performance, and leaders must be careful not to wear themselves out in short spurts. Your team needs your sustained toughness and mental agility, so be sure to pace yourself (and your team) for long-term performance and success. 
  9. Leaders must be **humble but assertive**. A leader needs to be able to check her ego (like we talked about in Chapter 4), take advice and criticism, and own up to her mistakes. But she also has to speak up — for herself, her team, and her decisions.
  10. A leader should have a **close relationship with her team members, but never to the point of compromising her authority** or the overall team’s success. Team members want to perform well for a leader who they feel cares about them, not only as employees but also as people. At the same time, team members can’t forget who’s in charge, nor should a leader’s relationship with any one person take priority over the whole team’s success. 
  11. An effective leader practices **Extreme Ownership** , taking responsibility for the success and failures of team, while also implementing **Decentralized Command** by delegating and trusting team members with various duties. (Shortform example: A leader is like the captain of an old steamboat, who is responsible for steering the ship in the right direction and calling for faster or slower speeds. She can’t perform these tasks and simultaneously be shoveling coal in the bowels of the ship to power the engine.) 
  12. As a leader, you have **nothing to prove and also everything to prove**. Your team understands and (presumably) respects your authority as a leader, so you don’t need to micromanage to demonstrate your power. However, your team members’ trust and respect for you ultimately determine your team’s success, and you can only earn their confidence through consistent good judgment and decision-making. 
  13. A leader must **implement discipline to create freedom**. Being regimented in certain habits and operations creates more flexibility and freedom in other actions. 



### Exercise Discipline to Create Freedom

It seems counterintuitive that exercising discipline in turn gives you freedom, but, as with all of the dichotomies described above, this requires balance. If you are strategic and deliberate, you can create a regimented approach that ultimately gives you more freedom.

For example, setting your alarm early (and having the discipline to get out of bed when it goes off) gives you more time and freedom to do the things you want to fit in your day. Willink explains that this was the only way to carve out time for anything — whether to study, clean, or stretch his muscles — in the tightly structured schedule of SEAL training.

This also translates to a team setting: **When a team implements disciplined SOPs, they have more freedom within those parameters.** When each team member knows her role and duties as well as the goal of the mission, she can quickly and easily adapt to changing circumstances without having to constantly get leaders’ approval (this is critical for Decentralized Command, as we talked about in Chapter 8).

If the team needs to adjust a plan, disciplined SOPs make it possible to change that aspect of the plan without throwing the entire operation out of whack; when everyone knows the procedure inside and out, it’s easy to explain which piece of it is changing and what is staying the same. And when things get confusing and chaotic — whether on the battlefield or in a business operation — everyone can fall back on the SOP.

However, leaders must be careful that their teams don’t become so rigid and stuck on the SOP that they lose that flexibility. **Leaders and teams need to be able to look at disciplined structures as a framework, while maintaining their adaptability.**

#### Battle Story: Creating Order Out of Chaos

Willink is leading a SEAL platoon on a targeted raid during his first deployment to Iraq. During these missions, he receives intelligence information about the location of a terrorist or group of terrorists, then leads his platoon on an operation to break into the building, detain the terrorists, and gather information from them and from the building (such as evidence of bomb-making material).

The SEALs did not train specifically on how to search buildings and collect evidence, so they typically ransack them. But this method creates chaos and confusion: They don’t have a system assigning people to search certain rooms or collect evidence, so they sometimes miss a room by accident or leave evidence behind because no one is designated to gather it. The helter-skelter method also takes a long time, creating more opportunity for nearby enemies to attack.

After the SEALs conduct several missions this way, the Iraqi courts impose stricter guidelines for collecting and documenting evidence. Forced by the court’s ruling, the SEALs have to create a more disciplined searching procedure. Willink assigns the task to his assistant platoon commander (Decentralized Command).

The assistant commander develops a system that assigns some SEALs to systematically search the building and others to collect evidence. His plan seems complex at first glance, but it breaks down into simple, individual roles and responsibilities. The new system designates SEALs to draw a layout of the building, assign a number label for each room, take photos and videos of evidence, and assign “room owners,” who are responsible for overseeing the searching and evidence collection in their particular room. Additionally, the plan requires SEALs to search rooms from the ground up, so that evidence doesn’t wind up buried on the floor. The plan also lays out how collected evidence should be documented and then organized once back at camp. **With everyone assigned a task under the new, disciplined system, all the work can be done simultaneously and the team can accomplish the task much more efficiently.**

When Willink and his assistant commander brief the platoon on the new system, they face resistance; the SEALs don’t see why they need to change their current approach, and insist it will take more — rather than less — time. So Willink explains the “why.” He gives the SEALs examples of how their current, undisciplined search method had failed them: Nearly everyone acknowledges there have been times when the mess of ransack-searching led them to search a room twice, or not at all.

With everyone now on board (if reluctantly), they put on their full gear and do dress rehearsals of the new system. With each run, they get faster and more convinced of the new system’s efficiency and effectiveness. By the end, they do an entire search in 10 minutes (much less than the 45 it took them with the old method).

The platoon successfully implements the new system in a mission, and even develops ways to further improve it. They now search buildings faster and leave with higher-quality evidence; this gives them the ability to search multiple buildings in a single night. In this way,**paradoxically, the discipline they imposed ends up creating more freedom**.

### Business Application: No One is More Important Than the Team

The chief financial officer of a business reveals to Willink that the company’s electrical division is losing money and he doesn’t understand why the CEO, Andy, isn’t pulling the plug on it. It turns out that the CEO of the electrical division, Mike, is an old friend of Andy’s, and it appears Andy doesn’t want to harm his friend by shutting down the division — but keeping it open is detrimental to the whole company. **Andy is prioritizing one team member above the well-being of the entire organization.**

Andy is convinced that Mike’s experience and knowledge is an asset to the company, but he acknowledges that it could be another three to five years before the electrical division is profitable. With some probing, Andy admits that this isn’t the best course for the company — they would be in a tight spot if unexpected costs come up or they hit a hurdle — but he’s reluctant to shut down his friend’s division.

Willink further explains how important it is that leaders balance the difficult dichotomies they face in order to lead the entire team to success. **Although one of Andy’s strengths may be that he has close, valuable relationships with members of his team, he can’t let that closeness impede him from making tough decisions.**

Andy finally relents and decides to shut down the electrical decision. Happily, Mike completely understands and even expected Andy’s decision, and Andy is able to move Mike to another department where his knowledge and experience are still assets to the company. **Having the discipline to make the hard decision to shut down the electrical division gave Andy the freedom to put his energy and resources into more profitable departments.**
