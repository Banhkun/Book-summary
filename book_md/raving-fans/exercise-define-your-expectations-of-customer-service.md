## Exercise: Define Your Expectations of Customer Service

Identifying how you perceive and label the service you receive from other businesses will help you to view what your business offers from a customer’s perspective.

* * *

Think of a recent time that you were impressed with the customer service you received. Why were you impressed?

What one word would you use to describe the service you received?

Now list how you want your customers to think of _you_. What words would make you feel like you had provided excellent customer service? (For example, reliable, efficient, friendly, and so on.) Don’t limit yourself—list as many words as you can think of.

Paint a clear picture of the service you dream of offering from a customer viewpoint—what do they see and experience when they interact with your business? Use the words you listed to guide and inspire you.
