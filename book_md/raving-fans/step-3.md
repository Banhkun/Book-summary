## Step 3: Integrate Your Vision With Their Needs

Now that you’ve got a clear idea of how you’re currently impacting both your internal and external customers, it’s time to **integrate your definition of excellent customer service in response to the feedback you’ve received from your external customers**. All of the possibilities for improvements can quickly become overwhelming, so we’ll focus on setting boundaries before we work on refining your vision.

#### Choose Which Customers You Serve

You’ll discover that there are some things your customers want that will be too difficult to accommodate. The authors recommend that you set boundaries on what you’re willing to offer—it’s more productive to limit yourself by accepting that you can’t please everyone and to instead focus on doing fewer things exceptionally well. The vision you created in Step 1 will be useful in helping you to judge what customer needs you’re willing to fulfill and what needs you won’t attempt to fulfill. This is why it’s important to define your own vision of excellent customer service before defining the customers’ vision.

> When given free rein, customers will suggest unrealistic features that they believe will improve their customer service experience with your business. But you won’t be able to meet every demand and please every whim. And if you attempt to do so, you’ll either burn out, lose revenue, or end up with a generic service experience. However, the idea of ignoring certain requests and missing out on potential sales can be uncomfortable for businesses to consider.
> 
> Seth Godin (author of _Purple Cow_) insists that businesses need to be clear about who they intend to serve. He argues that identifying your smallest viable audience will help you to focus and refine what you offer. In other words, you’re more likely to create an excellent service experience if you’re clear about who your customers are.

> **Shortform Exclusive: The Customer Journey Map**
> 
> _Define Your Customer Service Priorities_
> 
> Compare your vision from Step 1 with your **external customer feedback** from Step 2. For each step of the customer experience journey answer these questions:
> 
>   * What are the similarities?
> 
>   * What are the differences?
> 
>   * Are your priorities for excellent customer service the same as your customers’ priorities?
> 
>   * What priorities will you focus on?
> 
> 


By the time you’ve completed the comparison, you should have a clearer vision of what type of customer you intend to target, what needs to fulfill, and what your priorities for creating an excellent customer service strategy should be.
