## Step 4: Build Effective Systems to Ensure Consistency

You now have a clear picture of the customers you want to serve and what type of customer service experience you want to provide. Your feedback from internal customers in Step 2 gave you a clear idea of what you’re currently working with and where improvement is needed. The next step is to create a complete picture of the systems you need to build to bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be.

#### The Fable: Create Flexible Systems and Guidelines

In the fable, once the Area Manager collates his feedback and discusses possible improvements with his team, his Fairy Godmother introduces him to the owner of a successful full-service gasoline station. The owner explains that he is consistently able to offer an incredible service thanks to the **flexible systems and training procedures** he has in place—the systems set the guidelines but also allow his team members to understand how much flexibility they have to act autonomously and better serve his customers.

> **The Key to Giving Employees Autonomy**
> 
> The owner of the gas station has hit on one of the key features of companies that stand the test of time. According to the research of Jim Collins and Jerry I Porras, documented in _Built to Last_ , the most successful, long-lasting companies have systems to ensure that every employee understands the company’s core philosophy and can be trusted to work autonomously. The following example from the book shows how to implement the gas station owner’s customer service strategy:
> 
> Nordstrom’s employee handbook tells employees the core philosophy (“to provide outstanding customer service”) and gives them plenty of leeway to act as they see fit by giving only one rule: “Use your judgment in all situations.” They reward employees aligned with the core philosophy of outstanding customer service with big store discounts. Employees who are unpleasant towards customers get sent home for the day.

> **Create a Positive Work Environment**
> 
> The authors don’t offer any advice on how to judge and incorporate the feedback received from internal customers in Step 2. Further, the only advice they offer for getting your entire team on board with your customer service experience strategy is that all team members should know what the desired end results of the systems in place are, and that the system of rewards and promotions should be linked to how well they execute this strategy. Therefore, we’ll provide clarity on how to achieve a positive and cohesive workplace culture.
> 
> _Create Cohesion Within Your Workplace_
> 
> Your customer service experience vision determines how you assess the feedback you receive from your colleagues and prioritize necessary improvements. It simply won’t be possible to fix all of the flaws in one go. However, involving all of your team members in your vision will go a long way towards creating a positive work environment that’ll ultimately benefit both your team and your customers.
> 
> _Include Your Team_
> 
> Don’t restrict your vision by excluding your team—collaborate with colleagues across different departments and from different levels of your business to discuss viable possibilities. Inclusion in the process will encourage and motivate team members to work towards this vision.
> 
> _Clearly Define the Guiding Principles That Underpin This Vision_
> 
> Guiding principles serve as a reminder of your vision and can be easily communicated to remind your team what you’re all working towards. In essence, they are a set of operating principles that steer your team to make decisions that are in line with your vision. When creating your principles, consider if they:
> 
>   * Define your vision
> 
>   * Clarify how you intend to work together to meet your vision
> 
>   * Make decision making easier and encourage autonomy
> 
>   * Inspire your team to work towards this vision
> 
> 

> 
> _Communicate Your Vision_
> 
> Ensure that your entire company works together towards the same goal by regularly communicating your vision and guiding principles. Once your team members share your vision and see the improvements you all intend to work towards, you’ll see a shift in your work environment. This will inevitably have a positive impact on the customer service experience you provide.

### Consistent Delivery Creates Credibility

During this stage, Blanchard and Bowles insist that you focus solely on making changes and improvements that you can consistently meet. **Your customers don’t want false promises from you**. If you make promises that you fail to meet, they will judge you harshly for it. The only way to build customer trust is to **start small and focus on achieving consistent delivery of each new improvement** before introducing additional changes.

To achieve consistency, work with your team to define your goals and build systems that guarantee you deliver what you promise every single time. These systems also need to be adaptable so that they can evolve for continuous improvement (we’ll cover that in Step 5). The authors argue that systems and training procedures are at the core of every successful customer service experience strategy. **Your consistency will create credibility** , foster high expectations, and help to build your base of loyal customers.

> **Build Systems to Achieve Consistency**
> 
> While Blanchard and Bowles stress the importance of creating effective systems to achieve consistency, they don’t provide any practical advice on how to do it. Therefore, we’ve adapted an effective goal-setting process from _Measure What Matters_ to help your team work together to define goals and create the systems you need.
> 
>   * **Define your company’s overall objective:** this is your vision of excellent customer service. It needs to be clearly defined and action-orientated.
> 
>   * **Identify individual objectives:** every individual within your various departments and teams needs to identify their objectives. The objectives they define for themselves **must align with the company’s main objective**.
> 
>   * **Define your key results:** Your key results must be **measurable sub-goals** towards achieving your final vision. They need to include specific results and deadlines. To identify your key results, ask yourself, “What steps do I need to complete to reach my objective?”
> 
>   * **Regularly check progress**
> 
> 

> 
> Using this process to define both your long-term and short-term goals will ensure that all of your team members are:
> 
>   * Focused on one final objective
> 
>   * Aligned towards achieving this objective
> 
>   * Accountable for the progress they make towards achieving this objective
> 
> 


By the time you’ve completed this step, you’ll be working in alignment with your team towards achieving a clear objective: consistently delivering an excellent customer service experience to your customers.
