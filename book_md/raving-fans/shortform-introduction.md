## Shortform Introduction

In _Raving Fans_ , management experts Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles argue that successful organizations have one common central focus: **providing an excellent customer service experience**. And that any type of organization or business that serves people can benefit from these principles to create “Raving Fans.”

_Raving Fans_ is a fable in which a newly hired Area Manager’s plans to focus on quality are upended when told by the President of the company to instead prioritize customer service, which she stresses is the foundation of the business. The ill-equipped Area Manager worries that, like his three predecessors, he will quickly fail at implementing successful customer service strategies and lose his position.

Miraculously, his Fairy Godmother appears to offer guidance and lead him on a path of discovery. The Fairy Godmother introduces the Area Manager to successful business owners, all graduates of “The Raving Fans School,” who teach him the three simple but powerful secrets to deliver outstanding customer service:

  * Define Your Ideal Customer Service Experience
  * Discover Your Customers’ Ideal Service Experience
  * Exceed Customer Expectations



The Area Manager graduates from “The Raving Fans School,” successfully implements all of the advice he receives and proceeds to impress both his customers and the President of his company.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993

_Raving Fans_ was Blanchard’s 12th book and 1st of several with Bowles, including _High Five! The Magic of Working Together_ , and _Gung Ho! Turn On the People in Any Organization_.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

Since the 1960s, business fables like _Raving Fans_ , which combine storytelling with the wisdom and advice of management lessons,__ have become increasingly popular. The stories are designed to engage readers while also giving context to the principles contained within—the fictional context illustrates how to apply these concepts and makes them more memorable. As a result, many readers prefer the simplicity of business fables compared to the complexity of standard non-fiction business books. Successful books in this genre include:

_Who Moved My Cheese?_ , Spencer Johnson

_The Greatest Salesman in the World_ , Og Mandino

_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ , Patrick Lencioni

_The Go-Giver_ , Bob Burg and John David Mann

_The One Minute Manager_ , Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Prior to the publication of _Raving Fans_ in 1993, providing exceptional customer service was not a priority for most businesses. Consequently, consumers felt like they were being taken for granted and, with few alternatives available to them, they not only tolerated poor customer service, they expected it. But the early nineties brought a shift as businesses began to acknowledge the need to provide excellent customer service. As a result of this rising awareness, _Raving Fans_ originally received a warm welcome from innovative managers and leaders and has since sold over a million copies.

The book’s success is due in large part to how simply the authors express the concepts that underpin their view of excellent customer service. Their short story quickly puts the concepts into context and effectively demonstrates the different types of businesses that can benefit from this model. As a result, _Raving Fans_ is required reading in many customer-focused organizations.

However, this simplistic approach has also received criticism. This is mainly due to the unrealistic depictions of “Raving Fans Businesses” within the story. Further, the book doesn’t offer practical steps to apply the principles. As a result, some reviewers see the book as overly childish and impractical.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The fable offers a useful framing device to quickly deliver the three secrets to create “Raving Fans.” It offers an effective way to put the principles into context and attempts to engage the reader by foregoing the standard format of non-fiction writing.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Overall, _Raving Fans_ is well organized—the Fairy Godmother introduces the three secrets to the Area Manager in sequence, and each secret builds on the one before it. However, the story doesn’t include chapter breaks, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the three secrets. In addition, the third secret, “Deliver What They Want + 1%,” attempts to deliver a lot of information by referring to multiple concepts in a back and forth way. As a result, this non-linear approach creates confusion and makes the secret difficult to implement.

### Our Approach in This Guide

To make the ideas covered in _Raving Fans_ more relevant to today’s rapidly evolving business world, we look beyond the fable and focus on ways to make the principles more actionable—we’ve included a range of exercises to help you apply these principles in your work.

In addition, we’ve deconstructed the third secret, “Deliver What They Want +1%,” into three steps to make each easier to apply. Consequently, our guide lists five steps to create an excellent customer service experience:

  * Step 1: Define Your Ideal Customer Service Experience
  * Step 2: Discover Your Customers’ Ideal Service Experience
  * Step 3: Integrate Your Vision with Their Needs
  * Step 4: Build Effective Systems to Ensure Consistency
  * Step 5: Exceed Customer Expectations
