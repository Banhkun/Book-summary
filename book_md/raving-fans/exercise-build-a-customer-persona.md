## Exercise: Build a Customer Persona

Building detailed customer personas for each segment of your customer base helps you to define your customer service experience priorities. In addition, it reminds you to base your decisions on the wants and needs of real people, which enables you to connect to the real customers these personas represent.

* * *

Begin by imagining a customer you want to serve. Give them a name. Now, feel free to add as many details as you want: age, job title, location, hobbies, goals, and so on.

What do they want from your business? Whatâ€™s their goal? What problem are they trying to solve?

Why would they choose you over your competitors? What do they appreciate about the service you offer?

What one improvement to your customer service experience would immediately benefit this customer persona?
