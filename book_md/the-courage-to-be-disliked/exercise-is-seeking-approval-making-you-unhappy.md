## Exercise: Is Seeking Approval Making You Unhappy?

Kishimi and Koga assert that all negative emotions stem from the goal to avoid trying and failing to earn external approval. Investigate a persistent source of negative feelings in your life to see if they may be caused by this need for approval.

* * *

Describe a persistent negative emotion that you wish you didn’t have. What goal might these negative feelings be helping you achieve? (Recall our example from earlier: An actor too anxious to learn their lines may be trying to avoid the risk of embarrassment on stage.)

Could this goal be related to the broader goal of earning approval of others? If so, whose approval are you looking for? Why do you think you care so much about their approval? (For example, our actor may avoid embarrassment because they feel the need to appear “cool” in front of their friends. This may be because the actor values their friends highly and is afraid of losing them.)

Imagine what it would be like to completely disregard what this person (or people) thought of you. How does it feel? Frightening? Freeing? Why?

What is the smallest step you could take toward freeing yourself from their expectations? (For example, you may speak your mind around them in a situation where you would normally restrain yourself.)
