## Exercise: Practice Setting Boundaries

Kishimi and Koga argue that _all_ interpersonal relationship problems are the result of improper boundaries—either you’re taking responsibility for a problem that isn’t yours, or someone else is taking responsibility for one of your problems. Practice setting healthy boundaries by deconstructing one of your personal issues through this lens.

* * *

Describe an ongoing interpersonal conflict in your life: any frustrating or distressing disagreement between you and one other person. Identify the problem or problems keeping each person from what they want. (For example, imagine your significant other thinks you’re spending too much time out with friends and feels neglected. Your significant other’s problem is that they want to spend more time with you, while your problem is that you want to spend time with your friends, but you don’t want to upset your partner.)

Are you taking responsibility for a problem that isn’t yours, or is someone interfering in a problem that belongs to you? What is motivating you, or them, to do so? (Remember, to determine who a problem belongs to, ask: “Whose life will it affect?” In our example above, the conflict stems from the fact that you’re taking responsibility for your significant other’s feelings of neglect, which are their problem. Even if these improper boundaries are motivated by love and concern for your partner, they’re still harmful to the relationship.)

List the negative consequences caused by these unhealthy boundaries. (In our example, taking responsibility for your significant other’s perception that they’re being neglected may cause you to make sacrifices, like staying home every night, even though you don’t want to, fostering feelings of resentment and entitlement. Additionally, it will impede your significant other’s personal growth by removing the need for them to develop trust and emotional autonomy.)

What step could you take to disentangle your problems from those of the other person? (Remember, as a rule of thumb, you shouldn’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to do. In our example, you might continue to go out with your friends as much as you like and allow your partner to become more independent, find a compromise that makes you both happy, or even end the relationship.)
