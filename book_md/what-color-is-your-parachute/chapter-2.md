## Chapter 2: The Flower Exercise

Chapter 1 covered the current state of the job market and some methods for finding a job. Chapter 2 covers Method #3, the flower exercise, in more detail.

To start the flower exercise, draw a flower diagram modeled on the graphic in Chapter 1 or purchase the companion workbook to _What Color is Your Parachute?_ , which contains the flower diagram and all the worksheets involved in filling it out.

### Petal #1: Compatibility With People

**The goal of this petal is to figure out the kinds of people you like or don’t like working with, whether they’re people who work at your company or people you interact with as part of your job.** This is important because the people around you either give you energy or drain it.

The entries on this petal will be a Holland Code (more on Holland typologies in worksheet #1) and a list of adjectives and/or Myers-Briggs typologies that describe people. Be specific with your entries. An example petal might read: Holland Code—RIS, polite, elderly, Myers Briggs ISTJ, detail-oriented, team players.

There are two worksheets involved with filling out this petal:

#### Worksheet #1: What’s Your Holland Code?

Dr. Holland came up with the theory that every career attracts certain types of people, or a specific “people-environment.” Therefore, if you can figure out what kind of a people-environment you prefer, that knowledge can direct you towards a specific career.

There are six people-environments:

  * **R=Realistic.** These people like to do things that are ordered and explicit, such as working with nature, tools, machines, or sports.
  * **I=Investigative.** These people like to do things that use their brains, such as analyzing or investigating things, people, or information.
  * **A=Artistic.** These people like to do things that are creative and free, such as making art.
  * **S=Social.** These people like to do things that involve other people, such as teaching or serving.
  * **E=Enterprising.** These people like to do things that involve manipulating other people, such as sales, leadership, or starting projects.
  * **C=Conventional.** These people like to do things that are detailed and completable, such as administrative work.



The Holland theory says that **everyone would have the potential to excel at all six people-environments if our life spans were unlimited, but most of us tend to excel in only three,** based on how we grew up.

Your Holland Code is the three letters that represent your preferred environment. You can find your Holland Code in three ways:

  * Use the Self-Directed Search tool.
  * Use the O*NET Interest Profiler.
  * **Play the party game.** Imagine that you’re at a party and all the guests have arranged themselves into groups based on the six people-environments. Which group are you most inclined to go over to? (Don’t factor in shyness or your ability to join the conversation.) Then, imagine that the group you were talking to all leaves for another party without you. Which group do you approach next? Then, this second group leaves too. Which group are you next-most comfortable with? These three groups are your Holland Code.



Write your Holland Code on Petal #1.

#### Worksheet #2: Who Energizes or Drains You?

On a scrap piece of paper, create a chart with the following four columns:

Column A: Jobs you’ve had so far.  | Column B: The kind of people you worked with at those jobs that annoyed you.  | Column C: Top five worst types of people to work with.  | Column D: Top five best types of people to work with.   
---|---|---|---  
Here, write a list of all the jobs you’ve ever held.  | Here, write a list of ten types of people who annoyed you at previous jobs. List them in any order and don’t use names. For example, you might have been frustrated by coworkers who always came in late or were passive-aggressive.  | Here, write the top five kinds of people you don’t want to have to work with, in order of priority. Use the prioritizing grid.  | Here, write the opposite of the items in column C. You don’t have to write the exact opposite. For example, instead of writing “people who aren’t passive-aggressive,” you might write, “people who are straightforward.”   
  
Transfer the list in column 4 onto Petal #1.

### Petal #2: Workplace Conditions

The goal of this petal is to **figure out what kind of conditions and locations you most prefer working in.**

The entries on this petal will be a list of descriptions of your surroundings⁠—physical surroundings only because you’ve already covered people surroundings in the first petal. An example petal might read: somewhere with lots of natural light, flexible hours, standing desks, a short commute, air conditioning.

There is one worksheet involved with filling out this petal:

#### Worksheet #1: Ideal Environments

Like Petal #1’s worksheet, this worksheet will involve reflecting on what you don’t like and then considering the opposite.

On a scrap piece of paper, create a chart with the following four columns:

Column A: Jobs you’ve had so far.  | Column B: Working conditions you don’t like, in any order.  | Column C: Top five worst working conditions.  | Column D: Top five best working conditions.   
---|---|---|---  
Here, write a list of all the jobs you’ve ever held.  | Here, write a list of ten conditions that you didn’t like working in and/or that decreased your productivity. For example, perhaps you didn’t like working in an office that was near a door because every time it slammed loudly, it distracted you.  | Here, write the worst five items from column B in order of priority. Use the prioritizing grid.  | Here, write the opposite of the items in column C. Again, you don’t have to write the exact opposite. For example, you might write “quiet” instead of “not beside the door.”   
  
Transfer the list in column 4 onto Petal #2.

### Petal #3: Skills

**The goal of this petal is to figure out what your favorite skills are.** These skills should be transferable to any field and they’re probably related to your natural talents and abilities. However, while filling out this petal, it’s more important to list skills you love using than skills you’re good at.

The entries on this petal will be verbs or verbs accompanied by adverbs or objects. An example petal might read: write, mentor, accurately organize documents, teach children, speak, analyze, coach, edit, typeset, research.

#### What Is a Skill?

“Skill” is a commonly misdefined word, even among employers and HR departments. There are three kinds of skills, according to Sidney Fine:

  * **Functional.** These skills are things you can do and usually take the form of _verbs_ , for example, singing, teaching, and so on. They’re the basis of any job you take. There are three further categories of functional skills:
    * People skills. For example, mentoring and speaking are skills you apply to people. 
    * Information skills. For example, comparing and synthesizing are skills you apply to information.
    * Thing skills. For example, operating or setting up inanimate objects are skills you apply to things.
  * **Knowledge-based.** These skills are things you know about and usually take the form of _nouns_ , for example, computer programming, speaking Italian, and so on.
  * **Traits.** These skills are ways you act and usually take the form of _adverbs or adjectives_ , for example, punctual, passionately, and so on.



Petal #3 focuses on functional skills and traits. We’ll cover knowledge-based skills in Petal #5.

Each of the three types of functional skills contains a hierarchy. For example, mentoring is the highest form of people skills while helping is the lowest. Typically, if you have a higher skill, you also possess all the skills below it. For example, if you can mentor, you can also help people. It’s best to emphasize your highest skill in the hierarchy because exercising higher-level skills gives you more freedom (for example, you can choose your schedule as a mentor but not as a customer service rep). Additionally, fewer people have higher-level skills, so there will be less competition for jobs requiring those skills.

There is one worksheet involved with filling out this petal:

#### Worksheet #1: What Are Your Functional Skills?

Most people don’t know what their functional skills are. If you do know, write them directly on your flower diagram. If you don’t, do this exercise. Here are the steps:

**1\. Write seven stories about seven moments in your life.** Don’t choose something big like graduating from college; instead, choose a brief moment that you enjoyed. When choosing, consider, for example, stories that: aren’t work-related, demonstrate you acting differently than you normally would, or are difficult, exciting, unusual, or fun. If you really can’t think of anything, describe jobs or roles that you’ve enjoyed. Each story should have:

  * **A goal.**
    * For example, you adopted a puppy and wanted to train her as a therapy dog.
  * **An obstacle you had to overcome.**
    * The puppy was hard to train.
  * **The process you used to overcome the obstacle and achieve the goal.**
    * You researched dog training, signed yourself and the puppy up for a course, and signed up for the certification exam.
  * **The outcome.**
    * The puppy passed the exam and started working as a therapy dog at the children’s hospital.
  * **A statement about the outcome.**
    * You learned a lot about dog training and love that you did something to help sick children.



**2\. Carefully reread each story and figure out what _functional_ skills you used** in each to achieve your goals. For example, in the puppy story, you used some of the following skills: train, research, solve problems.

**3\. Look for a pattern of which functional skills keep recurring.** Assuming that you followed the guideline to write stories about truly enjoyable moments, these are your favorite skills because you keep using them.

  * For example, some people-related skills you might have employed are to: heal, instruct, counsel, communicate, or serve.
  * Some information-related skills you might have employed are to: imagine, analyze, research, problem-solve, or compare.
  * Some thing-related skills you might have employed are to: repair, drive, manufacture, restore, or carve.



**4\. Prioritize functional skills.** Narrow the list down to your ten favorite skills (the ones you like exercising, not the ones you think will be most useful). Then, use the prioritizing grid to put them in order of importance.

**5\. Qualify functional skills with traits and objects.** Create a list of your strongest traits. Remember that traits describe how you do things, for example, how you communicate. (To come up with the list, you can take a Myers-Briggs test, or take a Values-in-Action assessment.) Then, combine your traits and skills and add an object if necessary. For example, if the skill is “communicate,” you might specify that you can “communicate authoritatively with children.” These phrases will be your go-tos during job interviews.

  * Expressing your traits as adverbs (like “authoritatively”) makes it easier to combine your traits and skills into a single phrase (like “communicate authoritatively”). Some examples of traits in the form of adverbs are: energetically, tactfully, objectively, punctually, and versatilely.



Transfer your list of functional skills and accompanying traits or objects to Petal #3.

### Petal #4: Purpose

**The goal of this petal is to figure out the mission or purpose of your life.** You’ll consider your spiritual values and moral compass.

The entries on this petal will be a description of what facets of the world you want to improve and some details about those facets. Be specific. An example petal might read: improve the lives of children living in unsafe homes.

There are two worksheets involved with filling out this petal:

#### Worksheet #1: Nine Facets of Purpose

There are nine facets of human purpose. All of them are worthwhile and important, but you’ll likely be drawn to one in particular.

  1. **Beauty.** When you’re gone, do you want the world to be more beautiful than it was when you were born? Would you do this through music, flower arranging, or another art form?
  2. **Physical health.** Do you want to leave behind a legacy of feeding the hungry or contributing to the population’s fitness?
  3. **Resources.** Are you worried about the world’s consumerism and would prefer to see people being happy for what they have rather than always wanting more? How, specifically?
  4. **Morality.** Do you want the world to be more honest and fair than it is now? What areas of the world, or which populations, do you want to focus on? 
  5. **Love.** Do you want the world to be more compassionate? Towards who or what?
  6. **Entertainment.** Do you want to cheer people up and distract them from their problems? Do you want to make people laugh? What kind of entertainment are you specifically interested in?
  7. **Environment.** Do you want the earth to be in a better state when you leave than when you arrived? Which particular environmental movements speak to you?
  8. **Spirituality.** Do you want the world to have more faith and love in God? Which people, and what parts of life?
  9. **Knowledge.** Do you want the world to know more as a result of your time in it? In what subjects?



Choose the facet that speaks the most to you and write between a paragraph and a one-page essay about it. If you’re struggling with this exercise, move on to worksheet #2. If you know exactly what to write, transfer your essay, or a summary or your essay, to Petal #4.

#### Worksheet #2: Philosophy of Life

If you have trouble choosing a purpose, ruminate for a while. Eventually, an answer should come to you, even if it takes a year.

If you’re totally uninterested in choosing a purpose, then approach this petal differently. Write a “Philosophy of Life.” It should be no more than two pages and should address what you think about the meaning of life. Why do humans exist and why do you personally exist? Consider things such as beliefs, free will, happiness, stewardship, values, and so on.

Write a summary of your philosophy of life on Petal #4.

#### God and Your Mission

**Your beliefs contribute to who you are and what makes you unique, so it’s important to consider them as you self-assess.** The author believes that our purpose is inherently related to God⁠—a “mission” is something you feel called to do, and this call comes from God. If you’re not Christian, you can translate the following ideas into whatever’s meaningful for you.

The author has divided finding your mission into three stages:

**1\. Get to know God.** Everyone on the planet shares this mission, but the way in which you pursue it is unique to you. During this stage, keep in mind:

  * Your mission isn’t to do something, it’s to be the kind of person who reflects God’s image. 
  * We have a relationship with God whether we acknowledge it or not because we were created by and will return to him. When we’re born, we forget what came before⁠—you can think of being born into a physical body like getting amnesia and think of religion as remembering what you once knew.
  * Some part of ourselves will want to ignore God. This will be a barrier to achieving our mission.
  * We’re unique and special because God thinks so, not because there’s anything particular about our own being.
  * The physical aspects of our lives, such as interacting with nature, are important, but we also must consider spiritual aspects.



**2\. Improve the world.** Again, everyone on the planet shares this mission, but the way in which you pursue it is unique to you. During this stage, keep in mind:

  * Every time you have a choice, no matter how small, choose the option that improves the world. 
    * For example, if you’re driving in rush hour and someone signals to move into your lane, make space for them instead of cutting them off.
  * Every small decision is part of improving the world. If you only look for big-picture choices, you’ll miss opportunities.
  * Even if you don’t understand the big picture of the mission, follow God’s guidance.
  * God won’t give you any more information about the big picture until you’ve used all the information you already have.
  * The small things aren’t just practice⁠—they’re meaningful and they contribute to a larger mission.



**3\. Use your talents in a setting you enjoy in order to do things God needs done**. During this stage, keep in mind:

  * God gives us free will, so we can choose how to fulfill this stage of our mission.
  * Your achievements don’t have to be public or obvious. In some cases, even you yourself might not know what contributions you’ve made if they don’t take effect until after your death.
  * Whatever you achieve, you and God achieve together. You accomplish nothing alone.
  * Some of us look for specific, direct instructions during this stage of the mission. However, you already have all the information you need⁠—you know what you’re good at and you know what you like doing.
  * Career counseling is actually better at this part of the mission than religion. 
  * You might imagine that when God created your soul, you had a conversation about what your mission was and what talents you needed for it, and you’ve only forgotten because of earthly amnesia.
  * Your mission will probably have something to do with truth, beauty, service, or a combination of all three.
  * Now that you know you have a mission, you don’t need to worry about your lifespan. God will leave you on the earth until you complete your mission or a more important mission comes up elsewhere. Pay attention to your health and death, but don’t worry about either.



If you keep your mission in mind while job searching, **you’ll not only end up with a career you like, but you’ll also understand the point of your life.**

### Petal #5: Knowledges

**The goal of this petal is to figure out what knowledge you currently have that most excites you.** If you like, you can also include a list of what you’d like to know. This will help you figure out what fields or industries you might like to work in.

The entries on this petal will be nouns. An example petal might read: how to change a tire, Japanese language, gardening, psychology, beekeeping.

There are three worksheets involved with filling out this petal:

#### Worksheet #1: What Do You Enjoy?

On a scrap piece of a paper, answer the following questions:

  * What hobbies do you like to spend a lot of time doing?
  * What activities make you lose track of time?
  * What subjects do you like to talk about?
  * What websites or blogs do you find yourself on and what are they about?
  * What TV shows or podcasts do you like and what are they about?
  * What courses or classes (either in-person or online) would you be interested in taking?
  * What newspaper articles, magazines, and books do you like to read and what are they about?
  * What would you write a book about, if it wasn’t a biography?



#### Worksheet #2: What Do You Already Know?

On a scrap piece of paper, create a chart with the following four columns. Write down as much as you possibly can.

Column A: What you know from the jobs you’ve had so far.  | Column B: What you know from outside work.  | Column C: What fields, industries, or careers interest you.  | Column D: Other good ideas.   
---|---|---|---  
Here, write a list of things you’ve learned during your past work experience. Write down even things that seem simple or that you take for granted. For example, if you worked as a bookkeeper, still write down bookkeeping.  | Here, write things that you learned because you were interested in them and things you learned in school, at conferences/workshops, in online courses, or in the world. For example, you might have taken a course in comedy writing or organized your wedding.  | Here, write down which sectors interest you. There are six broad categories of work: agriculture, finance, information, manufacturing, services, and technology. Each of these categories breaks down further. If you need help brainstorming, look at the tools on O*NET OnLine. Write down a few options. Remember that no jobs or industries last forever so it’s always important to have a backup plan.  | Here, write down any miscellaneous knowledge you have that wasn’t covered in the other columns.   
  
#### Worksheet 3: Determining Your Favorites

On a scrap piece of paper, create the following chart. This chart is a prioritizing aid that will help you figure out your most important knowledges. You’re going to rank the knowledges you came up with in worksheets #1 and #2 by how much expertise and enthusiasm you have about them.

Box A: Here, write the topics that you _have expertise in but don’t have enthusiasm_ for.  | Box B: Here, write the topics that you have _both expertise and enthusiasm_ for.   
---|---  
Box C: This box is for subjects that you _neither have expertise nor enthusiasm_ for. This box is optional⁠—you won’t pursue any of the activities in this box, so if you fill it out, it’s just as a warning.  | Box D: Here, write the subjects that you have _enthusiasm but little expertise_ for.   
  
Once you’ve finished the box chart, take the top five knowledges from Box B (use the prioritizing grid if you need to) and transfer them to Petal #5.

### Petal #6: Money

**The goal of this petal is to determine how much money you need and/or want to earn from your job.**

The entries on this petal will be the level you want to work at, a salary range, and benefits. An example petal might read: manager level, $30-35/hour, improve the environment.

**Money and happiness are both important, and they’re related.** A 2010 study found that people who made less money were unhappier than those who made more. However, it also found that once people made over $75K/year, their satisfaction with life increased, but their happiness remained the same. Therefore, this petal is extra-related to all the other petals, especially to ones that have to do with your happiness.

There are three worksheets involved with filling out this petal:

#### Worksheet #1: What Level Do You Want to Work At?

Your job level is related to your salary⁠—the more responsibilities you have, the more you’re paid. Ask yourself how much responsibility do you want? Do you want to be the boss, a manager, a team member? Write down a two- or three-word description on Petal #5.

#### Worksheet #2: What Salary Range Do You Want?⁠—Use a Budget to Find Out

The minimum number in your salary range is what you’d need to survive. To find that out, **create a budget that states what you’re currently spending.** Figure out how much you spend in each of the following categories. Add any categories that you feel are missing:

  * Housing, including rent/mortgage, utilities, and so on
  * Food, including groceries, restaurants, and so on
  * Clothes, including buying clothes and laundry
  * Transportation, including car payments, gas, repairs, bus passes, parking, and so on
  * Insurance, including car, home, medical, life, and so on
  * Health, including appointments, gym memberships, prescriptions, and so on
  * Support, including daycare, home care for elderly relatives, pets, and so on
  * Donations
  * Education, including your own or your family’s
  * Bills, including credit cards
  * Taxes, including local, state, and federal, and tax services. Note that sometimes you can claim job-searching costs
  * Savings, including for retirement
  * Fun, including concert tickets, cable, and so on



Once you’ve come up with a monthly amount, multiply it by 12 to get the yearly amount and then divide it by 2,000 to find out how much you’d need to make per hour to support that budget.

The maximum number in your salary range should be the highest realistic salary a generous boss would give you. To find that out, redo your budget with the numbers you’d like to be spending in each of the categories.

Transfer the minimum and maximum numbers to Petal #6.

#### Worksheet #3: Factors Besides Money

This is an optional worksheet. Because money only buys happiness up to a point, you might want to consider what else you can get out of a job besides salary. Consider things such as respect, challenge, fame, or opportunities to do things such as be creative or help others.

Transfer your list to Petal #6.

### Petal #7: Location

**The goal of this petal is to figure out where in the world you’d most like to live if you had the choice and to resolve any potential conflicts with your partner about where she’d like to live.** It’s important to consider location early because if you get an unexpected opportunity, you want to be able to act on it right away.

The entries on this petal include five specific places to live and a list of five geographical factors. An example petal might read: Tokyo, Florence, Paris, Calgary, Buenos Aires, sunny, near mountains, good air quality, bilingual, friendly.

There is one worksheet involved with filling out this petal:

#### Worksheet #1: Determine Desirable Geographic Factors

On a scrap piece of paper, create a chart with the following four columns:

Column A: List the place you’ve lived.  | Column B: What did you dislike about the places you lived?  | Column C: What do you like in a location?  | Column D: What are your top ten factors?   
---|---|---|---  
Here, write the list.  | Here, write things that you didn’t enjoy. They don’t have to be written beside the name of the places, and if things come up multiple times, add a checkmark for each instance rather than repeating the factor.  | Here, list anything you liked about the places you’ve lived. Also list opposites, or near-opposites, of all the things in column B.  | Here, list the most important factors in a place to live. Use the prioritizing grid.   
  
**If you’re doing this worksheet with your partner, get them to fill out the chart too.** Then, together, make a list of your top twenty factors, alternating your and your partner’s factors in priority sequence. For example, your top factor is somewhere sunny and her top factor is somewhere French-speaking, write French-speaking, then sunny, then move on to both of your second-most-important factors. Stop after ten factors.

Now that you have either your own or a combined list of top factors, over the next ten days, ask everyone you meet if they know of anywhere in the world that has all, or at least most of the top, factors. You can also try the website Teleport to brainstorm, or if you really can’t decide or agree with your partner, throw darts at a map. Transfer the top five places and the top five factors to your petal diagram.

### An Expanded Flower: Rich Feller

Career professor Rich Feller put together his flower in 1982. He added four extra elements to his flower to make it more effective for himself⁠—he keeps a regularly updated list of ten things he wants to 1) give, 2) do, 3) learn, and 4) have.
