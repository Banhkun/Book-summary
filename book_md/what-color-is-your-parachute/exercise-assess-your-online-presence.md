## Exercise: Assess Your Online Presence

Many employers will factor what they learn about you online into their decision to interview or hire you.

* * *

Search your name. What comes up that you wouldnâ€™t want an employer to see? Why? How can you get this content down?

Consider your LinkedIn account. What information could you add to your profile to make it more complete? For example, you might be able to add details about your skills or hobbies.

How could you increase your general online presence? For example, you might start a blog or a video series. What kind of professional content or skills could you share? How would you create it?

What format do you think would work best for your resume: reverse chronological order, skill-focused, combo, or original? Why?
