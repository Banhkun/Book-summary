## Exercise: Find Bridge-People

A bridge-person is someone you know who also knows people or organizations you’re interested in.

* * *

Think of a job you might like to do. Who do you already know who might know someone else who’s doing the job, who works with a company who hires for the job, or who is an expert in the field?

What online groups and forums could you join to connect with bridge-people? Consider industry-specific groups, alumni groups, geographical groups, and so on.

Look through your connections and network on LinkedIn. Who could you approach about acting as a bridge-person?
