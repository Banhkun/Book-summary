## Chapter 1: The State of the Job Market in 2020

In _What Color is Your Parachute? 2020_ , career expert Richard Nelson Bolles (1927-2017) shares insights from over 40 years working in the career development field. The original edition was published in 1970 and has been updated every year since 1975.

Because job hunting, at its fundamentals, is about learning who you are and what to do with your life, **this book is valuable for people in all stages of life and career.**

### Shortform Note

_What Color is Your Parachute_ was written in 12 chapters and three appendices. We've reorganized the chapter order to be more coherent and logical. As a reference, here's a mapping of our chapter numbers to the original book:

  * Chapter 1: Job Market State→ Original Chapters 1-2
  * Chapter 2: What Do You Want to Do? → Original Chapters 4-6, Appendix A
  * Chapter 3: Two Approaches to Finding a Job → Original Chapter 3
  * Chapter 4: Resumes → Original Chapter 7
  * Chapter 5: Interviewing → Original Chapter 8
  * Chapter 6: Salary→ Original Chapter 9
  * Chapter 7: Starting a Business→ Original Chapter 12
  * Chapter 8: It’s Not Working → Original Chapter 10, Appendices B-C
  * (Chapter 11 is woven throughout the summary)



The book’s title was inspired by a joke. When the author was told in a meeting that some people in his organization were “bailing,” he wrote “what color is your parachute?” on a blackboard to remind himself to address the subject. Neither the parachute nor its color is a metaphor for the job-hunting process.

### What’s Changed in the Job Market Since 2008

Since the last major recession in 2008, the job-hunt has changed and the pre-recession job-hunting strategies many of us are familiar with are no longer effective. Here are some of the changes to the job market since 2008:

  * **Jobs take longer to find.** From 1994 to 2008, only 10% of job-hunters took more than a year to find work. Since 2008, 17-30% of job-hunters take more than a year.
  * **Jobs don’t last as long.** Since 2008, more jobs have been temporary, contract, or part-time. There are advantages to these types of jobs for employers⁠—employers only need to pay people for the exact amount of time that they’re needed, and they don’t have to pay benefits or vacation. 
  * **Job-hunting is a constant.** Since jobs don’t last as long, we have to hunt for new ones more frequently.
  * **Jobs increasingly involve new technology.** Technology advances every day, and while it’s not going to replace everyone, everyone’s going to have to learn to work with machines. While technology could reduce 5-19% of current jobs, technology will also create new jobs.
  * **Job postings are increasingly digital.** These days, there are several online types of job boards, including generalized ones that post jobs in any industry, to age-, industry-, or company-specific boards. Jobs are also posted on social media.
  * **Job-hunters must now cater to employers’ preferred hiring processes.** When times are good, as they were before 2008, employees are in demand. As a result, employers cater to job-hunters’ preferences⁠—for example, they post jobs widely and publicly and read resumes closely. When times are bad, however, employers don’t have to put in the same amount of effort to find workers⁠—there are more people than jobs. As a result, employers fill positions using their preferred methods, such as hiring from within the company or hiring friends of their existing employees. **Employers and job-hunters approach an open position in almost exactly opposite ways** , so if times are bad and you’re not prioritizing employers’ preferences, you’re unlikely to find a job. Here are some specifics on the differences between how employers and job-hunters approach an open position:
    * Employers approach hiring as an elimination game⁠—they winnow down the applicants first and then select someone from a group of finalists. Job-hunters would prefer a non-elimination-style process.
    * Employers want job-hunters to find them. Job-hunters want to _be_ found by employers.
    * Employers want to know everything about a job-hunter, while a job-hunter would prefer to share only what's on her resume.
    * Employers don’t want to confirm receipt of applications because they’re busy, while job-hunters wish they would.
    * Employers don’t want to increase hiring until they need people. (And employers aren’t necessarily motivated by government hiring incentives because these incentives have a time limit.) Job-hunters would prefer employers to always increase hiring.



### What Hasn’t Changed in the Job Market Since 2008

After reading the above, you might be thinking that things aren’t looking good. However, there are two elements of the job market that haven’t changed and will probably never change:

**1\. There are still plenty of jobs available.** You might feel like few jobs exist because of what you hear in the media or because you haven’t been able to get hired. However, the media tends to exaggerate the negatives, and the fact that you haven’t got a job probably has more to do with your approach (which you can change) than any universal job shortage.

  * For example, consider the two reports the US Bureau of Labor Statistics puts out every month. One of the reports gives the number of new jobs created, and the other gives the number of existing jobs that are unfilled. While the media will focus on the number of new jobs created, which is always less than the number of people who want jobs, new jobs don’t represent overall availability. When you look at both numbers together, you’ll see that there are plenty of jobs out there.



**2\. The fundamental goal of the job hunt is to figure out if the job-hunter and employer are compatible.** Think of a job hunt like dating instead of marketing. As job-hunters, we tend to be overly concerned about whether an employee likes us, but it’s just as important that we consider if we like them. If we don’t, and we take a job with them anyway, we’re eventually going to “lose” the job by quitting later because we’re unhappy.

### How to Find A Job

**The first step in finding a job is to figure out what you want to do.** This applies regardless of whether you’re a high school graduate trying to decide what to study in college or someone who’s been working in the same field for years.

**When you’re upheaving your career, try to keep other things in your life, such as your faith, values, or character, constant.** Changing everything all at once is hard.

There are a few methods for researching new career directions. Method #3 is most important, but you can use all of them if you’d like:

#### Method #1: Online

To learn more about what jobs and occupations exist, look at online job information sites such as O*Net OnLine. These sites group careers or jobs by categories, and once you’ve found a category you’re interested in, you can delve deeper. Keep in mind that O*Net only covers about 900 job titles, but far more exist.

#### Method #2: Assessments and Tests

Career assessments can give you some information about what you might be interested in. In some cases, they may even point you towards an exact career. It’s important to keep in mind the following though:

  * Tests can categorize you into a group but can’t fully represent your individuality.
    * For example, you might get the “scientist” result on the Myers-Briggs test, but that only means that you and everyone else in the scientist group answered the questions the same way. It doesn’t mean that everyone in the group is exactly the same.
  * Tests give you ideas rather than concrete suggestions. Keep in mind that test results require interpretation, ideally by a career counselor or psychologist.
  * Tests work for some people and not others.
  * Tests won’t be effective if you game the system. The point of a test is to give you new ideas, so don’t give inaccurate answers that you hope will lead to a specific result.
  * Tests can only represent a particular moment in time. Tests don’t take into account what you want to learn or how you could transfer skills you already have into new fields.
  * You can find many different tests online, but some particular ones to consider are the University of Missouri’s Career Interests Game, the Myers-Briggs test, or the Values-in-Action assessment.
  * Some tests are inaccurate, so take more than one.
  * Tests narrow down options, but at this stage, what you actually want is to broaden your knowledge base. When you’re looking to change careers, you first want to know everything that’s available before narrowing the options down to something you’d like.



#### Method #3: The Flower Exercise

**The flower exercise involves looking at yourself from seven different angles: compatibility with people, workplace conditions, skills, purpose, knowledges, money, and location.** In the exercise, each angle will be visually represented by a flower petal. When you’ve finished the exercise, you’ll end up with a one-page diagram of your flower that contains a visual summary of your personality as it relates to your career:

![what-color-is-your-parachute-petals.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/what-color-is-your-parachute-petals.png)

(Brain researchers have discovered that when you’re trying to make life decisions, it’s effective to write down what you know about yourself on a single piece of paper.)

As you work through the flower exercise,**separate your identity from your job title.** Don’t think of yourself as a mechanic or a writer, think of yourself as a unique person who has skills, experience, and knowledges.

Chapter 2 will cover the detailed steps to filling out the flower diagram, and in subsequent chapters, you’ll use the information in the flower diagram for your job search.

##### Prioritizing

Throughout the flower exercise, you’ll be making notes on scrap paper that will allow you to fill in each petal on your final flower diagram. Many of the exercises involve making lists of items that you’ll need to prioritize. **Prioritizing is important because when you’re looking for a job, you probably won’t find a position that encompasses every single thing you want.** Since you can’t have everything you want, it’s important to know what you value most and least.

**The best way to prioritize is to compare the options two at a time,** as if they were teams in a round-robin tournament. When only considering two choices, which one do you like better? Then, rank the options based on how many times they won out over another option. If you have a tie, compare the match between the two tying options and give the winner an extra point. (For example, if item #2 and item #5 both won four times, return to your list and find where you compared #2 and #5. Give the winner an extra point.) You can access an electronic “prioritizing grid” here.
