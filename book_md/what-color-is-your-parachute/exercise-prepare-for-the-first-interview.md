## Exercise: Prepare for the First Interview

It’s important to prepare for an interview in order to make the best first impression.

* * *

Think of an organization you’d like to work for. How would you find out more about them? Consider what parts of their website you should read, who you might conduct an informational interview with, and so on.

It’s helpful to bring samples of relevant work to an interview. What kind of samples could you bring? Consider documents you’ve written, photos of products you’ve made, testimonials, and so on.

All jobs require some general skills such as punctuality or commitment. Make a list of general skills that you could discuss in an interview. Then, write an example of an experience that shows you possess this skill.
