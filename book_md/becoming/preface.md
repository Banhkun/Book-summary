## Preface: Michelle Decides to Tell Her Story (2017)

From the time she was a small child, Michelle Obama's parents taught her the importance of speaking up and telling her own story in her authentic voice—**reconciling her past, present, and future and feeling proud of it all.** As first lady of the United States, Michelle passed on this advice to thousands of young people, and she hopes that by sharing her own life’s narrative, she can inspire others.

As her memoir begins, Michelle has recently left the White House after eight years as first lady from January 2009 to January 2017. Along with her husband, former President Barack Obama, and their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, she has moved into a suburban home not far from the White House. **For the first time in many years, Michelle finds herself alone with her thoughts in a quiet house.**

Each member of the Obama family is transitioning into a new stage of their lives. Barack is exploring career opportunities for his post-Presidential years. The Obama children are entering adulthood—Malia, the older daughter, is taking a gap year before starting college at Harvard University, and Sasha will finish high school in another two years. **Michelle is free from the constraints of her highly public life as first lady. Simultaneously, her duties and responsibilities as a mother have diminished.**

Michelle describes the simple pleasures she can now enjoy, which she didn't have while living in the White House: She can go outside and play in the yard with her dogs without the Secret Service asking where she is going. She can open her bedroom windows and let in fresh air whenever she pleases. She can make her own cheese toast without the kitchen staff rushing in to help.

Even though a cadre of Secret Service agents is holed up in the Obamas' garage command post—and agents will accompany the family for the rest of their lives—Michelle cherishes her newfound freedom and quiet time. This is her opportunity to reflect and write her life story.****

**Eight themes weave through Michelle’s memoir:**

### 1\. Becoming Her Authentic Self

Michelle is a woman who is perpetually striving to become a truer version of herself. Throughout adulthood, she learns to not get stuck holding on to the same identity or set of beliefs. She learns that personal growth has no finish line; there’s no moment in time when she’s done evolving. “Becoming” requires understanding there is always more work to be done. **It’s an ongoing process of self-creation. It means being willing to change and adapt to evolving circumstances and always striving to be true to yourself.**

As a child, she focused on doing the “right” thing to please her teachers and family. She wanted only to make a good impression and earn others’ praise and admiration: She strived for straight A’s and perfect attendance in school. She told adults she wanted to be a pediatrician when she grew up because they seemed pleased by that answer. She didn’t think about what her passions were or what she wanted from her life.

But after following a predetermined path of **“checking off the boxes”** —earning top honors in elementary and high school, getting admitted to top-notch universities, climbing the corporate ladder at a high-profile law firm—she finally stopped to consider whether any of it made her happy. When her free-spirited college friend died from cancer at age 26, she realized she needed to change her vision for the future. **She had to muster the courage to swerve off the path she'd followed for years and find a career that held more meaning.**

Despite her mother’s objections, Michelle quit her job and took a much lower paying position in the Chicago mayor’s office. She calls this **“finding the courage to swerve.”** She was moving closer to living her own true story—not simply living up to others’ expectations.

Michelle learned to swerve again after Barack became an important figure in her life. His passion for politics and helping to build a better world encouraged her to seek out more fulfilling work in the nonprofit sector.**** She wound up in a series of civic-minded positions that she found enriching.

But what she loved most about Barack—his idealism and desire to help people and change the world—also deeply challenged her vision of how her life should be. Michelle**** wanted a private family life like the one she grew up in—days filled with simple routines and the whole family sitting down to the dinner table every night. She knew that **life with Barack meant a life in the political arena, which meant chaotic schedules, the glare of the media spotlight, and never-ending public scrutiny.**

But despite Michelle’s misgivings about political life, she loved Barack, so she gave up her predetermined ideas about how her life should go and decided to grow and evolve. Ultimately, she campaigned for Barack when he ran for Senate and also for two terms as President, and she became one of the most popular first ladies in American history.

### 2\. Striving, Hard Work, and Self-Determination

**Through her parents' encouragement and her own hard work, Michelle rose above her circumstances**. She grew up in South Shore, a working-class Chicago neighborhood. She, her brother, and parents shared a one-bedroom apartment that the family rented from her mother’s aunt. Her father worked for the city water department and suffered from multiple sclerosis.

Michelle studied diligently in public school and later graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. She held high-powered jobs as a corporate lawyer, city manager, nonprofit director, and hospital vice president. While striving to give her best effort to each position, she helped her husband Barack campaign to become a U.S. Senator and later, U.S. President, and she raised two young daughters.

**As first lady, Michelle lived a life of opulence beyond her wildest childhood dreams.** She and her family lived in the 132-room White House with world-class chefs cooking their meals and staff members attending to their every need, including an in-house florist who noted what flowers they liked or didn’t like.

But Michelle never forgot her humble beginnings. She did not permit herself or her daughters to be spoiled by their privilege. **She demanded even more of herself as first lady, pushing through four major initiatives during her time in the White House.**

### 3\. Living With Racial Discrimination

**Michelle began learning about racial discrimination early in life.** She grew up in a racially mixed neighborhood where children played together regardless of skin color. But she soon encountered racial discrimination when a police officer stopped her brother Craig while he was out riding his new bike. The officer assumed that since this young Black boy’s bike was shiny and new, he must have stolen it.

Michelle also learned about racial discrimination from the elders in her family. Her grandfather, like many of the men of his generation, couldn't get a union card because he was Black, so he had to take a non-union job as a postal worker. He felt bitter about never having the career opportunities he hoped he would have.

**At 10 years old, Michelle learned that discrimination can be a two-sided coin.** Michelle's parents had always insisted that she and her brother speak formal English without any slang words. One day, one of her cousins asked her why she talked “like a white girl." The cousin believed that Michelle was denying her Black culture by speaking with proper diction.

A few years later, her family visited some Black friends who had moved to a white community in the suburbs. While they were there, someone vandalized Michelle’s father's treasured Buick Electra, which was parked on the street. Her family never knew who did it, but her mother assumed the neighbors wanted to discourage more Black people from moving in.

**When Michelle turned 17 and headed off to Princeton, for the first time in her life she found herself to be the only black woman in the classroom.** She had to muster the courage to speak up in class despite the difference in her skin color and gender.

### 4\. Persisting in the Face of Adversity

**Michelle's experiences taught her to remain optimistic and not let setbacks steer her off course.** Her father served as a role model, never complaining about his disability caused by multiple sclerosis. He simply accepted his condition and did his best to ignore it.

Her parents modeled optimism in the way they believed education could bring their children a better life. And when Michelle's high school guidance counselor told her that she wasn’t "Princeton material," Michelle ignored her, applied to the college, and got accepted.

In her eight years as first lady, Michelle met hundreds of highly accomplished people, many of whom told a story similar to hers: Someone in their young years doubted their ability to succeed at their goals. **The naysayers, critics, and doubters are always standing at the door, but the most successful people learn to push right past them.**

The people whom Michelle admires most remain optimistic in the face of great struggles. First, there’s Barack, who firmly believes that **people can work toward creating a better society.** But she names many other models of hope and inspiration, including Nelson Mandela, whom she met on a trip to South Africa, and the wounded warriors at Walter Reed Hospital, who inspired her with their resiliency.

Michelle notes that even her own story can be told in both pessimistic and optimistic ways: In one story, she grew up in a too-small house with not much money in a neighborhood that was starting to decay. In another version, she grew up in a music-filled house with a close-knit, loving family who believed in the importance of higher education.**In the former story, she is disadvantaged. In the latter, she has every chance at success.**

### 5\. Learning to Believe in Yourself

Michelle’s major concerns during the first 50 years or her life could be filed under one overarching question: **Am I good enough?** The questions and doubts began after middle school, when she got accepted to a high-achieving high school. She felt insecure about her intelligence—would she be able to measure up against the other students, many of whom come from privileged backgrounds? She soon learned that if she studied hard enough, she could easily keep up with them.

Later, in her first year at Princeton, she again felt insecure about her background, her education, and her abilities. Would she be able to make her mark in classrooms full of white men? **She quickly learned they weren’t smarter than she was; they were just more self-confident.**

Many years later, when she campaigned for Barack, the media vilified her. She questioned whether she was helping or hurting her husband's career. But she worked hard at improving her public speaking skills and her media persona, and she played a major role in getting Barack elected.

When she became first lady, she knew that the world was scrutinizing her because she was the first Black woman to hold this position. **The question "am I good enough?" continued to haunt her.** But as she made major strides in advancing her political initiatives, she realized that the answer was a resounding “yes.”

### 6\. Being Proud of Your Unique Story

During the campaign for Presidency, Michelle struggled to find the right words to frame the many twists, turns, and contradictions of her life story. Ultimately, she followed her mother's advice—**to tell her story truthfully and authentically.**

Michelle believes that too many people, especially women and minorities, go through their lives feeling ashamed of where they've come from or what their backgrounds are. They think that their truth doesn't live up to the established ideal, so they keep it hidden. But finding your own voice and telling your own truth is critical to the process of self-creation. **You can’t be fully yourself until you embrace every part of your story—past, present, and future.**

### 7\. Living Under the Weight of Privilege

Even before becoming first lady, Michelle was acutely aware of her privilege, which could take a variety of forms. She understood there’s inherent privilege in what class or race you're born into, but there's also privilege in being a mother who can choose how much to work—full- or part-time—or whether to work at all. There's even privilege in being able to have children, whether through in vitro fertilization or otherwise. **Sometimes privilege is based on the sheer luck of evading life's catastrophes: layoffs, mass shootings, domestic violence, lack of health care, poverty, prison, and so on.**

As Michelle’s daughters grew up in the White House, Michelle saw how many advantages they enjoyed compared to millions of girls all over the world who didn’t even have access to education. **Michelle believes the only answer to living under the weight of privilege is to find a way to serve others—to do what you can to create more advantages for everyone.**

### 8\. Living Under the Spotlight’s Glare

While the role of first lady was an extremely high privilege, it came with a difficult downside: **The media and public officials constantly scrutinized and criticized Michelle**(one U.S. Congressman even made jokes about her hips).

Michelle yearned for privacy for herself and her children. She craved simple, private-citizen freedoms, like going shopping by herself or taking her kids on field trips without causing a scene everywhere she went. She wanted to be free of the constant presence of cameras and cell phones, to not always be concerned about what clothes she wore or how her hair looked. Most important, she wanted the media and the public to leave her daughters alone so they could live their childhood and teenage years as normally as possible.

But this, she knew, was impossible. Presidential life did not afford the luxury of privacy, and **each member of the Obama family would need to find ways to live with that.**
