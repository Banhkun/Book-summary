## Chapters 21-22: Balancing Public and Private Life (2009-2013)

These chapters focus on how the Obamas learn to navigate their public and private lives, Michelle's fears about her family's safety, and her successful initiatives for children's health and military families. Michelle is now firmly entrenched in her role as first lady—and every day makes her more fully aware of the advantages and disadvantages of that role.

Barack had been in office for four months when Malia and Sasha received the present they'd been promised throughout his campaign. Senator Ted Kennedy gave them Bo, a seven-month-old Portuguese water dog. The entire family loved Bo, and he was permitted to wander through most of the White House rooms.

### Date Night for the Obamas

About the same time as the puppy joined the family, **Barack and Michelle went on a date in New York City to have dinner and see a Broadway show.** They had given up the customary date night they used to enjoy in Chicago, and the pair wanted to have an evening alone. Of course, the Secret Service had to plan every move, block off streets, and thoroughly check out every patron who entered the restaurant. Since the couple had to travel in the presidential motorcade, streets were blocked off and traffic was halted.

When they stood up to leave the restaurant, the other diners applauded them. Michelle felt flattered but uncomfortable, and she wondered whether some of the diners were happy they were leaving. At the theater, the Obamas' arrival held up the start of the performance because of the necessary security checks. Even though Michelle enjoyed the show, she realized that she and Barack were a nuisance. **The presidential couple could not go on a date outside of the White House without causing disruption.**

Michelle felt guilty for having wanted time alone with her husband, and wondered how previous presidential couples had dealt with life in the public eye. **Now that she was first lady, it seemed like the press, the Republican Party, and an array of other detractors were judging every move she made.**

### Michelle as Fashion Icon

At some point during Barack's campaign for President, the media started to pay attention to Michelle's clothes. While Barack could show up every day wearing the same dark suit and no one would ever notice, **journalists commented nonstop on whether Michelle was wearing short sleeves or long sleeves, high heels or flats.** At public appearances and press conferences, she was often asked, "Who made that dress?"

As first lady, Michelle's appearance was scrutinized even more. Fortunately, she loved fashion and loved dressing up. She became famous for mixing and matching designer couture with clothing she bought from J.Crew or Target.

Michelle had to pay for all her own clothes, except for couture gowns that designers loaned her for formal events, and that were later donated to the National Archives. (Shortform note: The Smithsonian Museum's First Ladies exhibit includes dresses worn by Frances Cleveland, Lou Hoover, Jacqueline Kennedy, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama. It also displays the China patterns they chose for White House dinners.)

**Most of the time, the press praised Michelle for her bold style, but there was criticism, too:** On a family trip to the Grand Canyon in Barack's first year as President, the media attacked Michelle for wearing shorts when she disembarked from Air Force One. Even though it was 106 degrees outside, they proclaimed it undignified for the first lady to wear such casual clothes.

Michelle’s wardrobe stylist and personal aide helped her to choose outfits that met the all-important "optics" standard. **"Optics" was jargon for public perception—how something looked to the media and American public.** Optics mattered so deeply to Barack's and Michelle's staff that when Michelle decided that she wanted to get her hair cut in bangs, her staff suggested they float the idea by Barack's staff first.

Even though Michelle had been educated at Princeton and Harvard, the optics question the staff needed to address was, "What does Michelle's haircut say about her?" In the end, she got the bangs.

#### Reflection

Michelle began to think that her clothes mattered more to the media than anything she said or did. But she decided that instead of griping about it, she would use it to her advantage. If the American public wanted to look at her outfits in photographs, maybe they'd also read about what she was doing while she wore those clothes.

**Michelle strategized ways to use the media's fashion obsession as a way to garner attention for issues and causes she cared about,** like children's nutrition. When _Vogue_ magazine asked her to be photographed for a cover story, she at first thought it was frivolous and indulgent, but then decided that **it was important to have a woman of color on a major magazine cover.** She went ahead with the magazine shoot.

### Challenges

#### Fears About Her Family's Safety

Chapter 22 opens with Michelle describing a nightmare in which her daughter is attacked by a cheetah that is brought to the White House—along with a lion, a tiger, and a panther—for the Obama family to pet and admire.

It was one of many nightmares Michelle had about her family's safety. She felt uneasy that other people were in control of so many aspects of their lives. Secret Service agents would tell them when it was okay to cross the street; staffers would schedule bathroom breaks for their long drives. Michelle never had to worry about carrying car keys or cash. **She found it nerve-wracking and uncomfortable to not be in control, especially since she had been taught self-reliance and self-sufficiency at an earlier age.**

#### Responding to Worldwide Problems

As President, Barack was constantly handling whatever the world's latest disaster was: a revolution in Egypt, an earthquake in Haiti, a BP oil rig off the coast of Louisiana leaking crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Whether the problem happened in America or not, the American President had to respond in some way.

**Michelle understood that as President and first lady, part of their role on the world stage was to model compassion.** If Barack wasn't able to travel to comfort the victims of tragedies, Michelle sometimes went. She and Jill Biden traveled to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake in which tens of thousands of people had been buried alive.

#### The "Birther" Conspiracy

**Barack won approval of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which increased Americans' access to health insurance.** The new law was both loved and hated. Like most presidents, Barack had fans, but he also had enemies, and some of them were quite vocal. The real estate developer and TV personality Donald Trump had begun considering a presidential run in 2012, and he started circulating rumors about Barack—specifically, **he questioned whether Barack was actually born in Hawaii and was an American citizen.**

Trump revived an argument that conspiracy theorists had invented during Barack's campaign for President, saying that **Barack was born in Kenya and his Hawaii birth certificate was a fake.** Trump now claimed that none of Barack's kindergarten classmates remembered him and that his birth announcements in the Honolulu newspaper were a hoax. Conservative news outlets threw more gasoline on the "birther" rumors by repeating Trump's claims.

#### Bullets Hit the White House

In November 2011, a 21-year-old man named Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez parked his car on Constitution Avenue, aimed an assault rifle at the top floors of the White House—the First Family's living quarters—and started firing. The bullets hit the building and cracked the protective ballistic glass in a window, but no one was hurt. Michelle and Barack were out of town at the time. **Still, it was a reminder to Michelle of how vulnerable her family was and that there were people out there who wanted to hurt them.**

### First Lady Michelle's Successes

Throughout Barack's first term, Michelle found ways to make a difference for Americans, but she first had to learn how to strategically use her position as first lady. **Michelle knew she couldn’t meddle publicly in West Wing matters. Voters elected her husband, not her.**

She took a cue from Hillary Clinton, who was now Barack's Secretary of State but was first lady from 1993 to 2001. Hillary was crucified by the press for taking too strong a role in her husband's administration, particularly regarding health care reform. **Michelle knew she had to employ more subtle tactics to accomplish her goals.**

She started a leadership and mentoring program for high school girls. Each teenager was nominated by her school principal or guidance counselor, then paired with a female mentor, many of whom held jobs in the White House. The girls went on field trips, attended career coaching sessions, and got together once a month with Michelle to talk about anything they wanted to talk about. **Michelle wanted the girls to feel comfortable coming to the White House, so they would grow up to feel comfortable in any room anywhere in the world.**

#### Reflection

Michelle felt like she owed a lot to young girls all over the world. **She believed she owed her own success—her leap from urban Black girl to Princeton, Harvard, and finally the White House—to the many people who helped her along the way.** There was Aunt Robbie, the piano teacher who held Michelle to strict standards. Her mother, who advocated for her throughout her school years. Her father, who taught her how to box and throw a football just like he taught her older brother Craig. Her teachers in high school. Her mentors at Chicago City Hall who modeled how to be a successful working mother.

Michelle knew from personal experience that it matters when someone shows a genuine interest in helping you find your way. And **it matters especially for minorities and women since these groups are more likely to doubt themselves—because society has doubted them.**

### Joining Forces: Michelle's Initiative for Military Families

Michelle, often accompanied by Jill Biden, visited military hospitals and was moved by how the injured soldiers and their families retained their optimism and pride despite terrible setbacks. In private conversations with Michelle, **soldiers would often tell her that the last thing they wanted was pity.**

She felt so inspired by the soldiers’ resilience—and that of their spouses and children—that she started a new initiative called **Joining Forces.** The concept was to establish concrete ways for Americans to rally around military service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment.

Joining Forces worked in tandem with the public and private sectors to find jobs for veterans and help them get access to higher education. It also created media campaigns to fight the stigma behind PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder.

### Let's Move: Michelle's Initiative for Children's Health

**Michelle's biggest and most visible success came from the seeds planted in her South Lawn garden.** Using the garden as a springboard, Michelle was able to establish a larger initiative for children's health with the goal of ending the child obesity epidemic.

Despite driving rainstorms and marauding birds and beetles, the garden produced more than 90 pounds of produce in only 10 weeks. The elementary school kids who helped her plant the garden returned to pick and eat the fruits of their labor. Some of the vegetables were served at the Obamas' dinner table; the rest were donated to a local nonprofit serving the homeless.

The garden created a lot of positive publicity that Michelle capitalized on to deliver these messages:

  * Families needed to learn how to feed their children healthier foods. 
  * Grocery stores needed greater access to fresh produce, and it had to be priced so that poor families could afford it. 
  * The food and beverage industry had to stop "supersizing" everything. 
  * Ad agencies had to stop targeting children with commercials for sugary cereals and processed foods. 



**As part of the initiative, Michelle and her staff developed the Let’s Move! campaign to get kids exercising.** Michelle hula-hooped on the South Lawn and guest-starred on “Sesame Street” to discuss vegetables with Big Bird. When reporters from health magazines interviewed her, she pointed out that**rising obesity levels meant rising health care costs, and many poor Americans didn't have access to fresh, affordable produce.**

Michelle's campaign for family health resulted in several victories, including **better labeling for sodas and other beverages, a commitment by the suppliers of school lunches to cut fat, sugar, and salt in their meals, and the establishment of a federal task force on childhood obesity.** Leaders from professional sports leagues agreed to help promote the "60 Minutes of Play a Day" campaign to get kids exercising more. Disney and Warner Bros. agreed to air special programming aimed at getting kids to live healthier lives.

#### Reflection

Michelle believes she hit her stride with her Let's Move! campaign. She was able to marshal her leadership and organizational skills to do something that mattered. She now understood the power of being first lady: The role offered her a huge media platform. **She could use what she saw as the job's biggest negative—constant media scrutiny—to achieve meaningful goals that would help Americans.**

### The Halloween Party

One of Michelle's smaller but most enjoyable victories was convincing the President's senior advisors to let her throw a big Halloween party for kids at the White House. At first, the advisors insisted it would be too frivolous and costly during America's tough economic times. ("The optics are just bad," they said). **But Michelle argued that during tough times, it was important to make sure kids still had fun.** On Halloween night in 2009, about 2,000 tiny pirates, princesses, and superheroes—the children of military families and White House staff—walked up the White House lawn to trick-or-treat with the President and first lady.

### Making Time for Girlfriends

Starting in 2011, Michelle made a concerted effort to start spending more time with her girlfriends, especially her old friends from Chicago. **She recognized how much they supported her when she was a new mother, when she was on the campaign trail with Barack, and during other tough periods in her life.**

Every few months, she'd invite a dozen friends to join her at Camp David, the woodsy presidential retreat in Maryland. Michelle encouraged her old friends to leave their families, careers, and responsibilities behind for a few days and just enjoy themselves. The women would exercise together, drive around in golf carts, and ride bikes.

### Osama bin Laden Is Killed

**One of Barack's goals as President was to find Osama bin Laden,** the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks on America in 2001. He had been in hiding for years and was considered the world's most wanted man.

In early 2011, Barack told Michelle that the military had located bin Laden, but he said that nothing would happen quickly because much planning was needed. On a Sunday in May, a group of U.S. Navy SEALs followed Barack's command and stormed a compound in Pakistan, where they killed bin Laden. **No American lives were lost in the ambush, which was a huge victory for Barack and the United States.** After Barack addressed the nation to relay the news, people around the world celebrated.
