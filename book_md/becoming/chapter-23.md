## Chapter 23: Second Term in the White House (2011-2016)

These chapters focus on Barack's second term in the White House, Michelle's higher education and girls' schooling initiatives, and the Obamas' campaign against gun violence. Now that Michelle has had four years of experience as first lady, she’s able to settle into her role and achieve more of the public-service goals that matter to her.

Barack's popularity soared briefly after bin Laden was killed, but by late summer 2011, Barack was taking a beating by a group of Republican senators who voted down almost all of his bills. The county was still in a dismal economic state from the 2008 financial meltdown. Americans were worried about a possible recession. Many politicians and voters blamed Barack for the mess. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the Republican Party’s most important task was to make sure Barack was “a one-term president.” **It seemed that despite the state of the country, the Republicans had only one goal, and that was to see Barack fail.**

### Meeting Nelson Mandela in South Africa

That same summer, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha were scheduled to travel to South Africa for a goodwill visit. Michelle had speeches to make and meetings to attend. She planned to hold several community events where she could talk about health and wellness.

During their trip, **Nelson Mandela invited them to his home.** Mandela was 92 years old at the time, and even Malia and Sasha were awed by the chance to meet the great man who had made such a profound impact on South Africa and the world. He challenged his country’s all-white apartheid government, and at age 44, **he chose to go to jail rather than turn against his principles.** He was kept behind bars until he was 71, and many of his friends were tortured and killed. Ultimately, Mandela negotiated South Africa's transition to a democratic government, and he was elected as its first president.

Mandela didn't speak more than a few words to Michelle and the girls—he was hard of hearing, and Michelle wasn't even sure he understood who they were. But still, Michelle left feeling humbled by the chance to gaze into the legendary man's eyes and say hello.

#### Reflection

On her flight back home to Washington, **Michelle thought about how Mandela had sacrificed so much, but he wasn't bitter about it.** He kept believing that somehow his sacrifices would be worthwhile, that his country would be better off because of them. He had to wait decades to see any progress, and yet he never gave up hope. She realized that she needed to learn to have the patience that he had. **She needed to accept that change and progress happen slowly, and sometimes you just have to wait.**

### Michelle Campaigns for Barack

**When she returned to the United States, Michelle campaigned for Barack's re-election.** She felt certain that Barack could accomplish a lot if the voters gave him four more years. Although Michelle never relished campaigning, it seemed harder than ever because the Republicans were dead set on proving that Barack should not be re-elected. Their candidate, Mitt Romney, was doing extremely well in the polls, only slightly behind the incumbent President.

As the couple got back on the campaign trail, Michelle learned to use the power of the Internet and social media to campaign for Barack. She used Twitter for the first time, and she talked to "mommy bloggers" who were big influencers, especially among women. **Meanwhile, she visited three cities a day, three days a week to speak at campaign events. It was exhausting.**

### Election Night 2012

On election night in 2012, the Obamas were back in Chicago. Michelle felt like more was riding on this election than on the election four years prior—**she felt like the entire nation was judging Barack's performance over the last four years, and perhaps hers as well.** On top of everything else, she hated the thought that if they lost the election, she would have to upend the girls' lives again, moving them away from the schools they loved and good friends they'd made in the last four years.

She was terribly anxious and couldn't stand watching the results come in, so she retreated to a room away from the television. Finally, Barack came in grinning and told her that he had won. Michelle was relieved—**America was giving the Obamas "permission to keep working."**

### Sandy Hook Tragedy

Only five weeks after the election, America faced a horrific tragedy when a gunman with a semi-automatic rifle shot and killed 20 first-grade students and six teachers at **Sandy Hook Elementary School** in Connecticut. The shooter was a mentally disturbed 20-year-old man who had "scorn for society." America was in shock.

Shortly after he received the news, Barack asked Michelle to come to the Oval Office—the only time in eight years that he needed his wife by his side in the middle of a workday. The two embraced, but neither had any words to say. **Like most Americans, they were devastated by the tragedy.**

The next morning, Barack held a press conference and addressed the nation, attempting to offer some solace for America's grief. As he wiped away his tears, he promised to do whatever he could to pass better legislation regulating gun sales in America. The next day, he traveled to Connecticut to speak at a prayer vigil for the victims and their families. Michelle was too shaken to go, plus her daughter Sasha was playing a small part in _The Nutcracker_ with the visiting Moscow Ballet, and Michelle felt like she needed to be there for Sasha. As she watched the show, **Michelle felt incredibly thankful that her daughter was alive. "My whole being was grateful for her," she writes.**

### Hadiya Pendleton Murder

The country was in the midst of a terrible period of gun violence. On January 29, 2013, just six weeks after the Sandy Hook school shooting, **Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old honor student from the South Side of Chicago, was shot and killed** on a Tuesday afternoon while hanging out near a playground with her friends. As a majorette with her high school's marching band, she had performed at Barack's inauguration just a few weeks before.

Michelle went back to her hometown to meet Hadiya's parents and attend the funeral in South Side. Hadiya's parents were very much like her own—working-class people who deeply loved their children. **Michelle hoped that her attendance at the funeral would draw attention to how many American kids were getting killed by guns** and force politicians to pass more sensible gun laws.

### Michelle's Chicago Violence Prevention Program

**Soon afterward, Michelle embarked on a violence prevention campaign in Chicago.** She got local business leaders and the mayor to expand programs for at-risk youth in the city. She met with students from a South Side high school where gun violence had killed or injured dozens of classmates. The students told her that the most dangerous days were the days when the weather report was "80 degrees and sunny." On good weather days, the gangs were always more active, so the students learned to stay inside for safety.

Michelle was honest with the students, telling them that getting more restrictive gun legislation passed was difficult—the National Rifle Association held a lot of power over Congress through their campaign donations. **The violence issue was daunting and could not be solved easily.** But she could offer them a tiny ray of hope: She told them to use school as their way out. If they studied hard, they could get into good colleges and find their way into a better life. **She told them that education had been her savior, and it could be theirs as well.**

#### Reflection

Michelle knew that mere words from the first lady wouldn't magically turn these kids’ lives around, but she wanted to offer them a different narrative than the one they so often heard—that as black inner-city kids, they were doomed to failure. **She believed that by telling them her story, they might see "a glimpse of a way forward."**

### Reach Higher Education Initiative

Concerned about the number of school-age children who were being killed by gun violence, Michelle launched an education initiative called **Reach Higher.** The goal was to get more kids interested in continuing their education beyond high school—whether through a professional training program, community college, or four-year college or university—by making them aware of the ways they could get there.

Michelle knew that her own success in life was largely due to parents, teachers, and mentors who pushed her to do her best and reminded her that she was important. She also knew that many school-age kids, especially in urban areas, **did not have mentors or role models to make them aware of what they could achieve.** These kids needed to learn what their career and college opportunities were and how they could access them. **Reach Higher provided financial assistance to high school guidance counselors to help students get into college, set up programs for summer internships and learning opportunities, and made it easier for students to obtain federal financial aid.**
