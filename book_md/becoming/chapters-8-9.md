## Chapters 8-9: Law Career and Meeting Barack (1989-1990)

In these chapters, Michelle jumps forward in her narrative, skipping past her years at Harvard Law School to her job at a high-end Chicago law firm and the summer she meets Barack. Michelle begins to evolve from someone who is solely career- and achievement-focused to someone who wants to be wife and mother, and she begins to question whether her law career was the right choice.

### Return to Chicago

**At 25 years old, holding degrees from Harvard and Princeton, Michelle moved back to her hometown of Chicago.** Her new law office was on the 47th floor of a building she had passed by many times on her way to high school. She became an upwardly mobile lawyer who worked 70 hours per week, owned a closet full of Armani suits, had a wine subscription service, and drove a Saab.

Michelle moved back into her old South Shore home, living in the upstairs apartment she was raised in. Her parents lived downstairs in the space where great-aunt Robbie, the piano teacher, lived before she died. (Robbie willed them the house.)

Michelle enjoyed visiting with her parents every day before and after work. Her brother Craig, now an investment banker, had also returned to live in Chicago with his new wife.

### Mentoring a Summer Associate

One day at work, a senior partner asked Michelle to mentor a summer associate who had just finished his first year at Harvard Law School. The young man had already acquired a reputation for exceptional intelligence. **Michelle felt skeptical about the hype surrounding the new guy and thought that his name, Barack Obama, was strange.**

Barack showed up late for his first meeting with Michelle, which annoyed her. As Barack apologized for his tardiness, Michelle noticed his smile. She also noticed that he seemed humble and not jaded by his brilliant reputation.

As Barack's mentor, Michelle was required to take him out to lunch. While they chatted, he told her that before he went to law school, he worked for three years as a grassroots community organizer in Chicago, rebuilding neighborhoods and creating jobs. **Barack’s earnest attitude and breezy self-assurance impressed Michelle.**

### A Friendship Grows

Barack and Michelle became friends at work. The pair formed an unspoken bond over the fact that **they were two of a very few Black people at the law office (out of more than 400 lawyers in the firm, only five full-time attorneys were Black).**

The two had lunch together once a week. Michelle learned that Barack was three years older than she was, that he read literature and political philosophy, that he played basketball, and that his hometown was in Oahu, Hawaii.

The only thing she disliked about him was that he smoked cigarettes—a habit she detested since her parents smoked when she was a child. But despite Michelle’s fondness for Barack, she had no romantic interest in him. **She was solely focused on her career at the firm and staying on track to become an equity partner before she turned 32.**

Michelle even invited Barack to a happy hour at a local bar, thinking her girlfriends would want to meet this brilliant, successful, handsome guy. He went along but wasn’t interested in dating any of her girlfriends.

Over time, Michelle learned more about Barack, including his staunch belief that **progress can only happen if ordinary citizens work together with the government.** She learned about his thriftiness and his introverted habits—he said he would rather spend an evening alone reading about urban housing policy than making chit-chat with 1980s yuppies at a bar.

Slowly their relationship began to change, and Barack tried to convince Michelle to date him. Although she resisted initially, Michelle soon realized she had romantic feelings for him. She felt drawn to Barack, but she was concerned about what her superiors at the law firm would think of their relationship.

### Love Blossoms

About a month before Barack headed back to law school for his second year, Barack and Michelle bought a couple of ice cream cones and sat down to eat them on the curb outside Barack's apartment. He asked if he could kiss her, and Michelle couldn’t resist his charm. **For the next month, the pair spent all their free time together.**

Since Michelle was living in the same house with her parents, the couple hung out at Barack’s sparsely furnished apartment surrounded by piles of books and clothes. They got to know each other more deeply over dinners, walks, movies, and long conversations.

**It was clear to Michelle and Barack that they were opposites:** She was organized; his apartment was a mess. She loved the Cubs; he loved the White Sox. She watched romantic comedies; he preferred serious drama. He wasn't interested in material goods; she drove an air-conditioned Saab. But they appreciated each other's differences and found commonalities in music, particularly Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and in their backgrounds—both had grown up in modest, middle-class households, and both had family members who deeply loved them.

### Barack's Heritage

Even so, Michelle soon learned there was a huge difference between her stable upbringing and Barack's more loosely tied family. **Barack came from a mixed heritage:** His white mother, Ann Dunham, was originally from Kansas but her family moved to Hawaii. She was studying at the University of Hawaii when she met Barack's Black father (also named Barack Hussein Obama), who was a Kenyan student.

After giving birth to Barack, Ann discovered that Barack Sr. had a wife in Nairobi. Ann divorced him and later married Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian man who was studying in Hawaii. Ann and Lolo took Barack with them to live in Jakarta, Indonesia, but after four years, Ann sent young Barack back to Oahu, where she thought he'd have better educational opportunities. **During most of his school years, Barack lived on Oahu with his grandparents, Ann's parents.**

Barack also had two half-sisters: Maya, who lived in Oahu, and Auma, who lived in Nairobi.

**Although Barack's early life was unconventional and somewhat unstable, he didn't yearn for something different.** He told Michelle that he loved Ann, he loved his grandparents, he loved his life in Hawaii, and that was all that mattered.

### Michelle Hears Barack Speak

One night, one of Barack's colleagues from his old community-organizing job asked if he would lead a training session at a Black parish in Roseland. The town had been devastated in the 1980s by steel mill closures. Michelle decided to go along to hear him speak.

The parishioners were at first skeptical of Barack but very quickly caught on to the power of his message. His words were simple: You either give up, or you work for change. Michelle, too, was moved by Barack’s talk. **She saw authenticity in his optimism—he fully believed that people could work for and achieve a better world.**

#### Barack Goes Back to Harvard

Barack told Michelle he loved her shortly before heading back to Cambridge and Harvard Law School, nearly 1,000 miles away. He intended to keep in touch with Michelle by writing letters to her—after all, he had written to his long-distance family all his life.

But Michelle came from a family of talkers—the Robinsons discussed everything over the dinner table. She insisted that they call each other on the phone, and Barack agreed.

### Michelle Recruits for Diversity

At work, Michelle was on a team that recruited summer associates for the law firm. **At the time, less than 3% of associates and less than 1% of partners in law firms were African-American.**

Like most other prestigious firms, Michelle's firm recruited associates only from prestigious law schools like Harvard, Stanford, and Yale. Michelle suggested that her firm cast a wider net and recruit from lesser known law schools, including state schools. She also argued that they examine other criteria besides grade point average.**If they didn't, they'd just recruit more lawyers who were like the majority who already worked there—white men from privileged backgrounds.**

### Michelle Meets Barack's Family

When Michelle went on recruiting trips, she occasionally had the chance to visit Barack at Harvard. He lived in a spartan apartment and drove a sputtering, yellow Datsun with a rust hole in the floor. Michelle, in contrast, enjoyed the many material perks that came with her high-paying job.

The Christmas after their first summer in Chicago, Michelle traveled to Honolulu with Barack to meet the grandparents who raised him, his mother Ann, his half-sister Maya, and some of Barack's high school friends. On that trip, Michelle learned that everyone in the family called him by his nickname, Barry.

Michelle felt comfortable and relaxed among Barack's family and friends. She saw how devoted he was to his family. **She watched Barack’s serious political side recede and his laid-back "Hawaiian personality" take over.**

On a day trip to the north shore of Oahu, the couple sat on the beach together talking. They discussed what kinds of parents they'd like to be someday, and what kind of house they'd like to live in. **Michelle realized she saw Barack as her potential lifelong partner.**

### Best Friend Suzanne Dies

Michelle’s best friend and Princeton roommate Suzanne called to announce that she was quitting her job as a computer specialist to travel around the world with her mother. Always the more conservative of the two friends, Michelle told Suzanne she was being irresponsible. Despite Michelle's disapproval, Suzanne left her job and traveled with her mother.

Suzanne returned home to Maryland several months later and phoned Michelle with completely different news: **Her body was being ravaged by an aggressive form of lymphoma.** In a tragic twist of fate, her mother had also been diagnosed with cancer of a completely different type.

Unable to cope with Suzanne's devastating news, Michelle used work as an excuse so she wouldn't have to think about her friend's mortality—and by extension, her own. **She spent months in a frenzied state of nonstop work, blocking out thoughts of her dying friend.** She kept telling herself that somehow Suzanne would recover.

Suzanne had several unsuccessful treatments and surgeries. When Michelle learned the doctors didn't think she would live much longer, Michelle traveled to Maryland to say goodbye to Suzanne, who was already in a coma. **Michelle felt devastated by the terrible injustice of her free-spirited friend dying at 26 years old.**

#### Reflection

Michelle felt challenged and inspired by the way Suzanne lived fully and vibrantly while Michelle worked nonstop, always obsessed with achievement. Suzanne's death served as a catalyst for Michelle, making her want more joy in her life.
