## Chapters 3-5: Coming of Age (1970s)

These chapters focus on Michelle and her brother Craig as they begin to grow into adulthood, learn about life's risks and responsibilities, and come to grips with the harsh reality of racial discrimination. In these years, Michelle begins to learn that there is more than one version of Black identity—that being Black isn’t tied to a single mode of speech, thought, or action—and that it’s up to her to create who she wants to be.

### Learning to Be Prepared

When Michelle was in fifth grade, she and her brother learned a hard lesson about life’s uncertainty. One of her classmates died in a house fire, a too-common tragedy in South Shore's aging buildings. Because most households didn't have smoke detectors, entire families sometimes perished.

Michelle and Craig attended the boy's funeral, and Craig, who was now a teenager, was deeply upset. He had always been a protective big brother to Michelle, but now life's risks had become more apparent. He decided his family must have an emergency plan in case of a house fire. He was especially concerned about his father, Fraser, who had little or no agility because of his multiple sclerosis.

Craig and Michelle began conducting fire drills at home. Fraser was uncomfortable with Craig taking on the role of family protector. Fraser didn't like feeling helpless—he never missed a day of work because of his disability. But he reluctantly participated in the drills and even allowed Craig to practice dragging his prone body to the stairwell.

**Craig and Michelle realized there was no guarantee that they could save their family in a fire, but they were comforted by having an emergency plan**.

#### Reflection

Michelle looks back on this period and realizes that although she and Craig may have seemed oddly serious and mature for their ages, those qualities came from their parents' lessons. **Fraser and Marian had instilled in their children the virtues of planning, preparation, and hard work to achieve mastery over life's circumstances.**

### Michelle Comes Out of Her Shell

Exposed to frequent extended-family barbecues and visits to her jazz-loving grandfather's house, Michelle became less introverted and more comfortable around large groups of people. Every Sunday, the Robinsons visited the "other" side of the family—Fraser's parents, whom the kids called Dandy and Grandma, and Fraser's three younger siblings. Michelle and Craig spent time with their father’s younger brothers, who wore leather jackets and bell bottoms and talked about Malcolm X and the Black power movement. Through their conversations, Michelle began to realize the world was much bigger than her South Shore neighborhood.

### Introduction to a History of Discrimination

Michelle loved her uncles but she was bothered by Grandpa Dandy's bad temper until she learned the source. He shouted at the television and at his wife, Michelle's grandmother, a meek and devout Christian woman who managed a Bible bookstore. Michelle, who had an inner fierceness, was mystified by her grandmother's passivity in the face of his verbal abuse. **Since no one else would speak up, Michelle sometimes confronted Dandy when he berated her grandmother.**

Michelle's parents tried to explain Dandy's anger: He was bitter from a hard life of disappointments and discrimination. He moved to Chicago as part of the Great Migration during the Depression, when six million southern Black men moved to northern cities to look for jobs. At the time, it was hard for everybody to find work, but even harder for Black people because factory managers preferred to hire European immigrants over American Blacks.

Dandy couldn't get a union card because he was Black, which foiled his plan to become an electrician. So he worked as a handyman and did other odd jobs. This story repeated itself among several men in Michelle’s family: Michelle's maternal grandfather, a carpenter, couldn't work for a reliable construction firm because he wasn’t eligible for a union card. Her great-uncle Terry also couldn’t get a union card, so he gave up searching for work as a plumber and became a Pullman porter, a "traditional Black man's job."

Dandy abandoned his plans to attend college because he couldn't afford it. Eventually, he became a postal worker. He was overqualified, but at least he had a steady job. After 30 years, he retired with a pension. He and his wife raised a family of accomplished children—one received an MBA from Harvard, another became a train engineer, another became a teacher. **But Dandy never got over being angry and bitter about his forfeited dreams.**

#### Reflection

Thinking back about her grandfather, **Michelle considers how America’s systemic racism cast aside many intelligent, hardworking men and took a huge toll on their families.** Because the men were denied access to higher-paying jobs, it meant they couldn't buy their own homes, save money for retirement, or send their children to college. And **being pushed down because of the color of their skin had an even more insidious effect—it encouraged them to resent and mistrust the world.**

### Discovering Her Own Black Identity

Michelle knew from a young age that her friends and cousins saw her as a curiosity, someone who didn’t fit their familiar mold. At a family gathering, **one of her distant cousins asked her why she talked "like a white girl."** It was part insult and part genuine interest, and it made Michelle self-conscious about the formal English her parents and grandparents had taught her to speak.

She understood that her diction wasn't like that of her peers—for example, in the Robinson family, "ain't" was a forbidden word. She knew that she had grown up in a different kind of household—one in which the library, literature, and the Encyclopedia Britannica were revered.

Michelle didn't know how to respond to her cousin's accusatory question. **She felt torn between two worlds, wanting to fit in with her peers but knowing that her parents had taught her to speak in a more refined manner.** She wasn't yet old enough to know why, but she knew her parents' reverence for proper English had value.

#### Reflection

Looking back on this childhood conversation, **Michelle notes that at the time, she still had a long way to go before finding her true voice and becoming comfortable with who she was.** She had to learn that there was more than one Black identity and more than one way for a Black person to speak or think. She reflects that the delta between where she came from and where she wanted to go was too vast and impossible for a young girl to comprehend.

She also notes that a similar conversation took place 30 years later when she and Barack were campaigning for President. **Some people—both Blacks and whites—criticized the couple's way of speaking and living as "denying their culture."** Others simply didn't know what to make of them, especially Barack, an Ivy League-educated Black Hawaiian whose mother hailed from Kansas. Some voters mistrusted him because he didn't fit any established stereotype.

### Educational Development

When Michelle was in seventh grade, her mother again intervened to improve her education. A newspaper wrote a scathing article about her school, calling it run-down and poorly managed, stating that it contributed to the neighborhood's "ghetto" mentality.

The principal defended his school and community, and Michelle's mother Marian supported him. An active PTA member, Marian lobbied for positive changes at the school and volunteered to chaperone at her children's school events. Despite the "white flight" happening all around her, Marian believed in her neighborhood and the people who chose to stay there. **She believed in fixing what was wrong rather than fleeing.**

The school began a new program that grouped students by ability, and Michelle was moved into the "gifted" classroom. She thrived in this enriched learning environment—she worked on independent projects, attended writing workshops, and took field trips to the local community college. As always, her mother encouraged her every step of the way.

### Becoming a Teenager

At age 14, Michelle grew into a stereotypical teenager. She stopped sharing every small detail of her life with her parents and started keeping her thoughts to herself. She became interested in boys and experienced her first kiss on a stone bench outside her parents' house.

Michelle slowly gained independence. She rode the bus across town by herself to take jazz and acrobatics dance lessons. She learned to be wary of her surroundings and look out for her own safety. She viewed herself as a grown-up, or at least a partial grown-up.

Fraser and Marian decided it was time Michelle had more privacy at home. They converted the back porch of their house into a bedroom for Craig. The parents moved into the space that used to belong to the children; Michelle moved into their bedroom. She loved having this new room all to herself.

### Marian's Sacrifices

Marian was active in the lives of Michelle, Craig, and their friends—sometimes to the neglect of her own. She knew how to be supportive without overpowering them—the opposite of today’s “helicopter parents.” **She gently guided her children and gave them freedom to make decisions, even if they sometimes made mistakes.** Marian was so devoted to her family that Michelle never realized until years later that her mother sometimes felt dissatisfied. (Like most teenagers, Michelle was too wrapped up in her own life to worry about her mother’s feelings.)

Although Marian never voiced her thoughts to her children, she occasionally daydreamed about leaving her husband and starting a new life. Eventually, however, her doubts would fade away and she'd regain her resolve to stay in her marriage.

#### Reflection

Looking back at her mother's occasional longings for a different kind of life, Michelle realizes that **even the best marriages present an affront to individual freedom.** Partners must continually make sacrifices in order to preserve their union.

Now that Michelle has been married for many years, she realizes that to preserve a long-term relationship, **each partner needs to continually renew their vow to stay.** It's a private choice, best made at frequent intervals. The partners don't need to discuss it, not even with each other, but they do need to make the decision to renew their commitment.

### Michelle Broadens Her Horizons

In eighth grade, Michelle tested into Chicago's first magnet high school, which provided specialized instruction for high achievers. She started ninth grade at a brand new school that offered classes that Michelle had never been exposed to, like pottery and photography.

On her first days at her new school, Michelle felt insecure as she struggled to find her place in the social community. The student body was about 80% nonwhite; the majority were Blacks. Her fellow classmates were high-achievers like her; many were the sons and daughters of doctors and lawyers. **They came from a world of privilege and connection unlike anything she had ever known.**

Michelle knew it was an honor to attend this school, but she felt insecure about her family background, her neighborhood, and her own intelligence. Just getting from her house to the new school was a major effort: She had a 90-minute bus ride on two different buses, so she had to get up at 5 a.m. and didn't return home until 6 p.m.

Also, for the first time in her life, Michelle didn’t have big brother Craig to pave the way for her because he attended a different high school.

But after a few weeks of getting used to the new school and routine, **Michelle realized that if she continued to study hard as she had always done, she could excel in this new environment.** As her confidence grew, she began to make new friends and earn good grades. She didn't achieve straight A’s like she had in previous years, but she came close.

#### Reflection

**Michelle looks back and says that if she were to categorize her concerns as a teenager, they would be filed under one overarching question: Am I good enough?** Her entry into a high-achieving high school only underscored her doubts and insecurities about her abilities. Ultimately, her ingrained work ethic helped her succeed. She quickly learned that if she put in extra hours of studying, she was able to keep up with the best students, and her confidence blossomed.

### School Trip to Paris

When Michelle entered high school, her mother went to work as an executive assistant at a bank. **Although her parents never discussed financial difficulties, Michelle knew the family needed money** since they already had one child in college: Craig attended Princeton University, and even with basketball scholarship money, it was expensive. Soon they would have two kids in college. Marian’s new job would help to pay the bills.

When Michelle's French class planned a school trip to Paris, Michelle didn't even mention it to her parents, assuming it was too expensive. But Fraser and Marian learned about the upcoming trip and told Michelle it wasn't her place to worry about money—all family financial decisions were theirs. Somehow they found the funds, and several months later, Michelle boarded the flight to Paris with her classmates.

#### Reflection

Looking back, **Michelle realizes that her parents, who were in their early forties at the time, gave up everything to give their children the best advantages.** They never visited Europe. They never went out to a restaurant for dinner. They never went on fancy vacations. They had never even owned a house. Instead, they saved all of their money to invest in their children's future. **They made countless sacrifices, but they didn't see them as sacrifices—they saw them as investments.**

### Befriending Jesse Jackson's Daughter

One of Michelle’s best friends at her new high school was Santita, who was also the daughter of Reverend Jesse Jackson, the powerful Baptist preacher and political leader who had worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and advocated for African-American rights. Like typical teenagers, Michelle and Santita would hang out at the mall and explore the city streets after school.

Michelle knew that Jesse Jackson was a celebrity, but she didn't fully understand his importance because she had little interest in politics. Santita, on the other hand, had participated in protests for important causes, marching alongside her father and four siblings. **From an early age, Santita's parents taught their children the importance of political activism.**

Michelle saw the Jackson house as an exciting place. She learned to expect the unexpected whenever she was there. Unlike her family, the Jackson family followed no routine. Business leaders, politicians, athletes, and artists were always coming and going. **The Jacksons seem to be caught up in something much larger than anything Michelle had ever known.**

For Michelle, who was fond of her quiet, orderly home with her parents, hanging out with Santita was intriguing and eye-opening, but not always fun. Michelle liked predictability and planning and didn't like last-minute changes, which were the norm at the Jackson household. **Their community-oriented life seemed like chaos to Michelle.**

At the time, Jesse Jackson was only a few years away from making a bid for the U.S. Presidency, so he often made public speeches and appearances. One year, someone in the Jackson family convinced Michelle and Santita to attend the Bud Billiken Day Parade, an important Chicago event promoting African-American pride. Jesse Jackson would speak at the event.

Michelle attended the parade but felt overwhelmed by all the noise and fanfare. Her mother, Marian, caught a glimpse of her waving and smiling on the television news. But Michelle wasn't smiling on the inside—**as was typical for her, she just behaved as she thought she should.**

#### Reflection

Years later, Michelle would understand the importance of this parade—what it meant to Black people all over Chicago—but at the time, she felt uncomfortable being part of the hoopla. **She reflects that perhaps this was the beginning of her disdain for politics and the media circus that surrounds it.** Being around the Jackson family taught her an important early lesson: **Political life was filled with unpredictability; it was a life without set schedules, dependable plans, and the quiet order that Michelle preferred.**

### Michelle Applies to Princeton

Sometime during high school, Michelle set her sights on attending Princeton University, mostly because her brother Craig was having a good experience there. Michelle had excellent grades, had been inducted into the National Honor Society, was treasurer of her senior class, and in the top 10% of her graduating class.

Despite all these accomplishments, when she told her high school counselor that she wanted to apply to Princeton, **the counselor told her that she probably “wasn't Princeton material."**

The counselor's words hurt, but Michelle refused to lower her aspirations. She decided not to let one person's opinion budge her from her goal. She did exactly what her parents had taught her to do—**strive to achieve what she wanted, even if it was a long reach to get there.**

Michelle applied to Princeton and was accepted. She never went back to the counselor to say that she had been wrong. She had no need; **Michelle proved to herself that she was capable, and that was the only affirmation she needed.**

#### Reflection

Michelle looks back on how she felt after meeting with this counselor and reminds us that "failure is a feeling long before it's an actual result." Had she listened to the counselor's advice, all the confidence gains she had made during high school would have been lost.

In her eight years as first lady, Michelle met hundreds of highly accomplished people, many of whom told a story similar to hers: Someone in their young years doubted their ability to succeed at their goals. **The naysayers, critics, and doubters are always standing at the door, but the most successful people learn to push past them.**
