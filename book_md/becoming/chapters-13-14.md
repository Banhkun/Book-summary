## Chapters 13-14: Career Changes and Motherhood (1993-2003)

These chapters focus on Michelle's career moves—first to the nonprofit Public Allies and then to the University of Chicago—as well as her challenges in getting pregnant and the eventual birth of the Obamas' two daughters. Becoming a mother fulfills a lifelong goal for Michelle—and plays an important role in her evolution as a person.

### Executive Director at Public Allies

After Michelle left her job at Chicago City Hall, she was hired as the **executive director for the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an organization that sought to inspire a new generation of community leaders.** Much like Teach for America or AmeriCorps, Public Allies trained talented young people through 10-month apprenticeships in civic-minded jobs and nonprofit organizations.

As the 29-year-old executive director, **Michelle was thrilled to have the chance to run her own nonprofit.** She relished being in charge of setting up an office, hiring staff, seeking out donors, and finding suitable places for young people to work. Most of all, she enjoyed selecting the "allies" themselves, the young people who would participate. She searched out candidates at community colleges and urban high schools. **She made it a point to choose not just straight-A students, but also young people who weren't the highest achievers** but seemed like they would benefit from the program.

Running Public Allies was all-consuming, but in reflection, Michelle calls it the best job she ever had because her work had so much impact on these young adults.

### Barack Gets Elected to the Illinois Senate

Meanwhile, Barack was teaching a class at the University of Chicago Law School, working full time at a law firm, and running community-organizing workshops. **Michelle began to understand that he had limitless energy and carried the world's problems on his shoulders,** which led to his need for quiet space and time to concentrate, read, write, and think.

When an Illinois state senator encouraged Barack to run for office, Michelle hoped he wouldn't take the bait. She had a low opinion of politics and politicians, and she wanted Barack to stick to his stable jobs in law and teaching. **But Barack had political ambitions, and Michelle wanted to support his goals** even though she believed the job would drive him crazy.

**Barack was elected to the Illinois Senate in November 1996.** He had to spend three nights a week in the state capital of Springfield, away from Michelle in Chicago, but he was excited about his new legislative position.

The couple developed a strategy to help them cope with the time apart: Every Friday night the couple shared "date night" at a favorite Chicago restaurant, where they'd catch up on the details of their lives.

### Associate Dean at the University of Chicago

Michelle, now 32 years old, prepared to make another career transition. After three years running Public Allies, she accepted a job as an **associate dean at the University of Chicago.** Her role was to focus on community relations and make sure the university was better known to everyone in the city. With a larger paycheck and less-demanding hours, she could focus on her personal life, which for her meant it was time to become a mother.

### The Obamas' Quest for a Baby

**Both Barack and Michelle wanted to have a baby, but conception didn't happen easily.** After trying to get pregnant for several months, Michelle had a miscarriage. The couple sought the help of a fertility doctor, who recommended Michelle take a drug to help with her egg production. That wasn't successful, and a few months later the couple decided to attempt in vitro fertilization (IVF). Michelle felt she was extremely fortunate because her job at the university came with top-notch health insurance benefits that would cover the cost.

As Michelle took the drugs, got the tests, and administered the daily shots needed for IVF, she felt her first twinges of resentment toward Barack's political commitments. She came to realize that no matter how great a husband Barack was and how great a father he would be, she would have to heft most of the responsibility for getting pregnant and, most likely, parenting their future child. **She realized that equality in parenthood is a myth—it's simply not equal.**

Considering the lonely road she was up against, Michelle briefly hesitated before putting the IVF syringe into her thigh. But she wanted a baby so badly, she was willing to do whatever was necessary to make it happen.

Once Michelle became pregnant, all traces of resentment disappeared. She was finally going to fulfill her dream of being a mother. **On July 4, 1998, she gave birth to their first child, Malia Ann.**

#### Reflection

Michelle’s difficulties in conceiving taught her an important lesson—that while hard work and perseverance made a big difference in many areas of her life, no amount of "hard work" could make her get pregnant.**Fertility wasn't just another achievement. It was a gift and a privilege.**

#### Joys of Motherhood

Barack was reelected to the Illinois state Senate and was busier than ever, but he was also thrilled to be a new father. Both he and Michelle were hyper-focused on baby Malia. Michelle was "heady with the responsibility" of parenthood, and she obsessed over every burp and murmur the baby made.

### Vacation Tainted by Politics

After a long maternity leave, Michelle eventually returned to a part-time job at the University of Chicago. Barack was still an Illinois state senator, but **he planned to make a bid for a U.S. Congressional seat.** That Christmas, Barack, Michelle, and Malia went to Hawaii to visit Barack's grandmother (and Malia's great-grandmother). The Illinois Senate was in the midst of debating an important crime bill, and in the middle of their holiday, Barack was called back for a special vote on the bill.

The Obamas immediately changed their plane tickets and prepared to fly back, but baby Malia suddenly fell sick with a mysterious fever. Until she could see a doctor, there was no way her parents could put her on a plane. Michelle and Barack discussed the option of him going back and leaving Michelle and Malia in Hawaii, but both parents were deeply concerned about their little girl. Torn by competing responsibilities, Barack chose to stay with his family and miss the vote.

As it turned out, Malia had nothing more than a typical toddler's earache. **But the crime bill failed by a narrow margin, and Barack faced strong criticism from other state senators and the media.** Despite his explanation that his baby daughter was sick, they accused him of choosing a Hawaiian vacation over important legislative work.

Michelle was mortified that the family's private life was being publicly judged, and she was also concerned that this one event might destroy Barack's favor with the Democratic party, poison his hard work and progress in the Illinois Senate, and ruin his chances to win a seat in Congress.

Her disdain for politics escalated in the days before the Demcratic primary. Some voters questioned Barack's character and made unfair comments about his education and his "whiteness." **They said “real Black men” didn't speak or look like he did.**

Michelle was incensed by these attacks, but Barack took them in stride, understanding that it was all part of the political game. Nonetheless, Barack lost the Democratic primary in March.

### Baby Sasha Joins the Family

After another round of in vitro fertilization, **Michelle and Barack’s second child, Natasha (Sasha) Marian, was born on June 10, 2001.** Big sister Malia was almost three years old.

Now with two children, Michelle considered quitting her university job and staying home to be a full-time mother. Her beloved babysitter, who had looked after Malia, had recently quit, so Michelle no longer had childcare.

Michelle interviewed for the position of **executive director for community affairs at the University of Chicago Medical Center.** She took three-month-old Sasha with her to the interview because she wanted to be honest about her reality: She was a mother of two young children. She felt empowered by her assertive display of motherhood, and her new boss didn't seem to mind at all.

Most of Michelle's close friends were, like her, educated and ambitious. Michelle observed as this tight group of women juggled high-powered careers and babies and supported each other along the way. Some worked full time; others part time. Some had help at home and some didn't. **She learned from watching these women that there is no "right way" to be a mother.**

When she was offered the hospital job, her friends and Barack encouraged her to accept. It was a great opportunity to make a difference in her community, and her new salary would be enough to pay for a housekeeper and caregiver for her children.

### Barack's Political Career Climbs Higher

Barack still hoped for an entry into national politics. **George W. Bush was president at the time, and the United States had just experienced the horrific tragedies of September 11, 2001.** In the midst of the turmoil, Barack considered running for a U.S. Senate seat. Michelle did not support the idea—she felt like they were already much too busy managing their children and their careers, and the last thing they needed to add to their schedules was a high-profile political campaign.

#### Marriage Discord

Years of Barack being away from home all week and returning late on Thursday nights had taken a toll on Michelle. **She felt lonely when he was gone, and when he was home, she felt frustrated by their big and small disagreements.** She was constantly annoyed by Barack’s lack of punctuality—he often got caught up in projects and lost track of time.

As the children grew to be toddlers, the couple's lives became even more hectic, and Michelle's resentments deepened. **Now 38 years old, she started to worry that her marriage might unravel.**

Michelle convinced Barack to go to couples' counseling. After some resistance, he agreed. Michelle expected that their psychologist would validate all her grievances and convince Barack to change his ways, but he didn't. Instead, he let both Michelle and Barack air their complaints, and he didn't take sides.

After several appointments with the psychologist, the couple began to find ways to communicate their needs more clearly and take care of themselves and each other.

##### Reflection

**Looking back on this difficult time in her marriage, Michelle realizes that she was suffering from "a kind of psychic whiplash."** She wanted to be a wife and mother like her mom was, but she also wanted to be just like her childhood TV-show idol, Mary Tyler Moore, who was a vibrant career woman and the opposite of her mother. **Michelle was yearning for an impossible degree of perfection** —a stable family life, a successful career, and an ideal marriage—and then blaming Barack for not providing it. She’d gotten "caught up in the notion that everything was unfair," but counseling taught her that she had to take responsibility for herself.

### Michelle's Pivot Point

**After counseling, Michelle realized that she could take steps to make her own life happier, and it didn't have to be at Barack's expense.** Barack didn't have to quit the job he loved or stop going to the gym to make more time for Michelle and the girls. Instead, for example, Michelle needed to start going to the gym herself, and she needed to find other ways to set healthy boundaries.

To simplify her life, Michelle stopped trying to accommodate Barack's erratic schedule every day. Rather than waiting for Barack to get home, she kept a set schedule for the girls' dinner time and bedtime. It was up to Barack to get home in time to see the girls before they went to sleep.

Barack, too, made adjustments based on what he learned from counseling, especially in terms of his day-to-day communication with Michelle. He even began working harder at being punctual.
