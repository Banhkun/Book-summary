## Exercise: Identify the Ego Problems in Your Life

Watts asserts that the ego illusion causes three major problems in Western Society: destructive tendencies toward nature and other people, dissatisfaction with the present moment, and fear of death. The first two problems in particular stem from a sense of alienation caused by the ego.

* * *

Describe an occasion when you acted destructively toward nature or other people. This could include a time when you accidentally did something damaging, like walking on plants, or when you intentionally did something harmful, like lashing out at someone in frustration.

How would you have behaved in this situation if you felt more connected to your surroundings and other people?

Describe an occasion when you felt discontent with where you are in life or felt anxious about the future.

What are the ego-associated triggers that make you feel dissatisfied with the present? For example, these triggers might include comparing yourself to others on social media or feeling like youâ€™re not part of a certain group.
