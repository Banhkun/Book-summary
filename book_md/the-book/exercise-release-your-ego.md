## Exercise: Release Your Ego

Watts acknowledges that releasing the ego isn’t a process that you can achieve simply by _wanting_ to release it. However, he makes two general recommendations: Increase your self-consciousness regarding your ego, and do more activities for pure enjoyment.

* * *

Write down a few activities that tend to enhance your ego or sense of identity. For example, attending gatherings for a club, participating in a sport, performing, or introducing yourself to new people. When you’re in those scenarios, try reflecting on your ego for a few moments and observe whether the ego feeling dissipates.

Write down the activities that you genuinely enjoy doing for no practical reason at all. This could include doing art, playing a game, or even just sitting outside and doing nothing.

Make a plan to do these activities regularly to distract yourself from the ego feeling and keep yourself present in the moment. How will you prioritize your just-for-fun activities over practicality? For example, you might schedule a weekly art class or commit to sitting outside and doing nothing for 30 minutes before breakfast every morning.
