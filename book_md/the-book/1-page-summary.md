## 1-Page Summary

Many people in the West internalize the idea that each of us is an individual—an entity separate from others and our surroundings. This basic understanding of identity is so foundational to Western society that most people never question it. However, in _The Book_ , Alan Watts argues that the idea of humans as separate beings is an illusion: the ego illusion. According to Watts and the Vedanta Eastern spiritual philosophy, each of us is a manifestation of one Cosmic Being that encompasses everything in the universe. (Vedanta is a teaching from the Upanishads: a collection of Hindu texts composed around 800 BC.)

Watts asserts that **the ego illusion alienates people from the rest of creation and causes destructive tendencies**. Ignorance of our interdependence puts Westerners in conflict with other people and**** nature, causes chronic dissatisfaction with the present, and makes them fear death as the endpoint of existence. His solution is for Westerners to release their ego and embrace the experience of unity with the universe.

Alan Watts was an English scholar and philosopher who interpreted Eastern spiritual philosophies for a Western audience starting in the 1930s. His ideas in _The Book_ —published in 1966—draw primarily on the Vedanta philosophy, but his writing is also based on principles from Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism.

Watts claims that his ideas aren’t meant to be moralistic or to encourage people to behave in a certain way, but rather to serve as a tool to help people experience their oneness with the universe—an especially pertinent philosophy in an era characterized by anxiety and competition. In the preface, he explains that he used the generic title _The Book_ to represent a spiritual manual that he imagines all parents could give to their children to help them make sense of the world and their existence. He notes that the philosophy is a starting point for exploration, rather than a specific doctrine to follow.

To start, we’ll define the ego illusion and what Watts believes is our true identity. Then, we’ll explain how Western society perpetuates the ego illusion, its dangerous consequences for humankind, and how Westerners can release the ego and embrace the experience of cosmic unity. Throughout the guide, we’ll also include practical advice for embodying the philosophy.

### The Ego Illusion and Our True Nature

We’ll start by describing the ego, the ego illusion (Watts calls it the “ego trick”) as well as how Watts defines our true identity as being one with the universe—which we’ll call the Cosmic Being.

**The ego is essentially feeling like an “I”—an individual consciousness contained in a body**. Watts defines the ego illusion as the false sense of being an individual who exists as an entity separate from other people and the environment. Watts argues that this is the fundamental assumption that guides Westerners’ relationship with the rest of the world, causing them to feel isolated and at odds with nature.

(Shortform note: This idea of the ego illusion comes from religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, which both deny the existence of a “self” and identify the ego as the source of human suffering. By contrast, Western philosophy and religions generally believe in an analogous concept of individual egos, although the terminology varies. For example, the French philosopher René Descartes believed that the mind is the essence of a person, while Christians generally refer to the soul.)

Another aspect of the ego illusion is the Western idea that we enter the material world when we are born and then later depart it when we die. Although people have different beliefs about an afterlife, there’s still an underlying assumption among Westerners that humans are individual entities who cease to exist on the earthly plane after death. For atheists, humans physically decompose, and that’s the end of their existence. For Christians, people’s individual souls move on to the spiritual realms of heaven or hell.

(Shortform note: Although Watts generalizes about the temporary nature of the Western ego, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (considered a founder of Western philosophy) believed that the soul was both uncreated and eternal. He wrote that individual souls are reincarnated into different physical bodies forever. The main difference between Plato’s eternal soul and the Cosmic Being is that there are multiple, individual souls in Plato’s philosophy.)

#### Our True Nature

Despite this Western concept of individual identities, Watts argues that we’re not really isolated beings, and we don’t enter or leave the world because we’re all part of the Cosmic Being that has always existed. In fact, more than being _part_ of the Cosmic Being, **each of us _is_ the Cosmic Being, taking different forms and playing pretend in different roles** (different humans, animals, plants, and minerals). What we think of as “I” is just one expression of the Cosmic Being in a particular time and place, but our real identity is the entire collection of beings and their environments and their relationships to one another. (Shortform note: This concept that there are no separate entities—only one Cosmic Being—is called non-duality.)

> **Comparing Watts to Another Non-Dual Western Philosophy**
> 
> In _Conversations With God_ , Neale Donald Walsch makes a similar argument for non-duality—the idea that we are all one—but with slight differences in his representation of the Cosmic Being. For example, he claims that God split itself into infinite forms and created the world so that sentience could exist. Walsch argues that God couldn’t know itself unless there was something besides God. Therefore, God created other beings that could experience God from a different perspective. As a result, life is essentially a game of remembering our true nature as God and enjoying existence.
> 
> This is similar to Watts’s playing-pretend model except that Watts never provides a motivation or justification for why the Cosmic Being manifests in so many different forms in the universe. In addition, the two authors differ in their terms for the Cosmic Being. When using the word “God” for a Western audience, people tend to conceptualize it like the God of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—a paternal, king-like figure who is envisioned as a person. Watts emphasizes that his Cosmic Being concept is much grander than a person or any particular physical form.

##### The Limitations of Language

Watts writes that the Cosmic Being transcends language, which is inherently limiting, so it’s impossible to adequately explain the concept with words. **“Knowing” ourselves as the Cosmic Being is more of an experience than an intellectual understanding**. He notes that because of the inadequacy of human languages, the Cosmic Being has many names, including “God,” “Ultimate Ground of Being,” and “Existence.” The Cosmic Being isn’t a supernatural, all-powerful being who controls everything, but rather _is_ everything.

> **Translation of Eastern Philosophical Terms**
> 
> One of the challenges of interpreting Eastern spiritual philosophy in English is the fact that the ideas were originally written in Sanskrit in the Vedas—ancient religious scriptures. The oldest of the Vedas was written around 1500 BC and defines the Cosmic Being using the Sanskrit word “Brahman.” Scholars translate it as the unchanging and infinite ultimate reality.
> 
> Although Watts uses the word “self” and “ego” interchangeably, the Sanskrit word “atman” refers to the self that is distinct from the mind, body, and ego. The term anātman refers to the belief that there’s no fundamental “self.” The non-dualist schools of Hinduism believe (like Watts) that Brahman and atman are the same, while the dualist school of Hinduism claims that Brahman, atman, and matter are all separate entities.

### The Cosmic Being Framework: Everything Is Relative

Despite the limitations of language for describing the Cosmic Being, Watts elaborates on his Cosmic Being framework by explaining that **everything in the universe exists in relationship to its environment and other beings**.

In other words, we can’t define anything except in relative terms. For example, we can only describe warm in comparison to something cold. We can only define ourselves as human by comparison to other types of organisms. Even in terms of the way our senses perceive things, we can only see a circle on a piece of paper if there’s a different-colored background that evokes the circle. Thus, everything is interconnected, and nothing can have an identity in isolation, including humans.

Watts also explains that organisms are really a _process_ of interacting with their environment. For example, a person has to breathe air, eat food, and walk on solid ground, and people only perceive reality when their nervous system continuously interacts with the environment. These observations reinforce the idea that everything in existence depends on mutuality and relationships.

> **Relativity in Science**
> 
> The concept of viewing everything in relative terms is called “relationalism.” It occurs in many fields of study, including color theory, theories of time and space, and quantum mechanics. In color theory, relationalism suggests that objects don’t have a true color because it’s possible for multiple observers to perceive the color differently. In _A Brief History of Time_ , Stephen Hawking explains that, in physics, motion, position, time, and weight are all relative to the observer because there’s no absolute frame of reference.
> 
> The relational quantum mechanics model also applies this principle to the microscale and suggests that particles can be in more than one state at the same time. Therefore, there’s no absolute state of any system—only measurable _interactions_ between the system and a specific observer. For example, we can’t say that an electron is in one specific position; we can only say that an observer _perceived_ it in a specific position.
> 
> These scientific concepts reinforce Watts’s ideas that we can only observe characteristics in relative terms, and that there’s no such thing as discrete, definable entities—only interactions between systems.

### What Perpetuates the Ego Illusion?

Now that we’ve defined the ego illusion as well as Watts’s concept of the Cosmic Being, we’ll explore what _perpetuates_ the ego illusion in Western society: How does an entire culture maintain this false idea about the nature of existence? Watts claims that the myth of the individual ego is reinforced by **language and by having a narrow scope of attention that focuses on components rather than connections**. Then, the ego illusion manifests in Western society through paradoxical cultural expectations for each person to be an individual.

#### Language and a Narrow Scope of Attention

First, Watts asserts that Westerners create the ego illusion by putting boundaries on things that don’t really have them and by narrowing their field of view. For example, people create a false boundary when they refer to a river as one discrete object, even though it’s constantly changing in composition, shape, and size.

(Shortform note: This idea that everything is constantly changing is called the philosophy of flux. The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus popularized this idea with the paraphrased quotation “You can’t step into the same river twice.” However, unlike Watts, who argues that the river isn’t an individual entity at all, Heraclitus argued that the fluctuating nature of the river is what fundamentally gives it its long-term identity as a river as opposed to a lake.)

In terms of humans, most languages use some sort of “I” pronoun and nouns that define organisms as separate entities that perform actions. However, as explained in the previous section, Watts says nothing exists in isolation, so when Westerners speak about the self, they’re actually narrowing their field of view to the human body and falsely referring to it as a separate ego. He notes that even human skin is highly dynamic and is more like a connection to the environment rather than a rigid boundary.

(Shortform: Contrary to Watts’s argument that English personal pronouns reinforce the ego illusion, there are also personal pronouns in Eastern languages associated with non-dualist cultures. These include Sanskrit—now considered a dead language—in which non-dualist philosophy was originally written, as well as Hindi and other languages based on Sanskrit. This suggests that language _can_ contribute to the notion of the “self” as separate from others, but doesn’t _necessarily_ do so.)

##### Western Science Is Reductive

Watts uses Western science as another example of how Westerners narrow their scope of attention and create the illusion of separateness. Because **science focuses on reducing things to their parts and analyzing how those parts work** , Westerners imagine the phenomenon of cause and effect. Watts writes that the concept of cause and effect is another example of the ego illusion since the Cosmic Being is one unified process with no cause and effect (similar to the way a circle has no beginning or end).

Watts illustrates this idea with the example of looking through a narrow gap in a fence and watching a cat walk by. If you saw the head first, followed shortly after by the tail, you might assume that the head _caused_ the tail when they’re actually parts of one whole. (Shortform note: Although Watts presents this example like a thought experiment, it doesn’t quite make logical sense unless it’s interpreted metaphorically. Since people are generally familiar with animal anatomy, they’re unlikely to make this logical jump of cause and effect in this scenario. However, the example metaphorically illustrates how people _could_ jump to a false conclusion if they couldn’t perceive the larger context.)

Watts explains that just like the head and tail of a cat are interlinked, **all events and organisms exist mutually, with no singular cause or effect**.

(Shortform note: Some physicists believe in the Block Universe Theory of time, which also argues that all events exist mutually. The theory claims that everything that has ever happened and will happen is contained in a “universe block,” and our perception of time depends on where we are in the block relative to other points. Therefore, the forward passage of time is only an illusion. However, the Block Universe Theory includes a beginning and endpoint of the universe, whereas Watts argues that there’s no beginning or end of time.)

Despite the tendency in science to focus on individual components, we can only understand things in context. For example, if scientists are studying how the human heart works, they’re not just studying the heart in isolation—they’re observing what it does inside the human body when connected to other organs under very specific conditions.

(Shortform note: Although Watts criticizes Western science as being reductive in nature, he doesn’t account for the scientific field of ecology, which is defined as the study of the relationships between organisms and their environment (humans, plants, and animals included). Ecology focuses on the connections between things and entire systems rather than individual parts.)

Watts emphasizes that things can only be separated in linguistic terms, and Westerners confuse the name for the true identity of something. For example, if you call one thing “back” and another the “front,” they have different names, but they’re just two different sides of the same thing. In this way, language is constantly reinforcing a concept of separateness that doesn’t exist.

(Shortform note: Although Watts suggests that Westerners confuse distinct names for distinct identities, Christianity includes a deity with multiple names but a unified underlying identity. In Christianity, the Holy Trinity%20has%20been%20variously%20understood.) consists of one God in three divine forms: God, his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Based on this counterexample, Westerners don’t necessarily conflate names with identity.)

#### Societal Conditioning

After explaining how the ego illusion arises from language and reductive tendencies, Watts explains how Western society perpetuates the ego illusion through **underlying community expectations for each person to be independent**. Society reinforces the mandate for individuality by using expressions like “Be yourself,” or “That’s not like you.” Watts writes that everything about a person is transferred to them from society—our genetics, our cultural beliefs, our language—and yet Western society tells people they’re separate individuals.

(Shortform note: The concept of being your most authentic self is a common ideal expressed in Western culture. Although Watts frames this idea as an impossible goal with a false premise, many authors present it as a solution to feeling inadequate. For example, in _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brene Brown argues that presenting your authentic self to the world fosters a sense of worthiness—the idea that we are enough as we are. On the other hand, in _What Got You Here Won’t Get You There_ , Marshall Goldsmith suggests that being _too committed to your idea of your true self_ can cause you to be inconsiderate of how your behavior might negatively affect others.)

This creates a paradox where society demands that everyone _be an individual_ , but the fact that the mandate comes from society means that **people are inherently linked to society and defined by it**. When Westerners go along with society’s idea that everyone is an individual, they become simply a product of society and thus _not_ fully independent agents. Therefore, Western society is based on a contradiction—a situation Watts refers to as the “double-bind.”

This situation is like when people tell you, “Don’t care what other people think of you—do what you want.” It’s a paradox because if you follow the advice, then you’re actually doing what someone else wants and showing that you _do_ care what other people think.

(Shortform note: In contrast to Watts’s emphasis on how language contributes to the ego illusion, some researchers theorize that the period of settler colonialism in the US during the 1800s contributed to its cultural emphasis on individualism. During this era, settlers entered new, unfamiliar environments and wanted to strike out on their own to achieve upward economic mobility. Researchers suggest that this romanticized concept of rugged individualism persisted over time as a cultural ideal.)

### Consequences of the Ego Illusion

After explaining the ego illusion and how Westerners fall into the trap of the ego illusion, Watts explores what all of this means for people practically. Watts writes that **ignorance of interdependence and the Cosmic Being makes Westerners feel alienated** from the rest of the world and constantly in competition with others. (Shortform note: In _Lost Connections_ , Johann Hari suggests that spending more time in nature may help us tap into the feeling of interdependence that makes us feel connected to other beings. Hari writes that seeing a natural landscape reminds us that our pain is insignificant in the grander scheme of things and therefore helps us de-center our ego.)

Because Westerners feel alienated from others, they try to destroy nature and their human enemies, experience dissatisfaction with the present, and fear death as the ultimate endpoint of their existence.

#### Destroying Nature and Enemies

Watts claims that the **ego illusion is a driving force for environmental destruction**. When Westerners believe they’re separate from all other beings, it fosters a sense of hostility and competition that justifies relentlessly extracting resources, destroying animal habitats, and killing other organisms for the sake of advancing the human race. Since we are all one Cosmic Being, this unknowingly causes harm to all of existence.

(Shortform note: Other environmental advocates emphasize alternative root causes of the destruction of nature. For example, some people argue that the capitalist economic system drives environmental destruction because it relies on growth fueled by the extraction of natural resources. Others suggest that people are less aware of how their consumption impacts nature because of the increasing distance between consumers and natural resources. However, this concept of separateness is based on _physical_ distance rather than a spiritual sense of separateness.)

Even within the human community, Watts argues that people define themselves in contrast to others. This, he argues, is an inherent aspect of existence. **Humans designate certain people as outsiders to bolster their own position as part of a superior community**. However, when people ignore the interdependent nature of the Cosmic Being and conflict is taken to the extreme, this leads to war and the destruction of the Cosmic Being in its various forms.

(Shortform note: In _Biased_ , Jennifer L. Eberhardt asserts that categorizing people into groups is an automatic neurological process that helps us sort chaos into order. This phenomenon is particularly powerful when it comes to categorizing people based on race. She argues that this unconscious tendency is rooted in the biological adaptation that allows us to more easily distinguish between people of our own race compared to people of other races. However, when this natural instinct goes too far, it might contribute to the conflicts that Watts describes. He doesn’t specify exactly what kind of conflict he’s referring to, but we can infer that it includes things like genocide and other forms of violence.)

Watts writes that **Westerners irrationally try to __ destroy the enemies** that their community fundamentally depends on. For example, Christians might reinforce their identity by disparaging the behavior of non-Christians. However, if they violently eliminated all non-Christians, people would feel compelled to make a new distinction to define themselves in comparison to others. If those new groups then fight to the death, this pattern of destruction would continue endlessly until nothing is left.

(Shortform note: The Crusades, a series of wars between Christians and Muslims during the 11th and 12th centuries, are one of many examples that illustrate the catastrophic impact of conflicts that escalate to war. During these wars, 2-6 million people from Western Europe were killed. However, Watts makes a broad generalization here by implying that the ego illusion inevitably makes Westerners want to violently destroy their enemies. Statistics indicate that the homicide rate is higher in the Americas compared to other global regions, but Watts doesn’t present any concrete evidence that links the ego illusion with violent tendencies.)

As an alternative to the destructive, competitive model of conflict, Watts proposes the idea of de-escalating conflicts so that people can still have opposing views without wanting to kill each other. In this paradigm, groups can (and should) fight with each other while keeping in mind that both groups depend on each other, and all conflict is a game of push and pull where no one group should ultimately win or destroy the other. He also suggests that a deep sense of interconnectedness will naturally lead to more harmony with others—a love that comes from knowledge and not from guilt or duty.

(Shortform note: Watts doesn’t go into much detail about the practical aspects of how to practice restrained conflict. One potential strategy for individuals is to use nonviolent communication, a conflict resolution technique that is rooted in compassion. In the book _Nonviolent Communication_ , Marshall B. Rosenberg explains that nonviolent communication avoids causing physical or emotional harm to the other person by focusing on a sense of shared humanity between you and the other person. It includes four steps: observe, identify feelings, identify needs, and make requests.)

#### Dissatisfaction With the Present

In addition to the destructive tendencies associated with the ego illusion, Watts explains that it also causes Westerners to experience a constant sense of dissatisfaction because they’re always trying to advance their own ego and **emphasize practicality over simply _being_**. He argues that only children in the West can fully enjoy the bliss and magic of every moment before they’re indoctrinated into the ego illusion. But if Westerners embrace the idea that they’re one with the Cosmic Being, they can then appreciate the miracle of existence without feeling anxious about the future or comparing themselves to others.

(Shortform: Based on Watts’s argument, it’s unclear _how_ Westerners try to advance their ego, or what exactly they’re working toward when they’re anxious about the future. However, we can infer from his use of phrases like “rat race” that he means Westerners generally strive for financial success and social status. Overall, Watts’s recommendation boils down to the idea of being present in the moment rather than worrying whether you’re doing what you think you should be doing. Some people recommend breathing techniques as a practical method to help you stay grounded in the present moment.)

#### Fear of Death

Lastly, Watts claims that the ego illusion causes Westerners to fear death because they’re so attached to their ego and the seemingly finite time each precious ego has to live. By observing the way that Western adults react to death and behave during funerals, children internalize the idea of dreading death.

However, Watts argues that if Westerners truly embrace the idea of the Cosmic Being, they would realize that there’s no entering or leaving the world because we are one with all of creation. He suggests that **death is a spiritual opportunity for a person to finally release their attachment to the ego** and remember that there’s no “self” and no beginning or end of life.

(Shortform note: In _Being Mortal_ , Atul Gawande suggests that Westerners’ relationship with death has changed over time. Gawande writes that modern changes to the way Westerners age and die hinder their ability to cope with death in a positive and accepting way. For example, Americans are less likely to live in multigenerational households, so younger generations are less exposed to the realities of aging and dying, making them ill-equipped to face mortality.)

### Path to Abandoning the Ego

Now that we’ve explored why the ego illusion causes so much destruction and hardship in Western society, we’ll discuss Watts’s recommendation for how people can escape from the ego illusion. Watts claims that there’s no surefire way to experience cosmic unity, but people can get closer to it by steering clear of rigid religious doctrines, doing more things for pure enjoyment, and increasing their own self-awareness around their egos.

#### Organized Religion Reinforces the Ego

First, Watts advises against organized religion as a pathway to releasing the ego. This is because **religions reaffirm a person’s sense of self rather than allowing them to reject it**. Religions, or even specific techniques like yoga meditation, tend to make people feel like they’re part of an in-group. This hinders the experience of feeling unified with the Cosmic Being because the group is defined in contrast to outsiders.

(Shortform note: One research study supports Watts’s idea that yoga meditation actually enhances the ego. Researchers followed yoga students for four months and found that people had higher self-esteem and a greater sense of superiority immediately after practicing yoga. However, the researchers also noted that modern forms of yoga often intentionally aim to help people feel more confident and worthy, so the results may have been impacted by people’s motivations for doing yoga. Based on this analysis, doing yoga with the goal of disassociating from the ego might lead to a different outcome.)

In addition, Watts asserts that **specific religious doctrines make people narrow-minded** about what they should be doing and how they should act. To experience the Cosmic Being and escape the ego illusion, Westerners have to expand their mind in order to reject the basic assumptions that society tells them about their existence.

(Shortform note: Despite Watts’s insistence that religion can get in the way of the ego release, some Zen Buddhists criticize Watts’s idea that you can achieve spiritual transcendence without disciplined practice—specifically the Zen practice of meditation called “zazen.” Watts studied with a Zen teacher until he decided he disagreed with the strict teaching style. He said that he rejected zazen because “A cat sits until he is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away,” perhaps implying that disciplined meditation is unnatural or unnecessary.)

#### Increased Self-Consciousness

In addition to organized religion, Watts asserts that **_wanting_ to release the ego is yet another way that people inadvertently reinforce it**. He suggests that the only way for Westerners to get closer to experiencing the Cosmic Being is to increase their awareness of their own ego attachment. Every time a person notices their sense of self—their feeling of being an “I”— they should embrace that sensation and examine it so closely that eventually, it starts to dissipate. The more Westerners recognize their tendency to advance their own ego and fight outsiders, the more they’ll realize they _need_ enemies to prop up their sense of self and the fact that they’re parts of one whole.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle recommends a more specific technique for releasing the ego. He says to think, “I wonder what my next thought will be,” and then wait and observe what it feels like to disconnect from your own mind. He recommends observing your mind as an outsider, even if it’s only for a moment. However, Watts would likely argue that at that point, you still need to acknowledge that the “outside observer” is a non-existent ego form as well. This aspect of Watts’s argument is a bit nebulous since he’s essentially saying that you can’t desire to release your ego, and you can’t do it by sheer force of will, but the only way to get there is to try anyway.)

#### Do Things for No Reason

Lastly, Watts suggests the simple practice of doing things for pure enjoyment, for no practical reason at all. Paradoxically, he says that doing things for no reason actually _does_ help us survive, but only if we don’t _intentionally_ do it for survival. But if Westerners do things that bring them joy, just for the sake of their own happiness, they’ll incidentally focus less on advancing their sense of self. He claims that people will get closer to experiencing the Cosmic Being when they **have a sense of humor with regard to the world and recognize it as a game** with only one player and no beginning or end.

(Shortform note: Gretchen Rubin’s _The Happiness Project_ makes a similar recommendation to seek out leisurely and playful activities simply because you enjoy them and not because you think you _should_ do them. Although the goal isn’t necessarily to part with the ego, this strategy is meant to add joy and gratitude to your life by making small changes. She suggests identifying activities that you genuinely look forward to and that make you feel energized, and then making time for those activities regularly. She also suggests keeping a notebook to jot down anything that sparks your interest and could be a new area to explore.)
