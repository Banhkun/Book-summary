## Chapter 6: Trigger Multiple Senses

The next principle of effective public speaking is**presenting content that triggers multiple senses.** For instance, give your audience something to look at—such as PowerPoint slides—as well as something to listen to—such as your voice.

Triggering multiple senses is important when making a speech or presentation because **it’ll help your audience to remember what you’ve said.** Research has shown that multisensory experiences are much more memorable than single-sense experiences.**** For instance, in one study, students were more likely to recall information from a lesson if that information had triggered two senses—sight and sound— rather than just one. Their brains created both visual _and_ auditory models of the information, making it much easier to recall in the future.

### Which Senses Should You Trigger?

You should aim to trigger a combination of the following three senses in your speeches and presentations (the more the better):

  1. **Hearing**
  2. **Sight**
  3. **Touch**



Let’s look at how to trigger each sense in detail.

#### Hearing

**Hearing is a sense that you need to trigger in every presentation you make.** After all, in these situations, getting people to listen to you is your main method of imparting information.

While you may assume that you can trigger this sense simply by talking to people, remember that just because you’re talking doesn’t mean that people will actually _listen_. To truly trigger your audience’s sense of hearing, you need to make your manner of speech interesting enough to grab their attention. There are three possible ways to do this:

**Method #1: Be highly descriptive.** Go into such vivid detail about your topic of discussion that people can clearly picture it in their minds. For instance, if you’re talking about how you created a product, discuss every detail about the moment you came up with the idea—where you were, who you were with, even what the weather was like that day. By painting a vivid picture with your words, you’ll immerse your audience in your topic and pique their interest.

According to neuroscientists, verbally describing something in detail can be just as memorable as showing someone a picture of the thing you’re describing. The brain’s visual cortex can’t actually differentiate between reality and imagination—in other words, something it’s _actually_ seen, and something it’s only _imagined_ seeing. So if your audience can imagine the thing you’re describing clearly enough, they’ll feel like they’ve actually seen it.

> **TED Talk Example: Janine Shepherd**
> 
> Janine Shepherd is an Australian former skier whose burgeoning Olympic career was ended by an accident that left her partially paraplegic. Shepherd was biking along a path in the Blue Mountains near Sydney when she was struck by a truck.
> 
> In 2012, Shepherd gave a TED talk about the accident and her life since it occured. She described the accident in vivid detail: the beautiful weather that day, the sun shining on her face as she cycled along, the feeling of the cold mountain air in her lungs—and the moment when everything went black.
> 
> Shepherd didn’t use a single visual prompt when describing the incident: She showed her audience no slides or pictures. Instead, she immersed her readers in her story by painting a picture with her words.

**Method #2: Repeat the key argument of your talk multiple times.** This will signal to the audience that you’re making an important point, thus encouraging them to listen to what you have to say.

This method was famously used by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his iconic “I Have a Dream” speech. Dr. King included this titular phrase in eight sentences in a row, a use of repetition that grabbed people’s attention and made them want to listen to what his dream actually _was_. The phrase became one of the most memorable and oft-quoted phrases in modern history.

**Method #3: Incorporate other people’s voices into your speech or presentation.** For instance, if you’re making a sales pitch, play a video in which happy customers give verbal testimonials. When giving a work presentation, invite a colleague to briefly give their perspective on your topic.

The brain starts to lose interest and “switch off” when it hears the same person’s voice for a long time. Incorporating other people’s voices into your talk, even briefly, avoids this issue and keeps your audience engaged.

#### Sight

The second sense to trigger is **sight**. The easiest way is to **create a visual aid to accompany your spoken words:** in other words, presentation slides. You could create these slides yourself, if you have faith in your ability to avoid common design mistakes—for example, spelling errors and overlapped text. Another option is to hire a professional to create the slides for you.

When creating presentation slides, **minimize the amount of text you include.** Professionals often cram presentation slides with written information—on average, 40 words per slide. This is problematic because the audience can’t read the text and listen to the speaker at the same time. They don’t fully absorb the information being presented, and therefore struggle to recall it in the future.

A better approach to creating slides is **using a combination of short phrases and pictures.** Research has demonstrated that people are more likely to recall visual information if it’s presented in this way, rather than just in written form. Likewise, other studies have shown that people will remember 65% of the information presented to them if they both hear it _and_ see a related image at the same, compared to just 10% of the information if they only hear it.

##### What Types of Images Should You Use?

The two main types of images used in presentations are **photographs** and **charts**(for example, graphs). It’s always a good idea to include lots of photos—the audience is unlikely to get sick of seeing them. However, they _will_ get sick of seeing slide after slide of charts, meaning you should limit the number you show.

If you absolutely have to include lots of charts and graphs in your presentation slides, **use cleverly-placed photographs to keep your audience engaged.** For example, during his 2013 TED talk, Bono showed the audience various graphs to support his argument that progress was being made in tackling extreme poverty. However, he interspersed these charts with photos of children whose lives had been saved thanks to anti-poverty drives. These photos stopped his audience from developing data fatigue.

> **TED Talk Example: Al Gore**
> 
> In 2006, former vice president Al Gore gave a powerful TED talk about climate change and the risk it poses to the planet. As Gore spoke, he frequently displayed relevant pictures on his presentation slides. For instance, when discussing pollution, he showed a photo of plumes of smoke being released from factories. When discussing the light waves emitted by the sun, he displayed a graphic of the earth, the sun, and arrows representing the transfer of light waves from the latter to the former.
> 
> By displaying images during his talk, Gore triggered a winning multisensory combination: seeing pictures as well as listening to words. Gallo believes that this is one of the reasons why Gore’s talk was so memorable.

#### Touch

The final sense to evoke in your speeches and presentations is **touch**. Sometimes, it’s possible to trigger this sense directly. For example, if you’re pitching a product, you could pass a prototype around your audience.

However, if you’re talking about an idea rather than an object, there may not be a suitable prop for you to hand out. In such cases, you can stimulate the sense of touch by **asking people to imagine how it would feel to touch or be touched by something.** For example, in a 2011 TED talk on chronic pain, Dr. Elliot Krane asked his audience to imagine how it would feel to have someone touch your skin with a blowtorch, explaining that sufferers of a condition called allodynia experience this burning sensation on a daily basis.

### What About Smelling and Tasting?

Note that Gallo doesn’t advise trying to trigger the senses of smell or taste when speaking publicly. He takes this position purely due to ease: **It’s difficult to directly trigger these senses in a presentation** (unless your talk is about something like perfume or food, and you give your audience samples to smell or taste).

In some circumstances, **it may be possible to evoke these senses indirectly by encouraging your audience to imagine what something smells or tastes like.** Just as imagining what something looks like tricks your brain into thinking you’ve actually seen it, imagining what something smells or tastes like fools your brain into thinking you’ve experienced these senses, too.

For example, in a 2009 TED talk, water treatment expert Michael Pritchard discussed a product he’d created that can make even the filthiest of water drinkable. During the talk, he brought a small tank of dirty water on stage to demonstrate how the product worked. The audience’s sense of taste was indirectly triggered as they were left to imagine how foul this water’s flavor might be without treatment.
