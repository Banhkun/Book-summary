## Exercise: Generate Passion

Sometimes, we all have to publicly speak on topics that we don’t really care about. However, by framing these topics in a way that appeals to your passions, you can ensure that you captivate your audience.

* * *

Think of a time you had to give a presentation on a topic you weren’t that passionate about. What was the topic? Why did you have to talk about it?

How did your audience react to your presentation? (For example, did they seem captivated or bored?)

If you had to give a presentation or speech on the same topic again, how might you link the topic to something that _does_ interest or excite you? (Try to frame the topic in a way that appeals to your passions.)
