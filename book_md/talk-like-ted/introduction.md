## Introduction

**Being a strong public speaker is one of the most powerful talents you can possess.** Effective speakers can captivate their audience with new ideas and concepts, inspire people to try new things, and even influence people’s opinions.

On the other hand, failing to speak persuasively and confidently can limit your capacity for success in the working world. For example, you won’t convince people to buy your product or service if your sales pitch is lackluster. Likewise, if all of your presentations are tedious and unconvincing, you’ll struggle to impress your colleagues and superiors.

According to communications coach Carmine Gallo, the key to becoming a good public speaker is applying nine principles to your talks. The first six principles relate to the content that you should include in your speech or presentation:

  1. **Pick a topic you’re passionate about**
  2. **Tell your audience stories**
  3. **Present something new**
  4. **Incorporate a shocking moment**
  5. **Use humor**
  6. **Present content that triggers multiple senses**



The final three principles relate to the logistics of preparing for and delivering an effective talk:

  1. **Keep your talk brief**
  2. **Plan and practice**
  3. **Be yourself**



Gallo formulated these principles after analyzing more than 500 TED talks. At TED conferences, speakers give short presentations on a topic related to technology, entertainment, or design—hence, “TED.” Gallo noticed that the most popular and engaging TED talks all incorporated at least some of the above principles. He deduced that **anyone can replicate the success of these TED talks if they apply these principles** —in other words, if they learn to “talk like TED.”

In this book, we’ll explore why these nine principles are so effective at boosting your public speaking skills, and how you can apply them at your future speaking events.

(Shortform note: We’ve reordered and reorganized some of the book’s chapters to add coherency.)
