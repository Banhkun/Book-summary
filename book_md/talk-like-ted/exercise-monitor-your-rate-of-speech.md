## Exercise: Monitor Your Rate of Speech

According to Carmine Gallo, the ideal rate of speech when giving a presentation is 190 words per minute. Discover what your current rate of speech is, and consider how you might get closer to Gallo’s ideal rate.

* * *

Read the following sentence out loud, and time how long it takes you to do so: “ _Talk Like TED_ is a book about learning how to be an effective public speaker. It contains nine principles that you should follow if you want to improve your public speaking skills.”

The above sentence is 32 words long. If you were to adhere to Gallo’s ideal rate of speech, it should take you 10 seconds to read out. How long did it _actually_ take you to read? Are you speaking too slowly, too quickly, or at just the right rate?

Now, read the sentence out loud again, bearing in mind your reflections from the previous question. Did you manage to get closer to the 10-second ideal this time? Why or why not?
