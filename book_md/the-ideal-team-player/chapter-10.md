## Chapter 10: Embedding Teamwork in Your Culture

Besides helping individuals become humble, hungry, and smart, it’s important to embed these values in your company’s culture. Here are some ways to do that:

### Talk about Teamwork Constantly

**Leaders who believe in teamwork should talk about their commitment to the three virtues to everyone** —customers, partners, vendors, and job candidates. That helps establish the expectation among people dealing with the company that employees will be humble, hungry, and smart and encourages employees to behave that way. And as word gets around, the organization becomes known for its culture, and it’s easier to find employees who are a good fit.

While it may sound simplistic or contrived to some, the organizations that are most explicit about a teamwork culture are the most successful in building it.

### Reward People for Teamwork

Managers often don’t say anything when employees do what they want them to, but they’re missing an opportunity. When employees act in ways that show humility, hunger, or people skills, leaders should call attention to it. **Praise rewards and motivates the employee and reminds everyone else of what’s expected**.

### Address Violations

When you see behavior that goes against one of the values, whether the misstep is major or minor, let the violator know. **Employees are often unaware of small slip-ups and learn the most from them when a manager or team leader points them out**. This doesn’t mean treating minor and major missteps the same—managers need to use good judgment. The important thing is, don't miss opportunities for learning

### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

For those who have read the author’s previous book, _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ , this section looks at how the three virtues relate to that model. (Shortform note: Read our summary of The Five Dysfunctions of a Team here.)

_The Ideal Team Player_ is about the qualities of individual team members, while _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ is about team dynamics.

The five biggest problems that teams need to overcome to work effectively are:

  * **Mistrust** : Teams can’t build trust when the members fear being vulnerable with each other. 
  * **Fear of conflict** : A team’s desire for harmony prevents productive conflict.
  * **Lack of commitment** : The fear of being wrong prevents good decisions.
  * **Avoidance** : Wanting to avoid discomfort prevents team members from holding each other accountable.
  * **Ignoring results** : A desire for credit shifts the focus away from team results.



**These problems are less likely and easier to overcome when team members are humble, hungry, and smart about dealing with people**. For example, a person with strong people skills will be better at engaging in healthy conflict.

Having members do self-assessments and work on personal development can improve team functioning. Also, talking as a group about everyone’s personal development goals can increase trust among team members.

### Humility Stands Out

**Humility, hunger, and people skills are as important in life as they are in workplaces and organizations.** Parents, friends, and neighbors who embody these qualities will have better relationships, get more things done, and serve others better.

But of the three qualities, humility, which has divine origins—the concept is taught in the Bible and embodied by Christ—stands out. It is a gift and a powerful way to influence others.
