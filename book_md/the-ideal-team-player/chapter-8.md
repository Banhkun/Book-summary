## Chapter 8: Assessing Current Employees

Another way to use the team player model is to evaluate current employees. The possible results are:

  * You confirm an employee has the qualities of a team player.
  * You identify employees who lack essential qualities and help them develop into team players.
  * You determine that an employee can’t or won’t become a team player and you part company.



**Assessing humble, hungry, and smart qualities also can help a manager identify the problem when struggling with an employee**. The employee may be creating or having problems due to a major shortcoming in one of the three areas. You’ll either solve the problem with an employee improvement program or terminate the employee.

If you can’t decide whether an employee has what it takes to improve, keep working with them until you know for sure. That way you won’t make the mistake of writing off someone who could become a valuable contributor in time. More often, managers know when an employee isn’t a good fit, but don’t do anything about it.

Here are some approaches for evaluating people for the team player attributes:

### Manager Assessment

Managers or team leaders can assess an employee by answering questions like the following:

##### Humble

  * Is he quick to praise coworkers for accomplishments?
  * Does he readily admit mistakes?
  * Is he willing to do grunt work for the benefit of the team?
  * Does he share credit with others?
  * Does he readily apologize and accept others’ apologies?



##### Hungry

  * Does he go beyond what’s expected in his job?
  * Is he excited about the team’s mission?
  * Is he willing to work beyond regular hours?
  * Is he eager to take on challenges?
  * Does he contribute in areas beyond his responsibility?



##### Smart

  * Does he pick up on others’ feelings during meetings?
  * Does he show empathy toward team members and interest in their lives?
  * Does he listen attentively?
  * Is he aware of how his words and actions affect others?
  * Does he adjust his behavior and style to the circumstances?



For an ideal team player, the answer to every question would be yes. Answering questions like these can add clarity even when a manager or team leader already knows an employee’s strengths and weaknesses.

### Employee Self-Assessment

**Asking employees to evaluate themselves may be an even more effective way to assess whether they’re team players** or have the potential to become team players. Most employees will do self-assessments if the purpose is to improve, and shortcomings won’t be held against them. It’s also a chance for them to take ownership of their development.

Use the questions in the manager assessment above, but rephrase them to ask how coworkers would rate the employee—for instance, “Would a coworker say... I’m quick to praise teammates for accomplishments?” or “Would a coworker say … I readily admit it when I make mistakes?” and so on.

A simple, alternative self-evaluation method is to ask employees to rank how strong they are in the three virtues from best to worst.

### Peer Discussion

Having teammates meet as a group and share their individual strengths and weaknesses is another way to encourage change and support.
