## Chapter 6: Assessing People

**You can improve the effectiveness of a team by assessing how people measure up to the virtues of an ideal team player** , and by helping those who fall short to develop the right qualities or move on to something else.

People typically fall into the following categories:

**1) None of the virtues** : People who aren’t humble, hungry, _or_ smart aren’t likely to develop into team players. They’re rarely hired, however, because they stand out as the jackasses or jerks that no one wants to work with.

**2) One of the virtues:** Someone who has only one of the three qualities will have a tough time developing the other two, but it’s possible. These people can be:

  * **Humble only (“Pawn”):** People who are humble without being smart or hungry are of little value to the rest of the team. While pleasant and kind, they don’t make waves, build relationships, or get involved in team conversations. They aren’t motivated to do much. They can coast for a long time on teams that don’t demand performance.
  * **Hungry only (“Bulldozer”):** People who are hungry or driven but lack humility and interpersonal skills tend to run over others in pursuit of their own interests. They don’t care about how their actions affect others and can quickly wreck teams. Leaders who prioritize teamwork remove them quickly, but companies that prioritize production often let bulldozers run amok.
  * **Smart only (“Charmer”):** Those who have people skills but lack humility and hunger are personable, but lack true interest in helping colleagues or the team. Because they don’t contribute, their charm soon wears off.



**3) Two of three virtues** : People with two of the three virtues have a good chance of becoming ideal team players if they acknowledge and focus on fixing their weakness. However, if their failing is major and not corrected, they can be a major impediment. People with two of three virtues can be:

  * **Humble and hungry, not smart (Inadvertent troublemaker)** Those who are humble and hungry but lack interpersonal skills are hard workers who want to help the team. They don’t try to hog credit or attention, but they are clueless about how their words and actions come across. Colleagues appreciate their effort but get tired of cleaning up the problems they create. They have a good chance of changing because their intentions aren’t bad and they can handle feedback. In the fable, Nancy fit this description.
  * **Humble and smart, not hungry (“Slacke** r**”):** These people are genial, get along well with others, and don’t crave the spotlight. But they do only enough to get by—they don’t voluntarily take on more work or extra assignments. Because they’re so likable, many leaders don’t push them, but without significant oversight, they hold back the team.
  * **Hungry and smart, not humble (“Politician”):** These people are ambitious and may at first appear to be humble, but they work for their own interests. They use and discourage other people. By the time leaders identify them as a problem, they’ve done their damage. They’re often promoted by companies that value individual performance over teamwork. In the fable, Ted fit this description: he said the right things in the job interview, but he was more interested in himself than others around him.



**4) Three out of three virtues:** People with all three virtues are ideal team players. They don’t need attention or credit for their efforts, and they’re driven to work hard and do whatever they can for the good of the team. Because they’re attentive to others, their coworkers like working with them.

#### Caution

Pegging people isn’t necessarily easy, and it shouldn’t be done cavalierly. Wrongly labeling someone could be unfairly damaging to their career. Also, it’s possible to mislabel someone who is particularly strong in one area, but still strong enough in all three to be a team player. The above classifications are intended for people _significantly_ lacking in one or two areas.
