## Introduction

One of the most important ways to succeed in your workplace and life is by developing the ability to be a team player. Being able to work effectively with others to achieve a group goal is more important than ever in an interdependent and changing world.

Yet **ideal team players are uncommon**. As leaders, we say we want team players, but**we can’t clearly define the individual qualities we’re looking for—and so we end up hiring people who undermine teamwork** (it doesn’t take many to destroy a team). In addition, many leaders and organizations pay lip service to teamwork, but they don’t devote serious attention to making it part of their culture.

In _The Ideal Team Player_ , author and business consultant Patrick Lencioni describes the model team player and explains how to develop current employees into team players and make sure you’re hiring team players.

Building on a previous book, _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,_ which focused on group dynamics, **this book defines three essential personal qualities or “virtues” the ideal team player embodies—humility, hunger or drive, and people skills**. (Shortform note: Read our summary of The Five Dysfunctions of a Team here.)

Here’s how they’re defined:

  * **Humble** : Great team players focus on the success of the team rather than personal interests.**** They**** lack overbearing egos or an obsession with status. 
  * **Hungry** : Hungry people are driven to seek more work and responsibility. Self-motivated and conscientious, they’re willing to go above and beyond. 
  * **Smart** : Being people-smart means having common sense when it comes to dealing with people. Smart people are aware of the impact of their words and actions on others, and they act appropriately for the circumstances.



While they sound simple, developing and living the virtues is more complicated. Many people have one or more of the qualities, but fewer possess all three. A team member who lacks just one quality can hold back or derail a team.

However, **with coaching and a relentless organizational commitment to teamwork, most people can learn to be ideal team players**. Employees who develop these virtues increase their value to current and future employers. Leaders who hire employees who already demonstrate humility, hunger, and people skills (referred to in the book as smarts) get better results and eliminate politics, turnover, and morale issues.

Through the fictional story of a man who takes over his uncle’s troubled construction company, _The Ideal Team Player_ explains how these three simple qualities combined can transform any organization.
