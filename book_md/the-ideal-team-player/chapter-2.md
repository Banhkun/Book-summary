## Chapter 2: Defining a Team Player

Jeff visited the Oak Ridge building site to get a feel for the problems there. He introduced himself to the difficult project manager, Nancy Morris, who was reticent in answering his questions. She said her part of the work was on schedule; if he wanted to know about the rest of it, he needed to ask the other manager, Craig. She didn’t know what Craig was doing because he’d stopped inviting her to his meetings.

Jeff knew Craig because their kids went to the same school, and Craig was more welcoming than Nancy had been. When Jeff asked about the problems on the site, Craig said that while Nancy was quite capable, she couldn’t get along with anyone; she always seemed to say things that angered or upset someone. Craig had told her to stop coming to meetings if she was going to upset people, so she quit coming.

Back at the office, Jeff spoke with several administrative employees in the lunchroom about whether they thought the company tried to hire team players. The conversation affirmed Jeff’s impression that while the company wanted team players, people didn’t really know what that meant. Hiring was hit or miss.

Jeff felt they could turn things around if they could weed out the counterproductive people.

This wouldn’t necessarily mean having to hire more people—**they could get more done with fewer people if the ones that remained were real team players.**

If there were problem employees who wanted to stay, they’d have to commit themselves to becoming team players, which required being able to admit mistakes, engage in healthy conflict, and be accountable. **It was especially important to ensure that managers were team players, because they would tend to hire people like themselves**.

#### What’s a Team Player?

The first step would be figuring out how to identify a team player.

That afternoon, Jeff talked with his cousin Ben, a school teacher and basketball coach (and Bob’s son) to get his thoughts on essential characteristics of team players. Ben said the key qualities were that they worked hard and weren’t prima donnas—they focused on helping the team succeed.

Next, Jeff and his two top managers went through a list of people the company had let go or had problems with in the past few years, looking for common denominators among non-team players. They came up with a fairly predictable list of negative traits: negative, lazy, self-centered, insensitive, and irresponsible.

Jeff, Clare, and Bobby soon got to test their own ability to identify team players: They decided to add a fourth top executive to their team, to help get the two big building projects done on time. Bobby had a highly qualified candidate in mind: Ted Marchbanks, a former division chief for a big construction company, who had retired recently.

They had a get-acquainted lunch with Ted and he came across as smooth and knowledgeable. Bobby wanted to hire him immediately, but Jeff and Clare didn’t have a sense yet of whether he’d be a team player.

Again, they tried to figure out what they wanted in a team player by examining the opposite—a non-team player or jackass. They came up with: overbearing, inappropriate, and clueless—which seemed to describe Nancy, the problematic manager on the Oak Ridge project. Clare commented that Nancy wasn’t upsetting people intentionally—she just wasn’t “socially smart” when it came to dealing with others. Regarding Ted, they agreed that he seemed smart about dealing with people.

Having people skills seemed important to being a team player, but Jeff thought there was more to it. Based on their analysis of past and current employees, plus his conversation with his cousin Ben (the basketball coach), **three key qualities began to gel in Jeff’s mind: lack of ego, willingness to work hard, and being smart about people.**
