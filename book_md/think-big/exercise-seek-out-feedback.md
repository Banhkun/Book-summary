## Exercise: Seek Out Feedback

Create a plan for how to ask for and receive feedback well so that you can incorporate it without letting your cognitive biases get in the way.

* * *

What is one issue that you’re currently facing that you’d like to receive feedback on?

Name three people who you think would provide honest, supportive feedback on that issue.

Briefly list some characteristics these three people have in common. Determine whether your list is sufficiently diverse—recall that asking a diverse group will provide you with the best possible advice.

What would excite or upset you most to hear? Writing this down now will help you realize what feedback you might pay too much attention to due to attentional bias.
