## Exercise: Brainstorm New Offering Ideas

To begin brainstorming ideas for a blue ocean offering, think of a product or service your company already sells, to use as a starting point.

* * *

What alternatives do customers have to your product? Why do they use them? Could you combine these features into your offering?

What happens before, during, and after your product is used? What are the most difficult or distasteful parts, and how could you make them easier?

What characteristics do your customers consider when they balance price and performance? Can you combine their most important characteristics into a new offering, while eliminating everything else?

Does your industry lean toward the functional or the emotional? If functional, can you inject emotion into your product to grow demand and highlight additional value from your product? If emotional, can you strip away unnecessary extras to make it more functional?
