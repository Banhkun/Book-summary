## Exercise: Practice Using an Action Table

Recall that Kim and Mauborgne’s action table consists of four boxes in which you record which characteristics of a product you would decrease, increase, eliminate, or create. In this exercise, you’ll create an action table for the blue ocean offering that you brainstormed in the last exercise, after Part 2.1.

* * *

What characteristics does your industry take for granted that could be eliminated? What would your customer not miss if it were gone?

What characteristics could be reduced? In what ways is your customer overserved by existing offerings?

What characteristics could be improved? In what ways is your customer underserved by existing offerings?

What characteristics might be created that your industry doesn't currently offer? What does your customer need in your offering that doesn’t currently exist in alternatives?
