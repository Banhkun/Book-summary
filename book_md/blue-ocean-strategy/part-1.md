## Part 1: What Are Blue Oceans?

In _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne argue that the solution to business growth and success is to operate in an uncontested market, which they call a _blue ocean_ , in contrast to a _red ocean_ , a marketplace where fierce competition has stained the water with the blood of the combatants. They observe that much of the literature on business strategy focuses on red ocean strategies, that is, outperforming rivals to secure a greater share of a static market. However, they argue that red-ocean competition erodes profits so much that the key to building a successful business is to create a blue ocean.

(Shortform note: This spirit of direct competitiveness that Kim and Mauborgne’s theories grew out of is epitomized by an article by George Stalk and Rob Lachauer published the same year as _Blue Ocean Strategy_. In it, they argue that the key to success in business is crushing the competition, and they propose five strategies for doing so: Target your competitors’ “profit sanctuaries,” the products they make the most money on. Don’t hesitate to copy a good idea if you can get away with it. Use deception to prevent your competitors from figuring out your strategy. Attack only indirectly until you’re sure you can overwhelm your adversary. And find ways to trick your competitors into operating with lower profit margins.)

### The Problem With Red Oceans

The authors contend that the red ocean mentality is based on the faulty premise of _structuralism_ : the view that the market has a fixed structure that individual companies cannot change. In a fixed market, a company can only gain market share by taking it from someone else.

By contrast, Kim and Mauborgne take a “ _reconstructionist_ ” view that markets are dynamic, demand-driven, and can often be reshaped by market players to expose new demand. If a company can create new market sectors for itself, it can profit from them without having to displace a competitor. As evidence for the reconstructionist perspective, the authors point to disruptive innovations such as the automobile and the personal computer, which created whole new markets.

Thus, **blue ocean strategy focuses on creating new demand in uncontested market spaces,** leading to profitable growth, because price competition is far less intense.

> **Disruptive Innovation and Market Reconstruction**
> 
> In _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Clayton Christiansen agrees with Kim and Mauborgne’s reconstructionist view that a disruptive innovation can shake up an industry’s very structure, and he outlines a few ways guidelines to keep in mind as you look to disrupt industry incumbents:
> 
>   * Disruptive innovations generally don’t come from your customers—if you let customer feedback drive your R&D, you’ll focus on minor improvements, and you’re more likely to be blindsided if your competitor makes a revolutionary breakthrough.
> 
>   * Incumbents usually want to build on existing products, improving them progressively, but revolutionary technologies require you to start over from basic principles rather than build on existing concepts.
> 
>   * Most established companies develop their strategies and make decisions based on market research, but you can’t do market research on a market that doesn’t exist yet. This is why incumbents often don’t see new markets developing.
> 
>   * Markets for disruptive innovations often start out too small to be relevant for big established companies, but they can grow so quickly that by the time the big company takes an interest in the new market, it’s too late for them to catch up with the startup that originated the technology.

### The Benefits of Blue Oceans

Kim and Mauborgne assert that **blue ocean strategies lead to more profitable growth.** The authors studied business launches of 108 companies. They found that incremental extensions of existing markets accounted for 86% of launches but only 39% of profits. By contrast, 14% of launches created blue oceans, and they generated 61% of profits.

They note that they don’t have data on how many of the red ocean vs. blue ocean launches failed, but they argue that this is immaterial because any companies that failed would have low (or negative) profits, and that would bring down the overall profits that they reported for that category. Thus, even accounting for failures, blue ocean strategies produced more profits.

(Shortform note: Kim and Mauborgne don’t address the fact that averages such as this are very sensitive to outliers, meaning that just a few landmark successes on the blue ocean side could mathematically offset a large number of failures. Consequently, while the statistics they cite imply _overall_ blue ocean success, the numbers might actually reflect a small number of (outsized) successes but a large number of failures as a whole. )

### Innovation Is the Key to Blue Ocean Strategy

Kim and Mauborgne argue that a blue ocean strategy starts with what they call “ _value innovation”_ —an innovation that makes your product so unique and superior to the competition (and thus more valuable to your customers) that you open up uncontested markets and leave your rivals behind. In this case, _value_ is the benefit that your customers get for their money, while _innovation_ is the uniqueness and originality of the benefit. To be effective, value and innovation are both required. By contrast:

  * **Value creation without innovation** tends to mean incremental improvements. For instance, decreasing costs and prices by 2% can create a lot of value, but it doesn’t lead to a new market space and differentiation. 
  * **Innovation without value creation** tends to create unique high-tech products that nobody wants to buy.



(Shortform note: Kim and Mauborgne coined the term “value innovation” in a 1997 article in which they explored the ideas that Blue Ocean Strategy was later based on—that companies must innovate beyond their currently defined borders in order to stay ahead of their competition. The term has been widely adopted by strategy and management experts since and is firmly associated with their theories.)

Typically, this “**blue ocean innovation” involves adding value by creating new features that buyers want, while cutting costs by reducing or eliminating features they don’t care as much about, resulting in a unique offering.** We’ll revisit this concept in Part 2, as we present tools and tactics for blue ocean innovation.

(Shortform note: In _Purple Cow_ (published two years before _Blue Ocean Strategy_), Seth Godin argues that only remarkable products are likely to succeed, because people are bombarded with advertisements for so many unremarkable things that they’ve learned to ignore them. He goes on to clarify that to be remarkable, a product must be both unique enough to stand out from the crowd, and also practical enough that people want to buy it. This is nearly the same distinction that Kim and Mauborgne make in contrasting blue ocean innovation with “value without innovation” and “innovation without value.”)

#### What Blue Ocean Innovation Isn’t

The authors clarify that blue ocean innovation is not a matter of merely raising or lowering value in order to raise or lower your costs (which will then raise or lower the price you charge your customers)**.** It’s easy to add premium features and offer a higher-value product at a higher price, or cut features to offer an economy version at a lower price, but that doesn’t require _innovation_. Instead, Kim and Mauborgne assert that **you need a breakthrough that allows you to offer _better value_ at _lower cost_**.

To illustrate how a company can successfully implement a blue ocean strategy, Kim and Mauborgne discuss the Canadian company Cirque du Soleil (“Circus of the Sun”), which created a blue ocean for itself by redefining circus entertainment. They took some of the most popular types of circus acts, such as clowns and acrobatics, and wove these acts together with elements of theater into a coherent performance with a coherent storyline. At the same time, they eliminated traditional circus features like animal acts that were less important to customers and more costly to the circus. By doing so, they demonstrated the blue ocean innovation concept of focusing on what customers want and eliminating what they don’t.

> **Why Cirque du Soleil Is Iconic of Blue Ocean Strategy**
> 
> The authors’ Cirque du Soleil case study has become particularly well known in connection with blue ocean strategy because it is such a good illustration of their concept of blue ocean innovation (or “value innovation”). By producing a show that was unlike any other, it provided _unique value_. Customers recognized this value and Cirque du Soleil quickly grew to become the global market leader of the circus industry (until they ceased operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring bankruptcy in 2020).
> 
> Furthermore, one thing that sets blue ocean strategy apart from other innovation-based business strategies is that blue ocean innovation doesn’t have to be technological innovation. Cirque du Soleil illustrates this principle because they were able to achieve a breakthrough in their industry without any new technology.
> 
> By contrast, other innovation-based strategies tend to assume that innovation produces a _technological_ breakthrough. For example, in _Crossing the Chasm_ , Geoffrey Moore presents a strategy for entering the mainstream market with an innovative product, but he assumes that that innovation is a technological breakthrough. His ideas center around how to manage technological innovations, and he doesn’t explore innovation outside of technology. In this way, Blue Ocean Strategy departs from Moore’s ideas and appeals to a wider audience.

### Two Visual Aids

Kim and Mauborgne have developed several visual tools to help you get a clear picture of your situation, your strengths and weaknesses, and your opportunities and threats. Two primary tools, upon which a blue ocean strategy is built, are a strategy chart, which helps you visualize where your product stands against others, and an action table of possible actions that help you evaluate where to apply your resources. Both of these are examined below.

#### The Blue Ocean Strategy Chart

Kim and Mauborgne present a graphic tool to help you visualize how your product (and the strategy behind it) differs from others in the market. They call this blue ocean strategy chart a “strategy canvas.” It consists of a two-dimensional line graph:

  * The horizontal axis lists the _characteristics of competition_ , that is, the attributes of your product and its alternatives that customers consider when making a buying decision. The authors emphasize that it’s important to **list only characteristics that customers actually care about.**
  * The vertical axis represents the emphasis a company places on each characteristic—a higher score indicates a company offers more of that characteristic. 



For each product, service, or company that you wish to compare, plot the value of each characteristic on the graph as a point. Then connect the points to produce a _strategy curve_.

For example:

![blueoceanstrategy_strategycanvas.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/blueoceanstrategy_strategycanvas.png)

The blue ocean strategy chart allows you to see at a glance how similar or how different your product’s offerings are. If your curve has a completely different shape from other curves, this implies a unique combination of value, consistent with blue ocean strategy.

##### Shortform Commentary: Customer Priorities on the Strategy Chart

Kim and Mauborgne emphasize that you should only include characteristics that your customers actually care about on a blue ocean strategy chart. What they don’t mention is that sometimes, customers care _more_ about certain things than others, even when they take them all into consideration. There are a couple of ways you could enhance your blue ocean strategy chart to reflect the priorities that customers put on different characteristics.

One way would be to sort the characteristics from most important to least important. As you interview customers to figure out what characteristics they care about, ask them which characteristics are more important to them than others. Once you determine how your customers prioritize different product characteristics, put the most important one at the left edge of the chart, followed by the others in order of importance from left to right. If the example chart above had been organized this way, it would show that customers care most about price and second-most about reliability, while training is the least important characteristic that they care about.

Another way would be to scale the height of each characteristic on the chart according to how important it is. In this case, the first step would be to talk to your customers and find out _how much_ they value each of the different characteristics of the product. Then, based on their answers, assign a _weight factor_ to each characteristic. The weight factor is a number that indicates how important that characteristic is. When you plot the value that a particular product provides on your chart, multiply the value by the weight factor for each characteristic. The chart below shows the original product strategy curve, the weight factors, and the resulting weighted strategy curve, to illustrate how multiplying by the weight factors visually exaggerates the characteristics that are more important to customers.

![blueoceanstrategy_canvasweight.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/blueoceanstrategy_canvasweight.png)

However, for the purpose of exploring your strategy, you would only actually plot the weighted strategy curve for each product that you want to compare. Since you multiply each product by the same weight factors, the curves still allow you to compare different products and strategies, but they would make the customers’ priorities stand out visually.

##### Revealing Red Oceans

Kim and Mauborgne note that, if the curve of your product closely follows that of another, then the two products follow the same value strategy. Similarly, if your curve is either lower or higher than the other but has the same overall shape, then one product is just a premium or budget version of the other. (In our example above, Product X is a premium version of Product Y.) Kim and Mauborgne warn that in either case, **this implies red ocean strategy, with direct competition between the products.**

> **Troubleshooting Red-Ocean Strategy Curves**
> 
> What should you do if your blue ocean strategy chart indicates your new product is a red ocean concept? According to Al Ries and Jack Trout, sometimes it’s not even necessary to change your product in order to give it unique value. As we noted, Kim and Mauborgne emphasize listing only characteristics that your customers would actually care about, not just trivial characteristics that superficially differentiate your product. However, maybe customers _would_ care about some of those differences if you showed them why they’re important.
> 
> For example, perhaps your product is just a little smaller than any of the others on the market, and that makes it easier for smaller people, such as children, to use. Until now, no one cared about this difference because you were competing for adult customers. But if you market your product as the only offering of its kind _for children_ , then suddenly it has unique value and no direct competition. In this case, you’ve created a new characteristic (child friendliness) on the blue ocean strategy chart without changing the product itself at all. (As we’ll discuss in the next section, you’ve also reached out to _potential customers_ —in this case, children.)

The blue ocean strategy chart can also show you how targeted your offering is. According to Kim and Mauborgne, **it’s very unlikely that all customers care equally about all the characteristics**. Thus, if your strategy curve is nearly flat, it implies that you’re trying to appeal equally to everyone. They warn that in this case, **your product will not be as compelling to anyone** as a more focused offering would be. In our example above, Product Z is falling into this trap.

(Shortform note: Ries and Trout likewise observe that appealing to a specific audience is crucial for successfully marketing a product, and they add the nuance that maintaining this focus can be psychologically difficult because it’s counterintuitive: To target a specific market sector, you have to give up targeting other sectors, so you’re targeting fewer customers in order to make more sales. This counterintuitiveness makes it easy to make the mistake of trying to be everything to everyone.)

#### Action Table

The second major visualization tool that Kim and Mauborgne present is an action table divided into four quadrants, representing the four ways you can differentiate your product from other offerings. You can use the table to evaluate the current state of your industry by examining four questions:

  1. Which characteristics of products in your industry could be **decreased** without affecting customer satisfaction?
  2. Which might be completely **eliminated**?
  3. Which should be **increased** in order to increase customer satisfaction? 
  4. What characteristics don’t currently exist but should? What might you **create**? 



The table for the “New Offering” shown on our blue ocean strategy chart example would be:

**Reduce** Service Life  Tech Support  | **Increase** Ease of Use  Aesthetics   
---|---  
**Eliminate** Expansion Slots  | **Create** Initial Installation Included  Training Provided   
  
(Shortform note: We have reorganized Kim and Mauborgne’s original presentation of the four quadrants. Specifically, we’ve swapped the _reduce_ and _eliminate_ quadrants. This change improves the organization of the grid because it creates stronger row relationships: The top row consists of actions that are a matter of degree (reduce or increase) while the bottom row consists of actions that are categorical (eliminate or create). As with the authors’ original arrangement, our table presents the positive actions (increase or create) in the right column, and the negative actions (reduce or eliminate) in the left column.)

According to Kim and Mauborgne, a good blue ocean strategy will typically have characteristics in all four quadrants. If you only have characteristics in one or two quadrants, you’re probably engaging in red ocean competition, rather than differentiating your product enough to create a blue ocean. However, they also point out that a good blue ocean strategy usually focuses on changing a few key characteristics, rather than spreading changes over everything that can be changed.

> **How to Pick Your Quadrants**
> 
> The four-actions framework that Kim and Mauborgne present is helpful for concisely expressing your product differentiation strategy, but it doesn’t tell you which characteristics to put in each quadrant. To decide on that, you have to understand what your customers really care about.
> 
> How do you find out what they care about? The obvious answer is to ask them, through surveys, focus groups, or their feedback on social media. However, the quality of this data is limited because most customers only discuss problems and solutions they’re currently aware of. They don’t have the vision or expertise to describe an ideal solution that they’ve never seen and tell you to build it for them. For example, imagine a letter carrier interviewing a customer in the early 1800s. The customer might say he wanted faster delivery of his letters, or more frequent pickups and deliveries to reduce turnaround time, but he probably wouldn’t ask for the ability to just pick up a handset and talk directly to the person he was writing to, because the telephone hadn’t been invented yet.
> 
> The solution to this problem comes in two steps:
> 
> First, instead of taking customer suggestions at face value, analyze them to see what _problems_ the customer is really trying to solve. By understanding your customers’ _problems and pain points_ , you can get a clearer picture of how existing options are underserving or overserving them. In our example, the customer asks for reduced turnaround time on correspondence, but his real problem is that communicating by writing letters is slow, a problem that was solved by real-time communication technologies.
> 
> Second, once you think you have a solution to your customers’ problems, put it to the test by showing it to them. This mitigates the limitations of the initial customer surveys because now they can see the new option and compare it to other existing options. This data allows you to validate the choices represented on the four-actions framework, and will also be useful for filling out a _customer experience scorecard_ , which we’ll discuss next.
