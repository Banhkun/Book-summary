## Exercise: Identify Your Defensive Barriers

Recall the five defensive barriers that protect your blue ocean from immediate competition: the legal barrier, the cognitive barrier, the organizational barrier, the image barrier, and the momentum barrier. Now think of the blue ocean offering you brainstormed in previous exercises, or think of another blue ocean offering that you are considering.

* * *

What aspects of your product could be protected by patent or copyright?

How does your offering differ from industry standards or common alternatives? How intuitive are its advantages? How fast are your competitors likely to see your productâ€™s potential?

How much would your competitors have to change their operations and brand image to emulate your offering?

How much does your product benefit from network effects and economies of scale?

Given your answers to the above questions, which of the defensive barriers do you think will be the most significant for protecting your blue ocean?
