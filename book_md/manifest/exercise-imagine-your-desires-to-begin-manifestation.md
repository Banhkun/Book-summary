## Exercise: Imagine Your Desires to Begin Manifestation

Nafousi explains that the first step for effective manifestation is creating a clear idea of what you want in life. In this exercise, you’ll use Nafousi’s process to conjure a clear image of your desire.

* * *

First, identify one desire that you want to manifest into your life—for example, a new friend. Now, list all the details you can come up with about this desire: If it’s a person, what do they look like, how do they treat you, what would you do together, and so on? If it’s an object, what does it look like, what would you use it for, what does it feel like, and so on? Write every detail that comes to mind.

Now, imagine that you’ve just received the object of your desire—how would you feel and why? (For example, your new friendship may make you feel content, rejuvenated, joyous, peaceful, excited, motivated, energetic, and so on.)

Finally, describe in detail how the version of yourself you identified in the previous step differs from your current self—what kinds of feelings do they regularly experience? How do they behave, what habits do they have, how do they view life, and so on? (For example, maybe this version of you regularly goes out for dinner with their new friend, regularly feels acceptance and joy, and views life more positively as a result.)
