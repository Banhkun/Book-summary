## Part 3: Tesla

Around the time Musk started SpaceX, an engineer named J. B. Straubel tried to improve electric car technology by using lithium ion batteries as a fuel source. He floated this idea around Silicon Valley, looking for investors. Vance explains that no one took much interest—except Musk, who funded Straubel’s work on this new battery technology.

(Shortform note: In 2017, Straubel continued his work with lithium ion batteries and founded Redwood Materials, which recycles the batteries and uses the materials to produce more.)

While Straubel worked on the battery technology, two engineers named Marc Tarpenning and Martin Eberhard worked together on a similar vision: to make electric cars a commercial enterprise, not just a science project. They also decided to build a luxury electric car, rather than a more affordable one that appealed only to environmentalists.

(Shortform note: Tesla succeeded in part because they appealed to a different group of people with a different worldview—namely, wealthy people who were interested in an environmentally friendly electric car. In _All Marketers Are Liars_ , Seth Godin explains that if you’re entering a market where someone else is already succeeding with their story, **don’t try to tell their story better**. Instead, find a different story to tell them, as Tesla did. Had Tesla tried to make an electric car that appealed to environmentalists, they would have competed with cars like the Prius, rather than creating their own section of the market.)

On July 3, 2003, Eberhard and Tarpenning incorporated Tesla Motors and started searching for venture capital. Vance explains that when Musk heard about their venture in 2004, he became Tesla’s biggest investor. He recommended that they work with Straubel, who’d been improving batteries. They all shared the vision of creating a great car and ending America’s reliance on gasoline.

> **The Tesla Team’s Just Cause**
> 
> Tesla had one hallmark of most great teams: a shared vision, or what Simon Sinek calls a Just Cause. A Just Cause is a big-picture vision that provides a framework for your corporate strategies—like Tesla’s vision of creating a car that would help end America’s reliance on gasoline, thus moving people toward a more sustainable future. In _The Infinite Game_ , Sinek outlines five elements of an effective Just Cause:
> 
>   * It stands _for_ something, not _against_ something. While Tesla can frame their Just Cause as being _against_ gasoline, they are also _for_ sustainable energy.
> 
>   * It’s idealistic, bold, and ultimately unachievable. Tesla’s goal required them to change the automotive industry.
> 
>   * It’s inclusive, inspiring others to join the cause. Tesla needs consumers’ support to drive the car to encourage sustainability.
> 
>   * It’s resilient and can endure technological, cultural, political, and industry changes.
> 
>   * It’s service-oriented, aiming to benefit others. Tesla wants humanity to benefit from finding a more sustainable resource than gasoline.
> 
> 


### Building the First Model

To build the initial car, the Tesla team used a luxury English car as the base. They replaced the engine with the battery pack, and within six months, they had a drivable electric car. In January 2005, Musk drove the car, was pleased by their progress, and kept investing.

But the engineers soon faced a problem: The batteries were incredibly flammable. They’d hoped to make a car _less_ dangerous than gas cars, not more. Vance describes how a small team of engineers worked solely on researching the batteries, and they found ways to arrange the batteries so that fires wouldn’t spread among the batteries.

(Shortform note: While Tesla addressed the high flammability risk, the company still has occasional reports of batteries catching fire, which are difficult to extinguish. But the US federal government’s top auto-safety regulator decided not to open a formal investigation of the flammable batteries, deeming the issue rare enough not to be a concern.)

Next, Musk and the other investors wanted to improve the design of the car. While using the base of another car had been sufficient for the initial engineering tests, the completed model needed to be unique. For the next year, they focused on the car design, eliminating bumps in the body and creating a longer body to accommodate the batteries.

By May 2006, they’d completed a prototype of the car, which they called the Roadster. While the car still had a few engineering flaws, the investors were excited about the new model. Vance notes that Tesla debuted the cars and priced this model at $90,000. Venture capitalists and celebrities paid $100,000 each to put their names on waiting lists for the cars. Musk promised that a cheaper model—at $50,000—would be released in three years.

(Shortform note: In a 2016 interview, Musk admitted that the original plan for the Roadster wasn’t a good one and that he only gave Tesla a 10% chance of survival. In 2011, Tesla announced it would discontinue production of the Roadster. But in 2017, Tesla revealed plans for a second generation Roadster—for $250,000—that was set to debut in 2020, but it was pushed back to 2021 and again to 2022. Tesla noted that the new Roadster will have a range of up to 620 miles, a top speed of 250 mph, and a battery pack twice the size of its others. Some experts believe Tesla may delay the Roadster again to focus on production of its other models.)

### Increased Media Attention

After the event, Tesla attracted more widespread attention than Musk himself. In a _New York Times_ article about Tesla, Musk was not listed as a founder. Vance explains that while the article was good publicity for Tesla, Musk was angry that he wasn’t mentioned at all in the piece.

But soon, Musk received more publicity. In 2007, filming for the first _Iron Man_ movie started. As insight into his role, actor Robert Downey Jr. met with Musk and toured the SpaceX facility. The filmmakers included a Tesla in the movie, and Musk made a cameo in one scene. Vance explains that when _Iron Man_ was released, people exaggerated the similarities between Musk and Tony Stark. Musk received more attention from the press after this, and he became a public figure.

Musk enjoyed some aspects of his new celebrity status, such as hanging out with other celebrities and being invited to exclusive events. Vance notes that Justine also enjoyed their celebrity status, and she blogged about their experiences, which gave people a more intimate look into their life.

But the press also brought new scrutiny to his companies. Over the years, the press would often mock and scrutinize Musk and his business decisions. Whenever SpaceX and Tesla missed deadlines, the press were harsh and predicted that the companies would fail. Musk told Vance that the press sometimes caused him to question what he was doing and if his companies were headed for failure. With so much public doubt, Musk faced more pressure to succeed.

> **Billionaires’ Changing Relationship With the Media**
> 
> Musk has a love-hate relationship with the media attention he receives. On one hand, he seems to thrive in his celebrity status by going to Met Gala events and posting headline-worthy Twitter threads. And Tesla even cited media attention as one reason for its good sales.
> 
> Yet Musk has also criticized the media for portraying him in a negative light, scrutinizing his businesses, and predicting his companies’ failure. His criticism highlights the complicated relationship between high-profile billionaires and media outlets, and he has threatened to create his own site that would rate journalists and editors.
> 
> Musk has a cult-like following, with over 78 million Twitter followers, and his widely publicized opinions have real-world consequences, influencing everything from Dogecoin to GameStop’s stock prices. In April 2022, Musk demonstrated how much he values Twitter as a means of communication by buying a 9.2% stake in the social media company—making him the app’s largest shareholder—and joining its 11-person board. He expressed interest in making “significant improvements” to Twitter, which may relate to his belief that the app is too heavily regulated.
> 
> Musk isn’t the only one rethinking his relationship with the media, pointing to the growing trend of billionaires buying news outlets. For example, Jeff Bezos bought _The Washington Post_ , Morningstar CEO Joe Mansueto purchased _Inc. and Fast Company_ , casino magnate Sheldon Adelson bought _The Las Vegas Review-Journal_.
> 
> While some reports note that these billionaires brought much-needed financial resources to struggling news outlets and have remained relatively removed from editorial decisions, experts are skeptical of why so many billionaires are making this investment.
> 
> Like Musk, they may be concerned about what they view as unfair representations of themselves, their companies, or political discourse, causing concern that there may be a less democratic and more oligarchical media ownership than the current one.

### Manufacturing Delays

Having debuted the first model, the Tesla team worked to improve safety features and complete performance tests so they could send out cars to everyone who’d paid to be on the waiting list. But they kept delaying the production of the Roadster, largely because of changes Musk wanted. Vance explains that he insisted that the car be more comfortable, and he wanted new technology for the door handles and material of the car body. The Tesla engineers grudgingly agreed to his requests.

But then production slowed dramatically due to two issues: the transmission and the overseas manufacturing. Vance explains that Tesla wanted a quick, smooth transmission system, so they hired other companies to build one for them. However, when Tesla ran tests on the transmission, they found 14 separate issues that could severely damage the car.

Second, Tesla planned to manufacture car parts overseas, shipping battery parts from China to Thailand and sending body panels from France to England to Los Angeles.

While Tesla thought they’d cut costs by manufacturing cheaply overseas, they were actually losing time and money with this strategy. When Musk heard about these manufacturing issues, he sent an operations expert to investigate the issues.

Around the middle of 2007, the expert returned with his report on Tesla’s spending and production process. Musk realized the severity of the situation. Vance notes that the team didn’t use their financial software, so Tesla’s spending and budget were incorrect. Tesla also reported that each car would cost about $68,000 to make. But the actual production cost was about $200,000. He believed that Eberhard had mismanaged Tesla and failed to tell the board about the financial situation. Musk told Eberhard that he would be demoted from CEO. The board found another CEO and made Eberhard an advisor. He stayed for another few months before leaving Tesla in December 2007.

Under its new leadership, Tesla addressed many of the manufacturing issues it had, such as the car’s transmission problems, which needed a complete overhaul. Vance explains that Musk began to take a more active role in Tesla’s operations. He also began making more public statements, trying to ease buyers’ minds about the production delays and changes in management. He also announced plans for a new model.

> **Improving Tesla’s Entrepreneurial Operating System**
> 
> Tesla’s manufacturing delays highlighted important issues that needed to be fixed to ensure a smooth _Entrepreneurial Operating System: the six key components of a successful business_. In _Traction_ , Gino Wickman breaks down these six elements of any organization:
> 
> 1) **Vision** : You need a compelling vision for your business that you communicate clearly so everyone can focus their energy on it and help you achieve it. While Tesla team members disagreed on some details, they agreed on their overall vision of revitalizing the EV industry with a luxury electric car.
> 
> 2) **People** : You need to have the right people in the right positions. People who are wrong for your company, or are in the wrong positions, hurt your business. After evaluating Tesla’s situation and management, Musk decided that Eberhard was in the wrong position as CEO, thus hurting the business.
> 
> 3) **Data** : By creating a weekly report on a few key numbers, you can regularly check the vital signs of your business, quickly see and solve problems, and predict the future—without waiting for financial statements. Musk had a professional collect and analyze Tesla’s data, especially since the team wasn’t using their financial software.
> 
> 4) **Issues** : You need to systematically identify and address issues before they undermine your business. To do this, maintain and regularly review an issues list. When you take the time to solve a problem, you’ll save up to 10 times that amount of time dealing with the problem or its consequences later. Musk reviewed issues in Tesla’s management and production and was able to address these issues before they crippled the company.
> 
> 5) **Process** : Your processes are the way you do business. You need to identify, address, and document each of your core processes, and continually improve them. Many entrepreneurs don’t fully appreciate the value of having the right processes—however, sound processes create efficiency and make your business scalable and more profitable. Musk did this with the production process, since the overseas manufacturing system was too expensive for Tesla and didn’t result in a better product.
> 
> 6) **Traction** : Traction—the ability to execute, or make the company’s vision a reality—requires two things: 1) 90-day priorities for everyone, and 2) regular, focused, productive meetings at every level. While Vance doesn’t describe what kind of changes Musk made to improve communication, his more active role in Tesla’s operations eventually helped make Tesla’s vision a reality.

### Financial Problems

In October 2008, Musk became CEO of Tesla. By this point, Tesla struggled to stay in business. The company was running out of money: The first model cost $140 million to develop, when it was originally estimated to cost $25 million. Vance explains that the company also faced a few other obstacles:

1) Consumers didn’t believe in the future of electric cars yet. (Shortform note: Over 10 years later, consumers still express concerns about electric vehicles, citing their mileage range, high initial cost, battery flammability, performance, and lack of charging infrastructure. These will be challenges the electric car industry will need to overcome to succeed.)

2) Short sellers altered the price of Tesla’s stock, causing the value to fluctuate. (Shortform note: Despite Tesla’s success, as of 2021, it was the most shorted stock in the market and has been for several years.)

3) Due to the 2008 recession, many consumers weren’t buying cars. (Shortform note: In 2008, consumers bought 3 million fewer cars than the previous year.)

Tesla was spending $4 million a month and needed more funding to survive. Musk began asking friends, family, and investors for money, and Tesla employees invested what little money they had. Many people never expected to see this money again.

In December 2008, Musk took out a loan from SpaceX—which had just received their contract from NASA—and asked Tesla investors for more money. Vance explains that Tesla was hours away from bankruptcy when the deal went through, saving the company.

> **Three Funding Issues Start-Ups Face**
> 
> While Musk eventually solved his money problem with the loan from SpaceX and some outside investments, financing is a common problem for start-ups, and many of the 90% of failed start-ups cite cash-flow problems as a reason for going out of business. Experts advise that to prevent funding issues, follow these three tips:
> 
> **Don’t ignore scalability** : When looking for funding, many founders don’t clearly communicate how they will grow their business. Show investors and financial institutions a plan for how you’ll use the money they loan or invest in your company. This was an issue for Musk, since he had inherited what he viewed as a mismanaged financial situation from Eberhard.
> 
> **Don’t neglect personal relationships** : When networking with potential investors or banks, make a personal connection—don’t just try to secure funding. Even if they do provide financial support, you’ll be working with them, so foster a good relationship.
> 
> **Know how funding works** : There are several ways to fund your business: venture capital, loans, angel investors, and so on. Research different options and determine what’s best for your company. Musk resisted going public with his companies to retain control, but this meant he needed to find other ways of securing funding.

### Road to Success

By 2010, Tesla’s fortunes turned a corner. The US Department of Energy (DOE) struck a deal with the company, loaning them $465 million. Tesla used some of this money to buy a factory to manufacture their cars, hoping to send out Model S cars to consumers. A few months later, Tesla went public, raising $226 million.

Then, after Tesla started shipping out the Model S in 2012, the public perception of electric vehicles gradually started to shift, warming to the idea of electric cars. Tesla had addressed manufacturing issues and common complaints about the car.

Vance explains that Tesla’s salespeople sold enough cars in the span of a few weeks to make a large profit, ending their first quarter as a public company with $562 million in sales. Tesla’s stock prices rose, and they paid off their loan to the DOE early.

By 2013, Tesla’s Model S received the highest _Consumer Reports_ car rating in history—a 99 out of 100—and won awards in the car industry, baffling competitors and naysayers.

Later that year, Musk announced plans for a free charging network, meaning consumers would no longer have to pay to fuel their car. His plan was to generate more excitement around electric cars and encourage consumers to transition from gasoline to electric cars. He later revealed that for the price of a tank of gas, customers had the option to replace the batteries in their car for a quicker recharge.

(Shortform note: Tesla is an example of Gary Keller’s idea of sequential success, where you accumulate small wins one after the other, like a domino fall, rather than all at once. In _The One Thing_ , Keller explains that success builds on success sequentially, as you move from one important task to another, until you reach the highest level possible. Over the course of a few years, Tesla accumulated small wins—such as addressing the manufacturing issues, selling enough cars to make a profit, receiving high ratings, and announcing the new charging network—instead of one big win that made the company an instant success. While one win probably wouldn’t have ensured Tesla’s survival, its accumulated sequential success did.)

> **Alternative Perspective: The Government’s Role in Tesla’s Success**
> 
> Tesla’s survival—and success—largely relied on going public and on taking advantage of the timing of new loans from the DOE. In _A Promised Land_ , former president Barack Obama describes the thought process behind setting up these loans, as he recognized that tackling climate change was crucial. His administration was the first to put in place a White House team to seriously address climate change.
> 
> Like Musk, the Obama administration saw that U.S. public policy was massively tilted toward fossil-fuel interests, with special tax breaks for oil companies, public highway subsidies, and government-funded oil pipelines and ports all contributing to America’s disproportionate share of global emissions.
> 
> Early on, the Obama administration tried to reverse this policy course by embedding $90 billion in clean energy investments into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the “stimulus bill”). Among other things, these investments planted the seeds of what would become a green energy revolution throughout the 2010s, providing funding for wind turbines, clean-energy battery storage systems, and the retrofitting of existing buildings to make them more energy efficient. The stimulus also provided loans to clean-energy technology companies, such as Tesla. These loans were crucial to the success of companies like Tesla.

### Improved Design Features

In the years after this incident, enough consumers bought the first car to keep the company afloat. During that time, Tesla worked on a new car model—the Model S—and refined its manufacturing. Vance explains that Musk wanted to perfect the car, not just create a functional electric car. The team improved the design of the car’s body and reduced the weight of the car by making it out of aluminum.

They also added extra features that would enhance Model S. For example, Musk had Tesla’s cars equipped with a touch-screen display, which had never been done in a car before. Although these caused more delays on the production of the car, many of these features are now trademarks of Tesla’s cars.

Vance notes that Tesla introduced other features to change the way cars are manufactured, serviced, and sold. Notably, he enabled overnight software upgrades and regenerative braking, which extends the life of brake pads and thus decreases the maintenance needed for the car (instead of brake pads slowing the rotation of the tires, regenerative braking reverses the motor, thus slowing the vehicle down). Customers appreciated these changes, and Tesla’s reputation for quality increased.

> **Tesla’s Design Features Were One of Seven Important Keys to Success**
> 
> While Vance notes that the perfected car was a major part of Tesla’s success, Peter Thiel situates how the design features fit into Musk’s overall plan and approach toward Tesla. In _Zero to One_ (which happens to be one of Musk’s favorite books), Thiel explains that Tesla is one of the few cleantech companies that lasted because it had good answers to Thiel’s seven entrepreneurial questions:
> 
> **Technology** : What made Tesla really stand out was its ability to integrate many components—like the aluminum body, touch screen, software upgrades, and regenerative braking—into one great product, the (2013) Tesla Model S sedan.
> 
> **Timing** : Musk seized the opportunity to secure a half-billion-dollar loan from the government in the small window before the government pulled the plug on cleantech subsidies.
> 
> **Monopoly** : Tesla started with a tiny submarket it could dominate: high-end electric sports cars. It then moved into the luxury electric sedan market and is positioned to continue expanding into broader markets.
> 
> **Team** : Musk assembled a team good at both engineering and sales.
> 
> **Distribution** : Tesla decided to own the distribution chain. It sells and services its cars in its own stores. The cost is higher than for traditional dealership distribution, but the approach gives it control over the customer experience, strengthens its brand, and saves money in the long run.
> 
> **Durability** : By getting a head start, moving faster than anyone else, and establishing a strong brand, Tesla is set to extend its lead in the future.
> 
> **Secrets** : Tesla realized that while rich people wanted to look green by buying an electric car, they'd rather look green and cool at the same time—if he gave them the opportunity, they’d choose his sleek car over the boxy Prius. Tesla created a product based on the secret that cleantech was in large part a social phenomenon.
