## Exercise: Determine Your Own Unique Traits

Musk used his unique traits to his advantage as he built his businesses. This exercise will explore your own traits and how you can use them in your own career.

* * *

Consider your natural talents or personality traits. What things do you naturally do well? Perhaps you’re an avid reader or a good listener. (Remember that something other people may not view as a talent might secretly be a strength—Musk was bullied in school for his natural desire to read and learn, but this skill proved useful in learning about complex topics like rocket science.)

What do your friends, family, or coworkers compliment you on? Maybe they appreciate your ability to encourage others or your strong writing skills.

Consider how you can use those traits to your advantage in your career. Perhaps you can use your listening skills to get employee feedback and make your workplace better. Or maybe you could take on a new project to use your writing skills.
