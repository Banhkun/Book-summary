## Exercise: Pay Better Attention by Managing Your Screen Time

The authors write that one way to improve your relationships is to pay better attention to them and suggest that one way to do this is by managing your screen time. Evaluate how your screen time is affecting your relationships, and create a plan to minimize any damage.

How much time do you spend on screens each day? Write down a rough estimate.

Break down your screen time by activity. For example, you might spend lots of time video-chatting your best friend or spend a lot of time scrolling through TikTok.

How do you think your activities help or harm your relationships? Recall that Waldinger and Schulz highlight the importance of paying attention in conversations, and think about unexpected ways your screen use might harm this ability. For example, if you spend a lot of time scrolling through true crime media while waiting to pick your kids up, your brain might be preoccupied with anxious thoughts when your kids are trying to tell you about their day.

List three specific ways you can mitigate the potential harm that your screen time does. Recall that Waldinger and Schulz recommend taking regular breaks from your devices and talking to people on social media rather than just scrolling through their posts.
