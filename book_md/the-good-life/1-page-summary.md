## 1-Page Summary

What’s the secret to having a good life?

Many of us believe that our happiness depends on how successful we are in our careers. But in _The Good Life_ (2023), psychiatrist Robert Waldinger and psychologist Marc Schulz argue that the **key to a good life is to cultivate good relationships**. They draw this conclusion from years of directing the Harvard Study of Adult Development. (Waldinger is the study’s current director, while Schulz is the study’s co-director.)

The Harvard Study is the world’s longest-running longitudinal research study on how adults develop. The study originated in 1938, when two independent groups of researchers who wanted to know what makes people successful recruited two groups of study participants: 268 male students at Harvard College and 456 boys from inner-city Boston. Over the years, the study expanded greatly in scope and now includes over 2,000 people—including the spouses and descendants of the original participants.

The Harvard Study is unique not just for its length and scope but also its methodology. Unlike most longitudinal studies, which ask participants to remember what happened in their lives and so are susceptible to the fallibility of memory, the Harvard Study learns about the participants’ lives _as they are now_. The research team does so by sending participants detailed questionnaires every two years, reviewing health records every five years, and interviewing participants in person every 15 years.

As a result, the Harvard Study has a rich trove of data that led Waldinger and Schulz to conclude that relationships are essential to a good life. This conclusion is supported by several other studies that include more diverse groups of people.

(Shortform note: Some question whether the Harvard Study of Adult Development is still important after it’s clearly demonstrated the importance of relationships. As the study directors point out, many long-term studies stop because they lose their funding. The Harvard Study has dodged this fate in part because it's largely funded by the federal government. But being funded by the government means that scholars must __ justify _why_ it should continue every five years—and this can be difficult, especially since the study still includes only white people. But the study directors maintain that it’s important and will provide insights on areas such as what incentivizes community engagement.)

In this guide, we’ll first define what a good life is and how to evaluate the current quality of your relationships. Then, we’ll explain how you can improve your relationships in general before diving into the authors’ advice for improving specific types of relationships— those with your spouse, family, coworkers, and friends. Along the way, we’ll share what other authors and psychologists have to say about Waldinger and Schulz’s findings**.**

### Understanding the Good Life

Knowing that relationships help you achieve a good life isn’t helpful unless you understand what a good life is. In this section, we’ll explore what constitutes a good life, how it helps us, and why we’re so bad at doing what’s necessary to live it.

Waldinger and Schulz argue that **a good life consists of what Greek philosopher Aristotle called _eudaimonia_ and what scholars today call “eudaimonic happiness.**” Eudaimonia represents a sort of flourishing, and it’s neither a temporary state of being nor a goal you can achieve. Rather, eudaimonia is a long-term sense of contentment or purpose—the concept you’re referring to when you say, “I’m happy with my life.”

Waldinger and Schulz specify that this good life—this eudaimonic happiness—depends mostly on the _quality_(not the quantity) of your relationships and how often you interact with others. In other words, having many friends won’t improve your life if they’re all toxic. Positive relationships contribute to your happiness because they improve your health; these relationships act as a buffer to life’s many health-reducing stressors (such as old age).

(Shortform note: Relationships that aren’t high-quality don’t buffer you against stressors; they may do the opposite—even if you have many of them. One study found an association between people who had many “ambivalent” relationships—relationships that included both good and bad interchanges—and shorter telomeres (the ends of chromosomes), which is thought to be a key sign of aging.)

(Shortform note: Unlike Waldinger and Schulz, Aristotle didn’t consider relationships a necessary component of eudaimonia. In _Nicomachean Ethics_ ,__ Aristotle defines eudaimonia as rational activity aligned with virtue. In other words, eudaimonia (or happiness) stems from regularly making and acting upon morally virtuous choices throughout your life. Similarly, while many modern psychologists agree that relationships are important for eudaimonic happiness, they propose several other ways to reach it that don’t involve relationships, such as writing down or reaching important goals.)

**Positive relationships also help prevent loneliness,** the feeling you get when you have less social interaction than you desire. Waldinger and Schulz cite several surveys that indicate that people worldwide are increasingly lonely and that this loneliness negatively affects our mental and physical health. The authors suggest that loneliness is bad for us because it triggers a stress response from our evolutionary history: Back when we relied on tribal communities for survival, being left alone often meant death—loneliness kickstarted a stress response that helped us survive even without our tribe. But in the modern world, many people are chronically lonely and so under constant stress, which harms our mental and physical health.

> **Loneliness Versus Social Isolation**
> 
> A 2023 meta-analysis of 90 studies (published the year after _The Good Life_) confirmed that both loneliness (the subjective feeling of not having enough social connections) and social isolation (the objective reality of lacking social connections) negatively impact physical and mental health. This finding mattered because previous studies that drew a link between loneliness and negative health effects drew criticism, in part due to the studies’ limited scope.
> 
> Like Waldinger and Schulz, this analysis suggests that loneliness is harmful because it’s a chronic stressor. However, it found that social isolation harms you more than loneliness does.__ One of the review’s authors proposes that this is because social isolation is more stress-inducing than loneliness. People who feel lonely but who have access to social connections are better able to handle the stress of loneliness because of the relationships they have. This theory supports Waldinger and Schulz’s argument that loneliness is bad for us because it used to be a death sentence: Feeling lonely is a warning sign to monitor our social isolation and make sure we haven’t been left behind to fend for ourselves.

#### We Don’t Prioritize Relationships

Waldinger and Schulz assert that many people struggle to prioritize positive relationships—despite their clear importance—for two related reasons. First, cultures worldwide often teach that financial success will guarantee happiness. As a result, **we prioritize money over relationships**. However, the idea that financial success guarantees happiness is mostly a myth. The authors acknowledge that if you don’t have enough money to cover fundamental expenses, such as food, then making more money increases your happiness. But once you make enough money to cover those fundamentals, making more money won’t make you happier.

> **How Money Impacts Happiness**
> 
> Unlike Waldinger and Schulz, Morgan Housel suggests in _The Psychology of Money_ that you may care about money in part because of how it impacts your relationships. Specifically, you may want money so you can buy status symbols because you think this will buy you respect. However, Housel argues that this is a mistake: You might _think_ that people admiring your possessions indicates that they admire you, but in reality, these people are imagining how much people would admire _them_ if they owned the same things.
> 
> Like Waldinger and Schulz, Housel warns against constantly trying to make more money in pursuit of happiness. This is a losing game: Unless you’re the richest person in the world, someone will always have more money than you—so if you’re always comparing yourself to someone richer, you’ll never be satisfied. Moreover, constantly trying to make more can lead to you losing everything if you risk the money you have and need to make even _more_ money that you don’t need. So figure out how much money will allow you to live your desired lifestyle (even if that’s slightly more than what covers your fundamental expenses), then stop chasing a more lavish lifestyle.

Second, **people struggle to prioritize relationships because we’re bad at “affective forecasting** ”—anticipating our emotional reactions to various events. Waldinger and Schulz explain that humans are biologically programmed to prioritize whatever provides the most obvious benefit—and often, the benefits of relationships are less obvious. Moreover, when making decisions, we tend to focus more on what might go _wrong_ than what might go _right_. As a result, we often prioritize whatever will make us more money (which is obviously beneficial) rather than relationships (which might go terribly wrong and ruin our lives).

(Shortform note: There may be additional reasons we tend to prioritize our careers over our relationships. Experts point out that we’re not just bad at anticipating our emotional reactions to events; we’re also bad at predicting how long we’ll feel those reactions. So you might chase a promotion because you think it’ll make you happy for a long time, when in reality, that boost is short-lived. Alternatively, Clayton Christensen suggests in _How Will You Measure Your Life?_ that we may prioritize our careers over our relationships because our loved ones are less demanding than our boss. Thus, we pay less attention to our loved ones—and we risk not noticing that our relationships are going poorly until it’s too late to fix them.)

### Know Where You Are in Life

Now that we’ve discussed why relationships are central to happiness, we’ll share Waldinger and Schulz’s advice on understanding where you stand. In this section, we’ll explore two frameworks for understanding your current relationships. First, we’ll describe the life stages we all experience so you can better understand what you and others in your life might be going through. Then, we’ll share how to evaluate the current state of your relationships.

#### Understanding the Life Stages

Waldinger and Schulz divide **human life into four main stages: adolescence, young adulthood, midlife, and late life**. They argue that understanding these stages will help you better understand the challenges you’re facing in your life and be more empathetic to people in different life stages.

Waldinger and Schulz explain that adolescence occurs between the ages of 12 and 19 and is characterized by a struggle to establish one’s identity. Adolescents benefit greatly from having supportive adults in their lives, as these adults serve as exemplars of different lives one might live. However, adolescents themselves tend to prioritize relationships with their peers as they navigate friendships and start to have intimate, romantic relationships.

(Shortform note: Psychologist Erik Erikson also proposes that adolescence (12-18) is characterized by a struggle to establish one’s identity. Erikson suggests that this struggle manifests in two main areas: sexual relationships and occupational concerns (such as what they want to do with their lives). If an adolescent successfully overcomes this struggle, she will develop what Erikson calls “fidelity”—the ability to feel like herself while still conforming to societal expectations. Parents can contribute to this process by not comparing teens to other people. Additionally, set boundaries without attacking your kid; for example, don’t criticize their friends, as your child will interpret these criticisms as a personal attack.)

After adolescence comes young adulthood, which tends to occur between the ages of 20 and 40. Waldinger and Schulz write that young adults tend to experience a lot of stress as they struggle to find their footing in their careers and possibly create new families. Young adults need to be careful not to overwork themselves and neglect other people in their lives, such as their friends or their parents.

Midlife usually occurs between the ages of 41 and 65. Waldinger and Schulz assert that midlife can _seem_ stable to the point of being boring, as people in midlife usually have established careers and families. But **people in midlife are often plagued by the thought that they haven’t done enough with their lives** —even though their lives are half over. Getting beyond this concern requires that people in midlife reach the “generativity” stage, which is characterized by a focus on making a positive impact on _others_ rather than a focus on improving one’s own life.

(Shortform note: Erikson defines generativity slightly differently, arguing that it’s a desire to leave a legacy, and he points out that most people achieve it through parenthood—though you can also achieve it through other means. Erikson adds that if you are successful in your quest for generativity, you’ll develop “care,” the sense that you matter to others.)

Finally, late life usually begins after the age of 66. Waldinger and Schulz explain that people in this stage are often preoccupied with how well they’ve lived, how well they can live the remainder of their lives, and the legacy they’ll leave. People in this stage tend to be happy, as they’ve gained the perspective necessary to prioritize what matters and ignore small stressors that don’t. But they must make an effort to maintain relationships that may naturally dissipate as they stop doing certain activities like working. They must also learn to accept any help they may need.

(Shortform note: In _Being Mortal_ , Atul Gawande suggests that older people don’t accept help due to the _type_ of help provided. He explains that older people tend to focus on what will make them happy in the present, but the people caring for them have a future-oriented outlook. As a result, caregivers may support medical interventions that extend the elderly person’s life or suggest that she create new relationships to replace those that naturally dissipate, even though she would prefer interventions that improve how well she feels in the present and wants to prioritize her oldest, deepest connections instead.)

> **Daniel Levinson’s Stages of Adult Life**
> 
> Like Waldinger and Schulz, psychologist Daniel Levinson divided human life into four main stages. But his stages consisted of 1) childhood and adolescence, 2) early adulthood, 3) middle adulthood, and 4) late adulthood, and they are primarily directed toward the stages of men’s lives.
> 
> According to Levinson’s theory, the first important stage is early adulthood, which generally occurs between 17 and 45. This stage features two important transitions: the early adult transition period (17-22), during which you first leave your family and set out on your own, and the age 30 transition (28-33), during which you evaluate your current state to determine whether you’ve made the right choices or need to pivot. In this stage, Levinson highlights the importance of having a mentor—someone who can help you achieve your life goals—rather than the importance of not working too much or neglecting your other relationships.
> 
> Middle adulthood begins around 40 and lasts until around 60. During this stage, the realization of your mortality sparks a midlife transition (40-45), during which you question your current career and relationships and may upend them in search of greater meaning. Finally, late adulthood begins at 60 and kicks off a period of trying to accomplish any goals you haven’t reached yet and leave an impactful legacy.

#### Evaluate Your Relationships

Now that we’ve shared how the life stage you’re in affects your relationships, we’ll discuss Waldinger and Schulz’s methodology for evaluating your “social fitness”—the current health of your relationships. The authors argue that **understanding how often you see people _now_ and how those people add to or subtract from your life will motivate you** to make any necessary changes to your social life.

Waldinger and Schulz recommend that you begin by listing the people who make up your social circle. This likely will include people you love, such as your friends and family, even if you don’t see them as often as you’d like. But it will also likely include people you see regularly but aren’t particularly close to—such as the bartender at your local pub—or even people you actively dislike—such as that in-law you can’t stand.

Next, Waldinger and Schulz suggest that you review both how _often_ you see each person in your life and how each one makes you feel. Does being in this person’s company refresh and uplift you, or does it drain and depress you? If it’s the latter, is there any particular reason why, and is there something you can do about it? Are you happy with how often you see each person, or would you like to see more or less of them?

Third, Waldinger and Schulz suggest that you review the specific benefits you receive from each relationship. Some people provide love and sex, while others provide assistance when you’re struggling—such as when you don’t know what job to take. Some people help you feel safe, while others push you outside your comfort zone. There are some people you can talk about anything with and others you can rely on because they’re so familiar to you. Keep in mind that some people will provide multiple benefits, but several of them won’t provide _all_ of them.

> **Other Methods for Evaluating Your Social Fitness**
> 
> Other experts agree that evaluating your social fitness is important, explaining that you can only improve your relationships when you have a better understanding of their current state. Like Waldinger and Schulz, they suggest reviewing how often you see each person in your life and how each person makes you feel to ensure that most of your relationships provide you with some support (and that you reciprocate). Additionally, they point out the importance of having relationships that provide varying levels of emotional intimacy and assistance.
> 
> Unlike Waldinger and Schulz, these experts suggest that you also review how many of the people in your life know each other to determine how well-integrated your connections are. The experts highlight the importance of having people in your life who will tell you the truth no matter what. And they propose that you evaluate whether you have positive relationships with six different types of people: family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances, professionals (like your lawyer or accountant), and people in your community (like your volunteer group). If your social group includes all these elements, you have a network that can help you achieve your fullest potential.

### How to Improve Your Relationships in General

Now that we’ve shared Waldinger and Schulz’s tips for understanding the current health of your relationships, we’ll discuss their tips for improvement. In this section, we’ll share two things you can do to improve any relationship: Pay better attention and replace bad habits.

#### Pay Better Attention

Waldinger and Schulz assert that **paying better attention to your relationships** can help you improve them. In the modern world, our brains have grown accustomed to constant distraction from our devices. As a result, we struggle to maintain our focus on a single thing—including whoever we’re spending time with. This lack of engagement hampers our ability to connect with others.

So how can you pay better attention to the people you’re with? Waldinger and Schulz recommend that you improve your ability to be present in general (and therefore, present with others) by **practicing mindfulness.** To do so, make it a point in your daily life to spend some time _noticing_ things that haven’t captured your attention before in places you frequent—perhaps the breeze in your office.

Waldinger and Schulz add that you can apply this practice in your relationships: When speaking with someone, **ask yourself what you might _not_ be noticing **and use that gap to guide your conversation. For example, if a friend is unusually upset about your tardiness, probe a bit deeper—perhaps your chronic lateness is getting on their nerves, or they’re upset because they fought with their mother. Studies indicate that the act of intentionally trying to empathize and connect with others can improve your relationship.

> **How Mindfulness Improves Focus and Relationships**
> 
> In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey elaborates on how mindfulness improves your ability to focus. Whenever you do a task (like holding a conversation), it occupies part of your working memory, which holds information your mind is actively processing. You have a limited _working memory capacity_ , so if you try to focus on too many things at once, you’ll exceed it and lose focus. But practicing mindfulness increases your working memory capacity. This allows you to focus on more complex tasks (like a conversation). Plus, researchers have found that the greater your working memory capacity, the less prone you are to distraction.
> 
> In _Where You Go, There You Are_ , Jon Kabat-Zinn provides further tips on how to practice mindfulness and so improve how present you are in your daily life. Kabat-Zinn recommends that when you practice noticing your environment, you use your breath as your focal point. Pay attention to what it feels like to have your breath move in and out of your body.
> 
> Similarly, other experts suggest adding a moment of mindfulness when you’re practicing active listening. This technique involves repeating what the other person said to ensure that you've understood it correctly before you respond to their comments—but instead of jumping straight to the repeating portion, take a moment to be mindful and consider the**** emotions that may be driving the other person's comments before you respond.

Additionally, Waldinger and Schulz suggest that you **minimize the potential damage of your screen use.** When using social media, prioritize communicating over browsing; the latter can make you feel worse about your own life because you’re comparing your reality to the highlights that others post online. If you notice that your screen time negatively affects your mood, decrease the time you spend on your devices. Ask the people closest to you whether your screen time bothers them; if so, reevaluate it. Finally, create pockets of time when you don’t check your devices at all so you can focus fully on those who matter most and also evaluate how _you_ feel when you take a break from screens.

> **Why Screens Are So Addicting—And How to Stop Using Them**
> 
> One of the biggest contributors to screen time is social media use. In _Dopamine Detox_ , Thibaut Meurisse explains why we spend so much time on social media even when it makes us feel worse about ourselves. As you scroll through social media, the anticipation of receiving likes and other forms of social validation activates the reward centers in your brain, releasing dopamine—the neurotransmitter released in anticipation of pleasurable activity. When you receive positive feedback, your brain associates the experience with pleasure and reinforces your desire to seek out more of it. This creates a cycle of reward-seeking behavior that can become addictive and prevent you from focusing on more important tasks or people.
> 
> To break this addictive cycle and access screens in a way that you feel good about, Meurisse recommends that you engage in a so-called dopamine detox. Try a total detox, during which you eliminate all dopamine-inducing behaviors—such as accessing the internet or eating sugar—for 24 to 48 hours and fill your time with low-stimulation activities such as journaling. Alternatively, try a limited detox, which involves eliminating your most significant source of dopamine for an extended period of time. Meurisse recommends that _you_ decide what to cut out; however, you could choose to cut out whatever bothers your family or friends the most.

#### Replace Bad Habits

Waldinger and Schulz say that you can also improve your relationships by **replacing bad relationship habits.** They explain that most of us have bad relationship habits; namely, we default to a particular pattern of behavior, or “coping style,” whenever we feel strain. Unfortunately, these defaults can harm us and our relationships; for example, the authors’ research suggests that if you tend to distance yourself from your problems, you won’t be as happy as someone who confronts their problems.

The default pattern, or habit, that you fall into may seem immutable and out of your control. But Waldinger and Schulz explain that in reality, how you handle a particular situation involves a clear process over which you have some control. Whenever you face an external _stressor_ , you _feel_ some way about it and so you respond with a _reaction._ For example, if your partner is late for your date (stressor), you may _feel_ neglected and _react_ coldly when they finally arrive. This process occurs so quickly that it feels automatic—but if you can interrupt it and choose to behave in a way that strays from your default, you might be able to improve your relationships.

(Shortform note: In _The Obstacle Is the Way_ , Ryan Holiday suggests that understanding the process by which you judge events can improve other aspects of your life, not just your relationships. Unlike Waldinger and Schulz, who focus on how you react to stressors, Holiday suggests that all events are neutral but spark feelings in us that evoke a reaction. According to Holiday, this perspective can help you see the silver lining in anything. For example, if a grandparent dies, you can choose to be sad, but you can also choose to be grateful for the lessons they taught you. Additionally, it helps you see opportunities in problems—which, other experts suggest, could reduce your tendency to avoid problems and thus increase your happiness.)

##### Follow the W.I.S.E.R. Model

To interrupt this process of quickly reacting to stressors, Waldinger and Schulz recommend that you use the five-step W.I.S.E.R. model. Whenever you start to feel touchy, **watch** every aspect of the scenario. Ask yourself what you can see about what’s happening and what you think will happen. By doing so, you force yourself to actually _see_ the situation as it is and buy yourself the time necessary to observe potentially relevant details instead of jumping to conclusions.

Next, **interpret** the scenario: Ask yourself what story you believe about the scenario and why that story is making you feel a certain way. Then, consider whether that story might be untrue. In the case of your partner who’s late, you might believe that they’re late because they don’t care about you—but it’s possible that they were held up at work and couldn’t get out in time.

The next steps of the W.I.S.E.R. model are to **select** what you want to do based on the desired result of this interaction, and then **engage** in that behavior. This requires you to recognize that you can _choose_ to behave in a manner that’s different from what you’ve done in the past. For example, if you normally snap at your partner when they’re late, you might choose to instead calmly ask why they’re late because you’re trying to be more compassionate in your interactions.

Finally, **reflect** on what you’ve done. Waldinger and Schulz acknowledge that you don’t have to reflect on every interaction. However, they recommend occasionally reviewing the results of engaging in this model to determine how you can improve upon what you’re currently doing. For example, if you find that compassionately asking your partner why they’re late doesn’t improve their chronic lateness, you may wish to select a different tactic.

(Shortform note: _The Oz Principle _authors __ warn that some people have a victim mentality that prevents them from taking the steps necessary to grow. If you have one, you may struggle to review the results of engaging in the W.I.S.E.R. model because you think it’s the _other_ person’s responsibility to change. To assess whether you have a victim mentality, ask yourself if you're open to other perspectives, able to admit when you've messed up, and comfortable with sometimes being wrong.)

> **Other Ways to Deal With Difficult Situations**
> 
> Other experts have proposed similar processes to help you deal with specific types of difficult situations. In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown advocates following a similar process when you face a failure or setback. First, acknowledge that your emotions were triggered in some way. This will force you to go from _feeling_ to _thinking_ and prevent you from leaping into action—just like the “watch” step does. Second, question the story you’ve automatically created—just as you do in the “interpret” step. Asking yourself what you _know_ about the situation, what you’re _assuming_ , and what feelings are driving the situation will help you separate the facts from assumptions and insecurities.
> 
> Third, instead of suggesting that you select and engage in a behavior that’s tailored to the results you desire, Brown recommends that you talk through your story aloud with the people involved. The phrase, “The story I'm telling myself…” is especially useful in these conversations—it lets you express your feelings and invite the other person to share their side of the story. Approaching the story this way either shows you the illogical leaps your story made or opens up an honest conversation about her thoughts.

### How to Improve Specific Relationships

Now that we’ve discussed Waldinger and Schulz’s strategies for improving your relationships in general, we’ll discuss their strategies for improving specific types of relationships. In this section, we’ll discuss the unique characteristics and challenges of your relationships with your partner, your family, your colleagues, and your friends, and how to improve each type.

#### Your Relationship With Your Partner

Waldinger and Schulz assert that a positive and long-lasting relationship with a romantic partner can provide comfort to your life. Psychologists have found that adults who feel like they have a “secure base”—someone they can rely on for comfort and support no matter what—recover faster from stressful situations.

> **Not All Romantic Relationships Are Created Equal**
> 
> Just because you _have_ a romantic partner doesn’t mean that they’re your secure base. In _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel Heller explain that people relate to intimacy in three ways: Secure attachers are comfortable with intimacy, avoidant attachers prefer to maintain some emotional distance from their partners, and anxious attachers desire a lot of intimacy and are highly attuned to any threats to that intimacy. Secure attachers tend to have healthy relationships—the kind that provides a protective effect from both physically and mentally challenging situations.
> 
> However, when anxious and avoidant attachers date each other, their clashing intimacy needs often lead to a relationship in which one partner is regularly stressed out and so feels insecure and unhappy.

Waldinger and Schulz name several techniques for improving your relationship with your partner. First, pay attention to and thank your partner for the little things they do. Doing so will improve your impression of them (because you’re paying attention to their positive qualities) and your partner’s mood (because they’ll be happy you noticed). Second, try new things together. You’ll see your partner in a new light, which will increase your admiration of them.

> **Other Ways to Improve Your Relationship**
> 
> Researchers provide further tips on how to express gratitude and try new things with your partner to improve your relationship. When expressing gratitude, emphasize how your partner has added to your life. One study suggests that this improves how positively your partner feels about you and your relationship—however, acknowledging what your partner gave up for you doesn’t have the same effect. For example, your partner will feel more appreciated if you say, “Thanks for walking with me; I love your company,” rather than, “Thanks for walking with me even though you’d rather play video games.”
> 
> Additionally, when trying new things with your partner, try learning something together. Your relationship grows stronger when you support each other through the mutual vulnerability that stems from not knowing what you’re doing.

Third, practice sharing _all_ parts of yourself with your partner—even those you’re afraid to. Waldinger and Schulz explain that in times of conflict, you may be tempted to hide your true feelings from your partner in an effort to protect yourself or to stop fighting. However, the authors assert that it’s better to lean into your vulnerability. When both partners share their true selves with each other, their connection deepens.

(Shortform note: In _The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work_ , John Gottman and Nan Silver suggest that if you struggle to share your true feelings with your partner when you’re fighting, you may be experiencing flooding. Flooding is a psychological phenomenon in which one partner feels so emotionally stressed that they’re unable to respond rationally to their spouse. If you’re feeling flooded—which can manifest as a desire to shut your partner out because you’re feeling overwhelmed—ask for a 20-minute break. Once you’ve calmed down, you’ll be more willing to be vulnerable and more able to have a productive discussion.)

#### Your Relationship With Your Family

Waldinger and Schulz assert that having a positive relationship with the family you grew up in heavily impacts your life. After all, you’ve known these people your whole life, so they provide a type of support that you cannot find anywhere else.

However, Waldinger and Schulz clarify that this doesn’t necessarily mean that you had a happy childhood. The authors acknowledge that our childhoods dramatically impact our ability to maintain healthy relationships—primarily because, as kids, we learn from our families how to handle our emotions. But, as the authors point out, we can also _unlearn_ the negative patterns our families taught us and replace them with healthier patterns.

(Shortform note: To unlearn the negative patterns your family taught you, you first need to understand them. This is particularly important if you’re a parent. The authors of _The Whole-Brain Child _recommend that you reflect on the wounds that produced your parents’ behavior and how their behavior affected you. You’ll thus learn something from your childhood experience and be deliberate about your approach to parenting. If you don’t practice this self-reflection, you risk repeating the negative pattern with your own child.)

According to Waldinger and Schulz, a key step to unlearning these patterns is to **be open to the possibility that people will surprise you**. In both familial and non-familial relationships, doing this frees you up to perceive when people _aren’t_ behaving as badly as you expect, which can help break down damaging assumptions you learned as a child. This openness is particularly helpful in familial relationships because it encourages us to notice and acknowledge when our family members have undergone personal growth—something most of us struggle to recognize in people we’ve known our whole lives.

For example, say your mother constantly criticized your dad when you were a kid. So as an adult, you develop a negative pattern of regularly criticizing the people you love. One day when you’re grown, you notice that your father bought the wrong brand of milk. But instead of loudly criticizing him, your mother simply puts the milk away. You only noticed this small change because you were open to the possibility that your parents _could_ change. Not only do you reconsider your belief that your mother constantly criticizes her family, but you also reconsider how you behave when your husband messes up—and the next time he does, you remember your mom’s gesture and choose not to criticize him.

> **How Your Mindset Affects Your Relationships**
> 
> In _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck argues that people have one of two mindsets when viewing the world. If you have a _fixed_ mindset, you believe that people’s abilities are innate and unchangeable. If you have a _growth_ mindset, you believe that anybody can improve upon the abilities that they’re born with. So if you think your family is incapable of changing, you may have a fixed mindset.
> 
> This may be true even if you have a growth mindset regarding how people _outside_ your family behave. Dweck explains that people fall into different mindsets in different areas, so you may only have a fixed mindset when dealing with your family. To change your mindset, Dweck recommends that you name your fixed-mindset persona. Then, have an imaginary conversation and argue against it when it pops up—such as by reminding your fixed-mindset persona that people can change when your family behaves differently than you expected.

Another key to improving your relationships, according to Waldinger and Schulz, is to **have regularly set family time** to ensure that you continue to connect with each other despite how busy life gets. If you’re all living in the same place, the authors recommend instituting regular family meals. If not, having a regular video meeting can help maintain some connection, too.

(Shortform note: Other experts have alternate suggestions for making the most of your family time. If you all live in the same place, prioritize the activities that both you and your family members value most. For example, your teenager may not care about family dinner but love when you play games together. If you don’t live in the same place, experiment with different video chat formats to make them age appropriate. For example, your toddler will likely stay on the call longer with her aunt if the aunt brings a puppet.)

#### Your Relationship With Your Coworkers

Waldinger and Schulz argue that having supportive relationships with your coworkers can make a big positive difference in your life. The authors note that most people divide their lives into work and non-work time. But in reality, your happiness at work has a big impact on the rest of your life.

Since people spend so much time at work, having social relationships with colleagues can prevent loneliness—which, as we saw previously, can damage our health. If a work occurrence negatively affects your mood, that bad mood often remains even when you return home—and so work events can damage your familial relationships.

(Shortform note: Working remotely may exacerbate the potential damage of work on our lives. Many remote workers struggle to set boundaries between their work and personal lives, which can negatively impact their relationships. For example, they may struggle to separate from work and so neglect time with their loved ones. And if you work remotely, you’re unlikely to have a social relationship with your colleagues that protects against loneliness. One survey found that 66% of remote workers in the US have no work friends.)

So Waldinger and Schulz suggest that you **change your perspective on your work relationships**. Instead of avoiding possible connections with your coworkers, think about how you could develop relationships with or deepen existing relationships with your colleagues. Then, put those ideas into practice. For example, if you love books and notice that a colleague you don’t know well is always reading, strike up a conversation about books with that person.

Waldinger and Schulz acknowledge that sometimes, this is easier said than done. You may struggle to befriend coworkers if you work remotely. Alternatively, you may be reluctant to befriend people at a different managerial level because you don’t want that hierarchy to potentially damage your personal relationship. However, the authors argue that developing relationships anyway will improve both your happiness and the quality of your work—especially in the latter case, because the only way to develop mentor/mentee relationships is to connect across the corporate hierarchy.

(Shortform note: Waldinger and Schulz focus on what _individuals_ can do to improve their workplace relationships. But other experts argue that _companies should take measures to facilitate friendships between their employees_ since these friendships improve both profits and retention. Try providing new employees with an “onboarding buddy”—a built-in mentor at the company who can help the new hire adjust appropriately. And if your team works remotely, have regular video calls. The more team members see each other, the greater their ability to build relationships.)

But what if it’s too late to develop relationships with your coworkers? If you’ve retired, Waldinger and Schulz propose that you **seek out regular social connections and something that brings you fulfillment.** The authors explain that many people find these connections and fulfillment at their jobs—so when they retire and lose both, they struggle to adjust. Having a replacement source of both will help you maintain your happiness. For example, getting a volunteer position that utilizes your professional skills could help you feel fulfilled and bring more people into your life.

(Shortform note: Maintaining social connections and a sense of fulfillment is also essential for your cognitive health. Research indicates that retirement often sparks a rapid cognitive decline: Given the lack of social engagement and increase in idle behavior, you don’t challenge your brain as often, and so you don’t maintain your cognitive health. In contrast, maintaining social connections after you retire exercises your brain and can add a sense of meaning to your life that helps you feel more fulfilled.)

#### Your Relationship With Your Friends

Waldinger and Schulz say that many of us don’t prioritize our friendships. They point out that while children value their friends, adults often neglect their friends in favor of more immediate concerns such as their family or their work. This is especially true if the relationship developed when both people were in the same phase of life but one has since moved on; for example, if one college friend is still struggling in her career while the other is financially successful.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, people neglect friends in different life stages not because they’re prioritizing other concerns but because they struggle to connect due to their now-different experiences. If so, experts suggest that you focus on the things you still share—like your love of politics—and remember that every life stage is temporary; no matter how different things seem now, they may not always be that way.)

However, Waldinger and Schulz argue that neglecting our friendships is a mistake, as they’re more important than most of us think. The authors point to several studies indicating that close friendships have a significant impact on both our physical and mental health. Notably, your friends improve how well you handle stressful events: Friends make difficult situations seem better than they are, and they reduce both how long and how strongly we feel these events’ effects.

(Shortform note: Friends may be particularly helpful in stressful situations if they’re going through the same event that you are. One study found that if one stressed-out friend conversed with another friend who was equally stressed out, both felt better.)

Waldinger and Schulz add that it’s not _just_ our close friendships, or “strong ties,” that positively affect our lives. A growing body of research indicates that “weak ties”—infrequent and low-intensity relationships—also provide unexpected benefits. When you cultivate connections with people you don’t know well, such as the friend of your friend or the cashier at the corner store you frequent, you gain access to broader networks that you might not have access to otherwise. For example, studies show that the more weak ties you have, the better your chances of finding a good job.

(Shortform note: In _Give and Take_ , Adam Grant suggests that different people reap different workplace benefits from their weak ties. Grant introduces a type of weak tie called a “dormant tie”—someone you used to see often but have lost touch with. If you’re a giver (who likes to give more than you get), you have a major advantage when reconnecting with this dormant tie: They’ll be happy to hear from you because you have a history of helping people. In contrast, if you’re a taker (who takes more than they give), this dormant tie may want to punish you. And if you’re a matcher (who gives on a quid pro quo basis), you may only have a transactional relationship with this person and so not be remembered fondly.)

Waldinger and Schulz suggest several strategies to help you improve your relationships. If you’d like to increase your weak ties, **look at your existing social group**. Who do you regularly interact with that you don’t know well? If you’d like to improve your close friendships, **reconsider your patterns.** Many of us fall into a rut in our friendships. Think about what you normally do or talk about with your current friends, and mix things up if need be. For example, if you always go to trivia night with your friends, maybe you want to go hiking instead.

Additionally, pay attention to whether you’re the one usually providing or receiving emotional support in the relationship. If there’s an imbalance, think of whether you can provide more (by listening more) or receive more (by asking for more support).

> **More Tips for Implementing Waldinger and Schulz’s Strategies**
> 
> Other experts suggest more specific ways to improve your relationships. First, if you’re uncomfortable reaching out to a weak tie you don’t know well, Meg Jay recommends in _The Defining Decade_ that you ask the weak tie for a small, interesting, specific, and easy-to-accomplish favor—for example, ask to borrow a book she loves. Most people like to help others, so she’ll likely oblige. Plus, once she does, her brain will tell her she likes you (because you made her feel helpful) and she’ll be more inclined to help you again. Second, if you’re in a rut with a friend but don’t know how to mix things up, create a bucket list—a list of experiences that you’d like to have—together.
> 
> Third, if you’re unsure whether your friendship is imbalanced, spend a moment reflecting after your next conversation. If you feel exhausted and drained, you may be providing too much emotional support; consider gently suggesting therapy to your friend if this is a regular occurrence. In contrast, if you realize that _you’re_ talking too much, focus on asking more questions during your next conversation to give your friend a chance to speak.
