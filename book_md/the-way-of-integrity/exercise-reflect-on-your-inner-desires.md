## Exercise: Reflect on Your Inner Desires

Beck argues that one of the three most important parts of living with integrity is spending your time doing what you actually want to do. In this exercise, you'll have a chance to reflect on what you'd like to do most and how to make time for it.

* * *

Imagine a life of complete freedom without expectations from others. What would you spend your time doing if you could spend your time any way you wanted?

Now that you have identified some ways that you would like to spend your time, ask yourself: How much time in an average week do you spend doing these things?

Reflect on what's keeping you from doing these things more often. What would it take to spend more time doing what you actually want to do?
