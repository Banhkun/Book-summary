## 1-Page Summary

_The Way of Integrity_ is a guide to living in alignment with your true self. Author Martha Beck argues that deep down, you know who you want to be and what you want to do with your life. She contends that the greatest source of chronic misery is living out of alignment with these wants. Therefore, the solution to chronic unhappiness is getting in touch with this deeper self to discover what you want the most, and then changing the beliefs and behaviors that are holding you back.

Beck is a life coach, columnist, and best-selling author. She draws her lessons from her hard-won experience as a woman who overcame deep childhood trauma, left the Mormon Church, embraced her sexual orientation despite the values she grew up with, and raised a son with Down syndrome. As a life coach, she has helped numerous clients with their own struggles and draws her advice from their experiences as well.

Our guide will cover her work in two parts.

**Part 1: What Is Integrity?** explains Beck’s theories about what it means to live with integrity, how you might lose your way, and the heavy emotional toll of living at odds with yourself.

**Part 2: The Process of Realignment** explores Beck’s four-step process for getting back into alignment with your personal nature: discovering your false beliefs, challenging those false beliefs, living with integrity, and transforming yourself.

Throughout this guide, we'll also compare Beck's advice to psychological research, while extending her strategies with tips from other self-help authors.

### Part 1: What Is Integrity?

Beck defines integrity as **the psychological state of living in accordance with your own _personal nature_.** To gain some clarity on Beck’s concept of integrity, we’ll first define her understanding of your personal nature, and then look at what it means to live in accordance with it. Then we'll explore how you can become misaligned with your nature by internalizing messages from your culture, how living out of alignment causes chronic unhappiness, and finally, how to tell if you are misaligned.

#### What Is “Your Personal Nature”?

Beck argues that **at your deepest level of self, you know what will make you happy and what kind of life you want to lead.** You also know how you feel, and what is true about your own life. This deepest level of self is your _personal nature_. Your nature constitutes a sort of bedrock for your psychology and personality. You may experience your personal nature in the form of intuitions or deep personal yearnings, or—as we’ll see throughout this guide—a sense that something is “off” in your life when you stray too far from your nature.

> **Is There a "True Self?"**
> 
> Many psychologists agree with Beck's assertion that there is a core self that contains your true desires and goals in life—a “true self,” in other words. However, some psychologists have rejected this idea and consider it an _ideal_ rather than a _reality_.
> 
> Psychologists who reject the “true self” argue that what people think of as their "true selves" is in fact just who they want to be or feel they ought to be. It is an _aspiration_ rather than a _reality_. They also cite research finding that people feel "authenticity" when they are accepted by others in a group setting, even if they are behaving contrary to how they would behave outside of that setting. This suggests that “authenticity” may have more to do with _external_ validation than _internal_ validation, paradoxically turning the concept of a “true self” on its head.
> 
> Psychologists who support the existence of a “true self” highlight the painful experiences of hiding parts of ourselves for the sake of conformity, and the anguish caused by living out of alignment with core personal values. They assert that these experiences are painful because they contradict parts of ourselves that are either more _important_ or more _deeply held_ than other desires and motivations, suggesting the existence of either a “true self,” or something like it. Some psychologists also argue that a stable and consistent sense of an authentic self is an essential building block of healthy self-esteem. To believe that you have value, first you must believe there's a _you_.

#### Living in Accordance With Your Personal Nature

While each of us has a personal nature, our daily life is not always aligned with this nature. For example, you might spend your life locked into a routine, when your nature is more spontaneous, or you might spend your life in solitude when your nature is more sociable. Beck maintains that there are three core components to living in accordance with your personal nature.

  1. **Accept your personal knowledge.** All of us learn personal truths throughout the course of our lives through direct experience. You live in alignment when you accept these personal truths about your life, and you live out of alignment when you reject them. 
  2. **Accept your feelings.** Each of us experiences natural emotional responses to the events of our lives. You are living in alignment when you allow yourself to fully experience these emotions and out of alignment when you repress or avoid them.
  3. **Spend your time on what you love.** How do you spend the moments of your day? When you spend your time doing things that you actually want to do, you are living in alignment with your nature. If you spend all your time doing what you feel you _ought_ or _have_ to do, then you are living out of alignment.



> **How Do You Trust Yourself?**
> 
> Beck's three points for living with integrity require you to have a sense of your true knowledge, feelings, and loves. If these things are in conflict with each other, how do you know which ones are really true to your nature?
> 
> Unfortunately, there's no _external_ source of confirmation—no mathematical formula to prove that you would rather write a novel than work as an actuary. This forces you to rely on internal sources of confirmation—in other words, trusting yourself. To cultivate self-trust, psychologists argue you should view trusting yourself not as a permanent or achieved state, but as a process of trial and error. If you feel that there's something you wanted to do or say but held back, give it a try and see how it feels. If it feels right, continue, otherwise try something else. Psychologists suggest that getting to know your true self is like getting to know anyone else—a relationship you build over time.

#### How Your Culture Pulls You Away From Your Nature

Even though accepting your personal knowledge, accepting your feelings, and spending time on what you love may _sound_ easy, Beck argues it isn’t—because most people are not living in alignment with their nature. She explains that this happens because **your nature may be out of alignment with your _culture_.**

Beck argues that you grow up as a member of society where you consciously or unconsciously absorb messages about how to live and who to be. When you internalize these messages, they solidify into _beliefs._ As we'll discuss, you may form beliefs about the "right" things for you to pursue in life and the “right” person to be, even if they aren't true for your personal nature. When this happens, we create _false beliefs_.These false beliefs __ then pull you away from being aligned with your personal nature, which may want something else entirely.

(Shortform note: Throughout the book, Beck contrasts a deeper longing for a different life with the superficial desires you absorb from the culture around you. However, your deeper longing and superficial desires may not be as opposed as you think. In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach argues that our superficial desires may give us clues as to our deeper desires. For example, if you fantasize about relationships, this may point to a deeper need for love and belonging. If you fantasize about positions of influence, this may point to a deep need to be heard. This stance does not contradict Beck's claim that achieving your superficial goals won't make you happy. Instead, it suggests that you can uncover your deeper yearnings by looking to these surface-level wants for clues.)

Beck identifies two ways culture may pull you out of alignment with your nature: You chase goals you don't really want, and you try to be someone you're not.

##### You Chase Goals You Don’t Really Want

Cultures often teach us what to want in life. Your culture may teach you that pursuing wealth, status, and "success" (however defined) will make you happy. Then you might put an enormous amount of effort into achieving those things only to find that they haven't actually made you happier. That is because these goals are not necessarily aligned with your personal nature.

For example, an employee believes that becoming a manager would make them feel successful because this role is higher in their company hierarchy. However, deep down, they actually hate working with other people and would rather take a job where they complete projects independently. Because of the messages they've internalized from their work culture, this employee might spend years chasing that management position, only to feel miserable once they get it.

(Shortform note: Psychologists concur that most people are highly susceptible to peer influence when choosing their goals. People have a tendency to pursue what they see others pursuing, in a phenomenon called "goal contagion." Psychologists say that people often acquire goals from those they admire or look up to, such as teachers, parents, or mentors. To determine if you're following the right goals for yourself, psychologists encourage you to reflect on people in your life whom you admire, and ask yourself, “Are their goals really mine?”)

##### You Try to Be Someone You’re Not

Beck argues that you may absorb lessons from your culture about who has value and who does not. In an effort to be someone who has value, you may then try to change who you are to conform to this standard.

For example, someone might believe that they need to be physically attractive to have value. Then they spend all their time exercising and shopping for clothes when really they would rather be learning a musical instrument with that time. This causes them to be out of alignment because they pursue an image of themselves while rejecting the deeper motivations of their personal nature.

(Shortform note: In her theory of identity, Beck draws a sharp contrast between culture and nature. According to her theory, culture is a misleading force, and nature is our best source of guidance. However, not everyone agrees with this advice. Some argue that no one exists in isolation from other people—therefore, finding out who you really are is a process of looking outward rather than inward. They assert that you find yourself by imitating role models, taking on responsibilities, and connecting to communities instead.)

#### How Living Out of Alignment Makes Us Unhappy

Beck argues that **misalignment is the source of most—if not all—chronic psychological misery in our lives.** It's very hard to find happiness if you're not connecting and listening to your personal nature—the part of yourself that knows what would make you happy.

Beck stresses that alignment is not moral, but _structural_. You aren't a bad person if you've become misaligned—you didn’t make a choice to become misaligned, but rather, you became that way through social and cultural conditioning beyond your control. Nevertheless, you will have a hard time finding long-term psychological well-being if you are detached from your emotions, knowledge, and desires. Without alignment, your psyche is like a house that is built on a crooked foundation. There might not be any problem in the immediate future, but over a long enough period of time, your house won't be able to withstand the pressures of the elements and is bound to collapse.

> **What Causes Depression?**
> 
> Beck contends that living out of alignment with yourself is the source of most—if not all—chronic psychological misery. However, this is complicated by research into depression, which shows a variety of risk factors. Writing in _Lost Connections_ , journalist Johann Hari claims that depression is caused by three distinct factors: disconnection from social networks, disconnection from your past or future, and biological heritability. Here we’ll compare each of these factors to Beck's ideas of structural integrity.
> 
> **Disconnection from others** includes a lack of meaningful relationships with family or friends and a lack of positive social status or belonging. This isn't quite the same as individual integrity, but it might be related. If your nature includes a deep desire for social connections—and most people's do—then failing to achieve these relationships could be a violation of your integrity.
> 
> **Disconnection from your past or future** includes an inability to deal with past traumas or view the future with hope and motivation. This factor aligns most closely with Beck's sense of individual integrity. You aren't accessing your full nature if you are cut off from the parts of yourself that are carrying trauma or striving to guide your life toward future goals.
> 
> **Biological heritability** means that genetics play a role in depression. About 37% of cases of depression involve an inherited genetic susceptibility. Out of all the causes of depression, this one would have the least to do with Beck's concept of living with integrity. However, Hari contends that even with this susceptibility, depression is usually triggered by the other disconnections described above.

#### How Can You Tell If You’re Misaligned?

Beck encourages you to **think of your emotional suffering as a natural alarm system.** Your body is telling you that something isn't right in your life and you need to change. She explains four types of suffering that indicate you might be living out of alignment with your nature.

(Shortform note: Beck argues that you should treat your suffering as an internal alarm system, remaining attentive to the symptoms of misalignment. However, in _The Art of Happiness_ , the Dalai Lama suggests that you may first need to accept your suffering before you can begin to learn from it. He argues that suffering is an essential part of life, and that you only add additional suffering when you believe you don't deserve to suffer. He asserts that only once you accept suffering as an inevitable part of life, can you begin to learn from it.)

  1. **Confusion:** Your life just “feels off” and you’re not sure why. In your quiet moments, you wonder who you really are and what you want. You struggle to understand why you feel the things you do.
  2. **Aimlessness:** It feels like life is just slipping by and none of it adds up to anything. You struggle to concentrate on long-term goals. You don't see much of a future for yourself. In your quiet moments, you wonder what, if anything, you’re moving toward.
  3. **Emotional misery:** You find yourself feeling sad all the time without being able to explain why. Inexplicable misery becomes your default "ordinary" state. You just feel unhappy day to day for no particular reason.
  4. **Consistent failures in your career or relationship:** It seems like the important things in your life just keep falling apart no matter what you do. You thought that changing careers or changing relationships would solve your unhappiness, but the same problems seem to just follow you from career to career and relationship to relationship.



> **Diagnosing Misalignment**
> 
> How can you tell if you are suffering from any of Beck's four symptoms of misalignment? You may have negative experiences like the ones she identifies that could be caused by something other than misalignment. In diagnosing yourself with any of these symptoms, it helps to be clear on what each of them is _not_.
> 
> **1\. Confusion is not disorientation.** If you find yourself confused about where you are, what time it is, or even who you are, this is more likely a neurological problem, especially if you are elderly. Contact your doctor if you are experiencing disorientation.
> 
> **2\. Aimlessness is not simply a lack of concrete goals.** Motivational experts write that there is a clear difference between dreams and goals. A dream is a fantasy of where you'd someday like to be. A goal is a concrete plan with a deadline that you are currently working towards. You may feel aimless if you have no concrete plans, but the aimlessness Beck describes is a sense of disconnection from your future, a feeling that you're not sure what's worth striving towards.
> 
> **3\. Emotional misery is not externally triggered.** It's normal to feel sad for a long time if you're grieving the loss of a loved one or going through a difficult life transition. However, in each of these instances, you can point to some factor in your life that is making you sad. The emotional misery Beck describes is internally triggered. Your sadness remains consistent regardless of your life's events.
> 
> **4\. Chronic failures in your career or relationship are not unrelated.** This symptom can be the trickiest to identify, as many people experience some kind of setback in their careers or relationships at some point in their lives. When we struggle in our professional or personal lives, it can be hard to figure out why. In determining whether your relationship and career failures are actually caused by misalignment, look for a pattern. Do you find yourself fighting about the same kinds of things in each relationship? Do you find yourself feeling the same kinds of frustration or dissatisfaction at all of your jobs? This may be a sign that internal misalignment is the root of the problem.

### Part 2: The Process of Realignment

Beck argues that the only way to overcome the chronic misery of misalignment is **through a process of realignment.** However, this process is neither easy nor immediate. Realignment is often painful, frightening, challenging, and time-consuming. Furthermore, we may have to go through this process several times as we become misaligned in different aspects of our lives. However, Beck argues that it will be worth it to trade a life of chronic psychological misery for one of happiness and well-being.

In this section, we'll explore Beck’s four stages of realignment: discovering our false beliefs, challenging those false beliefs, living with integrity, and transformation.

#### Realignment Stage #1: Discover False Beliefs

Recall that we fall out of alignment by internalizing false beliefs from our culture. **Beck argues that the path to realignment begins with discovering and recognizing these false beliefs.** In this section, we'll discuss Beck’s three techniques for discovering your false beliefs. She advises you to find a mentor, move inward toward your brain’s zones of denial, and then patiently observe your most painful thoughts and feelings.

##### 1) Find a Teacher

Beck argues that many people first discover their false beliefs by encountering a role model or teacher who can help them get in touch with their nature. These could be actual teachers, but they could just as easily be authors whose books you pick up or people you stumble upon unexpectedly. She writes that you can recognize a good “integrity mentor” because they possess three important qualities.

**1\. They aren't bound by cultural rules.** Beck explains that your mentor has already freed themselves from the false cultural beliefs that keep you out of alignment. You can tell this because they won’t follow your culture’s rules. For example, if you work in an office where the unspoken rule is that no one is allowed to contradict the boss when they're wrong, this mentor will still freely speak their mind. Your integrity mentor might even seem rude or antisocial at first, but ultimately, their actions will show you new ways of thinking.

**2\. They will captivate you.** Beck argues that you will be naturally drawn to this person. You might find that your attention naturally gravitates toward them in social settings, or you might find yourself thinking about them more than you usually think about someone you just met. This could be a strong sign that you want to be more like this person or that they have found something in their life that you are looking for in yours.

**3\. They will put you in touch with your nature.** Beck explains that an integrity teacher isn't someone who tells you how or what to think, but who "wakes you up" to your _own_ nature—your innate ability to sense truth and know your own feelings and desires.

While discovering an external teacher may be an important step in your process, Beck argues that the ultimate goal is to get in touch with your _inner teacher_. This is the part of you that intuitively knows what you need to grow and come back into alignment with yourself. A mentor can simply help you along the way.

> **What Kind of Integrity Teacher Do You Need?**
> 
> Beck intentionally leaves her concept of an integrity teacher broad in order to accommodate a wide range of experiences. However, it's worth considering the different types of teachers you might encounter and how each type could contribute to your growth. Psychologists define three distinct roles that could fall under this umbrella.
> 
> **1\. A role model** is a person you respect and emulate, but may never meet in person. This could be a public figure such as a musician, athlete, or politician. You learn from role models mainly by trying to follow their example and recreate their successes in your own life. A role model in integrity could be someone who has similarly struggled with your particular conflicts between culture and nature, found a solution for themselves, and publicly shared their story.
> 
> **2\. A mentor** is someone with whom you build a long-term relationship and turn to for guidance and advice. A mentor is usually someone older and more experienced who can guide you through your personal growth. A mentor in integrity could be someone you talk to about specific yearnings of your personal nature or specific fears about running afoul of your cultural values.
> 
> **3\. A coach** works with you to build and practice an important skill. Coaches are usually experts in this specific skill with a knack for teaching. Relationships with coaches tend to have clear boundaries of time and investment, and often involve a financial transaction. A coach in integrity could be someone like a professional therapist who you hire to help you practice listening to the yearnings of your nature or making small adjustments in your life to live with greater integrity.

##### 2) Move Inward Toward Your Psyche's "Forbidden Zones"

Beck argues that**you can discover your false beliefs by moving inward toward the painful places in your mind that you’re afraid to go.** She explains that when you are living out of alignment with your nature, there are usually regions of your psyche where your conscious mind won’t go—your "forbidden zones." You don't yet know what's in these places, but you know that it is probably painful because of how much you've avoided it. You can usually tell where your forbidden zones are because these are the topics in your life that make you anxious to even think about.

As you approach these forbidden zones you may feel overwhelming feelings of dread, pain, sadness, or grief. However, you have a very powerful ally on your side—the yearning of your personal nature. Beck argues that at your deepest level, you want to live with integrity. This motivation will help you overcome the challenges of entering these terrifying places.

Once you have entered these painful places in your psyche, you will begin to notice the thoughts and beliefs that are causing the pain. You might not realize it yet, but many of these thoughts are actually _the false beliefs_ that you have internalized from your culture. Even if the pain in these forbidden zones is caused by real experiences and events, there may be false beliefs making them even more painful. For example, if your forbidden zone holds the grief of losing a loved one, even though the grief is real, you may feel more pain if you falsely believe that you will never find another person who loves you.

> **Why Do People Create Forbidden Zones and How Do They Impact Us?**
> 
> In her discussion of "forbidden zones," Beck is referring to a practice that psychologists may call _repression_ or _denial_. Often people cope with negative aspects of their lives by simply trying to avoid or minimize the negative emotions that they cause. The things that you avoid then become your forbidden zones.
> 
> In the short run, coping with a problem this way isn't inherently harmful—you may need time to process and find a solution, and it helps to not feel overwhelmed in the meantime. However, this type of coping becomes maladaptive when you use it as a long-term strategy in place of a solution to the emotional problem.
> 
> Researchers have found that our coping strategies often develop during childhood. Someone who has experienced unmanageable stress, trauma, or poor treatment as a child may be more likely to fall into a pattern of maladaptive coping.
> 
> Psychologists also argue that maladaptive coping can cause someone to mute positive emotions as well as negative ones—essentially shutting down the entire emotional system for a flat, neutral experience. Since most people want to experience positive emotions, this validates Beck's perception that at your deepest level, you don't really _want_ to cope with your problems this way, even if it feels comfortable in the short term.

##### 3) Observe Your Internalized Beliefs

As we discussed, once you are able to enter your brain's forbidden zones, you will be in proximity to the beliefs that keep you from alignment. Beck advises you to **start by simply observing your painful thoughts and feelings.** Get to understand your feelings of discomfort, and the kinds of beliefs that might be associated with them.

For example, if you believe that you only deserve love if you have an impressive career, spending some time with this belief can give you insight. When and where did you acquire this belief? How does it make you feel? Once you understand the beliefs that are causing you to live in chronic misery, then you can begin to challenge and overturn those beliefs, which we will explore in the next section.

> **How to Observe Yourself**
> 
> Beck advises you to observe your own thoughts and feelings. Russ Harris, writing in _The Happiness Trap_ , provides some pointers on how you can do so. Harris conceptualizes the self as existing in two parts: a thinking self and an observing self. Your thinking self narrates your experiences, fantasies, and decisions to yourself—telling a running story about your life. Your observing self simply takes in what you experience without judgment.
> 
> Harris argues you can shift your attention away from your thinking self to your observing self through _mindfulness_. Start by observing your senses: What do you see, hear, smell, feel, or taste at this moment? Once you settle into your observing self, you can move your attention to observing the internalized beliefs that make you unhappy.

#### Realignment Stage #2: Challenge the False Beliefs

**Once you begin to recognize these false beliefs, it’s time to start challenging and overcoming them.** Even though you might consciously understand that something isn't true, it can still _feel_ true, and it is these feelings that you’ll have to change.

For example, one of the most common false beliefs people hold is that their value as a human is dependent on something external. They think they will be worthy of love only _if_ they are successful, virtuous, or beautiful. You could ask these people whether these statements are true, and they will often tell you they are false. Yet nonetheless, many of us _feel_ that statements like these are true—and suffer for it. This section will cover Beck’s techniques for questioning false beliefs and recognizing your inner truth.

> **How Strong Is Your Grip on Reality?**
> 
> Beck asserts that many of us believe things even though we know on a deeper level that they aren't actually true. To some, this may sound as if she's claiming that people are naturally dishonest or crazy. However, many psychologists assert that our grip on reality may not be as strong as we believe, simply because of how our brains work.
> 
> The human brain requires an enormous amount of energy to run. This causes two distinct consequences. First, when forming memories, we often retain the minimum amount of information our brain thinks we need. This can make it more difficult to learn from our experiences. Second, our brains tend to rely heavily on autopilot: our habitual patterns of thought and perception. Therefore, once an idea about how the world works has become part of our default programming, dislodging this idea could take a lot of effort, particularly as our brains have to learn and develop new habits of thought. In light of these tendencies, we shouldn’t be surprised that someone may continue to hold onto a belief, even when they are repeatedly exposed to contradictory evidence.

##### Question False Beliefs

Recall that as you explored your mind's forbidden zones, you discovered false beliefs that caused you pain. The next step is to challenge and overturn these beliefs. Drawing on the work of self-help author Byron Katie, Beck offers two strategies for overturning false beliefs.

**1\. Ask yourself—can you be _absolutely_ sure it’s true? **While your false beliefs may feel intuitively plausible, it's hard to be _absolutely sure_ of something if, on some level, you know that it’s technically false. Asking if you are absolutely sure something is true often introduces the first crack of doubt into your belief. For example, let's say you believe that you will never be happy. Ask yourself, can you be absolutely sure that you won't _ever_ be happy in your life? Not even once, for one second? If you can come up with just one tiny counterexample, then you can't be absolutely sure.

**2\. Reverse the formula.** Beck also recommends challenging false beliefs by inverting the statement. She recommends testing out new beliefs by switching out words for their opposites or reversing word order to come up with a new meaning. For example, if your false belief is, “I can't be happy unless other people love me,” you might switch up to “I _can_ be happy because I love other people.” If the reversed belief feels more true, then you might have stumbled on a way out of the false belief. In this next section, we'll discuss how your emotions can help you to recognize the truth.

> **Examining the Consequences of False Beliefs**
> 
> Beck draws on the work of self-help author Byron Katie (_Loving What Is_) in her techniques for challenging false beliefs. However, when pushing back on your false beliefs, Katie recommends thinking not just about the truth of these statements, but also about their consequences. She encourages you to ask yourself the following questions:
> 
> **1.** How does this thought benefit me?
> 
> **2.** How would I feel and behave without this thought?
> 
> She argues that if you can directly see the ways your false beliefs are harming your life and holding you back, this can provide a strong boost of motivation to let go of these thoughts once and for all.

##### Recognize Your Inner Truth

After you challenge false beliefs, how do you recognize _truths_? Beck argues that **you can distinguish between inner truths and false beliefs by paying attention to your body and moods.** She identifies four qualities you experience while discovering an inner truth.

**1\. Physical relaxation:** When you discover an inner truth, your body will relax. This is often because repression and misalignment take energy to maintain. You will experience a relaxing sense of physical relief as you let go of the need to control your emotions.

**2\. An "aha" moment:** Recognizing truth will feel mentally like a sudden epiphany or insight. You may experience a sense of ideas clicking into place or a feeling of viewing your life from a new vantage point.

**3\. Feeling of openness:** Recognizing truth often comes with a sense of feeling _open_. You will feel more receptive to new experiences, emotions, and sensations than before.

**4\. Feeling of freedom:** You will experience a greater feeling of freedom to be yourself and choose your actions. As you let go of restricting false beliefs, new possibilities for your life will present themselves.

> **Can You Recognize Self-Deception?**
> 
> Beck explains four ways to tell if you are recognizing your inner truth. However, it may be just as important to recognize when you are deceiving yourself. Psychologists argue that you can also recognize self-deception if you pay attention—though by definition, self-deception is hard to notice. Furthermore, many of the signs appear to be the inverse of Beck's techniques for recognizing your truth.
> 
> **1\. Notice your body.** Psychologists argue that self-deception will make you feel anxious and tense—the opposite of the physical relaxation you can expect to feel while recognizing your truth.
> 
> **2\. Notice your mind.** Beck contends that recognizing your truth will give you an "aha" moment, whereas psychologists argue that self-deception will feel like a knee-jerk reaction—something that happens quickly and feels out of your control.
> 
> **3\. Notice your feelings.** Beck argues that recognizing your truth produces feelings of openness and freedom. Psychologists explain that self-deception often produces feelings of shame—an emotion that makes people close down and withdraw into themselves—reducing their openness and constricting their freedom.

#### Realignment Stage #3: Live With Integrity

Once you free yourself from false beliefs and understand your inner truths, then you can begin aligning your life with these truths. This is going to be challenging at first, because you will be acting against your habits. However, it will get easier as you make it into a practice. In this section, we'll cover Beck's five techniques for living with integrity: Commit to telling the truth, focus on making small adjustments, focus on your yearning, enjoy the benefits of integrity, and forgive yourself for violating your integrity.

##### 1) Commit to Telling the Truth

When you live in your false beliefs internalized from your culture, **you are not just lying to yourself—you also have to lie to family, friends, and colleagues.** Living your truth will require telling it to others and making them understand who you _really are_. You may risk losing the identity you have built for yourself as well as your social relationships. However, Beck argues this may be the price you have to pay for living with integrity.

She cautions you to expect pushback, especially if living your truth requires violating the rules of your culture. For example, if you belong to a community that expects everyone to follow traditional gender roles, coming out as transgender may result in ostracization, social pressure, and outright hostility, even if your nature tells you this is who you really are.

> **How to Manage Public Backlash**
> 
> Beck cautions that being yourself in public may lead to intense backlash from your culture. In _So You've Been Publicly Shamed_ , journalist Ron Jonson suggests four strategies for managing intense public backlash, based on his interviews of people who have been ostracized and attacked online.
> 
> **1\. Tell your own story.** When facing public backlash, your detractors may try to tell a negative story about you to the public. Get out in front of the damage by telling your own version of the story.
> 
> **2\. Wait it out.** Sometimes public backlash will blow over as it becomes old news and your detractors move on to other targets. However, this is a risky strategy, as you might not be able to repair your reputation when returning to your public life. But it has worked for some people.
> 
> **3\. Develop emotional resilience to shame.** Refuse to feel ashamed of the things others think you ought to be ashamed of. This will take away your detractors' ability to harm your emotional well-being.
> 
> **4\. Hire a reputation management company.** While not everyone can afford these services, reputation management companies can help you by creating new online content that will knock damaging online content out of the first page of search results. This will prevent negative content from becoming your entire public image.

##### 2) Focus on Making Small Adjustments

Beck also encourages you to **realign your life by changing one small thing at a time**. She stresses that aligning your life with your inner truth may take a long time and a lot of work, and you can't expect to achieve all of it at once. However, small changes will add up over time to create a life where you are free to be yourself and live out your true nature.

For example, if you live in a big city, but deep down you want to spend more time in nature, you don't have to start by uprooting your entire life and moving to the country. You could try planning a camping trip, or going on regular walks in a park.

> **How to Form Habits**
> 
> **Making small adjustments in your life leads to much larger improvements over time _only if_ you can turn those small adjustments into habits.** As James Clear explains in _Atomic Habits_ , each new habit you create becomes the foundation on which to build the next positive habit. Therefore, in changing your life through small adjustments, it helps to understand how to form an activity into a habit. Clear identifies four stages of developing habits.
> 
> **1\. The cue** triggers your brain to notice an opportunity to do something.
> 
> **2\. The craving** is the emotional response attached to a certain cue—your emotional desire to do something.
> 
> **3\. The response** is how you act to fulfill the craving.
> 
> **4\. The reward** is the satisfaction you gain from the action you took.
> 
> In deciding on a positive step that you would like to turn into a habit, try writing out your new habit with each of these four steps.

##### 3) Focus on Your Yearning

Beck explains that if you find yourself stuck while trying to get your life in alignment, **it helps to focus on your deepest yearning**. This yearning comes from your personal nature and tells you what you _want_ to be doing with your life. It also provides the motivation you need to make hard changes like telling the truth with high social risks, or making consistent small changes to realign your life. Beck also argues that you can't force yourself to make hard changes until you are ready—but getting in touch with your yearning will bring you closer to readiness.

(Shortform note: In learning to listen to your yearning, it's helpful to draw a distinction between yearnings and cravings. Cravings are short-term desires that, when fulfilled, are quickly replaced with other cravings. Yearnings are long-term desires felt more deeply and can guide your life in accordance with your personal nature. However, it can be difficult to tell them apart while you are in a _state of craving_. Psychologists, therefore, suggest that you can reduce your experience of cravings through mindfulness and meditation. If you calm your mind and free yourself of cravings, you will have an easier time listening to that underlying yearning that motivates you toward a better life.)

##### 4) Enjoy the Benefits of Integrity

As you get closer to realignment, **you will begin to feel more at peace with yourself.** Recall the three pieces of alignment: Accept your personal knowledge, accept your feelings, and spend your time on what you love. As you make this your practice, you will experience a greater sense of wholeness and well-being. Learning to love and enjoy this lifestyle will provide further motivation to continue the difficult process of realignment.

(Shortform note: In making important life changes, motivational experts stress the importance of reinforcing a change to make it stick. In _Switch_ , Chip and Dan Heath argue that celebrating progress—no matter how small—can bolster your motivation to continue making the change. Therefore, by taking the time to savor even small moments of feeling aligned, you can strengthen your resolve to keep going.)

##### 5) Forgive Yourself for Violating Your Integrity

Finally, as you get your life in alignment with your deepest nature, **Beck highlights the importance of forgiving yourself for falling out of alignment with your integrity.** Many people devote years of their lives to living out false beliefs and may be tempted to beat themselves up for their mistakes. Beck argues that the best thing you can do is let go of the past while forgiving yourself for the false beliefs you internalized from your culture.

> **The Five Steps of Self-Forgiveness**
> 
> If you're struggling to forgive yourself for living against your integrity, psychologists recommend five steps.
> 
>   * Own what you have done. Accept accountability for your actions and their consequences.
> 
>   * Understand why you lived outside of your integrity. Look back on your past actions with honesty and compassion and determine the need you were trying to fulfill.
> 
>   * Learn from your mistakes. Think about the lessons you can apply and make a plan for your future.
> 
>   * Make amends. Try to set things right with those who have harmed when living outside of your integrity.
> 
>   * Choose to forgive yourself. Make a conscious decision to let go of your guilt moving forward.
>

#### Realignment Stage #4: Transformation

Beck argues that as you practice integrity, you might find yourself changing in ways that you didn't expect. **Your nature may call you to a higher sense of purpose and a higher spiritual awareness of the world around you.** Beck calls on you to trust your process and embrace this transformation, even though its outcomes may be uncertain. She gives four pieces of advice for navigating this stage in your journey: Embrace the unknown, embrace unity and connectedness, find a purpose, and spread alignment to others.

##### 1) Embrace the Unknown

Beck encourages you to **allow yourself to be open to aspects of life and experience that you don't fully understand.** She argues that living in alignment with your true nature won't simply help you become healthier and happier—it may also lead you to a _higher spiritual awareness_. This will require an openness to unknown experiences because the spiritual aspects of your life and world may be unfamiliar and unknown to you, especially if you have been living in misalignment. Just because you don't fully know what you are experiencing doesn't mean you can't continue trusting the process and being receptive to new spiritual experiences.

> **What Is “Spirituality?”**
> 
> Beck argues that the path of integrity leads not simply to better psychological health and well-being, but also to a greater state of spiritual enlightenment. However, the term "spiritual" can mean very different things depending on the context. Reviewing a few common understandings of the term will shed light on Beck's ideas.
> 
>   * The term "spiritual" comes from the Latin spiritus, originally meaning "breath" or "wind." To this day, the term carries a sense of both "life force" and "non-materiality" that hearken back to these roots.
> 
>   * Some define spirituality as a set of emotional experiences, particularly a sense of awe, wonder, acceptance, and inner peace.
> 
>   * Others define spirituality as a sense of greater connection, either to the world around us, to a higher power, or to something greater than ourselves.
> 
>   * Finally, others define spirituality as an experience of deeper connection to one's own sense of values and purpose—an experience of clarity about the source of one's meaning in life.
> 
> 


##### 2) Embrace Unity and Connectedness

As you embrace your true nature and find yourself ascending to new levels of spiritual awareness, you will find **the divisions between yourself and the rest of the universe becoming less important.** Beck argues that interconnectedness is the true nature of the world and that we learn from culture to put boundaries between ourselves and the universe. Beck argues that the more we get in touch with our true natures, the more we will experience belonging and connection as part of a vast, interconnected unity.

> **Religious Teachings on Interconnectedness and Unity**
> 
> In arguing that higher spiritual awareness will lead to a greater sense of interconnectedness, Beck implicitly draws on a range of religious traditions that have proclaimed a "oneness" or "unity" of the world.
> 
>   * In the _Tao Te Ching_ , Lao Tzu argues that the _Tao_ is an eternal force manifest in all things, and that the highest spiritual state is to harmonize your life with the Tao.
> 
>   * Some Hindu traditions proclaim that there is a universal soul called _atman_ , and that spiritual practice allows you to commune or fuse with this single universal soul.
> 
>   * The Buddhist concept of _sunyata_ posits a philosophy of "non-dualism"—a rejection of distinctions between the objects or entities of the world in favor of a single, undifferentiated whole.
> 
> 


##### 3) Find a Higher Purpose

Beck notes that as you become more aligned with yourself, you may discover **opportunities to contribute and help others that would have never occurred to you while you were living in misalignment.** This happens for several reasons. As you become at peace with yourself, you won't use up as much energy trying to control your life and emotions. This creates an opportunity to become less _self-focused_ and more _other-focused_. For example, if you're not spending all of your time managing cognitive dissonance or ruminating on your emotional anguish, you might notice opportunities to volunteer in your community.

Second, as you become more aware of your interconnectedness with others, you will naturally become more alert to opportunities to contribute. Beck advises you to embrace these opportunities and live out a higher purpose for yourself by helping others.

> **How to Find Meaning in Life**
> 
> In _Man's Search for Meaning_ , Victor Frankl builds on the idea that you can find meaning in your life by looking to the world around you. He argues that life doesn't have one single, inherent meaning, but instead each of us has opportunities to make meaningful contributions that only exist in certain moments and contexts of our lives. A meaningful life, he asserts, lies in recognizing these opportunities and taking them as they come, which Beck might argue is easier to do once you are living in integrity. Frankl suggests three paths to finding meaning:
> 
> **1\. Actions:** A meaningful action is one that contributes to something larger than yourself, like a community, family, or cause.
> 
> **2\. Experiences:** People find meaning in positive experiences, such as feelings of love toward others, experiences of beauty in nature and art, or experiencing truth through learning and contemplation.
> 
> **3\. Responses to adversity:** Frankl writes that when people experience suffering or setbacks in life, they can find meaning in these events based on how they respond. Someone who sees their hardship as an opportunity to grow will find meaning in the suffering they experienced along the way.

##### 4) Spread Alignment to Others

Finally, Beck argues that as you become more aligned with yourself, you **have an opportunity to spread the influence of alignment to others around you.** She describes the process of spreading alignment from yourself to others as similar to the repetition of shapes in a fractal.

Recall that the discovery of false beliefs often comes from encountering a teacher—someone who has found integrity and is already free to be themselves. Once you begin living in greater alignment with yourself, you have the opportunity to be that teacher for others. Beck argues that becoming aligned doesn't simply benefit you. Being the best version of yourself contributes to creating a greater culture of alignment around you, spreading health and spiritual transformation throughout the world.

> **Modeling the Spread of Alignment**
> 
> Beck describes the spread of alignment as a fractal—an infinite pattern that is self-similar at different scales. However, this refers to the finished shape, while she is mainly describing a process of spreading.
> 
> We might more effectively describe this process as a "cascade effect." Also sometimes called a "domino" or "ripple" effect, a cascade occurs when an action triggers the conditions that enable the same action to occur again. For example, in ecology, the extinction of one species can cause the extinction of other species that relied on it for food, moving up the food chain in a cascade of extinctions. This can also move in the opposite direction: The decomposition of a plant can add nutrients to the soil, allowing for the growth of new plants that will eventually die and enrich the soil themselves. Therefore, by finding our own alignment, each of us has the opportunity to participate in a cascade that could spread alignment far beyond ourselves.
