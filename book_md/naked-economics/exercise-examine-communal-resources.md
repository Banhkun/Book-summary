## Exercise: Examine Communal Resources

Communal resources are finite resources of which everyone uses a piece, but no one in particular owns—such as fish in the ocean. Systems based on such resources distort incentives because personal incentives rarely align with the incentives of the larger group.

* * *

Describe a time you operated in a market based on communal resources. (This doesn’t have to be a traditional, capitalist market—did you ever divide up communal chores between roommates or pitch into a project at work that involved many people but had no clear leadership?)

What kinds of problems did you or other members of your group encounter in dividing up responsibilities or the resources of your communal asset? (For example, did one person take more than their fair share of communal food, or did someone shoulder more responsibilities than others?)

How might these problems have been better managed or avoided entirely?
