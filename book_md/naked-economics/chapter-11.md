## Chapter 11: International Currencies

The concepts we’ve reviewed so far relate to how an economy functions in general, and typically within the borders of one particular country. We’ll now look at how people, firms, and governments of different countries can interact with each other globally in an international market, buying and selling not only goods and services but also currencies.

International markets operate similarly to domestic markets, except on a global scale. The global nature of the international market adds complexity to business transactions, not only because of the logistics of buying and selling goods and services from far-away regions, but also because different countries have different rules, regulations, taxes, and currencies.

**A currency is the unit of money a country uses to conduct its business.** Different countries have different currencies—for example, the United States has the dollar, Mexico has the peso, and Japan has the yen. Each country also has its own governmental institutions that create and manage its currencies.

In this chapter we’ll examine currencies, and how the international market uses them to function, covering:

  * What a currency represents (purchasing power) and how that is used to compare currencies (purchasing power parity)
  * How exchange rates are determined
  * What effect strong and weak currencies have on an economy, and how governments play a part in determining their currencies’ strength



### Purchasing Power

**A physical piece of currency is just a piece of paper or a coin, but it represents an amount of purchasing power that can be used for goods and services.** To evaluate a currency’s purchasing power, economists determine how many goods and services it can purchase from a hypothetical “basket of goods” that includes a broad range of things for sale in any given country.

#### Purchasing Power Parity

In theory, we can determine the values of currencies against each other by comparing how many goods and services each can purchase. This is called _purchasing power parity_ (PPP).

For example, if 50 American dollars buy the same exact goods and services in the U.S. as 750 rand (R) do in South Africa, we can calculate that $50 is worth about R750 (and that $1 is worth about R15).

Economists and government officials use PPP to compare the relative strengths of different currencies and, in a related vein, the relative strengths of different economies. So, for example, if someone living in Israel earns 100,000 shekels a year, how much would she have to earn in American dollars in order to have the same standard of living in the U.S.?

To determine this, economists compare the prices of a hypothetical basket of goods in both countries to see which currency can purchase more goods. The basket of goods includes both tradable and non-tradable items: For example, it might include televisions (tradable, because you can sell and ship a television to another country) and haircuts (non-tradable, because you can’t ship a haircut overseas).

So, for instance, if you buy a dinner in India for the equivalent of 10 American dollars (converted into rupees), and that same dinner would cost you 40 American dollars in New York, this indicates that the dollar is stronger than the rupee, as it can buy more items priced in rupees. (In other words, the $40 that would buy you dinner in New York will buy you dinner, dessert, movie tickets, and a hat when you exchange the dollars for rupees and use them in India.)

While PPP can give us a rough estimate of the strength of one currency in comparison to another, this correlation can differ significantly from the currencies’ official exchange rates. For instance, with our dinner example above, this measure of PPP does not necessarily mean that an Indian rupee is “officially” worth exactly one-fourth of an American dollar.

This is because official exchange rates and PPP take into account different types of goods. Official exchange rates are highly influenced by trade, and because you can't trade non-tradable items, it's hard to factor them into the rate. However, as mentioned above, PPP _does_ factor in non-tradable goods. Given that nontradable goods account for more than 3/4 of goods in a modern economy, it follows that PPP calculations would be very different from exchange rates.

### Determining Exchange Rates

**Currencies can be traded or sold for other currencies.** Currencies behave just like any other item that can be traded or sold—their values rise and fall according to the laws of supply and demand. The price at which you can purchase one currency using another currency is called the _exchange rate_.

There are several ways that a country can determine the value of its currency and its exchange rate:

#### The Gold Standard

The _gold standard_ is the most straightforward way to assign value to a unit of currency. With this method, a country pegs its currency to a specified amount of gold. A government stores a reserve of gold, and you can trade a physical unit of currency for a specified amount of physical gold.

The gold standard has a few advantages:

  * **It allows for an easy way to compare currencies between nations:** If one ounce of gold is worth 20 _dollars_ in the United States and 30 _pounds_ in England, you can easily determine the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound. 
  * **It protects against inflation:** A government using the gold standard can’t simply print money; it must have a corresponding amount of gold in its reserves to back up whatever money it creates. Therefore, it’s unable to spark inflation by flooding the market with currency.



However, the gold standard is an outdated method of valuing currency—no developed nations use it anymore. This is because it has a significant disadvantage: **It can rob a government of the tools it needs to ward off recessions.** A government using the gold standard can’t increase or decrease the amount of money in its economy through the fiscal policies that we discussed earlier; it’s beholden to the amount of gold in its coffers. Therefore, it has limited power to influence the flow of capital within its market.

Further, when an economy runs into trouble, foreigners who own that country’s currency lose faith in that currency, and often prefer to redeem it for gold rather than hold onto the currency itself, which they fear will lose value. When many foreigners do this simultaneously, they can drain a country’s gold reserves.

In order to protect its gold reserves, the country has to raise interest rates (because higher interest rates offer more value for investors who own that currency, they encourage people to hold onto the currency instead of trading it in for gold). Unfortunately, this is the exact opposite of what an ailing economy needs—as we discussed above, one of the most powerful things a government can do to fix a recession is to _lower_ interest rates. Raising rates only puts a further brake on the economy, which makes it harder for that country to climb out of its financial troubles. This is essentially what happened in the early 1930s during the Great Depression in America, and it led to ever-increasing unemployment.

#### Floating Exchange Rates

Today, most economies have _floating exchange rates_. **This means currencies are traded on foreign exchange markets (similar to stock markets but for currencies) and their values fluctuate against each other based on what traders are willing to pay for them, instead of against something tangible like gold.** So, if a firm wants to, for example, change its dollars into yen, it would use the foreign exchange market to trade its dollars for yen at a price set by demand in the market. (A firm might change dollars into yen for a variety of reasons—for example, if a Japanese company sells its product in America for dollars, and then wishes to pay its Japanese workers in yen, it will need to exchange those dollars for yen.)

Floating exchange rates are more flexible than the gold standard, because if a country needs to adjust its interest rates or to print more money, it can do so without the constraints of maintaining a physical gold reserve. The fact that the U.S. used floating exchange rates in 2007 to value its currency (instead of gold) allowed it to stave off the worst of the financial crisis with aggressive monetary policy adjustments.

However, this flexibility leads to a disadvantage as well: Firms conducting international business trust the system less, knowing that a government can adjust the value of its currency at any time.

#### Fixed Exchange Rates

_Fixed exchange rates_ operate similarly to the gold standard in that they peg a currency to something else that has a stable value—in this case, instead of gold, they peg a currency to another country’s currency. Argentina did this in 1991, pegging its peso to the American dollar. To do so, it kept a reserve of U.S. dollars in its vaults, and it committed to only printing more pesos if it had dollars to back them up.

Unfortunately, a fixed exchange rate runs into the same problem that the gold standard faces: A country using this system can’t adjust its own monetary policy based on its real-time needs, because in order to keep its currency pegged to the other country’s, it must mirror the other country’s monetary policies. Therefore, when Argentina fell into a recession in the late 1990s, its government couldn’t cut interest rates or do anything else to stop the downward spiral. The system was unsustainable, and in 2001, Argentina defaulted on its debts—the largest default in history. The country was only able to move forward after unpegging its currency from the dollar.

### Strong and Weak Currencies

Currencies can strengthen or weaken against each other, reflecting which one is more valuable to traders at any given moment. For example, if last week, one dollar equaled one pound, but this week, two dollars equals one pound, then the dollar has weakened against the pound: Each dollar can buy fewer pounds (in this case, one dollar would only be able to buy half a pound). If, however, this week one dollar equals two pounds, then the dollar has strengthened: Each dollar can buy more pounds.

The strength or weakness of a country’s currency has direct effects on importers and exporters. **In general, a weak currency hurts importers and benefits exporters.** To illustrate: If the dollar is weak, meaning it can buy fewer pounds, then an American trying to buy goods priced in pounds can buy fewer of them. Foreign, imported goods become expensive.

At the same time, a British person wanting to use pounds to purchase American goods can buy more of those goods. American exported goods become cheap for the rest of the world.

**In contrast, a strong currency works in the opposite direction, helping importers and hurting exporters.** So, if the American dollar strengthens against the British pound, so that dollars can buy more pounds, Americans buying imported British goods can purchase more of them, helping importers. However, the goods of American exporters become more expensive in Britain, so that the strong dollar hurts exporters’ sales.

#### What Drives the Strength of a Currency?

Overall, a currency responds to supply-and-demand market forces: **A country with a healthy economy will often have a strong currency, since a strong economy attracts investors** who purchase that country’s currency in order to conduct business in and with the country. This increases demand for the currency, driving up its price.

However, currencies can also be affected by governmental policies. A government might adjust the strength of its currency in order to manufacture some short-term benefit, such as propping up their exporters by purposefully weakening their currency. To manipulate its currency, a government can do several things:

**It can adjust interest rates:** In general, higher interest rates attract investors because they promise more return for their investment. When more people invest in currency, it raises demand for it, strengthening the currency. Alternatively, lower interest rates attract fewer investors, creating decreased demand and therefore weakening a currency.

**It can directly purchase or sell its own currency:** To strengthen its currency, a government might start buying it up, trying to create scarcity. Conversely, to weaken the currency, a government might start selling it on the market. Britain tried this technique (unsuccessfully) in 1992, buying pounds to stop its currency from being devalued. Unfortunately, this isn't an effective technique, because a government’s efforts to buy or sell a currency are usually insignificant in comparison to the wider market forces—if countless investors are selling a currency, a government trying to buy it back won’t make a material difference to its price.

**It can print money:** If a government starts printing money, driving up inflation and weakening the purchasing power of each unit of currency, it can drive down the value of that currency on the market. A country might do this if it gets into a lot of debt with another country and wants to devalue that debt. For example, say America owes China $1 trillion (and it does)—if the Fed doubles the number of dollars on the market so that each dollar now has half its purchasing power, then America’s debt gets cut in half.
