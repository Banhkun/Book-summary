## Exercise: Exchange Information

Information, and who has access to it, has an outsized influence on how smoothly an economy runs. A free flow of information allows for easy and smart transactions, while information imbalances put one party at a disadvantage to the other.

* * *

Think of a time when you had to make a purchasing decision but didnâ€™t have a lot of information about the item or service you were buying. How did you try to obtain information that could help you? Did the information influence your purchasing decision? (For instance, did you look at online reviews for the item or service, find those reviews were negative, and decide not to buy the item?)

If you are in a similar situation in the future, what are some other ways you could seek more information to help you make a decision?

Think of a time when you had to sell someone else something (either an item or your services), and the other person felt hindered by a lack of information. How did you convey the information you felt the other person was looking for? (For instance, did you send them an email outlining all relevant information about your service?)

If you are in a similar situation in the future, what are some other ways you could impart information to the other person to help them make a decision?
