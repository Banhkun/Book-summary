## Epilogue: Looking Forward

There are many different flavors of capitalism: Some allow for more of a free-for-all, while others are more concerned with minimizing capitalism’s drawbacks. In each country, people must decide for themselves what kind of market they want, weighing their priorities and voting for governments that support those priorities. In doing so, governments and their people must consider several basic questions:

**How will we maximize our utility?** In general, as a population’s wages go up, people start to work longer hours. At some point, though, people start to decide that _time_ is more important than additional money, and they start to work fewer hours. Each country—and each person within it—must decide for themselves where they want to draw that line: For example, will we end up working 50 hours a week and earning a lot of income, or will we decide we prefer to work 30 hours a week and enjoy what we can of our lesser income? Will we derive more utility (happiness) from listening to vintage records or walking in the park than working so that we can buy more records and a house closer to the park?

**How do we slice up the pie?** Some countries, like the United States, value a market that doles out large rewards to those who can grab them, but also tolerates harsh inequalities. Other countries, like those in Europe, discourage inequality but as a result, stifle overall growth. For example, regulations protecting workers from being fired only discourage firms from hiring in the first place, resulting in higher unemployment rates and a great percentage of people working part-time or gig-by-gig. Every country needs to decide where on the spectrum of economic freedom they want to operate, and how much inequality they’re willing to tolerate.

**How will we use incentives to encourage good behavior?** What punitive fees will we tolerate in order to ensure long-term desirable outcomes? For example, will we continue to subsidize car travel by making it cheap to own and drive a car? Or will we accept so-called “green taxes” that increase the costs of using non-renewable resources, bringing them more in line with their actual, overall costs to society as a whole (such as environmental costs)?

**How will we manage externalities?** How will we determine which elements of our society should be protected from market forces to maximize people’s overall happiness? How do we balance the desires of people who oppose strip malls because they’re “ugly” with those of people who want them because they provide easy, affordable shopping?

**How do we manage risk in the financial markets?** Figuring out fiscal and monetary policies that will consistently deliver healthy, sustainable growth is an ongoing challenge for governments. As different pieces of the economy become more integrated, they must adjust their techniques. For example, while classic economic theory advocates letting struggling businesses fail, in practice, when the government let the investment firm Lehman Brothers fail in 2008, the entire economy almost failed with it. Governments must continue to study how to allow the market to punish wrongdoers without punishing everyone else as well.

**How will the world eradicate poverty?** How can the rich world help governments in the poor world establish institutions that support a thriving market economy?

There’s no ultimate right answer for every economy, and each country might experiment with a number of approaches before finding one that suits its needs. In the end, the process of finding the right solutions to economic challenges is inherently ongoing, as solutions that work today might not satisfy tomorrow’s evolving priorities.
