## Exercise: Maximize Your Utility

The first assumption of economics is that people will do what they can to _maximize their utility_. “Utility” can be thought of as _happiness_ , and maximizing it means making yourself as well-off as possible.

* * *

At what level of income will you be happy to spend more time outside of work, enjoying the fruits of your labor rather than pursuing more income? What specific factors will determine when your income becomes sufficient for you?

For which quality-of-life improvements would you give up some income? (For example, would you accept a smaller paycheck for a shorter commute, or more time to exercise?) How much would each of these improvements be worth to you, and how might you determine their value?

Make a list of some things that bring you happiness. Think about how much time you spend on each item. How might you adjust your time to devote more energy to the things you enjoy?
