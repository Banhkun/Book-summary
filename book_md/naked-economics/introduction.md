## Introduction

**Economics is the study of how we allocate resources—not only tangible resources like food, clothing, and money, but also intangibles like time, effort, and knowledge.** To understand this process, economists begin by examining incentives: the driving forces behind our decisions. This study makes up the field of _behavioral economics_ , a relatively recent branch of economics, and one of the most applicable to our everyday lives.

By understanding the psychological instincts that steer us and how we respond to incentives, we can better understand how market forces work and make more informed decisions about how to spend or use our own resources. Additionally, governments and firms can use this information to design incentives that foster a healthy economy.

In _Naked Economics_ , bestselling author Charles Wheelan strips away the complexity from some of the most powerful theories in economics, allowing readers with little or no background in the subject to understand many of the field’s most fundamental concepts. He skips over the more technical, mathematics-based aspects of the discipline and concentrates instead on the logical pieces of how and why people behave in certain ways, how markets function, and how governments can design incentive systems that encourage healthy economies.

We’ll structure our discussions by walking through different aspects of markets one by one:

  * We’ll first explore what a market is and how a market works. 
  * We’ll then go into more depth about how incentives drive markets and how governments can influence markets as well. 
  * We’ll next explore two major influences on markets: information and human capital. 
  * Then we’ll discuss how _financial_ markets work.
  * We’ll also look at how economies of different countries are measured and compared, how recessions happen, and how governments can work with financial markets to manage recessions. 
  * We’ll finish by exploring international markets by looking at how currencies work and how markets can pull developing countries out of poverty.
