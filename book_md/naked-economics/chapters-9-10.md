## Chapters 9-10: Measuring and Managing Recessions

Sometimes, an economy functions well: It grows at a healthy rate that allows many people to earn a good living. But sometimes, it suffers a period of stagnation or contraction, when people find it harder to survive or to thrive within the market. **Every economy generally goes through periods of growth punctuated by periods of recession in what economists call the “business cycle.”**

In these chapters, we’ll explore how economists measure the health of an economy, what causes an economy to fall into recessions, and how governments can respond to recessions to fix them (or better yet, to prevent them).

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

In order to properly evaluate the strength of an economy, economists must figure out how to _measure_ economies in a way that allows for effective comparison. There are several markers of economic health that they look at, but the primary one is an economy’s _gross domestic product_ , or GDP. **GDP summarizes the value of all the goods and services an economy produces.** It’s the number that people generally refer to when they talk about a country’s growth: If you say the U.S. grew 3 percent this year, what you mean is that the U.S. produced 3 percent more goods and services this year than it did last year.

To properly measure the wealth of a country, you must also consider its population, which is why economists often look at _GDP per capita_ —the GDP of a country divided by its population— rather than simply GDP. If you don’t consider population, you can end up with misleading numbers. For example, India has a GDP of $3.3 trillion while Israel’s GDP is $201 billion. Without taking population into consideration, you might say that India is the wealthier country. However, because India’s population is so much larger than Israel’s (over a billion compared to several million), the GDP per capita works out to be approximately $2,900 in India and $28,300 in Israel, indicating that Israel’s population is better off.

#### GDP Misses Some Important Measures

While GDP does a good job of showing an overall picture of an economy’s health, it misses a number of important factors that determine whether or not an economy is functioning well and if the people operating within that economy are happy:

  * **GDP does not account for unpaid work.** If you forgo a paying job to raise your children, cook meals for your family, and care for your elderly parents, that work isn’t included in the GDP. 
  * **GDP does not account for leisure activities.** If you take time off work to spend the day hiking in the woods, you subtract from your country’s GDP. On paper, this means you’re worse off, while in real life, your ability to do such leisure activities shows you have a good standard of living. 
  * **GDP does not judge the methods used to create goods and services.** A country that produces lots of things but destroys its environment and burns through its own natural resources to do so (as China is often accused of doing) isn't taking into account the negative effect that its growth will have on its long-term health. In fact, environmental degradation can boost GDP: When a government has to pay for a clean-up of a factory’s pollution, it adds to the country’s GDP numbers. 
  * **GDP does not judge the _value_ of the goods and services a country provides.** If a country has a lot of prisons, servicing those prisons adds to that country’s GDP, even though it’s not a good thing for a country to have or need a lot of prisons. 
  * **GDP does not account for income distribution.** A country’s GDP might be high but only because a small segment of society is fabulously wealthy while others are poor—an unequal situation that does not indicate a strong economy. 
  * **GDP does not account for non-monetary factors that influence people’s happiness,** such as happy marriages or short commutes to work, both of which can have a stronger influence on overall life satisfaction than a simple income level. 



#### Other Measures of Economic Health

In addition to GDP, there are some other numbers that economists often refer to in order to judge how an economy is faring. These include:

  * **Unemployment rate:** This number measures the percentage of people who don’t have a job but are looking for one. In general, a lower unemployment rate indicates a stronger economy, because there are plenty of jobs to go around. However, a too-low unemployment rate indicates a lack of skilled workers, which can hold back an economy’s growth. 
  * **Poverty rate:** This number measures the percentage of a population living below a certain level of income. A high poverty rate typically indicates a poorly run economy. 
  * **Gini coefficient:** This number uses a scale of zero to 100 to measure income inequality. A score of zero indicates total equality, where every worker earns the same amount. A score of 100 indicates total inequality, where one worker earns all the income. By this measure, America has grown more unequal over time: In 1950, the country scored 37.9, while in 2007, it scored 45. Economies that are more equal tend to have longer-term stability. 



### How Do Recessions Happen?

**Recessions are periods of time during which an economy’s GDP shrinks.** They’re generally caused by a shock to the system—something unexpected and bad happening. Shocks might be the bursting of stock market or real estate bubbles (when exorbitant price increases are followed by sudden and devastating losses), a steep rise in oil prices (each of which preceded, respectively, the Great Depression of 1929, the financial crisis of 2007/2008, and the United States’ recession of 1973). Often a combination of causes leads to recession: For example, the American slowdown beginning in 2001 was sparked by the “dotcom bubble” of overinvestment in technology stocks, and was later exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of September 11.

Because all parts of modern markets are interconnected, the failure of one part of the economy can quickly cause other parts to fail as well. For example, if your income suddenly drops because of a stock market correction, you will respond by spending less money. Your decreased spending makes other people’s income decrease, who then respond by also spending less money, which spreads the pain throughout more and more sectors of the market.

**When this kind of slowdown reaches banks, the entire economy can quickly freeze up.** Our economy is very much based on credit: Many of the most basic business transactions require individuals and firms to borrow money from banks. When they can’t—because banks no longer feel confident lending out money, fearing that people won’t be able to pay it back—businesses can no longer invest or conduct business with each other, and individuals can’t borrow money to pay for things like houses, cars, or college. Everything grinds to a halt.

This is essentially what happened during the financial crisis that began in 2007. First, homeowners leveraged themselves highly: They took on more debt than they could finance in order to pay for new homes, fueling a property bubble. They did so on the understanding that if they found themselves unable to repay their mortgages, they could simply sell their houses and pay off the debt. However, this strategy could only work if home values continued to rise, and when the property bubble burst and home values dropped, people found themselves unable to pay their mortgages and also unable to sell their homes for enough money to cover their debts.

The resulting wave of foreclosures devastated investment banks. These banks were not only highly leveraged with mortgages but also with the credit default swaps we discussed earlier, which amplified the effects of homeowners defaulting on their mortgages. Lehman Brothers, a major investment bank, declared bankruptcy, and the global financial market froze as panicked banks stopped lending people money.

### Countering Recessions

To counter recessions, governments can change their _fiscal policies_ or their _monetary policies_ to encourage businesses to begin investing and consumers to start spending, so that the economy becomes self-sustaining again.

#### Fiscal Policy

Through its fiscal policy, a government encourages spending by injecting money into the economy. It can do so by cutting taxes, which allows people and businesses to keep more of their income and then (ideally) spend it. It can also do so by creating stimulus programs that put money directly into the hands of consumers and businesses. For example, stimulus packages might mail checks directly to individuals or allow firms to apply for no-cost loans, or they may fund programs that create jobs, such as infrastructure projects like road-building.

#### Monetary Policy

Through its monetary policy, a government controls the supply of money in an economy. The Federal Reserve (the “Fed”) is the governmental agency in charge of monetary policy in the U.S. and is the world’s most powerful agency when it comes to affecting the economy, both domestic and global. Its monetary policy is the most powerful tool it has.

**Monetary policy controls the amount of money in a market by increasing or decreasing short-term interest rates.** Cutting interest rates allows consumers to buy more things and allows firms to invest because borrowing is cheaper. Raising interest rates puts a brake on the economy by raising the cost of money itself, making it harder for individuals and businesses to borrow capital.

The Fed uses these mechanisms to pull the economy out of recessions and also to prevent recessions from happening in the first place by keeping the economy growing at a healthy clip. Importantly, a healthy clip means growing _not too fast_ and _not too slow_ , and it can be difficult to strike the right balance.

##### Not Too Fast: Inflation

When an economy grows too slowly, production outstrips demand. People don’t buy goods that firms produce, so those goods sit idle in warehouses or on lots, with no buyers. Unemployment rises because firms don’t need to hire workers if there are no transactions happening. The Fed can prevent this by decreasing interest rates and therefore making money cheaper to borrow, which encourages people to spend it.

Some people (often politicians) advocate for continually decreasing interest rates so that consumers and businesses can spend and invest all they want. However, there are limits to the speed an economy can grow. Firms can only produce items at a certain pace—a pace that depends on the availability of labor, factories, time, and other resources. Problems can arise when an economy is pushed faster than this pace. When consumers have easy access to cheap capital, they flood the marketplace with demand for items. When firms can’t keep up with demand, the market becomes unbalanced, with demand exceeding supply. As we discussed earlier, when demand exceeds supply, prices rise.

This leads to _inflation_ : a continual and somewhat rapid increase in prices of almost everything in an economy, including both goods and services. **To understand why inflation is so problematic, think of it not as prices increasing, but as the purchasing power of each dollar decreasing.** This means that if you have $100, you might be able to buy four shirts today, but a month from now, you might only be able to buy two shirts.

Inflation leads to all sorts of problems:

  * **People stop saving money** because their money will be worth less tomorrow than it is today.
  * **Banks become reluctant to loan money.** Inflation benefits people who borrow money but punishes those who lend it, because when the loan gets repaid, both the principal (the loan’s initial value) and interest have fallen in value. Germany’s inflation in the 1920s illustrates this danger: If you secured a fixed-rate mortgage in 1921, you could have paid the whole thing off in 1923 for less than the cost of a newspaper. Consequently, during inflation, people looking for credit have a harder time finding it, which, as we discussed above, can hold up all kinds of economic growth. 
  * **Taxes become distorted.** If you pay taxes on assets, such as stocks, that have depreciated in value because of inflation, you’re doubly losing money—first from the depreciation, and then from the taxes. 



Consequently, the Fed aims to set interest rates at a level that encourages growth but doesn’t allow inflation to set in.

##### Not Too Slow: Deflation

On the other end of the spectrum are persistent price _decreases_. On the one hand, price decreases are an expected part of a healthy economy: As we discussed earlier, productivity can lead to increased purchasing power because goods are relatively cheaper in terms of how many work-hours it takes to purchase them. This is overall a good thing, allowing people to buy more with their money.

On the other hand, prices that are _continually_ falling are terrible for an economy. This is called _deflation_ , and it’s as destructive to an economy as inflation.

Deflation is a danger during recessions, making them much harder to recover from. When wealth drops after an economic shock, people start spending less on goods and services. When demand decreases because of this, prices drop. **At a certain point, price drops perpetuate themselves:** People postpone purchases knowing prices will drop further (why buy a television today if it will be cheaper next month?), which causes prices to drop even further, and so on.

The negative effects of this are significant. Decreased demand for goods and services leads to fewer jobs needed to produce them, so unemployment rises. House prices drop, leading to a decrease in wealth for households and an increase in foreclosures, as people can’t sell their homes for enough to pay off their mortgage. People caught between unemployment and decreasing asset values (such as homes) are unable to repay loans, and banks, scared of future defaults, stop making new loans, which again freezes the economy.

To make matters worse, monetary policy is often unable to stop deflationary cycles in the same way it can stop inflationary cycles. Once a government drops interest rates to zero—doing so to encourage people to borrow seemingly cheap money that they can then spend, boosting the economy—it can’t go any further. However, rates of zero may not be enough to make borrowing money _actually_ cheap and spark spending. This is because, during deflation, your money gets stronger (the opposite of what happens during inflation, when your money gets weaker).

In other words, if you have $10, you might be able to buy two shirts today, but three shirts next month. This also means that if you borrow $10 today (two shirts worth), you’ll be paying back a more expensive $10 next month (three shirts worth). Thus, even with an interest rate of zero, it can be quite costly to borrow money. In a stagnant economy, people will not borrow expensive money, and lending shuts down, bringing the economy down with it.

Japan suffered through many years of deflation in the late 1990s and early 2000s, underscoring how difficult it is to break the cycle. When America flirted with deflation in 2007, the Fed lowered interest rates until they were no longer helpful, and then resorted to some creative ways to encourage spending—it allowed banks to borrow from the government anonymously so as not to burden them with the stigma of being in financial trouble, and eased certain regulations to make borrowing easier. In other words, it did whatever it could to inject money into the economy to stave off a deflationary cycle. This seems to be the only way to stop deflation: to flood the market with money by doing “anything short of dropping bank notes out of helicopters,” as one economist put it.
