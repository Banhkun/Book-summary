## Exercise: Use Your Influence

After setting a clear goal, influencers need to identify the critical practices that will have the greatest impact on their goal, then figure out how to effect change in those areas.

* * *

Considering the goal you wrote down, what are three practices that you think would have a significant impact on your goal?

Now choose the critical practice that’s the most important, and explain why it will have a significant impact on you reaching your goal.

The authors outline six potential spheres of influence that affect people’s ability and motivation to change their behavior. (Remember, the six spheres are Individual, Collective, and Environmental inspiration, and Individual, Collective, and Environmental Skill.) Describe what changes you would make in one of these spheres of influence to impact the critical practice identified above.
