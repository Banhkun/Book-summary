## Exercise: Use Your Network

If someone has already done what you want you to do, strategize how to use them as a resource instead of seeing them as a threat.

* * *

What is one goal you’d like to work on in the next year?

Is there somebody you know who has already accomplished this goal? (You don’t have to know them personally—it can be an acquaintance, friend of a friend, or someone you just know _of_.) If so, who is it?

Brainstorm three ways this person can help you achieve your goal. (Answering questions, mentoring, connecting you to another person or resource, and so on.)
