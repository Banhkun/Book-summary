## Exercise: Rehearse a “No” Response

Saying “no” to a request can be uncomfortable, but with practice, it gets easier. The better you get at saying “no,” the more you can say “yes” to your priorities.

* * *

Think of a recent time when you agreed to something you didn’t really want to do—for instance, letting your friend borrow your car even though it made you uncomfortable. How did the conversation go?

Imagine you are responding to that request today. Write three different ways you can decline using the strategies suggested in this chapter. (Offer an alternative, make them prioritize, be polite but firm, and so on.)
