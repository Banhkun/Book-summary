## Exercise: Regain Your Childhood Resilience

The older we get, the less tolerance we have for failure. Tap into your inner child and remember what it’s like to really try at something.

* * *

Think of a skill you acquired as a child that took a lot of practice (jump roping, cartwheels, learning your times tables, and so on). What was it?

If you had to guess, how many times do you think you practiced this skill?

Now think of a skill you tried to learn as an adult. Something that you didn’t master and gave up on. What was it?

How many attempts do you believe you made at learning _this_ skill?

Do you believe if you had practiced as many times as you did with your childhood skill, the result would have been different? Why or why not?
