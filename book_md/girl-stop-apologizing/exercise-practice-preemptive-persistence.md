## Exercise: Practice Preemptive Persistence

To persist is to experience a setback and continue anyway. Give yourself a head start by predicting the roadblocks you will face.

* * *

Think of a goal youâ€™d like to work on in the upcoming year. For two minutes, write down everything you can think of that could get in your way.

Choose three items from your list and for each one, write down a strategy for avoiding the roadblock.
