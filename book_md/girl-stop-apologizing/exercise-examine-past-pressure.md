## Exercise: Examine Past Pressure

Peer pressure and self-peer pressure can be overcome with practice. Start by identifying where the pressure is coming from and why.

* * *

Think of a recent time when you caved to peer pressure. What happened?

Upon reflection, do you believe someone else was pressuring you, or did you pressure yourself? Explain your thinking.

If you face the situation again, how might you choose to prepare? (Specifically, how would you rehearse the conversation, prepare physically, take the action ahead of time, and so on.)
