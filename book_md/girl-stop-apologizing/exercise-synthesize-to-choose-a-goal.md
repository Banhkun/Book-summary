## Exercise: Synthesize to Choose a Goal

Choosing one goal is difficult if you have many interests. Start by seeing what they have in common and then consider the timing.

* * *

Write down five to 10 goals you have for your life, in no particular order.

Looking at this list, **are there any goals that could happen by accomplishing another?** (For example, if “travel the world” and “make a million dollars” are both on your list, making a million dollars would allow you to travel, while seeing the world won’t make you a million dollars.) **Using this concept, narrow your list down.**

**Consider timing:** Looking at the remaining items on your list, if you had to choose one to accomplish in the next five years (knowing that the others could happen later), which one is most valuable to your life **right now**?
