## Exercise: Recognize Crises

Not just the sciences, but almost every field has certain established beliefs and paradigms. This means that just about anything could be subject to a crisis.

* * *

Are there currently competing paradigms in your field of interest? The field doesnâ€™t have to be in crisis for this to be relevant, just consider whether there are other schools of thought fighting to be recognized.

What might that field look like if one of those other paradigms were dominant?

Could you foresee the current paradigm being overthrown by one of the others? If yes, how? If no, why not?
