## Exercise: Think About Revolutions

While _Structure_ is, of course, focused on scientific revolutions, many discoveries and events across all fields have been described as revolutionary.

Think about a field that’s particularly interesting to you, whether scientific or otherwise. What’s something that has revolutionized that field?

What might that field look like today if that revolution hadn’t happened? What would be better, and what would be worse?
