## 1-Page Summary

#### The Meaning of “Structure” and “Revolution”

Many people have the idea that science progresses in a linear fashion—a straightforward march from ignorance to knowledge. If that were true, then there would be no such thing as scientific revolutions; old ideas would never need to be overturned, only built upon.

However, **not only do scientific revolutions happen, they follow a specific pattern._The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_** lays out this pattern clearly and labels each part of it. The parts are:

  1. _Normal science_ : The process of adding to existing knowledge through experiments and study. 
  2. _Puzzle-solving_ : Finding and fixing discrepancies in science as we currently understand it.
  3. _Paradigm_ : This is a difficult word to define, and the author himself used it in many different ways. However, a paradigm could be seen as a perfect example of an idea, which can be expanded into the framework of a whole field of scientific understanding. For example, think about the evolution of humans from a more ape-like ancestor. Using that paradigm, evolutionary biologists form the framework for all of their studies. 
  4. _Anomaly:_ Someone finds a discrepancy between the current paradigm and experimental results. 
  5. _Crisis_ : The discrepancy can’t be resolved. Scientists loyal to the current paradigm try to dismiss it, while others try to show that the current paradigm is wrong.
  6. _Revolution_ : The old paradigm is overthrown by new information, and eventually a new one takes its place—a “paradigm shift.”



There have been many such revolutions in history that completely changed the way people understood and approached the world. There was a mathematical revolution when the Greeks created proofs to show not only that certain mathematical formulae and postulates work, but _why_ they work. Classical science had a revolution when laboratories and experiments became the preferred way of examining the world, a practice that may have begun with Galileo.

In the 19th century, entire fields of science were codified and sorted into paradigms, including heat, light, and electricity. Phenomena that had baffled scientists could now be categorized and understood. This was around the time of the Industrial Revolution, and likely a direct cause of it. There have been more since then, including Einstein’s theory of relativity and Planck’s first steps into quantum theory.

**Revolutions happen because science is not a straightforward path toward what’s “true.” It’s more like a path away from what’s wrong.**

Karl Popper’s work could be seen as the precursor to this concept of scientific revolutions. Popper taught that scientists come up with broad, testable ideas, and almost inevitably prove them wrong. Then they refine their ideas based on the new information and try again. This cycle of conjectures and refutations is similar to the idea of scientific revolutions, just on a much smaller scale.

### “Normal Science” Within a Paradigm

**The everyday work of scientists could be called _normal science._** This is when they work within a paradigm, trying to solve puzzles and correct discrepancies in it. While _Structure_ occasionally sounds dismissive of normal science, the author actually had great respect for it.

**Normal science doesn’t try to create anything new. Most research journals follow three trends:**

  1. Determining facts
  2. Matching those facts with established theory, which may involve _slightly_ adjusting the theory _._
  3. Developing and explaining those theories, with a focus on larger implications.



However, even though it doesn’t look for them, normal science is exceptionally good at finding anomalies that don’t match up with the current paradigm. This is because, while normal science may restrict the _breadth_ of scientists’ work to what the current paradigm allows, it allows for a _depth_ of study that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. Scientists can devote great amounts of time and energy to studying minute details of the world.

### Anomaly Leads to Crisis, Which Leads to a Changed Worldview

Normal science usually finds what it thinks it’ll find. **However, major discoveries tend to come when that _doesn’t_ happen—in other words, when there’s an anomaly. **Remember, that was the heart of Popper’s philosophy too.

However, even when anomalies are observed, people tend to ignore them or brush them aside. Even scientists will usually see what they expect to see, and not always what’s actually there. Because of this, it can take a long time for science to realize the significance of an anomaly.

Even when an anomaly is so huge that a paradigm clearly has to be rejected, it’s not a simple decision. The problem is that you can’t just reject a paradigm because there’s a problem with it, you have to substitute another paradigm that both solves the problem and shows promise for solving future problems at least as well as the current paradigm does. Doing that means comparing the two paradigms to each other, and to what you’ve observed in the world.

**A crisis is a moment when two or more paradigms are competing to be adopted as _the_ paradigm. **It’s a time of scientific upheaval, when scientists are willing to try anything and debate even the most basic understandings of the field. Out of that scientific free-for-all, we get new ideas and, eventually, new theories.

These new theories eventually lead to a new established paradigm and, from some perspectives, a whole new world in which the scientists now have to work.

### Different Paradigms, Different Worlds

(Shortform note: The word _incommensurable_ comes up frequently in _Structure_. It means “unable to be compared to each other.”)

**Different paradigms are generally incommensurable.** They address different problems, have different standards, and even use different words for things—or use the same words differently.

(Shortform note: This seems to conflict with the idea of “comparing paradigms to each other” in the previous section. That’s because this is a major simplification of what actually happens during a scientific crisis, which the full summary explores in more depth.)

Since it’s impossible to compare one paradigm to another, it can’t really be said that scientists _choose_ a paradigm during a crisis—it’s more accurate to say that they are converted to one. Furthermore, since different paradigms function so differently, it’s often difficult for scientists to communicate and cooperate with each other.

However, this incommensurability can also be helpful. It contributes to specialization, which is how science continues to evolve and progress. **The use of the word “evolve” is not accidental—science specializes, branches off, competes, and evolves in a way that’s completely consistent with biological evolution.**

### Progress Toward Truth—Or the Lack of It

**Recall that many people think of science as cumulative: New ideas are piled on top of old ones to increase the overall knowledge that we have.** This goes hand in hand with the idea that science is moving toward some ultimate “truth” about the universe. And, in fact, this progressive piling-on of new information is exactly what normal science does.

**Scientific revolutions, on the other hand, aren’t about moving closer to the truth—they’re about moving away from old ideas that don’t hold up anymore.** We may need to reject the idea that there is some objective understanding of reality that science can find, some specific end goal that it’s working toward. Much like evolution, science has to change and adapt with its environment; just like there’s no “perfect” species waiting at the end of evolution, there may be no perfect truth waiting at the end of science.
