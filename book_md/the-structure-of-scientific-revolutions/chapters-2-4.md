## Chapters 2-4: All About “Normal Science”

**_Normal science_ means study based on previous scientific knowledge. **That knowledge is usually learned through textbooks and formal education, which outline the main questions of a field and the methods used to answer them. Before textbooks became common, the old classics like Aristotle’s _Physica_ had much the same purpose.

These books became influential for two reasons: first, because they were remarkable enough to attract a loyal following at a time when many schools of thought were competing with each other; second, because they left a lot of questions and unsolved problems—puzzles for their followers to solve.

**Scientific discoveries that have those two characteristics become _paradigms_ :** They are perfect examples of their fields, and a lot of information can be extrapolated from them. Paradigms are at the heart of normal science. They are the models that future experiments and theories are based on. This is why we use phrases like _Newtonian physics:_ physics based on the paradigm of Newton’s discoveries.

Students prepare for their work in chosen scientific communities by studying paradigms. Physicists, for example, would study Newton’s work and how to apply his principles to modern science.

Because of this, scientists in the same community will follow the same rules and models in their work. This helps lead to scientific consensus, which is needed for normal science to progress.

### Establishing Paradigms

**Without a paradigm, it’s hard to know which facts are the most important.** Scientists working without a paradigm will tend to gather whatever facts are easiest for them to find, or most relevant to their other areas of knowledge.

Because of this lack of a singular focus or guide, historians tracing a particular field of study back through time would likely find that,**before there was a common paradigm, each scientist had to recreate the field almost from scratch.**

#### Example: The Study of Light, With and Without Paradigms

For an example of this pattern, let’s look at the history of optics, the study of light. We see a series of scientific revolutions and changing paradigms going back to the 17th century: Modern studies of light are based on the belief that light is made of photons, which have characteristics of both particles and waves. However, before that model was developed in the early 20th century, most physics books taught that light was a wave. If we go back even further, scientists believed light was made of particles and looked for evidence that it puts pressure on solid objects.

However, before the 17th century, there were many competing schools of thought and no one universally-accepted paradigm. **There were so many different schools of thought about light because, at the time, there were no common beliefs or understandings that they could take for granted.** Due to the biases and past experiences each scientist brought, they came to wildly different—but equally valid—conclusions. Each school of thought supported itself by pointing to certain observations about the world that it could explain better than the others. Those observations were that school’s paradigms. These different schools all made significant discoveries that helped Newton to create the first almost-universally accepted model of light in the 17th century.

#### How Initial Paradigms Develop

Scientific writings from before a paradigm was established are a confusing jumble. They tend to contain incorrect information (or at least information that doesn’t fit with our current paradigm), accurate facts with implications that scientists of the day didn’t realize, and observations that were too abstract or too complex to relate to the rest of the field.

It shouldn’t be surprising that science performed without a paradigm leads to a lot of different schools of thought. **In fact, it might be more surprising that those discrepancies usually disappear.**

This usually happens because one school of thought becomes prominent over the others. That prominent idea will attract the next generation of scientists, and other schools of thought will die out.

For example, early electricians (in the scientific sense, not the modern sense) came to their first paradigm because a scientist who thought electricity was a liquid tried to capture some in a jar and created the Leyden jar, a primitive battery. What he learned from that experiment formed the basis of the most convincing arguments of the time, which eventually led to his school of thought becoming the paradigm of the time.

However, it’s important to note that even though electricity-as-liquid was the dominant argument of the time, it couldn’t answer every question about electricity. Paradigms must be more convincing than competing ideas, but they don’t need to explain everything. In fact, those unanswered questions are what make normal science possible.

In some ways, **establishing a paradigm is what cements a field of study as a science.** Once a paradigm is set, scientists don’t need to recreate the field from scratch every time they begin their studies. This allows them to explore problems that are both more concrete and more obscure. For example, once Darwin’s work cemented evolution as a paradigm, future evolutionary biologists could move on to questions like, “What is the mechanism by which evolution happens?”

**Most fields of study will follow a similar pattern.** However, there are a few exceptions. Fields like Math and Astronomy have paradigms dating back to prehistoric times, so there’s no way of tracing them to their beginnings. Some more modern fields like Biochemistry came about as combinations of already-existing specialties, so there was no early period before Biochemical paradigms existed. Finally, some fields are so new (relatively speaking) that the first universally accepted paradigm hasn’t been established yet; some types of social science are still in this state.

### What Does Normal Science Do?

**A scientific paradigm is something to be further studied and refined under new or stricter conditions.** Paradigms tend to be very limited and imprecise when they’re first established, so normal science is all about expanding the paradigm and filling the gaps in it.

Normal science doesn’t try to find new theories or explanations for things. In fact, new information that doesn’t fit the paradigm is usually ignored or brushed aside completely. _However_ , that’s not to say that normal science should be disparaged. While the paradigm hugely reduces the scope of normal science, it allows the depth of study that’s key to advancing science. In fact, most scientists practice normal science for their entire careers.

**Normal science has three common areas of interest.** The first is taking what we already know and improving the specificity, accuracy, or breadth of that knowledge. Scientists will try to make observations that line up with the example set by the paradigm, thereby making the paradigm stronger and more convincing.

One example was Foucault demonstrating that the speed of light is slightly reduced by water; his experiment strengthened the then-current wave theory of light, since the previous particle theory said that water would “pull” on the light particles and make them move faster.

The second area of interest is finding problems in the paradigm and solving them. For example, Newton proposed the existence of gravity, but it wasn’t until a century later that scientists were able to measure a universal gravitational constant. Science’s inability to come up with that constant was seen as a major problem with the paradigm, and it may have led to a crisis if it had remained unsolved.

The third area of interest is closely related to the second. It involves applying a paradigm to phenomena other than the ones it was originally based on, proving that it works under more circumstances. Broadening the paradigm is another method of strengthening it.

**However, normal science is not purely experimental; it has theoretical aspects too.** Theoretical science’s areas of interest are similar to experimental science.

First, theoretical science uses existing theories to predict new facts, preferably ones that can then be confirmed by experiments. Second, it connects theories to observations about the world, thereby making the theory stronger. Third, it finds problems in the accepted theory and solves them—sometimes this happens simply by rewording or clarifying the theory, rather than actually adjusting it.

### Solving Puzzles Through Science

**One of the most notable things about normal science is that it doesn’t try to find new information, but only to confirm and refine current beliefs.** Results that don’t fit into the paradigm are often set aside, and sometimes don’t make sense until much later.

For example, early experiments that showed the attractive power of electricity didn’t give consistent or easily explained results, so they were set aside as unexplained phenomena. It wasn’t until the paradigm shifted away from the liquid model of electricity that they started making sense.

Given this fact, it might seem strange that so many people are so interested in normal science. However, normal science is still challenging**—it’s often about _how_ to get the expected results, rather than the results themselves. **It’s like solving a jigsaw puzzle: Even though you already know what the outcome is supposed to be (the picture on the box), the challenge and the enjoyment come from figuring out how to achieve it.

A scientist can prove his or her skill and creativity by solving a difficult scientific puzzle. This can also involve developing all sorts of new procedures and equipment, which are worthy challenges for any scientist.

**A key aspect of puzzles is that they must have solutions.** Therefore, scientific fields will tend to look for problems that—if their paradigms hold true—are solvable. Problems outside of that scope will often be dismissed as belonging to a different field of science, or as just too obscure or troublesome to bother with.

**Also, both puzzles and scientific problems must have rules by which those solutions can be found.** For example, in the eighteenth century, scientists consistently failed to apply Newton’s laws of motion to the movement of the moon. Some scientists suggested replacing one of his mathematical laws with a different one that would work for the problem—however, that would have been changing the paradigm, and thus breaking the rules. Finally, in 1750, a scientist found the solution using Newton’s laws as they were written, and so the paradigm remained in effect.

**Scientific “rules” fall into 4 major categories.** The first is scientific laws and theories, such as Newton’s Laws of Motion. The second is which scientific instruments may be used to study the paradigm, and how.

The third category is broad, high-level concepts. For example, in the mid 17th century, scientists believed that the entire universe—including all natural forces—was made of particles. They believed that every natural phenomenon could be explained by particle size and shape, how they moved, and how they interacted with each other. Therefore, the “rules” of that time would force them to explain any findings in those terms, such as describing light as tiny, solid bodies that travel in a straight line and have some minuscule amount of momentum.

The fourth category is personal rules for scientists. Unlike the previous categories, this tends to be the same across all fields of study. In short, scientists must be committed to examining and understanding the world, with special focus on some particular part of it. If their studies reveal anomalies, either the methods or the theories must be refined.

However, scientists in a given field have more in common than just rules they follow, which is why we place so much emphasis on the paradigms they use. **Rules come from paradigms, but paradigms can be used as guides even without established rules** (this is explored in the next chapter).
