## Part 4: The Influence of Caste Systems on Society | Chapter 9: The Fallout of Progress

Now that we’ve addressed the individual consequences of caste, let’s take a look at the impact of caste systems on entire societies. In this chapter, we’ll explore the shift that happened in the U.S. in 2008 that sparked a resurgence of inter-caste tensions.

According to the author, caste tensions in post-Civil Rights era America simmered beneath the surface until the 21st century. The first harbinger of renewed racial animosity was the 2008 election of Democrat Barack Obama and the resulting vengeful quest by many white Americans to restore power to the dominant caste.

(Shortform note: Barack Obama’s successful campaign for the 2008 election presented such a threat to the established racial order that assassination was a looming threat. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security authorized Secret Service protection for then-Senator Obama beginning in 2007, a full 18 months before he was first elected president. This is the earliest any president has received Secret Service protection.)

### White America’s Revenge

**Most white Americans didn’t vote for Obama in either of his elections.** According to the author, only 43% of white Americans voted for Obama in 2008, or two in every five white voters. The percentage dropped to 39% in 2012. (Shortform note: In contrast, a full 95% of Black voters voted for Obama in 2008 and 93% voted for him in 2012. Additionally, the 2008 election saw a surge of minority voters, who made up a bigger share of the overall electorate than ever before.)

These numbers aren’t surprising because most white voters lean Republican. Wilkerson believes this is because, since the 1960s, the Republican party has positioned itself as the party that upheld Christian values, maintained laws that favored the dominant caste, and pushed against efforts to grant access to those seen as inferior. In contrast, the Democratic party branded itself as the party that represented all people, regardless of race or economic status.

The line was drawn between the political parties following the path paved by the caste system. **In response,** **many white voters, even those claiming to be progressive, switched allegiance to the Republican party because it represented their race’s interests**. Therefore, white voters saw Obama’s election as a threat to not only their political identity but their racial identity as well.

(Shortform note: According to political scientist Vincent Hutchings, the Black exodus from the Republican party began even earlier, in the 1930s, because Black voters approved of Democratic president Franklin Roosevelt’s economic response to the Great Depression. By the 1960s, two-thirds of Black voters were already registered Democrats; by 2014, almost 90% of Black voters were Democrats. White voters, on the other hand, are much more split: About 51% lean Republican while about 43% lean Democratic.)

#### The Plot to Win Back America

**According to the author, many in the dominant caste did everything they could to make Obama’s presidency as difficult and ineffectual as possible.** Congress denied or created barricades to almost every action Obama attempted to make, forcing him to rely on executive orders to accomplish anything. (Shortform note: While Obama did have to contend with a hostile Congress as Wilkerson describes, his use of executive orders wasn’t out of the ordinary. According to data from the American Presidency Project, Obama issued roughly the same number of executive orders in his two terms in office as his predecessor, George W. Bush, whose party dominated both the Senate and the House of Representatives during his presidency.)

More damaging in Wilkerson’s eyes were the efforts to push back racial progress. Republicans created several laws aimed at making it harder for many Americans to vote. **Several states erased approximately 16 million voter registrations and required new registration procedures that made it easier to deny someone their right to vote.** One such strategy was the requirement of new state-sanctioned IDs that were difficult to obtain and could be dismissed for something as small as a misplaced apostrophe in a name. These restrictions specifically targeted marginalized communities. (Shortform note: Wilkerson doesn’t go into detail explaining why these laws are so discriminatory. According to the ACLU, up to 11% of U.S. citizens don’t have government-issued photo identification. That’s because these forms of ID (like driver’s licenses and passports) cost money, and people from marginalized groups are less likely to have discretionary income to spend.)

In addition, Wilkerson describes how the number of hate groups in America doubled during Obama’s first term, as did anti-Black sentiments in mainstream society. The dream that Obama’s election was a sign of a post-racial America quickly evaporated. (Shortform note: Wilkerson is right to conclude that white reactions to Obama’s election caused the sudden surge in hate groups. One scholar found that the rate of new hate groups slowed significantly after 2016 because “Trump’s election signaled the closing of the perceived threats that drove hate groups to form during the Obama administration.”)

#### A Dangerous Consequence of Backlash

According to Wilkerson, the result of this resurgence of hate and anti-Black sentiment was increased violence against Black Americans. **Harkening back to the days of Jim Crow lynchings, unarmed Black citizens were killed during encounters with law enforcement at an alarming rate.** The number of incidents grew to such a degree that studies found that Blacks were five times more likely to be killed by police than whites were, making death at the hands of police a leading cause of death for Black males. Black men and boys suddenly had a 1 in 1,000 chance of dying at the hands of police officers.

(Shortform note: The data for deaths in police custody have additional nuances that Wilkerson doesn’t cover. Research shows that, overall, Black men are more than twice as likely to die at the hands of police officers than white men. However, age plays an important role: For white men, the risk of being killed by police is most concentrated between the ages of 20 and 35, after which it dwindles; for Black men, the risk stays high well into their 40s. This may be because, in general, people see Black men as more threatening than white men, so officers may perceive even older Black men as threats that require force to subdue.)

### Revealing Buried Resentment

In 2016, America prepared to vote for Obama’s successor. Wilkerson argues that this election was the catalyst that revealed the white resentment that had built up during the Obama administration.

According to Wilkerson, the American public had two options for who would be their new leader. As she describes it, in one corner, there was Hilary Clinton, a highly experienced woman representing the moderate and liberal factions of society. In the other was Donald Trump, a conservative man with a penchant for using hateful rhetoric about anyone different and a history of inappropriate and illegal behavior against women. Many people believed the choice was a no-brainer, but **they weren’t prepared for the wave of unseasonable prejudice that would expose the toxins below the surface of American society**.

(Shortform note: The election of Donald Trump came as a shock even to expert political forecasters. For example, on the day of the election, famed forecaster Nate Silver gave Trump just a 28.6% chance of winning, despite having correctly predicted election results in all 50 states in the 2012 presidential election and 49 out of 50 states in the 2008 election. Other analysts gave Trump even slimmer odds, ranging from 1% to 15%.)

#### Voter Psychology

So how exactly did Trump win? According to Wilkerson, he won because people choose who to vote for based on the traits that are most important in their own lives—which, for many white voters, was their privileged racial identity. Therefore, when a majority of the dominant caste entered the voting booths in 2016, the candidate who supported their highest-ranked characteristic—their whiteness—received their vote. Trump promised to restore power to the white race, and the promise was too enticing to pass up.

(Shortform note: While Wilkerson’s analysis of voter psychology is interesting, it’s not enough to explain Trump’s victory because Hilary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes. Furthermore, nearly 40% of white people voted for Clinton—not Trump. Trump’s victory arguably had more to do with the fact that five electoral college voters who had pledged to vote for Clinton ultimately voted for someone else—like Colin Powell, the former secretary of state and prominent Republican figure who wasn't even running for president.)

In Wilkerson’s view, the most surprising representation of this psychology were white women voters. Instead of supporting the first female presidential candidate and helping to make history for their gender, 53% voted for a man accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and misconduct (to contrast, only 4% of Black women voted for Trump, while 94% voted for Clinton). For white women, promoting their caste became more important than breaking the glass ceiling in the White House. These results show that the national psychology that elected Trump had more to do with caste traditions than anything else.

(Shortform note: Further analyses have shown that the 53% statistic isn’t actually true: In reality, experts think closer to 47% of white women voted for Trump. However, given that at least 26 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct since the 1970s, it’s still significant that nearly half of white women voters cast their vote for him.)

### The Division of American Life

Wilkerson argues that the immense divide between the candidates’ ideologies created an equally large divide in the American public.**The choice became one of supporting equality, moral values, and justice or protecting a way of life long dead but awaiting a resurrection** by those who’d grown increasingly frustrated with the costs of diversity and equality in their lives. (Shortform note: Wilkerson’s argument that only one side was promoting “moral values” may be a bit oversimplified because what counts as “moral” depends on which values are most important to you. For example, for many conservatives, tradition and hard work are “moral values” that may outweigh equality and justice. Thus, people on _both_ sides likely voted in light of their own values.)

In Wilkerson’s view,**the consequence of that ignited flame was an uncovering of deep-rooted racism.** As the 2016 election race picked up momentum, the Republican candidate became the spokesperson for all the rage and fear felt by many white Americans for some time. His racist rhetoric spawned an ideology that empowered them to feel comfortable waving their prejudice flags. His followers became fiercely loyal and vocal about their similar desire to return America to a time when white supremacy was the norm.

> **Understanding Southern Trump Supporters’ Motivations**
> 
> The reasons why people supported Trump are perhaps even more nuanced than Wilkerson suggests, as evidenced by the work of sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild, who interviewed conservative voters in the American South in the years leading up to the 2016 election. In _Strangers in Their Own Land_ , Hochschild describes how the threat of losing majority race status reflects the loss of social status that white conservatives feel they’ve suffered as other groups (like women, people of color, and LGBTQ people) have gained more cultural power. For many southern white conservatives, the progress of groups who don’t share their traditional values feels like a deeply personal attack on their way of life.
> 
> According to Hochschild, this explains why many conservative voters continually vote “against their own interests” (meaning they vote for leaders and policies that negatively impact their quality of life): They’re voting in their own emotional interest by protecting their values and identity, even if that means voting against their own _economic_ interests. This explains why working-class, Southern, white Americans voted for Trump in 2016, despite the fact that his economic policies catered to the richest Americans.

### The Aftermath of the 2016 Election

According to Wilkerson, the mobilization of this faction of supporters was too great for Clinton to overcome. Donald Trump—and the return to upper caste dominance that he symbolized—won the day. As a result, violence against those in the middle and lower castes spiked across the country. Ultimately, 2017 became one of the deadliest years in history, with an onslaught of mass shootings in public places, including schools, concerts, and churches. (Shortform note: Hate crimes spiked from 6,121 reported incidents in 2016 to 7,175 incidents reported in 2017. According to FBI data, the number has continued to hover above seven thousand every year since.)

Politically, Wilkerson believes the new president was polarizing Americans even further. Revelations about corruption by his administration came to light, and for the third time in history, the president was tried for impeachment. The Democrat-led House of Representatives voted to impeach, but the Republican-dominated Senate acquitted him. **The president’s victory became a victory for his supporters and validated his behaviors to date.**(Shortform note: In January 2021, the House of Representatives brought articles of impeachment against Trump for the second time, this time as a result of his support for the January 6th storming of the Capitol building. As before, the Republican-led Senate acquitted him.)

Wilkerson argues that perhaps the most telling evidence of the extreme division among Americans was the response to the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. president used the virus to spread anti-Chinese sentiments and blamed the media for inflating the severity of the virus, going as far as calling it a hoax. In the end, the virus grew at a faster rate in the United States than in any other country, leaving several hundred thousand dead and millions infected. (Shortform note: The coronavirus pandemic disproportionately impacted Black, Latinx, and Asian communities, further contributing to racial division in the United States. Additionally, anti-Asian hate crimes rose 145% from 2019 to 2020, and one study found a direct link between Trump’s pandemic rhetoric and a surge of online anti-Asian hate speech.)

### A Lack of Foresight

Today, many people feel shocked about the state of things in America. According to Wilkerson, the deep-seated sentiments of white supremacy and hate seemed to sprout overnight, but they were actually there the whole time under the surface. It took the toxic platform and behaviors of one man to thaw the landscape of progress enough to allow the poison to seep out. As a result, **Americans are now unsure of what to do with the exposed hate and whether it’s even containable**. (Shortform note: While many Americans were shocked about the surge of vocal racism after the 2016 election, that sense of surprise was not universal. In an interview, _How to Be an Antiracist _author Ibram X. Kendi argues that many people of color didn’t experience the same shock because they grew up enduring racist abuse and were well aware of the country’s racist undercurrent that many white Americans never recognized.)
