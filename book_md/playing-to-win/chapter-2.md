## Chapter 2: Envision Your Company’s Ideal Future

The next five chapters will take you through Lafley and Martin’s waterfall strategy, question by question.

**Question 1: What is your company’s ideal future? (In the authors’ terms, your “winning aspiration”)**

To answer the first question, which starts the waterfall, **figure out your definition of success and what you want your company to achieve.** The answer, your _ideal future_ , can include a statement of purpose, but it’s not _only_ a statement of purpose. It’s also a statement of what success—or “winning”—would look like at your company. Once a company understands what it wants to achieve, it can take clear and specific actions toward that ideal future.

Lafley and Martin say that **your goals must involve serving and pleasing your customers** : If consumers like your company and your products, then you’ll naturally succeed in the marketplace. The authors add that focusing exclusively on internal issues (like profit margins, or marginal improvements to your products) will blind you to external market demands and make you less likely to reach your ideal future.

In other words, Lafley and Martin say that to figure out your ideal future, you have to determine what your business is really about—not just _what_ you do, but _why_ you do it. The authors say that, generally, companies will tell you their business is their product or service.**In reality, though, all successful companies are in the business of _meeting customer needs_ —the product or service is just the vehicle. **For example, is a bar really in the business of serving alcoholic beverages, or is it providing a way for people to unwind and socialize?

(Shortform note: In _Start With Why_ , Simon Sinek tells us why it’s crucial to understand the reason behind your business: Your product or service (your _what_) engages people’s rational minds, but your purpose (your _why_) engages their feelings. He adds that emotion-based decisions are reached more quickly and are less prone to outside influences than logic-based decisions—in other words, if a customer buys a product just because they like it, they’ll make that decision faster and feel more secure in it than if they buy a product because they researched and compared numerous similar products and decided on the “best” one.)

To figure out how to best serve your customers, **first research what the customer needs, then tailor your company to meet that need better than anyone else.**

> **The Three Perspectives of Business**
> 
> Your customers’ needs are just one of three critical elements that must be addressed in a successful business strategy:
> 
>   * The customer: Who is buying your product?
> 
>   * The investor: Who is covering your costs?
> 
>   * The producer: Who is making your product?
> 
> 

> 
> Many business plans fail because they only consider the perspective of the producer—the company making the product or providing the service. Such narrow business plans tend to gush about groundbreaking technologies and revolutionary ideas, but overlook the fact that they’ll need people to invest in those innovations—and, even more importantly, they’ll need people who want to buy them.
> 
> That’s why Lafley and Martin say to begin with customer needs: First identify the need, and then determine how your great new innovation will allow you to meet that need better than anyone else does.

### The Importance of Playing to Win

Lafley and Martin say that**you must play to win because it’s _hard_ to win.** Many companies that want to win still lose. So, if you’re just trying to compete rather than dominate, you’ll have no chance at all—you won’t devote the time and resources necessary to stay in the game.

(Shortform note: In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone also discusses the importance of trying to dominate rather than merely compete—but for different reasons: Cardone says that if you’re in a competition mindset, you’ll waste time watching your rivals and copying what they do, which is a recipe for failure.**** While Cardone does urge you to _learn_ from your competitors, he warns against trying to emulate them or directly compete with them. Instead, with a mindset of domination rather than competition, look for the next great innovation that’ll let you completely bypass your competitors and corner the market.)

In any market, you’re naturally going to have competitors, many of whom will also have developed ideal futures and effective strategies to reach them. Therefore, Lafley and Martin suggest honing your strategy by identifying the competitor that is most formidable. **Then ask: What are they doing that I’m not? How are they serving people better than I am? How can I overtake them?**

Note that your strongest competitor might not be the most obvious one. For example, if you’re running a tech startup, it’s unlikely that you’ll be directly competing with Microsoft or Google right off the bat. Your strongest competitor in that case might be a much smaller company that’s targeting the same section of the market as you.

> **Respect Your Competitors**
> 
> In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek suggests viewing your competitors not just as rivals, but as worthy rivals. It’s a fine distinction, but Sinek believes that it’s an important shift in mindset: Respecting your competitors’ abilities means that you won’t just try to win, you’ll work harder to become _good enough_ to win.
> 
> Imagine yourself as a boxer with an upcoming match. If you don’t respect your opponent, you won’t train as hard before the match—you won’t think it’s necessary. However, if you believe that your opponent is a worthy rival, you’ll be motivated to work hard and improve as much as possible before stepping into the ring.
> 
> As Lafley and Martin say, one highly effective way to improve your skills is to study your opponent, see what he or she does better than you, and use what you learn to shore up your weaknesses.
