## Chapter 7: Work Through the Waterfall

Now that we’ve covered the five steps of Lafley and Martin’s waterfall strategy, we’ll delve into exactly _how_ to make decisions at each step. **There’s no surefire formula for victory, but there are frameworks that, if used correctly, can serve as jumping-off points and make success more likely _._**

> **Leverage Uncertainty Through Options**
> 
> Lafley and Martin say that there’s no sure way to win in the marketplace because there are always unknown variables and uncertainty in any strategy. In _Antifragile_ , statistician and risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains how to make uncertainty work in your favor instead of against you.
> 
> One of Taleb’s key points is to always leave yourself as many options as possible; every option you have available helps you to maximize opportunities and minimize harm from any sudden changes. For example, if you’re considering reducing your staff to save on overhead, keep those workers around for as long as is feasible—you’ll always have the _option_ to let them go later. That way, you’re ready for one of two possibilities:
> 
>   * If the market improves and there’s a sudden increase in demand, you’ll have trained and experienced staff ready to take full advantage of it.
> 
>   * If the market suffers, you can proceed with the layoffs to minimize your losses.
> 
> 

> 
> In the meantime, the only cost of maintaining that option is the same salaries that you’ve been paying them the whole time.

**While you work through Lafley and Martin’s waterfall strategy, remember that no decision is final.** Each step of the waterfall affects all the others (not just those below it), and every strategy can change based on shifting market conditions. Therefore, even following this guide, you’ll most likely come back to the early steps and rethink the decisions you make.

> **Remove Ego From Your Decisions**
> 
> When responding to changing circumstances, one unforeseen obstacle can be your own sense of pride. In _Ego Is the Enemy_ , Ryan Holiday explains that**** pride (or ego) can prevent us from recognizing when we’ve made a bad decision or admitting that we need to change our approach.
> 
> He explains that someone with too much ego sees failure as a personal attack, rather than a part of life. When you feel attacked, you respond with emotion and instinct rather than logic; you become defensive, blame others, and stop working to improve your situation. This kind of emotional reaction can turn a temporary setback into a permanent defeat.
> 
> Holiday’s solution is to focus on _what you’re doing_ , rather than _who you are_. In other words, when you encounter failure or defeat, your question shouldn’t be, “What does this situation say about me?” Rather, ask yourself, “How can I turn this situation around?”**** Separating your sense of self from the situation will help you make rational and intelligent decisions.

### For Step 1: Develop Winning Aspirations

Since your strategies will change frequently in response to the market, Lafley and Martin say that you shouldn’t worry about creating a perfect definition of “winning.”**** Instead, **create a working set of winning aspirations and commit to frequently revisiting them as you work through the other steps.**

> **Counterpoint: You Can’t “Win” Business**
> 
> In contrast to Lafley and Martin’s emphasis on winning, Simon Sinek argues in _The Infinite Game_ that you can’t “win” in business. That’s because business is an _infinite_ game, an ongoing process that nobody ever wins; the point is to play as long and as well as possible. On the other hand, games and sports are _finite_ games—distinct events that end with winners and losers.
> 
> Sinek believes this is an important distinction because infinite games require completely different mindsets and strategies from finite games. To play an infinite game like business, Sinek recommends you:
> 
>   * **Focus on sustainability.** Because the game lasts forever, the best strategies are the ones that you can sustain indefinitely. Overspending your resources for a short-term edge in the market will leave you at a severe disadvantage once your resources run low.
> 
>   * **Focus on flexibility.** Instead of creating specific strategies to “beat” your opponents, pursue innovations and opportunities that will make your company stronger, more resilient to market shocks, or more adaptable to changing circumstances.
> 
>   * **Take the long view.** Worry more about your long-term success than your short-term profits. If a project briefly cuts into your bottom line, but puts you in a stronger position overall, it’s worth the cost.
> 
>   * **Consider your impact.** Unlike finite games, infinite games have effects that reach far beyond the game itself. Therefore, consider what effects your play style might have on your employees, your community, and the world as a whole.
> 
> 


### For Steps 2 Through 4: Decide Where to Play and How to Win

When deciding where to play, how to win, and what capabilities you’ll need, consider the following four questions. Answer them in order, then make a strategic choice based on your answers:

**1) How is your industry structured—who are the current big players, and who are the small players on the rise? How much money could different markets within that industry make you?**

**Map the industry** to answer this question. The authors suggest breaking your industry into many smaller pieces: For example, you might divide it by geographic regions, product types, or distribution channels. They add that the market evolves rapidly, so you must **continually monitor how your industry is changing and adjust your maps** accordingly.

Consider how attractive the different parts of the industry are—how much profit you stand to make in each—so you can choose where to play. This requires you to analyze how much bargaining power your suppliers and customers have (in other words, how much control you have over your own prices and how much of a profit margin you can earn), as well as how much competition you’ll face from current players and potential new entrants into that market.

> **How to Find Your Market**
> 
> Examining your industry and looking for available markets is sometimes called Blue Ocean Strategy, after the book of the same title. While Lafley and Martin say that a company can win through either cost leadership or differentiation, _Blue Ocean Strategy_ relies almost entirely on differentiation. In the book, Renée Mauborgne and W. Chan Kim discuss how to find and capitalize on your ideal market by breaking it down into three steps:
> 
>   * **Innovate:** By definition, finding a market with little to no competition means offering something that nobody else is offering: either an entirely new product, or something distinctly different from and superior to your competitors’ products.
> 
>   * **Set your price:** Price your product in such a way that imitators will find it hard (if not impossible) to match you, but that still protects your desired profit margins. If it’s impossible to fulfill both of those conditions, then your product won’t work and you need to return to innovating.
> 
>   * **Execute.** With your product designed and appropriately priced, you’re ready to execute your blue ocean strategy.
> 
> 


**2) What do your customers want?**

Lafley and Martin note that, if your company sells directly to retailers, then your customers include those retailers as well as the people buying your products off the shelves. Just like you, retailers want high profit margins and repeat customers.

**Data about how customers are buying your product and what distributors want can help you decide whether it’s best to pursue a strategy of widespread distribution of a cheaper product or a more prestigious product with bigger margins**. If customers are only willing to buy your product at a very low price, the former strategy is likely better. In contrast, if they think of your product as a luxury good and are willing to pay more for it, the latter might be more successful.

The authors say that every company has to worry about their “end consumers”: the people buying the products off the rack. **You can’t just ask them what they want, because customers don’t always know what they want until they see it** —before the invention of air conditioning, people would have said they wanted stronger fans. Therefore, you have to invest a lot of resources to ascertain customer needs: what they buy, what they look at but don’t buy, and what their return rate is.

> **How to Learn About Your Customers**
> 
> As Lafley and Martin say, effective market research requires investing a lot of resources—however, those resources don’t have to be monetary. Some low-cost alternatives to expensive surveys and customer outreach include:
> 
>   * **Observation:** Watching what customers do—which stores they go to, which products they buy, and so on—costs you nothing but time.
> 
>   * **Research:** See if something similar to your idea has been tried before. Look for industry reports, academic reports, and case studies related to your business.
> 
>   * **Investigation:** There are a lot of hints about your customers available if you know where to look. For example, the ZIP codes on their credit cards from online purchases (combined with readily-available census data) will tell you what demographics you’re attracting. You can also visit your competitors’ stores to get a sense of their pricing and advertising strategies.
> 
>   * **Experimentation:** Especially if you’re running a small business where you call all the shots, experimenting with different ideas can cost significantly less than trying to ask all of your customers what they think they want. For example, if you’re a deli considering bringing in a new type of cheese, offer free samples to your customers and see what they say.
> 
> 


**3) Do you have an advantage over your competitors?**

Lafley and Martin suggest asking yourself two simple questions to determine whether you have an advantage over your rivals in either differentiation or cost leadership.

The two questions are:

  1. Am I meeting the needs of my customers better than my competitors? (Differentiation)
  2. Are my costs lower than my competitors’? (Cost leadership)



**If you don’t have an advantage, and you can’t figure out how to improve based on a good understanding of what your customers want, it may be time to exit the sector.**

> **How to Keep Your Edge**
> 
> Lafley and Martin repeatedly tell us to look for advantages in either customer service or cost, but they downplay the fact that those advantages must be _consistent_ and _sustainable_ —a momentary advantage that your competitors can quickly duplicate isn’t grounds for winning. In _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy_ , Richard Rumelt suggests four ways you can sustain and press your advantage.
> 
>   * **Increase the advantage.** If you have an advantage, build it up even more by reducing your product’s cost, increasing its value to customers, or (if possible) both.
> 
>   * **Broaden the advantage.** Apply your advantage in new markets and against new competitors. Identify which capabilities your advantage relies on (such as employee skills, manufacturing, and distribution) and look for new markets that rely on those same capabilities. For example, Facebook has the capabilities to collect user data and use that to customize user experience, so entering the streaming market was a natural step for the company.
> 
>   * **Increase demand for the advantage.** Use advertisements and marketing to either increase the number of people buying your product or increase the amount each person buys.
> 
>   * **Prevent competitors from copying the advantage.** Protect your advantage with trademarks and copyrights. Deter would-be copycats by constantly updating and improving your product.
> 
> 


**4) How do you think your competitors will respond to any action you decide to take?**

Unlike with the previous three questions, answering this means you’ll have to guess, since you can’t accurately predict what your competitors will do at any given moment. However, Lafley and Martin argue that you _have_ to make these guesses—if you don’t, your strategy will be based only on the present circumstances.**** Then,**if the situation shifts based on a competitor’s response and you’re unprepared, your strategy will completely fall apart.**

> **Be Firm, Yet Flexible**
> 
> Sun Tzu’s _The Art of War _is a primer on military tactics, but people have applied its lessons to many different aspects of life, including business strategy. Sun Tzu provides us with two seemingly contradictory lessons about how to adapt to changing situations:
> 
>   * Have a clear and focused plan for victory.
> 
>   * Observe your enemies and adjust your plans based on _their_ preparations.
> 
> 

> 
> In other words, a successful strategy needs to be both stable and flexible—your goals and overall plan should be fixed well before the conflict, but the details will change as the situation does. For example, Sun Tzu might know ahead of time that a cavalry charge will be the key to breaking the enemy ranks and winning the battle, but exactly where he positions his cavalry and when he signals them to charge will depend on the landscape and his enemies’ actions.

### For Step 5: Form an Effective Leadership Team

Lafley and Martin warn that, even if you go through the steps of the waterfall perfectly, success is not guaranteed. Instead, the point is to**make your odds for success as good as possible, and for that you need a strong team making the decisions.**

An effective way to make group decisions is to **ask _what needs to be true_ for a particular strategy to be successful**. This approach allows people to think creatively and work as a team to figure out how to meet those needs. Lafley and Martin urge you to**figure out—as a team—how to create the ideal market situation for your strategy.** If creating that situation isn’t feasible, then neither is the strategy.

Most organizations aren’t good at bettering their odds in this way. A team often comes up with a single strategy, which they analyze to show that their strategy will work and is cost-effective based on current market trends. The problem is that this type of analysis only reflects _what’s true at the moment_.

> **Counterpoint: The Benefits of Snap Judgments**
> 
> Lafley and Martin advocate for careful planning, developing multiple strategies, and using forethought and predictions to determine which strategy will serve you best. Conversely, in _Blink_ , Malcolm Gladwell discusses unconscious thinking (sometimes called a snap judgment, or “going with your gut”). Gladwell believes that unconscious thinking is often as effective as conscious, rational thinking, with the added benefits of happening more quickly and being less likely to get derailed by stress or anxiety.
> 
> Gladwell believes that your subconscious mind naturally takes in a huge amount of information, filters out what’s irrelevant, and returns the best answer to your current problem. Therefore, if you need to come up with an idea quickly, unconscious thinking is the best way to do it.
> 
> However, unconscious thinking has some potential pitfalls, especially in a team management situation:
> 
>   * It’s subject to biases that you might otherwise if you took your time.
> 
>   * It’s difficult to explain how you reached a decision—unconscious thinking isn’t a rational process, so trying to rationalize the answer is nearly impossible.
> 
> 

> 
> The key is to know when “going with your gut” will be effective and when it won’t. For example, do you have good instincts for this particular situation? Will your team trust your gut feeling, and/or will you be able to explain your reasoning in a satisfactory way? If not, then the much slower process of rational thought and the team decision-making process will serve you better.
> 
> You could also use unconscious thinking as part of the conscious planning and strategizing process: Put forward your gut instinct as simply one more plan for the team to consider, and see if others agree that it’s a good idea.

Lafley and Martin offer a seven-part process for deciding on a strategy by determining the necessary conditions for its success:

#### Part 1: Lay the Groundwork for a Choice

Lafley and Martin say you should begin by identifying the problem you’re trying to solve and boiling your options down to a clear either/or choice—for example, if you need to reduce overhead, perhaps your options are to either fire employees or cut down on distribution to an expensive place. Next, ask what information you need to figure out which solution is best. **Note that you’re not making a decision yet; you’re figuring out what groundwork you’ll need to make that decision.**

> **Consider Options Using the “Toggle” Technique**
> 
> The Toggle Technique can help you consider different options. Here’s how it works:
> 
>   * **Center yourself.** Take a moment to close your eyes and breathe. You’re about to engage in a fairly strenuous mental exercise, so make sure you’re calm and prepared for it.
> 
>   * **“Pick” an option.** Think about the first option on your list and imagine that you’ve already chosen it—imagine that you’re 100% committed and there’s no going back. Does it make you feel excited? Nervous? Sick to your stomach? Your emotional responses will be crucial in eventually making a decision.
> 
>   * **Toggle.** Once you’ve examined your emotional response to the first option, switch to the next one on your list and imagine that you’re 100% committed to that one instead. Again, check in with your feelings. Repeat this process for every option you’re considering.
> 
>   * **Choose.** Once you’ve checked in with your “gut” on every option, pick the one that feels the best.
> 
> 


#### Part 2: Imagine Potential Strategies

Laying the groundwork required you to have two options to consider. **Now that you have those two logical options, think about _every_ possible strategy for solving a problem, no matter how off-the-wall it seems.** Lafley and Martin suggest that, during these sessions, you don’t put the ideas through any sort of vetting process—just let solutions fly and imagine the positive outcomes of each. Commit to being open to new ideas, no matter how unusual.

(Shortform note: In _Purple Cow,_ Seth Godin suggests that you use these brainstorming sessions to intentionally come up with the most extreme, over-the-top options you can imagine. Godin reasons that to create an exceptional product, you should start by finding the outer limits of possibility. Then determine which of those extreme options will get you the kind of customer attention that you want, and figure out how to implement it.)

#### Part 3: Determine the Conditions for Success

After you’ve written down all of your potential solutions, the authors tell you to move on to figuring out what market conditions would be necessary for each of those possibilities to succeed. Doing so requires a sort of reverse engineering—**start with the assumption that each potential solution is a good one, and work backward to what conditions would make that so.**

In other words, don’t ask whether strategies would be successful based on current conditions; that might lead you to throw away potentially strong strategies simply because they wouldn’t be successful _now_. Instead, ask what conditions each strategy would _need_ for success. This approach acknowledges that **even strategies that wouldn’t work now may work in different conditions** , thus encouraging people to think about them more thoroughly.

Consider what would need to be true in each of the areas that we’ve previously discussed:

  * **Industry structure:** What would need to be true about the industry you’re hoping to compete in, and the particular segment of that industry you’re targeting? For example, maybe there would have to be a particular niche for your business to fill. 
  * **Customer values:** What would need to be true about what your customers want and value? For example, people would need to buy the product or service you’re hoping to sell.****
  * **Competitiveness:** What would need to be true about your position within your industry, relative to your competitors? For example, as we discussed earlier, your business strategy might hinge on you being the best at manufacturing, or being able to sell your product at the lowest price.
  * **Competitor responses:** What would need to be true about your competitors’ actions in response to your strategy? For example, it would need to be true that your competitors can’t outperform you in your own core competency—or, at least, would require significant time and resource investments to do so.



(Shortform note: In _Purple Cow,_ Godin talks about how digital cameras were able to compete with—and eventually dominate—the photography market by taking this approach. In brief, the camera manufacturers realized that in order for their product to see widespread success, they needed two things to be true: Digital cameras had to be as easy to use as film cameras, and people needed to understand the advantages that digital cameras offered (such as not needing to get film developed). Once they created those two conditions, digital cameras became enormously popular and quickly dominated the market.)

#### Part 4: Find Potential Barriers

Lafley and Martin’s fourth step is the opposite of Step 3—Figure out every potential _problem_ with each strategy. **Encourage the members of the team who are most skeptical about each idea to explain their skepticism.** Do this for each of your potential solutions.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, the most successful people are those who manage to turn problems into opportunities—and that begins with recognizing your problems, as Lafley and Martin suggest. For example, boxing great Muhammad Ali won the famous _Rumble in the Jungle_ match against George Foreman by using a strategy he called the rope-a-dope—leaning against the ropes to absorb the shock of his opponents’ strikes, while Foreman tired himself out with powerful yet ineffective punches. Then, in the eighth round, Ali struck back against the exhausted Foreman and scored an easy knockout. In other words, Foreman’s strength was a _barrier_ that Ali couldn’t overcome, so instead he used a strategy to turn that barrier into an advantage.)

#### Part 5: Create Tests

Next, Lafley and Martin suggest you **design tests** —approved by the group—**that can gauge the potential success conditions and the potential barriers to each strategy**. These can be qualitative (like speaking to customers in a focus group) or quantitative (like conducting large-scale price-point tests). If your company can’t afford these sorts of tests, Lafley and Martin recommend using publicly available data instead.

As in Part 4, having a skeptic in the group is useful. Everyone needs to believe that the tests will give meaningful results, and skeptics will have the highest standards for those tests.

(Shortform note: At this stage, it helps to recognize when formalized testing is feasible and when it isn’t. Generally speaking, formal testing is appropriate for _implementing_ a strategy but not for _creating_ a strategy. For example, if you’re considering a new logo for your company, you can test it on a small scale and see how your customers respond. However, if you’re facing a major strategic decision like a merger or choosing a manufacturer, there’s no way to run a meaningful test—you’ll have to make the best decision possible based on the information you already have.)

#### Part 6: Administer Tests

After you’ve designed your tests, conduct them. At this point, your group should have an inkling of which ideas are more and less likely to be successful. **First, test the ideas about which you feel the least confident.** If these possibilities fail your tests, you can eliminate them right away and move on to testing ideas that you think have a better chance of success.

The authors recommend testing one strategy at a time. Companies often try to analyze every potential solution at once, which is more expensive and can cause confusion when tests and strategies overlap.

(Shortform note: You may be tempted to create tests that you believe your ideas will pass, to prove that your idea is workable. However, it’s often more effective to do what philosopher Karl Popper calls negative verification: Design tests that you think the strategy _will_ fail in order to show that it’s fatally flawed. Negative verification allows you to quickly and efficiently weed out the ideas that won’t work. It also gives you greater confidence in whichever choice you settle on—you’ll know that it’s a strong enough strategy to withstand your best efforts to _make_ it fail.)

#### Part 7: Make Your Choice

The final step of Lafley and Martin’s process is to choose a strategy. If you’ve done the first six parts correctly, you should feel confident that the data from your tests are pointing you in the right direction. **Whichever potential solution tests best is the one you should choose.**

> **Part 8: Stick to It—Unless…**
> 
> The team decision-making process is designed to help you make the best decision possible and feel confident about it, but it doesn’t include guidance for what to do when you _don’t_ make the best decision. To avoid this, determine specific red flags that would get you to reconsider your decision.
> 
> Setting specific guidelines like this will help in two ways:
> 
>   * You won’t panic at the first sign of trouble and make an unnecessary course correction.
> 
>   * You won’t wait too long to make a _necessary_ course correction.
> 
> 

> 
> Setting these red flags will keep you on track—you’ll be able to make changes when needed, and _only_ when needed.
