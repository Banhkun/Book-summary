## Conclusion: Do’s and Don’ts of Strategy

Lafley and Martin conclude their book by briefly summarizing the signs of an effective strategy, as well as some common pitfalls of weak strategy.

### Common Signs of a Good Strategy

In short, Lafley and Martin believe that a good business strategy is one that makes you stand out from the competition in a positive way. Here are some signs that you’re doing so:

  1. **You have a unique activity system.** Your particular combination of goals and capabilities is different from your competitors’, and they’re not easily imitated. 
  2. **People have strong feelings about your company.** You have die-hard fans and people who can’t imagine ever buying from you. That’s a sign that you’ve made strong and clear choices. 
  3. **Your competitors are doing well.** This seems counterintuitive, but if your competitors are secure then they’re less likely to try to muscle in on your market.
  4. **You have more resources available than your competitors.** If you’re able to spend more on business activities than your competitors do, it means that you have larger profit margins than them. That’s a good sign that you’re winning in your chosen arena.
  5. **Your competitors fight each other, not you.** If other companies aren’t trying to directly compete with you, it means that you’re either unique or dominant within your industry. Either way, it’s a sign that your strategy is a good one.
  6. **People come to you first.** You’re on the cutting edge of your market, meaning that people look to your company first for new innovations, better products, or improved services.



> **Playing It Safe Is Dangerous**
> 
> As we’ve discussed, the way to win in business is to stand out from the crowd, and the way to stand out is to make tough and risky decisions. As Seth Godin says in _Purple Cow_ , “playing it safe” is the most dangerous thing you can do in business. In other words, not all bold strategies are good, but all good strategies are bold.****
> 
> Godin says that larger and older corporations are the most prone to playing it safe; they’re used to a world of widely appealing products sold through mass marketing, leading to guaranteed sales and profits. However, Godin believes that this world no longer exists—there are now so many companies and so many products that you _have_ to stand out and attract attention, or even a large and long-established corporation can suffer.

### Common Signs of a Bad Strategy

The authors believe that a weak strategy is defined by unclear choices, too many choices (or no choices at all), or choices that won’t lead to a competitive advantage.

**1\. You’re not making choices, or making too many choices.** If you’re trying to do too many things—reach too many different demographics, play on multiple fields at once, or pursue conflicting goals—you’ll do all of those things poorly.

(Shortform note: In _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, _Rumelt also discusses common pitfalls of bad strategy that closely parallel those listed in _Playing to Win_. One of Rumelt’s pitfalls is misguided objectives—either too many objectives, or objectives that work against each other and don’t support your overall goals. Rumelt says that local governments and schools tend to be particularly guilty of this pitfall (because they’re trying to please everyone), but that businesses sometimes fall into this trap as well.)

**2\. You’re making the same choices as everyone else.** If you’re playing with the same strategy as your competitors, you won’t have any advantage in the market. Remember that differentiation is one of the two ways to win in your playing field.

(Shortform note: Rumelt warns that companies will often try to hide their weak strategies behind lofty language and buzzwords; he calls it “fluff.” For example, a grocery store might say that its strategy is, “Customer-driven, comestible-focused services” or some such thing—in other words, their “strategy” is to be a grocery store like any other. This does not set them apart from their competitors or give them a clear path to victory.)

**3\. You’re targeting your strongest competitor first.** Going right for the biggest fish in your industry might be tempting, but you’re almost certain to lose that fight; instead, pick an arena where you can defeat or evade your competition.

(Shortform note: This is an example of what Rumelt calls misidentifying the challenge. If you’re a small or brand-new business, your main challenge isn’t the largest and strongest company in your industry; trying to defeat them will be a waste of energy and resources. In order to make effective strategies, you need to correctly identify your most direct and immediate threats so that you can devise practical solutions to them.)

**4\. You’re mistaking goals for strategy.** Beware of setting aspirations without concrete plans to realize them—you have to make choices about how to reach your goals, not just what those goals are.

(Shortform note: Just saying what you want to achieve isn’t a workable strategy. Pairing your goals with motivation also does not constitute strategy—motivation and determination are good values, but by themselves they are not a path to victory.)
