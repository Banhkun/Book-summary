## Shortform Introduction

_Playing to Win_ is a collaboration between A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin, who worked together at Procter & Gamble (P&G) as CEO and strategic adviser, respectively. The book teaches what business strategy is and how to use it effectively. Lafley and Martin suggest using a “waterfall” sequence of five questions that identify the company’s vision, target markets, and plan to dominate those markets. The answer to each question informs the next, hence the term _waterfall strategy._

### About the Authors

Lafley is best known for leading P&G as president, CEO, and chairman of the board from 2000 to 2010 and from 2013 to 2015. During those periods, he doubled P&G’s total sales and market capitalization—his success is credited to his heavy investments into brands that were already successful and his intense focus on customer satisfaction. Lafley stepped down as CEO in 2015 to become executive chairman of P&G, and he officially retired in 2016. When he stepped down for the second time, _Fortune_ hailed him as “one of the most lauded CEOs in history.”

Martin is an author, strategic adviser, and former dean of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto. In addition to advising CEOs of several major corporations, including P&G, Martin is known for his contributions to the theories of democratic capitalism and Integrative Thinking. _Thinkers50_ named Martin the world’s #1 management thinker in 2017 and regularly places him in the top 10.

### The Book’s Publication

_Playing to Win_ was published in 2013 by the Harvard Business Review Press. It was Lafley’s second book, following _The Game-Changer_ , and, to date, it’s the last book he’s authored.

Martin (a professional author) has many more books to his name, but _Playing to Win_ remains one of his most popular and successful.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

A large part of _Playing to Win_ ’s appeal is that it provides a clear and easy-to-follow guide to creating a winning strategy. This was especially relevant in 2013 because the 2010s were—as the authors say in the book’s conclusion—a time of extreme globalization, thanks in large part to technological advancements and the internet. Since publication, the global marketplace has become even more complex, and it shifts quickly and constantly. That’s why it’s more important than ever for a business to have a clear and effective strategy guiding it through rapid market changes.

#### Intellectual Context

_Playing to Win_ is most notable for pushing back against business guides that discuss how to _compete_ in the marketplace. Instead, Lafley and Martin insist that the purpose of business strategy is to _dominate_ the marketplace—in other words, to win. That, plus the authors’ focus on clear and actionable advice, helps this book stand out among the plethora of popular business guides from the 2010s, such as _Blue Ocean Strategy _and _Tools of Titans_.

Simon Sinek’s 2018 book _The Infinite Game _would later dispute some of Lafley and Martin’s ideas, particularly the concept that you can “win” at business. We’ve included some commentary to explore Sinek’s perspective.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Playing to Win_ is a _Wall Street Journal_ and _Washington Post_ bestseller, and __ it has received largely positive reviews from critics. The _Financial Times_ calls _Playing to Win_ a manual for business strategy. _Fortune_ lauds the book for its insightfulness and accessibility. Overall, fans of the book believe that it’s one of the most practical and easy-to-understand business strategy guides on the market.

Criticisms of _Playing to Win_ are generally mild, such as _Fortune_ noting that the book’s case studies all come from large corporations like P&G or Apple, and therefore might not be applicable to smaller companies and startups. The _Financial Times_ says that it makes for dry reading, but that the lessons it contains are worth learning nonetheless.

More serious critiques—mostly from individual reviewers on Amazon and Goodreads—take aim at how heavily _Playing to Win_ focuses on Lafley’s time at P&G. They argue that the lessons are outdated, and that the examples and case studies are self-promotional fluff. However, the authors say in their introduction that they’ve seen their methods used to great effect in companies of all sizes across many different industries.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_Playing to Win_ starts by presenting the five questions of Lafley and Martin’s waterfall strategy. The subsequent chapters explain each question in detail, including how to come up with effective answers and implement those ideas in your own business. It’s a logical structure that takes you step-by-step through the authors’ process of developing strategies.

_Playing to Win_ relies heavily on examples and anecdotes from Lafley and Martin’s time at Procter & Gamble, which illustrate (but lengthen) their lessons.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Since Lafley and Martin’s waterfall strategy must be followed in the order they wrote it, we’ve largely kept their structure. However, since Chapters 7 and 8 both describe how to apply the five questions of the waterfall strategy, we’ve combined them for brevity and ease of access.

We’ve also removed a great deal of the P&G case studies and stories while keeping the core lessons and using our commentary to make them as broadly applicable as possible. We’ll provide case studies and examples from different companies, thereby expanding the book’s view beyond Procter & Gamble. We’ve also included commentary that further enriches—and occasionally contrasts—Lafley and Martin’s ideas with connections to other iconic business guides, such as Richard Rumelt’s _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy _and Simon Sinek’s _The Infinite Game._
