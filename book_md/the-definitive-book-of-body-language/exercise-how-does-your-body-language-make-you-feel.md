## Exercise: How Does Your Body Language Make You Feel?

Allan and Barbara Pease suggest that intentionally changing your body language influences your emotions. Letâ€™s explore how adopting different expressions, gestures, and postures can change the way you feel.

* * *

Notice and describe your body language and how you feel. (For example, you might be frowning, slouching in your chair, and feeling bored.)

Deliberately hold a broad smile for at least one minute. Write down any changes you notice in your emotions.

Scrunch up your face and hold this pose for at least one minute. Write down any changes you notice in your emotions.

If possible, stand up with your head held high and your hands on your hips, elbows out. After holding this pose for at least one minute, write down any changes you notice in your emotions.

Relax and sit comfortably. Notice and describe your body language and how you feel, noting any changes from your original response at the start of this exercise.
