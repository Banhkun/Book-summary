## 1-Page Summary

_Reboot_ explores the rise and fall of Jodie Fox’s global shoe business, Shoes of Prey—an innovative start-up that allowed customers to design their own shoes. Fox offers a vulnerable, honest look into her successes and failures as an entrepreneur, proving that **there’s always value in the process of owning a business, even if your business doesn’t work out.** She also provides advice on dealing with many of the situations you’ll encounter should you build a global business.

Fox combined her professional background in law, international business, and marketing with her interest in fashion to found Shoes of Prey in 2009. She built it into a profitable, award-winning company alongside co-founders Michael Fox and Mike Knapp. By the time the business collapsed in 2018 after failing to scale effectively, she’d taken on the role of creative director, COO, and CEO, staying with the company to the end.

In this guide, we’ll discuss Fox’s advice for:

  * Choosing a business idea and getting it off the ground
  * Navigating cultural differences as an international entrepreneur
  * Overcoming decision paralysis in your business
  * Creating a healthy company culture
  * Dealing with mental health struggles as a business owner



Throughout the guide, we’ll use examples from Fox’s time with Shoes of Prey to illustrate her points. In our commentary, we’ll discuss perspectives from other entrepreneurs on building a successful business. We’ll also explore additional ways to support your employees through challenging times and more tips for managing mental health in business.

### Lesson #1: Getting Your Business Started

Alongside her then-husband Michael Fox and their friend Mike Knapp, Jodie Fox built Shoes of Prey from the ground up. The process was often complicated and stressful, but they solved problems one step at a time. In this section, we’ll cover some of the lessons Fox learned along the way, including her advice on discovering what you’re interested in, moving forward with a business idea, and finding suppliers.

#### Follow Your Passion

**One of the first lessons Fox learned as a young professional was the importance of following your passion.** If you’re genuinely interested in what you do, you’ll work harder and spend more time finding innovative solutions to problems that arise. Additionally, you’ll receive opportunities and experience success because people—whether they’re supervisors, customers, or investors—want to invest time and money in individuals who are passionate about their work.

(Shortform note: As Fox states, seeking job opportunities that involve work you care about can be a great path to fulfillment in a career. However, passions can be short-lived. You might be interested in cooking for a few months, then decide that you’d rather make a career in fashion. Instead of following passion alone, look for opportunities that will help you grow as a professional and advance your career. These jobs may not be exactly what you want right now, but they can give you chances to refine your interests, develop your skills, and discover things you didn’t know you were good at. These experiences will allow you to explore a wider range of opportunities later.)

The alternative to following your passion—doing work you dislike or feel uninspired by—can leave you feeling trapped and depressed. You won’t perform at your highest level in a career if you’re not interested in the work.

(Shortform note: Though doing work you’re passionate about is the ideal, it’s more common in the United States to do work you dislike or are uninspired by. Research shows that 53% of US workers are disengaged, meaning they don’t really care about their work, while 13% are _actively_ disengaged, meaning their work makes them miserable. That said, the number of people doing work that _does_ engage them is rising.)

##### How to Choose a Passion to Follow

Fox learned the importance of following your passion after several career changes. She started off in the law profession but soon found that the work didn’t challenge or inspire her, so she moved to a marketing company.

(Shortform note: Because of her existing educational background in business, Fox was able to smoothly transition from law to marketing (and, later, to running Shoes of Prey). However, sometimes, after identifying the career you want, you need additional education to pursue it. Luckily, there are many options for continuing education: You can go to night school or online classes to earn a new degree or certification. You can also attend workshops and webinars to gain specific skills. Finally, consider professional development opportunities like conferences and courses that will improve your knowledge of industry topics.)

To find a career she’d enjoy and be passionate about, Fox used the following exercise:

**Ask people you know about their jobs.** Do they enjoy their work? What’s the breakdown of a typical day at work for them? What tasks are involved in their everyday work? What’s the culture of their industry like? This will give you an idea of what options are available.

**Make a list of things you want out of a career.** This will help you narrow down your interests and priorities. For example, maybe you want to make a lot of money, work on creative projects, or have a flexible schedule.

**Compare what you want out of a career with what you’ve learned about other people’s jobs.** The intersections you find may point you in the right direction. For example, after speaking to a friend who’s a freelance writer, you might realize that their independence and flexible schedule would also work for you—it would allow you to travel as you’ve always wanted to.

> **Tips for Expanding Fox’s Exercise**
> 
> Fox’s method of finding a new career path worked for her circumstances, but you may need a little more structure to execute her advice depending on the size of your social network and how conscious you are of your needs and wants in a job. If you need a little extra guidance, here are a few tips to expand on her exercise:
> 
> **If you don’t know a lot of professionals or the jobs of your friends don’t appeal to you,** you can gather information about potential careers from people outside of your existing network. Make a list of jobs and employers you might be interested in, and reach out to people who work in these roles and companies. Ask them if they’re willing to speak to you for a short time about their line of work. Additionally, look for job shadowing opportunities so you can get hands-on experience in a career alongside professionals.
> 
> **If you’re not sure what to put on your list of things you want out of a career,** you can start by taking assessments online that measure your skills, personality type, interests, and values. Skills assessments help you determine what you’re good at, interest assessments help you figure out what kind of work you’re passionate about, and personality and values assessments show what someone of your temperament and preferences needs to be happy and engaged at work.
> 
> **When comparing what you want from a career to the jobs you’ve researched,** don’t worry if you can’t find a perfect match. According to Cal Newport in _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ , research shows that people naturally develop passion for their career over time, no matter what that career is. Even if a career only fulfills one or two of your passions at first, over time, you’ll probably find the job more satisfying than you predicted.

#### Turn Your Idea Into a Business

Fox also followed her passion when she and her co-founders decided they wanted to start a company together. They settled on Shoes of Prey, a website where women could design and order custom shoes. They were inspired by Fox’s interest in fashion and an experience she had designing her own shoes at a market stall in Hong Kong. She designed several pairs of shoes using a sketchbook and swatches of material the stall owner gave her. Then, the owner took the designs she created, sent them to be manufactured, and shipped the finished product to her.

When Fox wore her custom shoes, women began asking where she got them. They were all intrigued by the idea of creating fashionable pairs of shoes that no one else owned. Once Fox and her co-founders realized that interest in custom shoes existed, they wanted to replicate and scale Fox’s Hong Kong shoe design experience for women online.

> **Finding the Target Community for Your Business**
> 
> Many entrepreneurs start their businesses to solve a problem they have as a consumer—in Fox’s case, it was the lack of options for designing your own affordable, high-fashion shoes. In _The Minimalist Entrepreneur_ , Sahil Lavingia expands on this idea, outlining how you can start a business by identifying a problem you want to solve and which community you want to solve it for.
> 
> To identify potential target communities, look to your own communities first. Think about your hobbies, interests, and social groups—who do you like to spend time with, and where can you find these people? (Fox’s community was women interested in fashionable shoes.) Once you’ve identified some possible communities, join groups within them to get to know their members and interests better.
> 
> Establish yourself as a member of these communities, and pay close attention during the conversations you have with other members. They’ll eventually tell you the problems they need solutions for. When you find the right community with the right problem, you can start looking for solutions that you can turn into a business.

To begin moving out of the idea stage of your business, Fox offers the following tips:

##### Tip #1: Research Potential Competitors

**Research businesses making a similar product or service to yours to see if your idea’s been executed and executed _well_.** Fox and her co-founders discovered only one other company of the same type, and the experience that company offered wasn’t very good. This convinced them that they could create something better with little competition. The team also researched Nike’s sneaker customization service and found that it had achieved swift growth. Nike’s success convinced them that there was a market for shoe customization.

(Shortform note: Fox suggests researching your business idea to see if anyone else is already doing it, but she doesn’t give much guidance on how to do this. Start with a simple Google search, using keywords that reflect the problem you’re trying to solve or the function of your business. Additionally, contact a business consultant about your idea—they know the market, and they’ll be able to tell you if your business idea is original and if it has a chance of survival. Finally, check for patents or trademarks that suggest someone may already have a legal claim on your idea. You can use websites like Google Patents or Patentscope.)

> **Where Shoe Customization Is Today**
> 
> The niche Fox and her co-founders discovered while starting Shoes of Prey—enabling women to design their own affordable, high-fashion shoes—hasn’t been filled since the company closed. Admittedly, companies like Nike and Vans have limited options for customizing athletic shoes and sneakers, and companies like Shoe Zero and AliveShoes allow customers to design and sell their own shoe lines. However, none offer the same level of customization for individual pairs of shoes as Shoes of Prey did, and none target women looking to create couture designs.
> 
> This gap in the market may be a result of the same challenges Shoes of Prey faced, which we’ll touch on in later sections: Making one unique pair of shoes at a time while offering countless design possibilities isn’t compatible with standard manufacturing processes, and it offers limited opportunities for the business to scale.

##### Tip #2: Create and Test a Prototype Product

**Next, Fox advises, put together a simplified version of your product and test it with your target customers.** Doing so before you invest a lot of money or time in your idea will help you pinpoint areas of your product that still need improvement.

Additionally, feedback can provide evidence that your product idea is worth pursuing, validating the time, money, and effort you put into it so far. Fox argues that this validation is especially important for maintaining a positive mindset while starting a business, when you have to put in a lot of time and hard work for minimal pay.

> **Jake Knapp’s Design Sprint Process**
> 
> One effective method for getting feedback on your product in a short time window is Jake Knapp’s Design Sprint process (as outlined in _Sprint_). Knapp developed the process to improve product development efficiency while working at Google. Later, he facilitated design sprints at more than 100 companies.
> 
> During a design sprint, you and your team develop a prototype product and test it with customers within a five-day workweek. The short time window allows you to gain valuable insight into your product’s strengths and weaknesses without spending too much time or money developing it.
> 
> Design sprints are highly structured and collaborative, with each day broken down into steps that build on each other. You work with a small team of different kinds of experts to plot your customer’s ideal experience with your product. Then, you individually create designs for your product, collaboratively choose a design to move forward with, and create a simplified, functional prototype. Finally, you test your prototype with customers on the last day of the sprint.

#### Find Your Suppliers

Once you decide to pursue your business idea, you’ll likely need to find suppliers to help you with manufacturing (if you make a physical product). Fox and her team returned to Hong Kong to look for suppliers. They went to the stall where she had originally designed her shoes, then they met with several other owners of similar stores.

Many potential suppliers didn’t want to meet Shoes of Prey’s manufacturing needs at first because Shoes of Prey required factories to produce one custom shoe at a time instead of their usual large orders. However, large factory orders slowed when the 2008 global financial crisis started, so the suppliers were eventually willing to take a chance on Fox and her co-founders.

Based on her experience, Fox offers the following options for finding suppliers for your business:

**Find suppliers online through business websites** such as LinkedIn. This works especially well if your product type is already made by other companies. (Shortform note: The internet is a good source for suppliers when you make an existing product because if the _product_ already exists, _suppliers_ of it do, too—and you can likely find them online.)

**Attend events that showcase products from your industry.** Do this if you aren’t yet sure what kind of product or service you require. Seeing the manufacturer’s samples at fairs and other events will show what they can make. (Shortform note: You can find information about conferences and trade shows in your industry using online databases. These websites have event listings and resources for exhibitors, and you can search for them by industry or location.)

**Figure out who supplies brands that make similar products.** Often, brands try to keep their suppliers secret, but this is still a worthy avenue to pursue. (Shortform note: It can be difficult to find a company’s suppliers because they don’t want competitors to learn that information. However, even when a company tries to keep it a secret, you can usually find its list of suppliers on databases like Bloomberg and Mergent Online. In the US, you can also search a company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings to find this information.)

> **How to Evaluate Potential Suppliers**
> 
> Before you partner with a supplier, you need to make sure they’re the best option for your business. Fox and her co-founders had to prioritize finding suppliers who were willing to manufacture small orders—your business’s needs will likely be different. No matter what your priorities are, there are a few factors to look for when deciding if a supplier is right for you:
> 
> **Is the price right?** The costs of working with the supplier should match your budget, especially when you’re a start-up with limited funds.
> 
> **Will the supplier be reliable?** A good supplier will send items you order on time and in good condition. Both large and small suppliers can offer a reliable service, but in different ways—a large supplier has the resources to fix mistakes, but a small supplier will likely have more attention to devote to your business.
> 
> **Is the location of the supplier right for your business?** Having international suppliers worked for Shoes of Prey but also brought unique challenges. Consider how the location of a supplier will affect different parts of your business: shipping times, environmental impact, the number of employees you need to hire, and so on.

### Lesson #2: Navigating Cultural Differences in an International Business

In the last section, we discussed the lessons Fox learned while choosing her business idea and finding suppliers, some of whom were international. This section will explore the lessons she learned about navigating cultural differences while running an international business. She asserts the importance of understanding both everyday cultural differences and special considerations for working with certain cultures; hiring employees local to the country you’re working in; and meeting the expectations of customers in different parts of the world.

(Shortform note: Understanding cultural differences is a vital part of running an international business. Taking the time to learn about another culture communicates respect and helps to foster long-term, trusting relationships with global business partners. There are many ways you can educate yourself about other cultures—for example, take a college course on cultural awareness in business, or start learning another language using apps like Duolingo.)

#### Be Aware of Everyday Differences and Special Considerations

Fox claims that when you work with suppliers in other countries, you should be aware of both everyday cultural differences and special cultural considerations, like culture-specific holidays. If you don’t understand the interpersonal dynamics and expectations of your international partners, it can lead to missed opportunities, misunderstandings, resentment, and disruption to your business relationships.

Let’s look at two examples from Fox’s experience:

##### Example #1: Dressing for Success

**Be aware of how your appearance affects the way your international partners perceive you.** When Fox and her co-founders first began meeting with suppliers at their factories in China, she selected simple attire: black trousers, a black shirt, simple shoes, and no jewelry. She wanted to look professional and be taken seriously.

However, over time, she noticed that the suppliers were always dressed well, wearing their nicest jewelry and driving expensive cars. She realized that they communicated the success of their businesses through their appearance.

By dressing simply, she left the suppliers feeling unsure that she represented a serious business. She started wearing expensive clothes and jewelry to meetings instead, convincing suppliers that Shoes of Prey had money to pay them.

> **How to Dress for Success in International Business**
> 
> As Fox notes, when deciding how you should dress for business interactions, think about how you want to be perceived, and dress for the role you want to fill. However, don’t dress solely based on what _you_ think that role looks like. Consider what that role looks like to the people you’ll be working with, especially if they come from a different country.
> 
> Fox initially tried to convey that she was a serious professional with her minimal garb. However, she misjudged how her Chinese partners would perceive her. You can avoid making similar mistakes by researching what’s considered appropriate business attire in the country you’re visiting or by reviewing your outfit choice with someone you know and trust from that country.

##### Example #2: How Local Holidays Affect Business

**Furthermore, understand the important holidays where you do business and how they’ll affect your work.** Fox learned this lesson when she and her co-founders failed to account for the effect Chinese New Year would have on their manufacturing. They knew that Chinese suppliers closed for two weeks during Chinese New Year, but they assumed that a reduced crew of workers would be available during the holidays since that’s common practice in Australia, where they’re from.

When they asked about keeping some staff on during the two weeks, their suppliers were upset that they didn’t understand the importance of the holiday or what it would take to keep the factory going with a reduced staff. Fox and the team worked it out by paying the workers a much higher rate during the holidays. Still, Fox and her co-founders could have prevented the problem with better cultural understanding and communication.

(Shortform note: If you have international employees, as Fox did, consider integrating their national and religious holidays into your corporate structure from the start. When you only include time off for holidays in your home country, you may leave your employees feeling disrespected and disheartened. To create a respectful culture around holidays and avoid the conflict Fox experienced, ask your regional leaders to create a list of the most important holidays in their country and share it with corporate. Put those holidays on the corporate calendar. Establish the expectation that everyone at the company must respect all culturally significant holidays and those who observe them.)

> **How to Map Cultural Differences**
> 
> As Fox suggests, understanding other cultures is a vital part of international business. However, navigating nuances of communication and interaction with global partners alongside the other everyday stresses of running a business can feel overwhelming. To make this process easier, systematize your understanding of cultural differences using Erin Meyer’s method for measuring them, as explored in _The Culture Map_.
> 
> Meyer outlines eight categories for measuring cultural differences—communication, feedback, thinking, leadership, decision-making, trust, disagreement, and time perception—each of which includes a range of possible behavior between two extremes. Every country’s norms in each category fall somewhere between the two extremes. You can judge how different your country’s cultural expectations are from another country’s within any category based on how far you are from them on the behavioral range. You can then modify your behavior toward people from that other culture accordingly.

#### Hire Employees Local to the Other Country

Fox and her co-founders’ early struggles to communicate effectively with international partners highlighted the importance of hiring employees local to other countries. These employees could help them navigate the cultural differences, the language barrier, and the practical aspects of the business when Fox and her co-founders couldn’t be there.

If you’re working with suppliers in another country, **consider hiring local employees to fill the following roles:**

  * Someone with professional networks in the country who can connect you with employment agencies. This will make it easier to hire more employees later on. 
  * People to set up your local office and manage the packing and shipping of your product 
  * People to manage everyday communication with suppliers, ensuring that daily operations are smooth and quality standards are met



(Shortform note: When hiring employees to run your international offices and manage relationships with suppliers, make sure you can trust and build rapport with them. You’ll depend on them to get an accurate picture of your international operations, which will require frequent and open communication. To find strong, trustworthy candidates for these roles, hire someone to help you with recruitment first.)

> **How to Hire Employees in Another Country**
> 
> Fox and her co-founders temporarily hired a local employee to help them recruit employees in China. This is a great way to _find_ potential international employees, but she doesn’t explain how to navigate the tricky legal and logistical process of _hiring_ international employees. There are three main options you can use depending on your business needs:
> 
> **Option 1: Establish a branch or subsidiary of your company in the country.** This will allow you to legally hire employees there. Incorporating and registering a business in another country can be a lengthy and complicated process, so this option is best if you plan to establish a physical location for your business abroad and hire the employees indefinitely.
> 
> **Option 2: Hire international workers as independent contractors.** This means you don’t have to offer benefits or put workers on the payroll. However, every country has a different definition of what constitutes an independent contractor, so make sure you understand the country’s unique parameters. Otherwise, you may find yourself owing back pay, taxes, and benefits later on.
> 
> **Option 3: Partner with an Employee of Record (EOR).** An EOR acts as the official employer of your employees. They’re responsible for legal compliance and HR tasks. This option makes hiring international employees quick and easy because the EOR is already an established entity in the country.

#### Understand the Needs of International Customers

As Shoes of Prey grew, it began expanding into new markets, including Japan, Russia, and the Netherlands. During this expansion, Fox discovered that **cultural differences matter when communicating with _customers_ as well.** Customers in different countries have varying customer service expectations, and you may have to make adjustments to your processes to keep these customers satisfied.

For example, Fox and her team worked with a partner in Japan who informed them that Japanese customers expect their parcels to arrive in perfect condition with elaborate packaging that enhances their experience of receiving the product. To avoid any issues with customer satisfaction in Japan, they shipped shoe orders first to their Japanese partner, rather than directly to customers. He acted as an intermediary, finishing the packing process and hiring special couriers to ensure the packages were still pristine by the time Japanese customers received them.

(Shortform note: The Japanese market is well-known for its emphasis on quirky products, and their standards for packaging are uniquely high. Japanese customers expect the packaging of products to have an appealing design, practical usability, and top-quality materials. Given these specific expectations, it was wise for Fox and her team to partner with someone who fully understood the culture.)

> **Cultural Distinctions in Customer Satisfaction Research**
> 
> A recent study shows that traditional customer satisfaction research, which focuses on customer ratings of products and services, fails to account for important cultural distinctions. The most valuable information doesn’t come from customer ratings, but from the underlying assumptions that contribute to them. In Fox’s experience, for example, Japanese customers generally hold the assumption that a product is higher quality if it has nice packaging.
> 
> Paying attention to these assumptions can help you determine how best to connect with customers in different countries. For example, one product in the study had consistently high quality ratings across all countries, which suggested similarities across markets. However, the reasoning behind the quality ratings differed depending on the region. Most importantly, customers factored in cost as a primary measure of quality in all regions except Latin America.
> 
> With this research in mind, it would likely benefit your company to price your products higher than competitors in regions other than Latin America—the higher price will suggest to customers that it’s a higher quality product, making them more likely to buy it. However, in Latin America, you’ll have to find a different way to indicate the quality of your product.

### Lesson #3: Making Big Decisions

In addition to understanding cultural differences while running an international business, Fox’s third major lesson was learning how to make big business decisions when you can’t predict their outcome.

**When you’re building a business, you’ll frequently face choices that require you to act without knowing whether your decision will work out or not.** Fox struggled with these decisions, becoming overwhelmed with the possibility of making the wrong choice.

(Shortform note: Entrepreneurship is inherently uncertain—most start-ups lack a solidified business model and depend on outside funding, so they’re especially vulnerable to economic disruptions. This means that every decision you make as an entrepreneur about the direction of your business carries a lot of financial risk, which can be a source of great stress. Fox wasn’t alone in her struggle with this unpredictability—research shows that uncertainty during decision-making activates the amygdala (the area of our brain that responds to fear or threat) and reduces activity in the striatal system (the part of our brain that responds to potential rewards). This means we’re actually wired to crave certainty.)

To handle big decisions, Fox used the following strategies:

**Move forward before you feel ready.** If you spend too much time deliberating during each step of building your business, you risk halting its progress completely. You likely won’t ever feel fully ready, so become comfortable with being unsure.

(Shortform note: In _Courage Is Calling_ , Ryan Holiday also emphasizes the importance of making decisions before you’re ready. He argues that if you never take risks, you’ll never give yourself a chance to learn and grow.)

**Choose the _best possible_ solution for problems that arise,** not a perfect one. Choosing a flawed solution is better than not moving forward at all because you’re waiting for certainty.

(Shortform note: To find the best possible solution, start by clarifying your problem. Once you have a clear idea of the issue you need to address, list some possible options for solving it. Then, weigh the pros and cons of each option, and move forward with the one that seems like it will generate the most favorable range of outcomes.)

**Keep your solutions as simple as possible.** You might waste valuable time and money trying to make complicated ideas work. For example, when deciding how to determine customer shoe size, Fox and the team tested several elaborate ways for customers to measure their feet before realizing that simply asking the customer their regular shoe size gave them the most accurate results.

(Shortform note: Fox’s advice to keep your solutions simple aligns with a well-known design principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid, also known as the KISS principle. An American aeronautical and systems engineer coined the term in the 1960s to capture the idea that simplicity should be the key goal when designing anything. Product and service users want things that are easy to use—they don’t care how clever the designer was, or how much work went into designing a complicated system. In keeping with that idea, Fox ended up choosing the method for determining customer shoe size that involved the least amount of work for the customer.)

### Lesson #4: Creating a Strong Company Culture

Now that we’ve discussed Fox’s advice for overcoming decision paralysis as you build your business, we’ll cover some of the lessons Fox learned further along in her journey. In this section, we’ll discuss her advice for establishing a strong, positive company culture using clear policies, expectations, and support for employees, especially during times of transition.

#### Set Up Structure and Expectations

Fox recommends **establishing administrative policies and structures early on to create clear expectations for employees.** She and her co-founders didn’t do this in the early years of Shoes of Prey, and it caused confusion as the company grew.

(Shortform note: Experts agree with Fox’s assertion that companies should establish clear rules and policies even when the business is small. HR policies are like laws: They create a common set of expectations, understandings, and standards of acceptable behavior at a company. Additionally, they ensure that a company is legally compliant, protecting the company from litigation and promoting fair, consistent treatment of employees. Clear expectations (laid out in job descriptions, performance standards, objectives, and so on) give employees goals to work toward, helping the company to grow. Employees who know what’s expected of them are more engaged, productive, and satisfied at work.)

When the company moved from Australia to the United States in 2015, it hired a human resources manager who created the following policies to support the new volume of staff:

**An annual employee survey** that helped Fox and her management team identify themes of feedback they needed to address. Additionally, they implemented three smaller employee surveys throughout the year to track their progress on the feedback from the annual survey.

(Shortform note: Annual and quarterly surveys are a good way to show employees that you value their feedback and that they have input in the direction of the company. Experts argue that quarterly surveys requiring no more than 10 minutes to complete are optimal for ensuring participation, preventing survey fatigue, and providing management with relevant, actionable information. Every survey should have a clear focus and goal so employees aren’t confused about its purpose. Additionally, write survey questions that yield actionable results: Many companies use multiple choice questions for this purpose because the data from them is easy to compile and analyze.)

**Lunchtime training sessions** on professional development topics. (Shortform note: Regular training keeps employees aware of current expectations and increases productivity and performance.)

**Frequent individual meetings between employees and the HR manager** to discuss what’s helping and hindering the employees’ motivation. (Shortform note: Meeting one-on-one with HR instead of management enables employees to give honest feedback without feeling the pressure of criticizing their supervisors directly. If you’re the HR representative conducting these meetings, come prepared with a list of questions to guide the employee feedback. Ask questions that reflect the aspects of the employee experience your company wants to measure, like inclusivity or recognition for good work.)

**Clear promotion tracks and employee hierarchies.** (Shortform note: Having a clear promotion structure improves employee retention. Research shows that 35% of employees who voluntarily leave their jobs do so because there’s a lack of career development and promotion opportunities. Promotion policies should define how, when, and why an employee is eligible for a promotion, with specific and measurable goals.)

#### Provide Support During Difficult Times

Another important facet of Shoes of Prey’s company culture was the extensive support it gave its employees, especially in times of transition and struggle. Fox offers suggestions for the following situations:

##### Example #1: Moving to a New Country

When Fox and her co-founders decided to move the company to the United States, they offered all 24 of their Australian employees the chance to move with them, and 22 decided to do it. Fox found that the following support measures helped her employees make the transition:

**Make a checklist with information about the administrative side of moving,** like visa paperwork, taxes, and health care costs. Moving to a new country can be overwhelming, so you’ll significantly help your employees by doing this research for them.

**Rent a house in the new country where your employees can stay** before they find their own housing. This takes the immediate stress of finding a place to live off them, thus allowing people to move to the new country more quickly.

> Fox provides useful tips for how to support employees during a company relocation, but her strategies may not be enough in every situation. An administrative checklist won’t always provide the full picture of what it’s like to live in the new location, and companies with a larger staff won’t necessarily be able to rent accommodation for all their employees. If your company’s circumstances don’t match Fox’s experience, here are some tips to supplement her advice on supporting your employees during a move:
> 
>   * **Tell the employees about the move as soon as possible,** and keep them informed of any new developments. This will give them time to prepare and limit gossip that may spread false information.
> 
>   * **Ask employees for their input on the new location.** They may not have a say in _where_ the company moves, but they could have valuable ideas and suggestions about establishing the new space.
> 
>   * **Offer opportunities for employees to visit the new location prior to moving,** if possible, and compile information about the area (transit options, day care services, restaurants, and so on). This will help them get used to the idea of living there.
> 
>   * **Offer assistance,** like helping employees to find a new residence, granting time off or flexible hours while they’re moving, and giving relocation bonuses.

##### Example #2: When the Company Is Struggling

Fox also provided extra support to her employees in the company’s final months. By this time, she was the only co-founder still working at the company. After several failed attempts to scale the business, it was struggling financially, and eventually, Fox had to let some team members go. For those who remained, she offered the following support measures:

**Holding regular meetings with her employees** to discuss the company’s financial outlook and the steps she was taking to save the business. Transparency helped build trust in a precarious time.

(Shortform note: If you have to communicate with employees when the future of your company is uncertain, as Fox did, there are a few things to include in your approach. First, consider your employees’ perspective—what would you want to hear in their position? Address as many of their fears as you can. Additionally, admit when you don’t know something (for example, whether or not there will be layoffs), and avoid glossing over unpleasant news. Downplaying hard truths won’t stop them from coming to light, and it will reflect poorly on you later on if your employees feel like you deceived them.)

**Reducing employee hours instead of deferring their salaries.** The company couldn’t afford to pay their employees for full-time work anymore, but Fox didn’t want to lay anyone else off or ask them to work without pay, so she reduced the number of hours they worked instead. To lead by example, she also reduced the number of paid hours she worked.

(Shortform note: As Fox demonstrated, reducing employee hours can be a better alternative to layoffs, furloughs, and salary deferment when you’re trying to cut costs as a business. However, pay attention to how reduced hours will affect your salaried (exempt) employees—in certain circumstances, reducing the hours of salaried employees can hurt your business. Since salaried employees receive the same pay no matter how many hours they work, they’ll be making the same amount of money while doing less work. If they agree to reduce their hours _and_ their pay, they may lose their exempt status and become eligible for overtime pay, which could be another added cost.)

**Offering employees the chance to look for other jobs on company time** , as long as they did it discreetly. Fox also sent her employees’ names to other companies in the industry and offered them references.

(Shortform note: To further support your employees as they prepare to find another job, pay them severance or unused sick time and vacation time (if you can afford it). Additionally, if you’re based in the US, take advantage of your state workforce agency—many states have teams that help employees and employers manage company closures. They provide job counseling, job placement, interview training, and internet access for job searching. This may be particularly helpful if employees can’t search for jobs on company time, or if you don’t have contacts who are hiring right now.)

### Lesson #5: Dealing With Mental Health Struggles as a Business Owner

In the last section, we touched on some of the strategies Fox used to establish a solid company culture at Shoes of Prey. In the final section, we’ll discuss how to manage your own well-being as a business owner. We’ll explore some of the lessons Fox learned when dealing with mental health struggles during her time at Shoes of Prey. She provides strategies for overcoming imposter syndrome as an entrepreneur and managing depression and burnout when building a business.

#### Managing Imposter Syndrome

Fox struggled with imposter syndrome throughout her time with Shoes of Prey. She felt like she wasn’t a true professional capable of running the business, even when everything was going well. Every time she came across a part of the business she didn’t understand, she took it as confirmation that she wasn’t meant to be an entrepreneur.

Over time, she learned strategies that helped her fight those feelings, including the following exercise: **Every day, write down one thing you did well.** Keep your record of these achievements in one place, like a spreadsheet. Whenever logic fails and you’re struggling to overcome feelings that you’re not good enough, refer back to the record of your achievements as evidence of your capabilities.

> **How to Combat Imposter Syndrome**
> 
> Imposter syndrome affects many people in the business world and beyond. As Fox experienced, its characteristic symptoms of self-doubt and feelings of fraudulence can be debilitating, leaving you unable to recognize your accomplishments.
> 
> Fox’s suggestion to keep a success log is a great start for acknowledging your accomplishments, but it may not be enough on its own—truly overcoming imposter syndrome often requires you to address negative thought patterns as they arise. Here are some further steps you can take to do so: 
> 
>   * **Be aware of moments when feelings of imposter syndrome arise.** Track what they are and what circumstances prompt them.
> 
>   * **Redirect fears that you’re secretly incompetent** by frequently reminding yourself that it’s normal to not have all the answers. You can always learn and grow.
> 
>   * **Discuss your feelings with others.** Knowing other people experience the same feelings or understand your experience can ease your burden by helping you feel less alone.
> 
>   * **Approach failures as learning opportunities.** Figure out what the lesson is, and adapt based on what you learn.
>

#### Managing Depression and Burnout

Fox also dealt with depression and burnout throughout her tenure at Shoes of Prey. For many years, she worked constantly, sacrificing her relationships and her health to keep the company going. Eventually, she struggled to find any source of joy or meaning in her life beyond the business.

(Shortform note: Burnout is when stress at work leads you to experience fatigue, feelings of failure, and a loss of your sense of self. Research shows that 63% of entrepreneurs have experienced or are currently experiencing it. Factors that contribute to burnout in entrepreneurs include financial concerns, poor work-life balance, and general, everyday stress. The most effective treatment for burnout is stepping away from the job for a while, but that’s not always possible. If you can’t take time off, focus on getting quality sleep, spending time with friends and family, reconnecting with things you’re passionate about, and spending time in nature. These strategies can also soothe symptoms of depression.)

##### Strategies for Improving Your Mental Health

Over time, Fox learned to balance taking care of herself with being a business owner. She found several things helpful while managing her mental health struggles:

**Find doctors and mental health professionals you trust who can help figure out the best treatment option for you.** For Fox, taking antidepressants ended up being the best option for helping her feel like herself again.

(Shortform note: Before booking a full appointment with a mental health professional such as a therapist, consider setting up a 10- or 15-minute introductory appointment. Some therapists will allow you to do this without billing your insurance. Use this time to learn about the practitioner, their therapy approach, and the services they offer. The information you gather will help you decide if they’re right for you.)

**Surround yourself with a strong community.** Fox had a large network of friends, family, and colleagues she could lean on when things were difficult. This supportive community was especially helpful while managing her mental health during the company’s collapse.

(Shortform note: Fox had an established social network to turn to when she was struggling, but this may not be true for everybody. If you find yourself needing some extra social support, try getting involved in a new club or joining a volunteer group. These activities connect you with people who have similar interests and values, and they provide structured opportunities for building relationships. Alternatively, try adopting a pet—studies show that interacting with animals can have the same social benefits as interacting with humans. Pets are also great conversation starters when you’re trying to make new friends.)

**Find passions outside of work.** When it feels like work is taking over your life, make time for hobbies that are different from your job. If you work on a computer, find activities that get you away from screens. For example, you could take up a new sport, work on DIY projects around your house, or learn a new craft.

(Shortform note: In _Digital Minimalism_ , Cal Newport offers some tips for choosing a hobby away from screens. First, choose a demanding hobby over a passive one. Demanding hobbies require you to learn a new skill or finish a task, which creates a sense of pride and satisfaction. Second, make something with your hands. Creating or practicing something inspires a sense of accomplishment. Finally, try in-person social activities that energize you through positive interactions with others, like competitive games and sports.)
