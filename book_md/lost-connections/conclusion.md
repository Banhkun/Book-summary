## Conclusion: The Need for Collective Change

As we’ve seen, depression is more than just an individual issue, and we can’t expect to conquer it individually. Even if it _were_ possible to cure depression on your own, if you’re working endless hours at a dead-end job just to make rent, you’re unlikely to have the time or energy! Instead, as previously noted, to truly tackle depression, we need large-scale societal changes, including a fundamental restructuring of personal, cultural, and economic priorities. The way depression has become nearly universal should be a wake-up call: **The old ways of doing things are not working.**

This may seem like a daunting task. Fundamentally changing the systems that cause depression is undeniably a massive undertaking. However, so were social changes such as introducing marriage equality, women’s suffrage, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and electing a Black president—and **these changes still came to pass.**

### Structural Change Is Possible

As evidence that even seemingly impossible social change _can_ happen, Hari offers the story of his friend, journalist Andrew Sullivan. In 1993, after watching the AIDS crisis unfold and claim the lives of his friends, Sullivan received his own devastating HIV-positive diagnosis (at the time, there were no reliable treatments for HIV, so the diagnosis was often a death sentence). With little to lose, Sullivan quit his job and poured his energy into writing the first book to propose legalizing same-sex marriage. He knew the idea would sound like an absurd pipe dream, but he hoped it would at least make things a bit better for the next generation after his death.

Except, to his own surprise, Sullivan survived. The book, _Virtually Normal_ , attracted serious backlash, but it also started a conversation that evolved into a full-blown civil rights movement. Twenty-five years later, the majority opinion for the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage quoted the book directly as part of the rationale for writing marriage equality into federal law.

Andrew Sullivan’s absurd, not-quite-deathbed dream became a reality for the entire United States. Perhaps one day, the dream of restructuring society to address the way it causes depression can become a reality, too.
