## Part 2 | Chapter 3: Disconnections From Others

We’ve seen that biology isn’t the primary cause of depression for most people. In this part, we’ll cover what _does_ cause depression: the social, psychological, and environmental factors in our daily lives.

Hari calls these factors “disconnections” because they represent a fundamental disconnect between the realities of modern life and the healthy practices we need in order to stave off depression. Disconnections fall into three broad categories: disconnections from others, disconnections from your past and future, and disconnections from a meaningful life.

In this chapter, we’ll begin by exploring forms of disconnections to others: namely disconnection from meaningful relationships and from positive social status.

### Disconnection From Meaningful Relationships

The first factor that can cause depression is **disconnection from meaningful relationships with other people.** Social isolation can create loneliness, which impacts us on more than just an emotional level: It creates real, measurable change in the body. **In one study, researchers found that acute loneliness raises your levels of the stress hormone cortisol as much as being physically attacked.**

(Loneliness also lowers your immune response. One study found that lonely people are three times more likely to catch the common cold than socially connected people; another study found that when people get sick with cancer or heart disease, lonely people are two to three times more likely to die from that illness than connected people are. These health effects will become an even bigger concern as technology starts to replace all types of in-person connections.)

The link between loneliness and depression is deceiving because it could reasonably go both ways: Loneliness could trigger the onset of depression, or being depressed could lead to social withdrawal and ultimately trigger loneliness. Researchers tested the direction of this effect using the power of hypnosis. They administered a battery of personality tests (including a test of depression symptoms) to participants and divided them into two groups. A psychiatrist who specializes in the clinical use of hypnosis then prompted one group to remember experiences of profound loneliness and the other group to remember feeling profoundly socially connected.

After coming out of hypnosis, the participants completed the personality tests a second time. The results were conclusive: **People who remembered feeling lonely were significantly more depressed than they had been before undergoing hypnosis** , and people who remembered feeling connected were significantly _less_ depressed. In other words, this study showed that loneliness is a _cause_ of depression, not just a result, because making people feel more lonely also made them feel more depressed.

#### Evolutionary History

If you think about loneliness in the context of evolutionary history, it makes sense that being isolated from other people would lead to depression. Millions of years ago, humans were much further down the food chain than we are now. The only way for early humans to avoid becoming a tasty snack for a predator was to band together into tribes. People who felt miserably depressed when they wandered off on their own were more motivated to stick with the tribe, and so they were more likely than loners to survive long enough to pass on their genes. **In other words, the inability to tolerate loneliness due to the depression it triggered is what kept our ancestors alive.**

What does this mean for modern humans? Essentially, we are the descendants of the people who had the strongest negative reactions to social isolation (because the more it hurts to be alone, the more motivated you are to stay with the group). On a deep, instinctual level, our entire species evolved to be especially sensitive to loneliness and to interpret feeling lonely as a powerful signal meaning “I am not safe, and I need to get back to the group _now_ ”—and for modern humans, that powerful unease translates to depression.

That evolutionary sensitivity to loneliness makes chronic loneliness a self-perpetuating problem. Profound loneliness triggers depression, which makes people withdraw and isolate themselves. On top of that, they become highly anxious because, as previously mentioned, the most primitive part of their brains perceives isolation as a threat. That anxiety makes them even more suspicious and afraid of strangers, making it even harder to form the genuine connections they need. It’s easy to justify this with the Western emphasis on independence and self-sufficiency, but in reality, humans were not built for isolation. We have a deep evolutionary need for community.

#### Modern Humans Are Less Connected Than Ever

Today, loneliness is hard to avoid, as nearly every form of social connection (like sports leagues or regular dinners with friends) is becoming less and less frequent. This trend is particularly obvious in individualist cultures: For example, a 1980s study showed that the average American had three close friends; by 2004, that number dropped to zero. That’s not because people are spending more time with family and less with friends—all forms of family togetherness have dropped in popularity as quickly as other social connections.

Today, many people report feeling disconnected and lonely even in densely populated cities where it is nearly impossible to ever be truly alone. There’s a common, paradoxical sense of homesickness, even when we’re already home. **That’s because overcoming loneliness isn’t just about gaining physical proximity to others, but also about feeling a mutually _meaningful_ connection with someone else**. It’s not enough to be around people, or even to be around someone you care about—you need to feel that they care about you in return, and that you’re both connected to something you’re equally passionate about.

##### Online Connections Are Not Enough

It may seem ironic that the explosion of chronic loneliness across the world coincided with the birth of easily-accessible social media—now that we have constant access to everyone we know, shouldn’t we feel _more_ connected, not less? Psychologists who specialize in internet addiction disagree because **social media facilitates _communication_ , not real connection. **

Online communication scratches the connection itch temporarily, and can be a valuable tool, but it doesn’t provide the long-term sense of well-being that comes from connecting with someone in the same physical space as you. When you connect with someone face-to-face, all of your senses are engaged, satisfying your brain’s primal urge to connect. But when the interaction is mediated through a screen, that multisensory experience shrivels down to a series of pixels—a very new form of communication that your brain’s very old evolutionary patterns can’t quite process.

### Disconnection From Positive Social Status

Not _all_ forms of in-person connections are helpful—**if your social status is low or threatened, interaction with others can actually make depression worse.** Surprisingly, the first researchers to study this effect weren’t psychologists or sociologists—they were primatologists studying the social hierarchies of baboons in Kenya. Monkeys and apes are humankind’s closest evolutionary cousins, and like us, they live in social communities. Studying those groups gives researchers a chance to watch social relationships play out in a much more concentrated way than they can when studying human communities.

#### Depression as a Submission Response

For baboons in particular, there is a strict hierarchy within the group. Female baboons inherit their place in the hierarchy from their mothers, but male baboons are constantly competing with each other for the top spots. Even the alpha male baboon’s position can be challenged by younger, stronger males. The competition is brutal—researchers can often identify low-status males instantly because they’re covered in so many bite marks from higher-status males asserting their dominance.

What does this have to do with human depression? The key is the way those low-status males cope with the constant abuse from high-status baboons. To avoid being ripped apart, low-status baboons make themselves as non-threatening as possible by lowering themselves physically. They bow their heads and keep their bodies low to the ground whenever other apes are around as a way of communicating, “You win. Please don’t hurt me. I’m not a threat.” **Their posture, behavior, and energy levels mimic those of a severely depressed human.**

The similarity between stressed baboons and depressed humans goes even further—both have elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their blood, and both show the same changes in the brain, pituitary gland, and adrenal gland compared to their unstressed counterparts.

**Because of these similarities, some scientists think that human depression is a submission response from deep in our evolutionary history.** On a primal level, your brain can’t tell the difference between being savagely attacked by a competitive baboon and working a thankless job, being compared to unrealistic body ideals, or struggling financially—all of which make you feel “not good enough,” or like your status is low relative to people who are successful, thin, or rich. As a result, your brain reacts in the same way it would if you were being attacked. Whatever the cause, depression is the body’s way of saying, “You win. I give up. Just stop the pain.”

#### Low or Threatened Social Status Triggers Depression

This stress response shows up in different situations depending on a baboon’s place in the social hierarchy: Low-status baboons are stressed almost constantly, and high-status baboons are acutely stressed when their status is threatened.

Generally, human depression works the same way: When people are at the bottom of their social hierarchy, they’re more likely to be depressed. That makes intuitive sense—when life is harder, there’s more to be depressed about—but being at the top of the hierarchy can also trigger depression for humans if that status is threatened.

Sometimes, even having a social hierarchy at all can constitute a status threat because everyone feels the stress of needing to avoid falling to a lower rung of the social ladder. Research shows that **highly unequal societies (with a large gap between those at the bottom and those at the top) have higher rates of depression for _everyone_ , regardless of their spot in the hierarchy,** than countries with more equal social structures. This is part of why countries like the United States (with the most unequal distribution of wealth of any advanced economy) have higher rates of _all_ mental illnesses, including depression, than countries with more social equality (like Norway).

  * If you imagine the social hierarchy as a physical ladder, Norway’s ladder would be one or two stories tall, while the United States’ ladder would be closer to five or six stories. A fall from either wouldn’t be pleasant, but a fall from the U.S. ladder would hurt a _lot_ more—so there’s more pressure for high-status people to defend their position at the top, and that pressure can trigger a submission response like depression.
