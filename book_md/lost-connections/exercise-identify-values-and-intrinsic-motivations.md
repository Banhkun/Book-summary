## Exercise: Identify Values and Intrinsic Motivations

Making financial decisions based on your core values (things that you consider most important for living a good life) and intrinsic motivations (things you love to do just for the joy of it) can help alleviate depression. Use this exercise as a chance to take inventory of those values and how they affect your decisions.

* * *

Other than necessities like food and rent, what things do you typically spend money on? (For example, a daily coffee shop visit, vacations, gadgets, and so on.)

Now, try to list three values that are most important to you (things like sustainability, family time, integrity, and so on).

Next, list three of your intrinsic motivationsâ€”things you love to do and would happily do for free (for example, playing an instrument, reading, gardening, and so on).

Do the things you spend extra money on line up with your values and intrinsic motivations? Do they make it easier to do the things you really love to do? Why or why not?

What concrete change could you make to better align your spending habits with your values and intrinsic motivations? (For example, if you lease an expensive car just to impress other people, you might consider downgrading to a less expensive car and putting the money you save toward something you really value, like a trip to spend time with relatives in another country).
