## Exercise: Compare Online and In-Person Interactions

Between advances in technology and the rise of social media, many forms of communication that once took place face-to-face have moved online. Reflect on the differences between in-person and online interactions.

* * *

Interacting online and interacting face-to-face are very different experiences. Aside from not being in the same physical space, what differences do you notice in how you see these experiences? (For example, maybe you feel more anxious when communicating in person, or maybe you get distracted easier when communicating online.)

Hari argues that online interactions canâ€™t fulfill the instinctual human need to connect. Do you agree? Why or why not?

In your ideal world, what types of interactions would take place online, and what types would take place in person? (For example, maybe you think all banking should happen online, or all job interviews should be in person.)
