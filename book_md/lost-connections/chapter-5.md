## Chapter 5: Disconnections From Meaning and Purpose

The final group of disconnections we’ll look at are disconnections from meaning and purpose. For many people, the loss of hope for the future hinges on an unsatisfying and seemingly meaningless work life. Being low on your organization’s totem pole and having little control over the day-to-day responsibilities of your work can lead to depression. That feeling of being an unimportant cog in the machine can also spill over into your personal life and prevent you from doing the things you truly enjoy doing for their own sake.

Furthermore, for people living in cities, those work and life struggles are coupled with a disconnection from the natural world. This makes it much harder to see how small many problems really are in the grand scheme of things.

We’ll look at each of these factors below.

### Disconnection From a Rewarding Work Life

For many people, an unfulfilling and unhappy work life leads to depression. Most people sleepwalk through their work day or actively dread going to work, often because they feel they have little control over their responsibilities and thus disengage from their work. In 2011 and 2012, a Gallup poll surveyed millions of people all over the world. Only 13% said they are “enthusiastic about and committed to” their work. The rest were “not engaged” (63%) or “actively disengaged” (24%). At the same time, work hours are expanding—the “nine to five” is now more of a “seven to seven”—which means that many people spend more time working than doing things they actually enjoy.

It might seem obvious that spending most of your life in a job where you have little control and aren’t actively engaged could make you depressed, but scientists resisted that idea for many years. The tide began to change after a landmark study of British civil servants showed that **the higher your status at work, the lower your risk of heart attacks and depression.**

This finding contradicted the popular assumption that people at the top of the ladder would have more health problems because they made more important decisions and therefore had more stress. In fact, a second study of the British civil service showed that **people who have more control over their work are far less likely to be depressed than people who have less control** , even when they work in the same office and have the same salary. In other words, the degree of control you have over your job is a better predictor of depression than where you work, how much status you have, or even how much money you make.

This lack of control affects people even after they clock out. People who feel they have a sense of control over their work tend to feel more fulfilled at the end of a work day, so they have the energy to spend time with friends and family. On the other hand, people who have very little control over their work lives tend to be so drained by the end of a work day that they have no energy to invest in their relationships. Over time, that lack of investment creates disconnections with other people that only worsen depression.

Another control-related factor that determines how much work contributes to depression is the balance between effort and reward. In some jobs, the harder you work, the more money and status you gain; in others, your performance and dedication don’t matter, and the only time anyone even notices your work is if you do something wrong. **If your efforts have a meaningful impact on your rewards, as in the former case, you have some degree of control over how rewarding your work is, and a lower risk of developing depression;** but if your efforts go unnoticed and you have no control over your rewards, your risk for depression increases.

### Disconnection From Intrinsic Motivation

How much you enjoy your work life also depends on whether you’re intrinsically or extrinsically motivated to do the work itself. **Intrinsic motivation** is what drives you to do things purely for the joy of them. If you love running and spend all your free time doing it, you’re acting on intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, **extrinsic motivation** is a means to an end: If you _hate_ running but keep doing it because you’re trying to lose weight, that’s extrinsic motivation. You’re not doing it for the joy of the activity itself—you’re doing it for the payoff.

Today’s culture emphasizes extrinsic motivation because we base our definition of success on external milestones—like climbing the corporate ladder, getting married, buying a house, and so on. The logic is that meeting those milestones is the only way to be successful, and being successful is the only way to be happy. You may not love the actual day-to-day routine of your job, but you stick with it because it pays well, carries a fancy title, and makes it possible to buy that nice house. The job itself is just the means to achieve that goal.

Extrinsic motivation isn’t necessarily a bad thing—you’re probably not intrinsically motivated to go to the dentist for yearly checkups, but it’s still a good thing to do. But when the majority of your time is spent pursuing extrinsic motives, it’s a recipe for misery. Studies show that **achieving intrinsic goals increases happiness, but achieving extrinsic goals doesn’t _._ **Whether it’s a promotion, a bigger house, the newest gadgets—they might give you a fleeting burst of joy, but it wears off quickly, and doesn’t make you happier overall. In fact, over time, it does the opposite: Dozens of studies from all over the world show that**the more extrinsically motivated you are, the more likely you are to develop depression and anxiety.**

#### Materialism Leads to Depression

Extrinsic motivation often manifests as materialism because modern society uses money and material objects as status indicators. If your extrinsic goal is to be seen as successful, you’re more likely to focus on having expensive clothes or a fancy car because most people associate wealth with success. Hari calls these superficial, materialistic extrinsic values “junk values”—like “junk food,” they may be satisfying in the moment, but too much of them can make you sick. Over time, these junk values lead to depression for four main reasons:

**1) Extrinsically motivated, materialistic people have shorter, lower-quality relationships with others**. We’ve seen how important authentic connections are for preventing depression, but if you’re laser-focused on climbing the corporate ladder so you can afford to live a lavish lifestyle, you’re more likely to seek out connections with people because of what they can do for you, not who they are. On top of that, if your relationships are based on status symbols and perceived wealth, they’re more likely to crumble if that wealth someday disappears.

**2) People experience fewer flow states when they’re focused on materialistic, extrinsic goals.** Flow states are times when you’re so absorbed in an activity that you lose all sense of time. In flow, you lose yourself in the joy of what you’re doing instead of focusing on ego-driven questions about what other people will think or how much money you’ll make for doing it. Studies show that getting into a flow state frequently is an important part of overall happiness—but it’s almost impossible to be in flow when you spend most of your time focused on making enough money to buy the next exciting gadget or expensive sneakers. Constantly feeling the pull of “stuff” makes it difficult to fully sink into an activity purely for the joy of it.

**3) Materialistic people have a less secure sense of self-worth**. If you’re driven by money or status, you’ll always be worrying about what other people think of you and calculating whether you’re impressive enough to earn external rewards. Over time, constantly questioning whether you’re “good enough” chips away at your self-esteem.

**4) Junk values don’t meet our fundamental social needs.** When you spend all your time chasing the status and material stuff you _think_ you need to be happy, you inevitably neglect your _real_ need for connection. For example, if you work late because you think the resulting money and status will make you happy, you’ll be disappointed. But if you go home and genuinely connect with your loved ones during that time instead, you’ll actually _achieve_ that happiness.

Despite these harmful effects of junk values, it’s easy to get distracted by them because we’re all steeped in materialism from a young age. Studies show that **kids as young as three can recognize one hundred brand logos**. A separate study showed that after watching just two commercials for a certain toy, most four- and five-year-olds would rather play with a “mean boy” who owns that toy than with a “really nice boy” who doesn’t own the toy. Conversely, most kids who weren’t exposed to the two commercials chose to play with the nice boy, even though he didn’t own the toy. Essentially, it only took two commercials to persuade kids to choose a material object over a human connection.

This effect doesn’t lose power as kids grow up—in fact, it gets even stronger. Advertisers prey on typical teenage insecurities to sell everything from clothing to cologne. The link between a certain product and increased social status then spills over into kids’ social circles and reinforces the message even further—if the ad itself didn’t sell them on the product, the fact that all the cool kids are buying it might do the trick.

Thankfully, the social environment can also be a _good_ influence:**If the people in your social circle have healthy, anti-materialist values, you’re more likely to focus on those healthy values too.** However, there’s a limit to how much any individual can escape the materialist vortex—it will take policy changes at the societal level to truly put an end to the problem (like advertising bans, which we’ll explore in more detail in Chapter 9).

### Disconnection From Nature

The final disconnection we’ll explore is a disconnection from nature. Humans evolved to live in the wild—in evolutionary terms, living inside buildings is a very new development. When we lose touch with the natural world, we often become caught up in our own problems and lose sight of the greater sense of meaning in our lives. We’re also more likely to become depressed: Rates of all forms of mental illness are higher in cities than in rural areas, and people in urban areas with more green space (like parks) have better mental health than people in urban areas without access to green space.

#### City-Dwelling Humans Are Like Animals in Captivity

Some of the first scientific studies on how being disconnected from nature can make people sick weren’t about people at all. Researchers comparing bonobos in captivity to bonobos in the wild discovered that both groups show the same type of fierce social competition as baboons, with the same constant stress for the low-status animals.

However, the effects of this stress differed in severity between captive and wild bonobos. In the wild, the low-status bonobos showed signs of that distress by scratching compulsively, refusing grooming, and isolating themselves—but only up to a certain point. In captivity, the low-status bonobos sank lower than their wild counterparts, often developing tics, howling, or scratching until they bled. Other animals show the same extreme distress in captivity by injuring themselves, rocking compulsively, and refusing to mate—behaviors researchers have never seen in the wild.

**In a sense, humans living in dense cities are similar to animals in captivity** , living in concrete boxes far from the natural habitat that evolution prepared them for. And like all animals, living in captivity can make us deeply depressed.

#### Three Theories of Natural Disconnection

In general, all humans feel better with regular exposure to the natural environment. But for people with depression, that effect is up to five times greater—even after just a short nature walk. So why is nature such a powerful mood-booster, and why are we so miserable without it? Scientists have three theories:

**1) Modern, sedentary lifestyles don’t meet our evolutionary needs.** Humans are animals, and like all animals, we spent most of our evolutionary history outside, doing the hard physical work of hunting, building shelter, and fighting off threats in order to survive. Today, we value intellectual and technical skills more than physical ones, so we spend our time being sedentary and indoors, neglecting the purpose our bodies evolved for—and it’s making us miserable.

**2) We have an innate preference for natural landscapes.** Like the need for movement, the need to be in nature is rooted deep in human evolutionary history. Scientists call this “biophilia,” and it explains why even the smallest exposure to nature can have such profound effects (for example, one experiment in a prison showed that prisoners in cells that had a view of nature were 24% less likely to need medical care than prisoners without a view).

**3) Connecting to nature breaks the grip of the ego.** Depression can be so painful and consuming that people unintentionally sink into themselves and lose any sense of connection to the grander scheme of things. Their world shrinks down to their own experiences. But out in nature, that pain no longer seems like the biggest or most important thing in the world because it’s so small compared to the expansive landscape. Being in nature grants a new perspective—the pain is still there, but it’s far from the whole story of your life, because you are part of something much bigger than yourself.
