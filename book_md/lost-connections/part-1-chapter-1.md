## Part 1 | Chapter 1: Depression Is More Than a “Chemical Imbalance”

(Shortform note: We’ve reordered the book’s material in this summary to add clarity.)

When _Lost Connections_ author Johann Hari first started taking antidepressants, his doctor explained depression the way the medical community sees it: Depression is a brain disease caused by low levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain, and antidepressants treat depression by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Millions of people have heard this same explanation from doctors when they sought medical treatment for depression—in 2014, one out of every five adults in the United States was taking some form of psychiatric medication.

But the sheer number of people taking medications for mental health hints at a deeper issue: If depression is a purely biological illness caused by a random malfunction in the brain, how is it that so many people’s brains are going biologically haywire at the same time? As it turns out, **depression is not just about your biology.** Brain chemicals (called neurotransmitters) and genetics _do_ play a role, but even if you’re genetically predisposed to depression, your genes alone won’t make you depressed—something in the environment _outside_ the brain has to go wrong to trigger them.

Today, most scientists talk about depression and other mental illnesses using the arguably more accurate**biopsychosocial model** , or the idea that mental illness is caused by a combination of three factors: biology (“bio”), psychological history (“psycho”), and social environment (“social”). In other words, biology is only _part_ of the problem—which means a drug that treats biological factors can only be _part_ of the solution.

This isn’t to say that Hari is against antidepressants in general (nor are most of the doctors and scientists he interviewed). As we’ll see,**antidepressants do have some effect on symptoms of depression and anxiety:** but it’s a small effect, on a small percentage of people, that lasts for a short time.

In _Lost Connections_ , Johann Hari investigates the psychological and social factors that contribute to depression (which he calls “disconnections”), as well as innovative social and environmental treatments for depression (or “reconnections”).

In Part 1 of this summary, you’ll learn how the medical field views depression and why many psychiatrists now use the biopsychosocial model to talk about mental illness. Then, we’ll discuss the history of antidepressants, the shaky science behind them, and why biological treatments alone can’t cure depression. Part 2 will cover the seven social disconnections that lead to depression as well as the real role of biology in mental illness. In Part 3, you’ll learn about innovative solutions for each of the seven disconnections and why treating depression is a cultural, political, and economic issue.

### The History of the Medical Model: Depression as a “Chemical Imbalance”

The “medical model” of mental illness is the idea that a serotonin imbalance in the brain causes symptoms of depression and anxiety, with no influence from the outside environment. Serotonin is one of several chemicals in the brain called _neurotransmitters_ , which are chemical messengers that relay information from one cell to another. In the medical model, serotonin is the chemical that makes us feel happy, and people get depressed when their brains don’t produce enough serotonin on their own. Through this lens, depression is a medical disease that pops up randomly, much like cancer.

This explanation is a relief for many depressed people who are often accused of being lazy or just not trying hard enough to be happy or even to function. The model gives these people a biological process to point to: Depression comes from a chemical imbalance in the brain, not a lack of willpower or a choice to be lazy, so it’s not their fault. However, that story is only half-true: Depression isn’t about willpower or laziness (and is certainly not a choice), **but the debilitating effects of depression are not the result of a simple “chemical imbalance.”**

The false idea that low serotonin levels in the brain cause depression symptoms originated in a tuberculosis ward in 1952 with an experimental new drug containing serotonin. The treatment was a flop in terms of treating tuberculosis, but it induced a state of euphoria in the patients that left them dancing in their rooms. There could be any number of explanations for that unexpected effect, but the technology required to test them didn’t exist yet, so all scientists could do was speculate that serotonin was responsible for the mood-lifting effects—and that’s exactly how “the serotonin story” started.

When scientists proposed that the failed tuberculosis drug was creating a sense of euphoria in patients by raising their serotonin levels, and that, therefore, low serotonin levels must lead to depression, it was a hypothesis based on pure guesswork. **_If_ raising serotonin levels increased patients’ happiness, then _maybe_ low serotonin levels were causing their depression.** At the time, there was no evidence to support (or refute) that theory, but it persisted.

### The History of the Biopsychosocial Model

In contrast to the cultural idea of depression as a brain disease, most experts today look at depression through the lens of the **biopsychosocial model.** As previously noted, this view recognizes**three root causes of depression: biology, psychological history, and social factors.**

#### George Brown’s Depression Study

One of the first proponents of looking at depression through the biopsychosocial model was an anthropologist named George Brown. In the 1970s, Brown and his team conducted one of the first longitudinal studies looking at the psychological and social predictors of depression. They repeatedly interviewed hundreds of women in their homes (114 of whom had a formal diagnosis of depression, and 344 of whom had no diagnosis and served as a control group). These interviews looked for three things: severe losses or traumatic events in the previous year; chronic stressors (like an unsatisfying marriage or living in a violent neighborhood); and “stabilizers,” or positive relationships that counterbalance those negative events.

The idea was that if depression was truly a random brain malfunction that could strike anyone at any time, there should be no correlation between life experience and a diagnosis of depression; in other words, the women with depression would be just as likely as women without depression to have experienced trauma or chronic stress in the last year. To illustrate this, think of depression as a meteor falling from the sky—whether or not someone experienced trauma in the year before being hit by a meteor wouldn’t make any difference to the chances of the meteor strike occurring, because the event is truly random.

But Brown’s study showed that depression is nothing like a meteor. The results showed a clear distinction between the women with depression and the control group: **Only 20% of the women in the control group had experienced a traumatic event in the previous year, compared to 68% of the depressed group**. Women with depression were also three times more likely to have chronic stressors in their lives compared to women who weren’t depressed. However, stabilizers can make all the difference: Having a supportive partner and a tight network of close friends significantly reduces the risk of depression, even after serious trauma or stress.

**These effects are both cumulative and exponential:** If you experience a negative event _or_ a chronic stressor, it increases your likelihood of becoming depressed a little bit; but if you experience _both_ , your risk of depression skyrockets (unless you have a strong network of social support).**** Other researchers have replicated this study in different cultures and locations with similar results.

Before these studies, psychiatrists classified depression as either “reactive” (developing in response to a traumatic event) or “endogenous” (developing without any obvious trauma). Brown’s study included women with both these diagnoses, but the results showed that in reality, none of the women in the study had _truly_ endogenous depression—they all had some sort of stressful life event that preceded their diagnosis. Today, most psychiatrists agree that endogenous depression is a myth, and even those who believe it exists are quick to say that truly endogenous depression is exceedingly rare (estimated anywhere from 1% to 5% of all depression cases).
