## Exercise: Compare Work Experiences

The way we think about work has changed radically over the years. Think about how these changes might impact your own mental health.

* * *

If you have experience with both stable, contracted work and unstable, gig-based or freelance work: How did each of them impact your mental health? Which did you prefer and why?

Did you identify with the description of a “lost sense of the future” in this chapter? Why or why not?

Think about your parents and others of their generation. How did their work structure differ from yours? (For example, maybe your parent was a lifelong member of a labor union and always had job security, or maybe they were self-employed and only worked sporadically.)

Do you think you’d prefer that work structure over your own? Why or why not?
