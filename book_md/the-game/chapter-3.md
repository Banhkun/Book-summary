## Chapter 3: Neil Hones His Skills

Neil had been frequenting bars and clubs, practicing his craft with other men from the community. Between his practice and his posts to the online message boards, Neil was quickly moving up in the seduction community.

When Sin—Mystery’s wing from his workshop—decided to leave the community to join the Air Force, **Mystery wanted Neil to step in and wing his upcoming workshops.**

Neil was so eager to take the opportunity that he agreed, even though the next scheduled workshop conflicted with a trip he’d planned to visit Belgrade to see his old friend, Marko. Neil refused to miss out on this chance to apprentice with a guru, so he convinced Mystery to hold his next workshop in Belgrade.

But if Neil was going to wing the workshop, he’d need an alias—nearly everyone in the seduction community had one. Mystery dubbed him Style.

### Improving His Game

**It had only been a month since Style’s pickup education began while _attending_ Mystery’s workshop—and soon he’d be helping Mystery _lead_ a workshop.** Style began training rigorously to improve his game in the six weeks before the next workshop.

Style read books on a range of related subjects, including:

  * Social dynamics 
  * Flirting 
  * Body language
  * Sexual technique 
  * Women’s sexual fantasies
  * Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), per Jeffries’ method
  * Magic and mind-reading, per Mystery’s method



Based on what he read, Style also:

  * **Corrected his gestures and posture to make himself appear more confident**
  * Took singing and speech lessons to make his fast, muffled speech slower and clearer
  * Wore bright clothing and flashy accessories for peacocking, including fake piercings, feather boas, and light-up necklaces



Style went out constantly with Grimble, his wing Twotimer, and Jeffries. Style studied their sarging techniques, and he tried to emulate them.

#### Success Reveals Style’s Inner Doubt

One day, Style nervously approached a woman in Office Depot. Following the prescribed routine, he negged her, showed her an ESP trick, and made up a false time constraint.

Style asked the woman how they could continue their conversation, and, to his surprise, she offered her phone number and email address. PUAs never give their phone numbers and never ask for a woman’s number directly—they must get the woman to offer her number.

The woman had claimed to be a model, so when Style got home, he looked her up online. He discovered that he’d just scored the Playmate of the Year’s phone number.

**Although Style was thrilled, he felt unworthy. He’d learned the strategies, but hadn’t yet built the confidence to back them up.** He never called.

### Style’s Debut as Mystery’s Wing

**Confidence was a critical part of the game: PUAs needed it to complete successful pickups, and they gained it from their successes.** Many newcomers to the community had spent so many years failing with women, that they had no confidence.

The first step to feeling more confident was looking good. When Mystery and Style arrived in Belgrade for the workshop, Mystery gave Style a laundry list of changes he needed to make to his appearance to improve his seduction game:

  * Shave his head
  * Get a tan
  * Get Lasik and stop wearing his eyeglasses
  * Start working out



When Style’s childhood friend, Marko, picked them up from the airport, their first stop was a barbershop—and the second was a tanning salon. Style was surprised how much better he looked from such simple changes.

#### The First Night of the Workshop

On the first night of Mystery’s workshop, **Style felt intense pressure to prove himself in front of Mystery and the students.** He’d been training for months.

Each of the three workshop students had different challenges: One was trying too hard, one seemed boring, and one was socially awkward. When they got to the club, Mystery and Style gave them pickup assignments and critiqued their performances after each one.

Then, they came across a gorgeous, confident-looking woman in a two-set (a group of two in a bar or club; there can be sets of any number of people). Mystery and Style sent in the socially awkward student, a 22-year-old named Sasha.

As the two women sat at the bar, Sasha walked up to them from behind. It took several attempts to get their attention—and when he did, he had nothing engaging to say.

At Mystery’s insistence, Style stepped in to rescue Sasha and show the students a PUA in action. **Style was nervous, but he knew the strategies—now he just had to use them with confidence.**

#### Style’s Strategy

As Style approached the two-set and Sasha, he was fighting what Mystery dubbed social homeostasis, which is the push-and-pull men feel between wanting to pick up women and fearing rejection. Still, he knew that **he had to emanate confidence—if he didn’t, the women would see right through his charade.**

Style thought strategically. A successful pickup was a multistep process:

1) **Approach** : Since the women were facing the bar, Style approached on the left side of the so-called obstacle, who sat between him and the woman he wanted to pick up. By contrast, Sasha’s approach from behind had meant the women had to turn 180 degrees to see and respond to him, and they simply had to turn back around if they wanted to ignore him.

2) **Get in position** : Style recited an opening line about magic spells, and, meanwhile, he thought about how he would maneuver around the obstacle to get next to his target. When the women responded well to his opener, Style said that he wanted to show his target something, which was a ploy to move next to her.

3) **Join the set** : Now Style was on his target’s right side, but he needed to find a way to sit down, in order to make himself part of the set. Style knew that if he spent too much time standing over the women, they would start to feel uncomfortable. There were no open stools at the bar, so Style instructed his target to stand up so he could perform a trick—and, as soon as she did, he sat in her seat.

4) **Develop rapport** : To smooth things over, Style joked with his target that he’d stolen her seat. She joked back, signaling that he hadn’t overstepped. Style told the woman he had to leave soon (creating a time constraint), but he said that he had another trick to show her first.

5) **Distract obstacle** : Sasha was still hanging around, so Mystery whispered to him that he needed to entertain the other woman—the obstacle—so that she wouldn’t take Style’s target away. This would normally be the wing’s responsibility.

6) **Number-close** : When Style’s artificial time constraint was up, he simply told the woman he’d like to see her again while he was in town. With no further prodding, the woman wrote down her number and handed it to Style.

Style encouraged Sasha to attempt an e-mail-close with the obstacle, and it worked. Sasha was floored.

**Style’s performance demonstrated not only his credibility, but the credibility of the Mystery Method.** His success gave the workshop students hope that, with some training, they could achieve the same.

#### The Cost of Success in Seduction

While Style was having more success with women, he realized that mastering the pickup game had an unintended consequence: He was constantly objectifying women.

In the seduction community, the way that men bonded and related to each other reinforced this way of thinking about women. They constantly rated women’s attractiveness, and their status in the community was measured by the quantity and the attractiveness of the women they could pick up.

**Style had started to view women as benchmarks of his pickup ability, and his interactions with women had become scripted and strategic, substituting for genuine connection.**

### Marko’s One-Itis

Even after witnessing the power of pickup during Mystery’s workshop, Style’s childhood friend Marko was skeptical of Mystery and the game.

Growing up, Marko and Style had both struggled with girls. But now Marko was a few months into a relationship with a woman named Goca, whom he wanted to marry.

**Marko was suffering from what PUAs called one-itis—when men get overly attached to women, and, ultimately, push them away with neediness.** PUAs’ prescription for one-itis was to sleep with several other women. But Marko wasn’t interested in this cure.

One night, Style, Mystery, Marko, and Goca all went out together. During dinner, Marko and Goca seemed uncomfortable and awkwardly formal. Eventually, Style couldn’t help but jump in.

Style took photos of the couple with his digital camera. For the last photo, he insisted that they kiss. It turned out to be the pair’s first kiss, and it was as awkward as the rest of their interactions.

During dinner, Style thought Goca was eyeing him—and his suspicion was confirmed that night, when she crawled into bed with him while Marko was in the shower. Style was tempted, but he refused, despite Goca’s insistence that Marko was just a friend.

When Marko got out of the shower, he and Goca got into a fight and she stormed out. Marko told Style he was ready to try learning the game.

### Style Discovers Mystery’s Background

Heartbroken and discouraged, Marko decided to take a road trip to Moldova, a small country that broke off from Russia, where the most beautiful women in Eastern Europe supposedly lived. Style and Mystery agreed to join Marko on his adventure.

The trip was a flop. However, during their travels, Style learned about Mystery’s upbringing and how it had molded him into an attention-hungry magician-PUA.

Growing up, Mystery and his brother were physically and verbally abused by their father. **As a child, when he was depressed, Mystery fantasized about killing his father with a shovel, and then killing himself.**

In an effort to balance out the abuse, their mother was extremely loving with Mystery’s 14-year-older brother—but when the older brother came out as gay, their mother blamed herself and the excessive affection she’d showered on him. Consequently, **Mystery’s mother was emotionally distant from Mystery** , in order to prevent the same fate.

Ironically, Mystery had questioned whether he might be gay when he was in his early 20s and still a virgin. When Mystery determined that he wasn’t gay, he started researching social dynamics and developing the Mystery Method.

### Style Learns to Kiss-Close

Prior to Mystery’s workshop, Style had gone out every night to practice seduction. He’d mastered a routine that consistently helped him number-close—but his pickups never went any further.

**Style had to get out of his head and get over his nerves in order to attempt a kiss-close.**

Style’s impressive success on the first night of the workshop gave him a confidence boost. But when he met the woman at a cafe a few days later, he couldn’t shake his anxiety. Despite her indicators of interest (IOIs), Style couldn’t bring himself to kiss-close.

#### To Pick Up a Woman, Be Willing to Lose Her

As Style watched Mystery’s pickups, Style realized what he was missing: **He had to be willing to _lose_ a woman in order to make moves bold enough to _get_ her.**

Mystery had made a strategically impressive pickup on the first night of the workshop, and now he was sitting with the woman at a cafe and trying to figure out how he could get her to have sex with him.

Mystery claimed he’d had a haircut earlier in the day and that he needed to take a bath, offering for the woman to come and help him wash up. The woman, who had a boyfriend, declined.

Seemingly unperturbed, Mystery said goodbye and bluffed as if he was about to leave. The woman looked deflated.

Mystery took a few steps, then turned and told her he was going to take a bath at a nearby hotel instead of going back to Marko’s apartment. He repeated his offer for her to join him—if not, he said, he’d email her in a couple weeks when he was back home in Canada.

The woman paused briefly, and then she joined him.

#### Overcoming the Hump

After returning home from Belgrade, Style posted a call for advice on how to kiss-close on Mystery’s Lounge, an invite-only online seduction message board. Top pickup artists (PUAs) logged onto Mystery’s Lounge to exchange stories, strategies, and sometimes photos and videos.

Style got a range of responses:

  * Follow the three-second rule: Let the conversation stall and look her in the eyes. **If she holds your gaze for three seconds, she wants to kiss.**
  * Have her pick you up for the date and invite her into the house for a few minutes to establish some comfort there. At the end of the night, invite her back to your house, offer a drink, and entertain her for a while. Have her sit on your lap as you show her something on your computer. **Kiss her on the cheek, and usually she’ll turn around and kiss you—if she doesn’t, wait a few minutes and try again.**
  * Invite the woman into your house at the end of the date, and ask for a massage for your sore muscles. As she massages, critique her and insist on showing her how to do it. Start by massaging her back, then tell her that you feel tension in her legs and that you give your friends great leg massages. **Massage her legs, and then tell her that her pants are in the way.** After she takes her pants off, continue massaging as you gradually work your way up her legs. Presumably, she’ll then consent to having sex. 
  * **Get rid of your fear of rejection by convincing yourself that you don’t care about the woman.** Think of her as practice so that the stakes are low if you fail. Do something brazen, like telling her to stick her tongue out and then sucking on it. If she gets upset, you both come away with a story to tell at parties. 



Style took pieces of advice from the various posts and developed his own, fool-proof routine:

  1. **Compliment how she smells.** Explain that animals smell each other before they mate, and that humans are wired to become aroused when someone else smells them.
  2. Slide your hand up the back of her neck, **grab her hair, and pull it.** Explain that when lions mate, they bite each other’s mane. 
  3. Take her arm and **bite the inside of her elbow in an erotic way.** Explain that this is one of the most sensitive areas of the body.
  4. **Tell her to bite your neck.** If she hesitates, turn away for a few seconds (cat-string theory). Then turn back and tell her again; most likely, she’ll do it. 
  5. Critique her bite, then **pull her hair to the side and bite her neck.** Afterward, tell her to try again. 
  6. Tell her that the second bite was better. Then, **kiss her.**
  7. **Invite her back to your house at the end of the date.** Show her something on your computer, and have her sit on your lap. Kiss the back of her neck until she turns around and kisses you. 



Just one successful night with his new kiss-close routine pushed Style past his mental block.
