## Exercise: Reflect on Everyday Pickup Strategies

While most people don’t become students of seduction, many have heard general advice that overlaps with PUA strategies.

* * *

What are some rules of the game that you’ve heard (for example, be coy)? Which have you abided by, if any?

The last time that you approached a stranger you were attracted to, how did you open the conversation? Or, the last time someone approached you, how did she open the conversation?

During the conversation, what strategy did you use to engage the other person? For example, did you play hard-to-get, or were you completely transparent?

How did you show your interest?

How do you think following—or disregarding—certain rules of the game would’ve changed the outcome of the conversation (for example, whether you exchanged phone numbers or planned a date)?
