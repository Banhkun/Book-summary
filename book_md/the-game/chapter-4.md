## Chapter 4: Style Meets the Gurus

Mystery had another workshop coming up in two months, in Miami. Style set a goal to meet all the top pickup artists (PUAs) before then.

**The seduction community had several pickup gurus, each pedaling a different seduction strategy.** For example, Ross Jeffries’s Speed Seduction was based on subliminal messaging through sequences of scripted lines, while David DeAngelo’s Double Your Dating strategy used a hybrid of arrogance and humor, called cocky funny.

The gurus competed for disciples, discrediting each other in the process. However, most men in the seduction community didn’t want to commit to just one guru—like Style, they wanted to pick up as many strategies from as many sources as they could.

### Juggler: Be Bold

The first PUA Style contacted was Juggler.

**Juggler advocated tactics that were bold and unorthodox.** For example, he told his students to get over their fear of picking up women by calling random numbers from the phone book and asking for movie recommendations, or by convincing a homeless person to give them a quarter. Juggler also encouraged PUAs-in-training to make their pickups more challenging by telling women that they worked as garbage men or drove old cars.

Style attended one of Juggler’s free workshops in San Francisco.

Before Style reached out, Juggler already knew of Style from seeing his posts in the online seduction community. When they met, Juggler was impressed by Style’s innate likability, eloquence, and ability to put people at ease.

When Juggler saw Style in action, he admired Style’s skill at using seduction techniques. Combined with Style’s unassuming appearance, Juggler mused that Style could be an ideal sidekick for a rising seduction guru.

**Juggler could see that Style was lacking confidence, but that self-doubt disappeared when Style was sarging** (picking up women).

#### Juggler’s Background

Growing up, Juggler loved taking things apart—from toys to home appliances. **As he got older, Juggler remained curious about how things worked, but his focus changed from appliances to human interaction.**

Juggler became a street performer, juggler, and comedian. In these roles, he studied social dynamics and, consequently, improved his game with women. By 23, he’d had sex with just one woman, but by 28, he could pick up any woman.

**Juggler felt like he’d found his tribe when he discovered the online seduction community, because the game was based on the knowledge and strengths he’d developed.**

### Ross Jeffries: Neuro-Linguistic Programming

After Style’s trip to San Francisco, Jeffries called to invite Style to attend a seminar he was hosting that weekend. However, Style didn’t know that Jeffries had invited him as a pawn in the competition among the gurus.

**Style had become well-known in the community as Mystery’s new wing, and he’d gained respect since his impressive performance at Mystery’s Belgrade workshop.** Jeffries knew that he’d gain clout if he could claim Style as his follower.

In the middle of the seminar, Jeffries spotted Style in the audience and pushed him to declare Jeffries as his guru. However, Style deflected. When the two were alone later, Style explained that he didn’t feel he needed to choose among different methods—he wanted to learn from all gurus.

#### Jeffries’s Background

**Jeffries had created the foundation for the entire community, so he was very defensive of his position as a top guru in the community.** Jeffries chafed when other PUAs rose to prominence, spewing insults and greedily claiming his followers.

Jeffries had been raised by intelligent, good-natured Jewish parents who relentlessly teased him and his two brothers. Their teasing and high expectations beat down on Jeffries and his siblings.

As an adult, Jeffries was angry and lonely. He tried performing stand-up comedy and screenwriting, but he struggled and gave up. One day, as Jeffries was browsing self-help books, he happened to pick up a book about neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), titled _Frogs Into Princes_.

As soon as he read it, Jeffries was hooked. He read everything he could find on NLP, and then he used his new knowledge to seduce a woman who applied to work at his office. **After years of feeling powerless, Jeffries finally felt in control of his life.**

Jeffries kick-started his career as a PUA when he self-published a short book, titled _How to Get the Women You Desire Into Bed: A Down and Dirty Guide to Dating and Seduction for the Man Who’s Fed Up With Being Mr. Nice Guy_. Initially, he faced ridicule and backlash.

But when Jeffries started offering seminars, a community began to form. One of his followers created an online message board—and the worldwide seduction community was born.

### David DeAngelo: Cocky Funny

David DeAngelo had entered the seduction community as a student of Jeffries, but he broke out on his own after Jeffries allegedly hypnotized and seduced DeAngelo’s girlfriend.

**DeAngelo developed and promoted a strategy called cocky funny, which was a hybrid of arrogance and humor.**

DeAngelo wrote a manifesto on cocky funny and distributed it through an online seduction newsletter called Cliff’s List. It was so well-received, that Cliff—who operated Cliff’s List—convinced DeAngelo to turn the 15-page guide into an e-book, which DeAngelo titled _Double Your Dating_. He went on to build a business by the same name.

DeAngelo was unique among the gurus in several ways:

  1. He wasn’t particularly charismatic or emphatic. He was a regular guy who was sharing what he’d learned through experience. But **he was more organized as a businessman** than the other gurus (for example, DeAngelo scripted his entire seminar), and he was a skilled marketer. 
  2. **He presented his material in a way that was palatable to the public.** He excluded or rephrased anything that seemed creepy or degrading toward women—except his suggestion that aspiring PUAs get tips on picking up women by reading a book on dog training. 
  3. **He didn’t even use the word seduction, because it implied that he was tricking women into having sex with him.** Instead, DeAngelo said he was teaching attraction, which entailed self-improvement that caused women to naturally gravitate toward him. 
  4. **He didn’t engage directly with the online seduction community.** He stopped posting on the underground seduction world’s message boards, and he operated his business solely in the public world. 



#### DeAngelo’s Background

DeAngelo had been an unsuccessful real estate agent in Oregon when he decided to move to San Diego for a fresh start. DeAngelo was lonely in his new city, so he started teaching himself seduction tactics through online research and befriending men who were successful with women.

Along the way, DeAngelo met Riker, who was a student of Jeffries. Riker encouraged DeAngelo to practice seduction online, because facing rejection via instant messaging was less intimidating than face-to-face.**** DeAngelo took his advice and developed a strategy based on how women responded to his approaches.

**DeAngelo discovered that women were actually more receptive to his pickup when he relentlessly teased them in a playful way, which he dubbed cocky funny.**

#### Zan’s Cocky Funny Field Report

One of DeAngelo’s followers, named Zan, was a master of cocky funny.

Zan appeared to be genuinely cocky, playing up his seduction skills and touting his stories of conquest. **Zan always assumed every woman was interested in him, and he insisted that if he believed it with enough conviction, the woman would, too.**

If a woman tried to reject Zan, he played dumb and acted as if the woman wasn’t making any sense.

One day, Zan posted to Mystery’s Lounge about the cocky funny routine he used to pick up waitresses:

  1. When the waitress first came to the table, he pretended like he didn’t notice her for a few seconds. When he supposedly realized she was there, he appeared very interested in her. 
  2. He looked her up and down—long enough for her to notice, but not long enough to be creepy. Then he turned his body fully toward her, smiled, and winked. 
  3. He asked for her name as a means of breaking the ice. 
  4. Every time the waitress returned, he teased her that she kept coming back because she wanted to be around him. She started to play along with the game, which established a rapport. 
  5. He joked with the waitress that he’d call her, but he didn’t earnestly ask for her number. The purpose of the exchange was purely to make himself memorable.
  6. The next time he went to the restaurant, the waitress remembered him, so he picked up with an increased level of familiarity, putting his arm around her and saying what a good couple they’d make. **The cocky funny strategy created a buffer that allowed him to push the boundaries, because she never knew whether he was being serious or joking.**
  7. He continued the jokes about dating, such as apologizing for not calling her last night, and chastising her for being a negligent girlfriend. 
  8. He transitioned from joking to serious. He created an opportunity to talk to the waitress one-on-one, and he asked her if she wanted him to call her.



Zan wrote that not only had he used the same routine on the other waitresses in the restaurant, but he also expected them to tell each other about what he’d said. He said that **it was actually strategic that the waitresses knew he’d hit on all of them, because it created social proof—the idea that someone is more desirable if others are interested in him.**

### Steve P. and Rasputin: Hypnosis

DeAngelo’s seminar also featured a session with guest speakers Steve P. and Rasputin, who worked together as a hypnotist duo. Each had impressive credentials within the seduction community.

**Steve P. got women to pay him up to a thousand dollars to have sex with him** because he claimed he could:

  * Teach them how to orgasm when they heard a particular voice command
  * Make their breasts grow up to two cup sizes via hypnosis
  * Teach them deep throat techniques for oral sex



**Rasputin performed hypnotic sexual engineering, in which he framed sex as a privilege for the woman.** For example, if a woman gave him oral sex, he might limit her to three sucks the first time, and then grant her five sucks the next time.

According to Rasputin and Steve P., nerves and emotions only hindered PUAs. **To be successful, they said, you had to live in your own reality, making you impervious to rejection and humiliation.**

Style got a taste of the duo’s hypnosis powers when he first met them: Rasputin saw that Style was nervous, so Steve P. did a quick hypnosis to get rid of Style’s anxiety.

First, Steve P. had Style say his phone number backward. Then, Steve P. snapped his fingers and told Style to breathe deeply and exhale forcefully. Finally, Steve P. ran his fingers up Style’s torso and said, “Be gone!” Style wasn’t entirely sure it had worked, but he’d felt _something_.

Steve P. gave Style his card and offered to teach him inner-circle techniques—but Style had to vow not to share them with anyone else. The pair’s hypnosis tactics were so powerful that they could only be trusted to certain people.

#### Style’s Apprenticeship

Style agreed to the conditions, and he began visiting Steve P. and Rasputin every weekend, in hopes of acquiring inner game in time for Mystery’s workshop in Miami. Through hypnosis, Style hoped he could:

  * See himself as attractive to women
  * No longer worry about other people’s opinions of him
  * Carry himself with confidence and strength
  * End his fear of sexual rejection
  * Believe that he was worthy and deserved the best



**Style’s weekends were spent reading Steve P.’s NLP books and undergoing hypnosis.** Rasputin and Steve P. used a variety of tactics when they hypnotized Style:

  * They played music that was meant to evoke certain psychological responses. 
  * They put Style under deep trances. 
  * They spoke into each of Style’s ears at the same time. Rasputin narrated complex stories to occupy Style’s conscious mind while Steve P. spoke to Style’s subconscious. 
  * They told Style stories and metaphors but didn’t tell him the conclusions until the following week, which created an open loop in Style’s mind. 



After Style had apprenticed for a while, Steve P. told him he wanted to make Style a trainer for Steve P.’s and Rasputin’s methods. But he had to turn it down—**Style had already disconnected from much of his regular life, and he knew if he accepted their offer, he’d be completely consumed in the world of seduction.**

#### About Steve P.

Steve P. was just in first grade when an older girl gave him oral sex. From then on, he was obsessed.

As a teenager, he worked at a Catholic girls’ school, but he was fired for giving students oral sex (school administrators caught on from the girls’ confessions).

**As an adult, Steve P.’s life was centered around sexuality and spirituality.** He’d learned secret magic from shamans and applied it to seduction.

Steve P.’s spiritually-based sexual tactics—which he taught to Style—included:

  * Soul-gazing, which entailed breathing in synchrony while looking into a woman’s right eye with his right eye. Soul-gazing created a strong connection with the woman. 
  * How to stack a woman’s orgasms, so that the energy of withheld orgasms compound. 
  * How to use words and touch to lead a woman to an intense orgasm. 



### Rick H. and David X

Two PUAs, Rick H. and David X, had fairly simple strategies.

Rick H. was arguably the best PUA in the community. His seduction philosophy centered around two rules:

  1. **Don’t be nice.**
  2. **Never give a direct answer.** For example, if a woman asks about your job, give a facetious answer like a white slave trader, professional hopscotch competitor, or cigarette lighter repairman.



David X was a relatively recent PUA discovery. He was a former biker who now worked in construction.

**Despite being one of the ugliest PUAs, David X oozed alpha male confidence.** His rules for seduction were:

  1. Don’t care what the woman thinks. 
  2. Remember that you’re more important than the woman.
  3. Never lie to a woman. 



David X flipped women’s words to corner them into going out with him. For example, he’d lead a woman to say she was spontaneous. Later, if he asked her out and she was hesitant, he’d challenge her about being spontaneous.

**David X was known for dating multiple women—the seduction community called it harem management—without lying to any of the women about it.**

### Style’s Takeaways

Style’s time with the gurus had taught him about hypnosis, cocky funny, and sheer brazenness.

He also picked up some universal lessons, which would serve him in the world beyond seduction:

  * When you approach someone, **your opening line isn’t as important as you think.** How you start the conversation is less important than where you take it.
  * **There’s a misconception that asking a lot of questions during conversation shows interest** —but it comes off more as interrogation.
  * **In contrast, making statements in a conversation is a confident and intimate way of talking.** Old friends speak in statements, because they allow each other to offer information through their own sharing. 
  * **Talking fast indicates a lack of confidence.** If you’re talking fast, you’re trying to fit everything in as quickly as you can because you may be worried that people aren’t interested, or you can’t bear to leave out any details. 



Style felt he’d met enough gurus. He’d picked up plenty of philosophies and strategies—now he simply needed to practice using them.
