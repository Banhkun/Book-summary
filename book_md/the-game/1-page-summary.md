## 1-Page Summary

Throughout his life, author and journalist Neil Strauss had always felt self-conscious and awkward around the opposite sex—which led to rejection, creating a vicious cycle. **Neil assumed that it took natural charisma and confidence to pick up women, and that he simply didn’t have it.**

Then, in the early 2000s, when Neil was in his early 30s, he got the opportunity to write a book modeled after _The How-to-Lay-Girls_ _Guide_ , a guide to picking up women that had been circulating in an online community of men who exchanged tips and advice in the art of seduction.

When Neil plunged into the seduction community’s online world of websites and message boards, he discovered an entire subculture. **Members of the community wrote posts sharing strategies, divulging details of their exploits, or asking for advice** —and, in the real world, men in cities around the world gathered weekly to share techniques and then go to clubs together to put the tactics to use.

In _The Game_ , Neil chronicles the two years he spent in the seduction community, the characters he met there, and their various hijinks. Along the way, he exposes readers to many of the methods that pickup artists (PUAs) use, as well as the history and context of this underground community.

### Neil Meets Mystery

The seduction community’s leaders were a handful of PUAs who were considered gurus. **Each guru taught disciples his distinct set of rules and techniques—including psychology, magic tricks, and hypnosis—to seduce women.**

Neil wanted to meet all the gurus, and he planned to integrate techniques from each. The first guru he met was a Canadian magician named Mystery, who had just started offering workshops for PUAs-in-training.

The workshop consisted of three nights of lessons and in-the-field practice in bars and clubs. As students practiced the techniques, Mystery and his wing (aka wingman) critiqued and coached them.

Neil somewhat stumbled through pickups during the workshop, but Mystery saw huge potential in Neil as a PUA.

#### The Mystery Method

When Mystery was 21 and still a virgin, he began studying how women reacted when he hit on them. Over 10 years, Mystery pieced together the principles of social interaction and the patterns of male-female dynamics, which he called the Mystery Method.

The Mystery Method was designed to be a subtle, indirect approach. **If Mystery’s technique was executed correctly, a woman wouldn’t know that she was being hit on, but she would _want_ to be. **

The keys to the Mystery Method were:

  * Make yourself seem like the most fun and interesting person in the room. 
  * Confuse your target (the woman you’re trying to hit on) with negs, which are backhanded compliments or vague insults.
  * Use gimmicks, such as magic tricks and ESP tests, to impress and intrigue her. 
  * **Maintain a push-pull balance, in order to keep her engaged and wanting more.** For example, if your conversation with a woman is going well and you show that you’re interested in her, then look around the club for a moment, as if you’re distracted or looking for someone else. 
  * Never be the aggressor. For example, lead the woman into offering her phone number—but never explicitly ask for it. 



### Ross Jeffries: Guru and Seduction Hypnotist

The next guru that Neil met was Ross Jeffries, who was considered the godfather of the seduction community since he’d introduced Speed Seduction in 1988.

Jeffries’s Speed Seduction method was based on a technique called neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), which blended psychology and hypnosis. NLP was based on the concept that words, movements, and suggestions could tap into a person’s subconscious to affect her thoughts, emotions, and actions.

**Using NLP, a PUA would steer his conversations with a woman toward the subjects of attraction and arousal.** Then, he would use questions and suggestions to connect those feelings of attraction with a physical sensation, in order to make the woman subconsciously associate the PUA with those feelings and sensations.

During Jeffries’s first meeting with Neil, Jeffries demonstrated NLP on their waitress. First, he asked the waitress what she felt physically when she was really attracted to someone, and she said that she got butterflies in her stomach.

Then, he suggested that, as she got more attracted to someone, her butterflies probably rose higher and made her blush. As he said this, Jeffries put his hand near his stomach, palm up, and raised it toward his chest.

The motion created an association between the gesture and the feeling of attraction and blushing. **Throughout the rest of the conversation, every time Jeffries raised his hand from his stomach to his chest, the waitress blushed.**

### Neil Hones His Skills

Just a month after Neil entered the seduction community, Mystery asked him to be his wing in Mystery’s upcoming workshops. Neil accepted, and Mystery dubbed him with his pickup alias: Style.

Style had just six weeks before the next workshop, so he started training rigorously to improve his game. He read books on a range of related subjects, including body language, social dynamics, NLP, magic, and mind-reading.

Style also worked on his appearance and presentation:

  * **He corrected his gestures and posture to make himself appear more confident.**
  * He took singing and speech lessons to make his fast, muffled speech slower and clearer.
  * He wore bright clothing and flashy accessories—including fake piercings, feather boas, and light-up necklaces—based on Mystery’s theory that eye-grabbing garments attracted women. 



Style constantly went out sarging (hitting on women) with other men in the community so that he could study their sarging techniques in order to emulate them.

Style began to discover that **confidence was a critical part of the game: PUAs needed it to complete successful pickups, and they gained it from their successes.** Many newcomers to the community had spent so many years failing with women that they had no confidence.

#### Style Impresses at the Workshop

**It was the first night of Mystery’s workshop, and, as Mystery and Style prepared to take their students into the club for some on-the-ground training, Style felt intense pressure to prove himself in front of Mystery and the students.**

Style had a chance to put his skills to the test when a pair of gorgeous, confident-looking women walked into the bar. Style was nervous, but he knew all of the strategies—now he just had to use them with confidence, or else the women would see right through him.

Style thought strategically. A successful pickup was a multistep process:

  1. **Approach** : The women were facing the bar, so Style approached on the left side of the so-called obstacle, who sat between him and the woman he wanted to pick up. 
  2. **Get in position** : Style recited an opening line, and, meanwhile, he thought about how he would maneuver around the obstacle to get next to his target. When the women responded well to his opener, Style said that he wanted to show his target something, which was a ploy to move next to her. 
  3. **Join them** : Now Style needed to find a way to sit down, because if he spent too much time standing over the women, they would start to feel uncomfortable. Since there were no open stools, he instructed his target to stand up so that he could perform a trick—and, as soon as she did, he sat in her seat. 
  4. **Develop rapport** : Style joked with his target that he’d stolen her seat, and when she joked back, he knew he hadn’t overstepped. 
  5. **Create a false time constraint** : Style told the woman he had to leave soon, in order to ease any concern that he might hang around all night.
  6. **Number-close** : When Style’s artificial time constraint was up, he told the woman he’d like to see her again while he was in town. With no further prodding, the woman wrote down her number and handed it to Style. 



**Style’s performance demonstrated not only his credibility, but the credibility of the Mystery Method** , giving the workshop students hope that, with some training, they could achieve the same.

#### Style Develops His Own Techniques

Style had mastered how to pick up women, but he struggled to go any further; he was too nervous to attempt a kiss.

He posted to the seduction message boards, asking for advice—and he received an array of tips, from holding the woman’s gaze for three seconds to instructing her to take her pants off in order to give her a leg massage. Style took pieces of the advice and developed his own strategy; it worked flawlessly every time.

Style had cleared another seduction hurdle, and his confidence was growing. However, he began to realize that he was increasingly objectifying women. Men in the seduction community constantly rated women’s attractiveness, and each man’s status in the community was measured by the quantity and the attractiveness of the women they could pick up.

**Style had begun to view women as benchmarks of his pickup ability, and his interactions with women had become scripted and strategic, substituting for genuine connection.**

### Meeting the Gurus

As Style refined his seduction skills, he continued meeting the various gurus and integrating their teachings into his skill set:

  * **Juggler advocated tactics that were bold and unorthodox.** For example, he told his students to get over their fear of picking up women by calling random numbers from the phone book and asking for movie recommendations. Juggler also encouraged PUAs-in-training to make their pickups more challenging by telling women that they worked as garbage men or drove old cars.
  * **David DeAngelo developed and promoted a strategy called cocky funny, which was a hybrid of arrogance and humor.** DeAngelo coined cocky funny when he discovered that women were more receptive to him if he relentlessly teased them in a playful way. 
  * **Steve P. and Rasputin worked together as a hypnotist duo** , but they also had impressive individual credentials: Steve P. allegedly got women to pay him up to a thousand dollars to have sex with him, and Rasputin performed hypnotic sexual engineering, in which he framed sex as a privilege for the woman. 
  * **Rick H.’s simple seduction philosophy centered around two rules: Don’t be nice, and never give a direct answer.** For example, if a woman asks about your job, give a facetious answer like a white slave trader, professional hopscotch competitor, or cigarette lighter repairman.
  * **David X oozed alpha male confidence.** He told men not to care what women think, to remember that they were more important than the women they were picking up or dating, and never to lie to women. David X was known for dating multiple women (known in the community as harem management) without lying to any of them about it. 



### Getting Too Deep in the Game

By this point, Style was far beyond merely observing the community for his writing assignment—he was a full-fledged member and a well-respected pickup artist (PUA).

He was enjoying his new powers—especially after so many years of feeling completely inadequate around women. But the better Style got at the game, the more automatic his interactions with women became. **Learning to _seduce_ women didn’t teach Style how to _connect_ with them. **

One day, Style got an unexpected visit from his college friend, Dustin, who had always been comfortable, confident, and successful at picking up women—but now, Dustin informed Style that he was living in a yeshiva and abiding by a vow of celibacy. Dustin had recently realized that he’d been basing his self-worth on his success with women, so he turned to a life of God. Dustin had come to ask Style’s forgiveness for glamorizing a corrupt womanizing lifestyle.

However, Style didn’t see Dustin’s lifestyle or the seduction game in general as corrupt. **Style argued that the game hadn’t just helped him pickup women, but it also had made him a better person** : He’d begun exercising, improved his diet, become more confident, and learned how to interact with people more effectively.

#### Training the Next Generation of PUAs

Style wasn’t alone—just about every student who took Mystery’s workshop started dressing better and carrying himself with more confidence.

**The seduction game was based on the premise that everything standing between you and picking up a woman was within your control.** Being successful with women had nothing to do with good looks or innate ability—men simply had to correct bad habits and learn new ones, from their posture to their clothes.

However, as Style and Mystery gave their students the same tips, techniques, and lines—workshop after workshop—they didn’t realize that **they were inadvertently creating clones of themselves, instead of coaching men to be their best selves and helping them develop an inner confidence.**

#### The Community’s Downturn

Style began to notice that **many of the men in the community had become addicted to picking up women, and they were constantly determined to improve their game.** Some men had left their jobs and quit school in order to spend more time sarging.

Style was no exception: He’d all but stopped taking writing assignments, and he was neglecting his family and friends outside of the community.

### A New Generation Emerges in the Pickup Community

While Style’s life balance was far off-kilter, all the time and energy he’d dedicated to the game hadn’t been in vain: **Style had inadvertently become a guru.** Flocks of eager young men—some still in high school—were constantly joining the community. Many of them had read Style’s posts religiously and looked up to him as an idol.

These young, new members didn’t just want seduction technique, but also day-to-day advice, such as where to apply to college. **In every aspect of life, they wanted to be like Style and other top PUAs.**

#### Tyler Durden Hits the Community by Storm

Among the young, aspiring PUAs was a 22-year-old college student with the alias Tyler Durden. Tyler had read thousands of pages of archived posts on the seduction message boards, and he relentlessly emailed Style for tips.

Tyler was also active posting on the message boards, proposing that new members of the community get over their shyness with women by physically running into women or playfully hitting them with something soft.**Tyler’s brazenness and constant presence on the seduction message boards helped him become well-known within the community.**

When Style was unavailable to wing Mystery’s upcoming workshops, Mystery asked Tyler and another young PUA, named Papa, to step in as his wings. They eagerly accepted Mystery’s invitation.

#### Tyler Durden and Papa Go Rogue

Mystery brought Tyler and Papa to Europe for several workshops Mystery had scheduled there. The demand for the workshops was growing so much that, when Mystery had to fly home, he left Tyler and Papa in Europe to lead a few more workshops in his absence.

**Papa and Tyler were supposed to simply continue teaching the Mystery Method, but, one night, they went off-script and invented a new technique** , called AMOGing (AMOG is an acronym for alpha male of the group).

Tyler posted about AMOGing on the message boards, and the tactic took off. Soon, Tyler and Papa launched a company and offered their own in-field workshops. They called their company Real Social Dynamics—which was just one word off from the name of Mystery’s seminars, Social Dynamics.

Mystery felt betrayed: **Not only had Tyler and Papa used his workshops as a platform to develop and promote AMOGing, but they’d also created a competing business with a nearly identical name.**

### Launching Project Hollywood

Style began to realize that he’d been focusing too much on memorizing pickup routines and simply picking up women at clubs. He now saw that **the real purpose of the game was in creating a lifestyle that was interesting, exciting, and fulfilling. Men with that lifestyle exuded confidence and vibrancy that naturally attracted women.**

Style was ready to graduate from sarging and build this lifestyle. He decided it was time for him and Mystery to create Project Hollywood, which would be a seduction headquarters.

**Style and Mystery found a mansion in Hollywood** —Dean Martin’s former home—**and they planned to use it as a home base for PUAs, a venue for parties and seminars, and a meeting place for Mystery’s workshops.** Since they didn’t want to take on the risk of putting their names on the lease for a massive party house, they got Papa to sign the lease (despite the fact that he’d recently betrayed Mystery).

Papa immediately took on the role of manager of Project Hollywood. He had ambitions of renting the mansion out for movie premieres, after-parties, and corporate events. Instead of using his game to pick up women, Papa began using it to network for Project Hollywood.

Project Hollywood hit the ground running: The first party drew 500 people. Soon, similar seduction venues were popping up around the world—in Austin, San Francisco, Sydney, and Perth.

#### Tyler Durden Joins Project Hollywood

Without approval from the rest of the housemates, Papa invited Tyler Durden to move into Project Hollywood.

Style had a gut instinct that Tyler couldn’t be trusted—and he soon found out he was right:

  1. Tyler told Style that he sometimes pretended to be Style (more accurately, Neil Strauss, a _Rolling Stones_ writer) in order to impress women.
  2. Tyler had created a new technique, in which he undercut fellow PUAs. For example, while talking to a group of women, Tyler would point out Mystery from across the club and say that Mystery loved attention and often made rude comments. This made it impossible for Mystery to approach that group with his own routines and negs (backhanded compliments). 
  3. **Tyler had invented a technique called Stylemogging, in which he imitated Style’s phrases, mannerisms, and habits.** Since Style was a top PUA, Tyler studied him incessantly in order to understand what made Style so successful. Tyler then broke down everything Style did into a formula and taught it to workshop students. 



Style saw Stylemogging as a symptom of a larger problem within the community: Men were becoming robotic pickup clones who were obsessed with the game. They developed no real interests or hobbies outside the community, and, as a result, they had no real substance beneath the rote pickup lines and routines.

The irony was that**the purpose of the techniques were to make men _appear_ interesting, but their obsession with the game prevented them from _being_ interesting, which was the most effective way of attracting women**.

#### Project Hollywood Starts to Fracture

Tension was building at Project Hollywood.

Tyler Durden and Papa were still running their business, Real Social Dynamics, and now they were using Papa’s room as the business headquarters. Papa had an unknown number of people sleeping on the floor in his room, bathroom, and closet—and they were all part of the Real Social Dynamics team.

At the same time, Mystery was still operating his own seduction business. As a result, **the house became split between the two competing businesses.**

Additionally, Mystery quickly became serious with a woman named Katya, and she moved into the house. However, when their relationship fell apart, Katya got involved with another housemate. The love triangle caused constant drama in the house.

Style reflected on the optimism he’d had when they started Project Hollywood, that it would be a place where the men in the community could come together for self-improvement and life enrichment beyond sex and romance. That dream was now shattered by the harsh reality that **the house dynamics were breeding instability and dysfunction.**

### The End of an Era in Project Hollywood

The very concept of Project Hollywood—as a place for men who dedicated their lives to chasing women to coexist peacefully—had been flawed all along. **It was overly optimistic to assume that they wouldn’t fight over women, their competing businesses, or their egos.**

The tensions of living with business competitors and with his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend ultimately pushed Mystery to move out of Project Hollywood. Despite the dysfunction at Project Hollywood, he planned to move to Las Vegas and launch Project Vegas.

As more new people moved in to join the Real Social Dynamics team, more of the original Project Hollywood housemates began to move out. Style found himself living with strangers—and, oddly, they all blatantly ignored him.

Style eventually discovered that Papa and Tyler Durden had instructed everyone in the house to freeze Style out, in order to push him to move out. **Papa and Tyler had twisted the principles of social dynamics that they’d learned for seduction in order to manipulate people to do what they wanted.** In this case, they wanted to make Project Hollywood a headquarters and dormitory for Real Social Dynamics.

Style had known it was time for him to get out of Project Hollywood’s toxic environment, and this was the final straw.

#### Style Exits the Community

**During Style’s two years in the seduction community, he’d learned pickup techniques from top gurus, enjoyed unprecedented success with women, and—most importantly—developed inner confidence.**

Style’s newfound confidence had helped him get into a relationship with Lisa, with whom he felt a deeper connection than he’d ever had with a woman.

Lisa was so confident that none of Style’s seduction techniques had worked on her—in fact, they’d almost ruined his chances with her. Ultimately, he had to toss his lines and routines out the window and be himself in order to win Lisa over.

However, even though Style’s pickup tactics had pushed Lisa away, Style recognized that, before joining the community, he wouldn’t have had the confidence he needed to pursue her.

**So much of the game was artificial** —the scripted routines, the peacocking outfits, even the aliases—**but mastering the game had helped Style develop the inner confidence to be himself.** Style could now graduate from the community.
