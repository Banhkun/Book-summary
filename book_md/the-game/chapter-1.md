## Chapter 1: Neil Discovers the Seduction Community

Neil Strauss, a journalist and the author of _The Game_ , always struggled with women. Since he was a teenager, he felt self-conscious and awkward around the opposite sex, which led to rejection, creating a vicious cycle.

Despite years of failure, Neil still wanted to date and have sex with women—he just couldn’t figure out how. **Neil assumed that it took natural charisma and confidence to pick up women, and that he simply didn’t have it.**

Then, in the early 2000s, when Neil was in his early 30s, he got a call from a book editor who wanted him to write a book modeled after _The How-to-Lay-Girls_ _Guide_ , a manual for picking up women. The guide sourced advice from dozens of pickup artists (PUAs), and it had been circulating in an online community of men who exchanged tips and advice in the art of seduction.

Neil took the assignment and began a two-year journey, during which he became a member—and then a guru—in the world of PUAs and wannabes. This book chronicles the two years Neil spent in the seduction community, the characters he met there, and their various hijinks. Along the way, he exposes readers to many of the methods that pickup artists (PUAs) use, as well as the history and context of this underground community.

### The Seduction Community

When Neil plunged into the seduction community’s online world of websites and message boards, he discovered an entire subculture. People used aliases—Neil’s would become Style—and they used a jargon that included terms such as:

  * AFC: average frustrated chump
  * AMOG: alpha male of the group
  * HB: hot babe
  * PUA: pickup artist
  * Sarging: picking up women



**Members of the community wrote posts sharing strategies, divulging details of their exploits, or asking for advice.** Beyond the virtual world, men in cities around the world gathered weekly to share techniques and then go to clubs together to put the tactics to use.

The community’s leaders were a handful of PUAs who had reached guru status, each of whom taught disciples his distinct set of rules and principles of the pickup game. **The gurus used a combination of psychology, magic tricks, and hypnosis to seduce women.**

Neil decided he wanted to meet all the gurus, and he planned to integrate techniques from each. The first guru he met was a Canadian magician named Mystery.
