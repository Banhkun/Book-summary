## Chapter 8: Style Launches Project Hollywood

After Papa, Mystery, and Style signed the lease on the Project Hollywood mansion, they posted on Mystery’s Lounge that they were looking for roommates to fill the remaining two rooms. The response was overwhelming.

They ended up bringing in three eager pickup artists (PUAs):

  1. Herbal, a 22-year-old from Austin who had made a small fortune in a gambling scheme. 
  2. Playboy, a party promoter who had quit his job at a New York dance company in order to come to Project Hollywood. Playboy worked for Real Social Dynamics to pay his rent.
  3. Xaneus, a college student from Colorado who was willing to do whatever it took to live at Project Hollywood—so he slept in a tent in the backyard, worked as an intern for Real Social Dynamics, and paid for utilities and housecleaning.



The roommates laid out the ground rules for the house:

  * Herbal was responsible for finances.
  * Papa was in charge of social events. 
  * **Guests couldn’t stay in the house for more than a month without approval from all the roommates.**
  * Ten percent of profits from any seminars held in the living room had to go to the house fund.
  * **No one was allowed to sarge a woman that another PUA invited to the house.**



Project Hollywood hit the ground running. Playboy threw the first Project Hollywood party, and the turnout was 500 people.

Similar seduction venues started popping up around the world—in Austin, San Francisco, Sydney, and Perth.

### Style Reaches a New Level of the Game

As a master PUA, Style could effortlessly approach any set (group of women), deliver his lines, perform his routines, and take his target home. But, **after moving into Project Hollywood, Style reached a new level of seduction prowess: He learned how to initiate threesomes.**

Style was simultaneously dating 10 different women—multiple long-term relationships (MLTRs), as the pickup community called them. All the women knew that Style was seeing other women, and only one woman, named Isabel, was bothered by it.

One day, a woman named Hea was visiting Style at Project Hollywood, when Isabel dropped by for a surprise visit. Style didn’t want to turn Isabel away, but he panicked that the only jealous woman out of his 10 MLTRs would now be face-to-face with another woman he was seeing.

Style escorted Isabel in, introduced her to Hea, and then ducked out for a minute to ask Mystery for advice. **Instead of getting one of the women to leave, Mystery told Style to try to start a threesome.** He suggested that Style start by suggesting a wholesome three-way massage, and then try to escalate from there.

Style decided to take the gamble. He invited both women to his bedroom under the pretense of watching a funny video. By design, he had no chairs in his bedroom, so they were all laying on the bed.

After the video, Style told the women that he’d heard about something called a dual-induction massage, in which two people massage someone at the same time, moving their hands in synchronicity. The women agreed to try it, so Style told Isabel to lay on her stomach; since she was inclined to be jealous, it was a strategic choice to make her the first to receive a massage.

Style went next. As the women massaged him, he felt the tension between them changing. Incredulously, he thought that his scheme could actually work.

After Hea’s massage, she remained lying down. This was the pivotal moment: Style began kissing Isabel, and they slowly moved down toward Hea. Style switched to kissing Hea, and then brought Isabel into the kiss. It had worked—both women were on board.

But it didn’t last. When Hea started giving Style oral sex, it snapped Isabel out of the moment. Style recognized that Isabel was uncomfortable, and he thought about a fellow guru’s advice that threesomes only work if the man makes it a priority to keep the women comfortable.

Style pulled back, and the three didn’t go any further. Still, he was amazed that he’d gotten that far.

**The following night, Style tried the three-way massage technique with two different women** —one of his MLTRs, Nadia, and her friend, Barbara—**and it worked.**

Style had perfected a new routine. Naturally, he shared the technique on the message boards. **The innovative strategy secured him recognition as being the top PUA for the second year in a row.**

### Style’s Pickup Expertise Affects All Areas of His Life

**The techniques Style learned in the community were not just useful for picking up women—the principles were about how to read people and make them feel comfortable.**

As a journalist, these skills vastly improved Neil’s interviewing skills.

#### Courtney Love

After Neil’s feature on Tom Cruise, he got another assignment from _Rolling Stone_. His editor wanted him to interview Courtney Love; it was the early 2000s, and she was all over the news for her outlandish behavior and pending drug charges.

Early in the interview, Love’s answers were abrasive and somewhat antagonistic. Neil realized that he, as a reporter, represented the media, which had exposed and mocked Love’s outbursts and mistakes. Neil recognized that Love was using a bitch shield—as PUAs call it—which was merely a defense mechanism.

Neil had to use his pickup techniques to break through her bitch shield and build a rapport, which would be the only way she’d provide authentic, interesting answers for his article. **Neil knew the formula: trust + comfort = rapport.**

First, Neil followed up on a comment Love made about her grandmother with a memory of his own grandmother. This created an opportunity for brief small talk about their families, and Love revealed that she didn’t get along with her family, which gave him something personal and authentic to build on.

**As the interview went on, Neil gently widened the crack in her bitch shield to create a larger opening into Love’s genuine self.** Finally, Love began to cry and told Neil that she needed saving—in fact, she said that Neil had to save her.

Neil had created a rapport. At Love’s request, they exchanged phone numbers.

Love called Neil later that night, asking him to come over to her place. Style ended up staying at Love’s apartment for three days straight. They talked, ate takeout, watched movies, and performed amateur acupuncture—but they never had sex.

#### Britney Spears

For another assignment, Neil had to interview Britney Spears, who was still riding the peak of her late 1990s-early 2000s fame.

At first, Spears was giving few-word answers and hardly paying attention to the questions. Again, Neil had to use his pickup skills to build rapport.

First, Neil had to engage her. He did some cold-reading, making fairly obvious observations that Spears took as uncannily perceptive. Then, he created a yes-ladder, a series of questions that all elicit a “yes” answer, designed to keep the other person’s attention.

Next, Neil performed a value-demonstrating routine, which was meant to make him stand out—in this case, among other journalists. For his routine, Neil explained to Spears that people’s eye movements revealed which parts of their brains were engaged.

Finally, he wrote a number between one and 10 on a piece of paper, and he encouraged Spears to guess it. Neil had written down the number seven, because he knew people almost always chose seven—and that’s what she guessed. **Spears was amazed at herself for supposedly intuiting the right number, and she was amazed at Neil for showing her this ability she possessed.**

Neil’s techniques worked, and Spears not only opened up and gave a better interview, but she also suggested that they exchange phone numbers.

#### Style Loses Himself

The impact that Style’s pickup expertise on his life wasn’t all positive.

While on a trip to New York, Style met up with several old friends from college. Style’s friends hadn’t seen him since before he joined the seduction community, and they were amazed that their formerly awkward friend had transformed into a PUA.

But when the conversation shifted to other things—such as their work and interests—Style was disconnected. **Style didn’t have much to add to the conversation if it wasn’t about the game, and he felt that he didn’t have anything in common with his friends anymore.** His whole life had centered around seduction for the past year-and-a-half.

As soon as Style had the chance, he sarged a woman and spent the rest of the night talking with her. When he left the bar with her, Style realized he’d neglected his friends all night.

### Tyler Durden Joins Project Hollywood

One day, **Tyler Durden moved into Project Hollywood.** Papa had given him an (unapproved) invitation to live in his bathroom closet.

Tyler and Papa were still running Real Social Dynamics together. Plus, Tyler and Style would be winging Mystery’s workshop together that weekend in Las Vegas. Mystery didn’t explain his decision to invite Tyler to wing his workshop, but right after Tyler and Papa had launched Real Social Dynamics, Mystery had vowed to keep his friends close and his enemies closer.

Although Style had gotten a bad impression of Tyler during their last meeting, Tyler’s skill and reputation had vastly increased since then. Tyler had been leading workshops regularly and gaining respect in the online seduction community. Everyone else seemed to like Tyler, so Style decided to give him another chance.

When Tyler arrived, he praised Style for being a big influence on him. **Tyler then revealed that he’d sometimes told women that he _was_ Neil Strauss, a _Rolling Stones_ writer, which alarmed Style.**

That weekend, Style found out just how influential he’d been to Tyler.

#### Tyler AMOGs Style and Mystery

On the first night of the workshop in Las Vegas, Style overheard Tyler belittling Style and Mystery to Tyler’s targets, in order to undercut their pickups. For example, Tyler told one set that Mystery loved attention and that he liked to make rude comments to people. If Mystery were to approach that set after, his negs would be useless.

When Style called Tyler out, **Tyler explained that several of his new techniques involved tearing down Mystery and Style** —and he quickly offered for Style to do the same to him.

Style couldn’t believe that Tyler was effectively AMOGing other PUAs. **This confirmed Style’s initial impression that Tyler approached the game with no human compassion.**

Tyler shamelessly lurked around Style for the rest of the weekend, observing and analyzing Style’s game so that he could emulate it.

#### Style Kisses Tyler’s Target

On the last night of the Vegas trip, Tyler picked up a woman named Stacy. However, shortly afterward, Stacy approached Style.

**Community etiquette dictated that the first PUA to approach a target had exclusive access to her until the PUA either succeeded and slept with her or gave up and moved on.** But as Style thought of Tyler AMOGing him, he decided to forego etiquette.

Style kissed Stacy. All of a sudden, Tyler angrily pulled her away. Style immediately felt guilty—but he was quickly soothed by Stacy’s roommate, Tammy, who spent the rest of the night with him.

**Although Stacy was with Tyler the rest of the night, Tyler was still mad at Style for taking his target.**

#### Tyler Sarges for Sport

For Tyler, the game was just about competition. **Tyler never followed through with women—rather, it seemed like he just enjoyed the challenge of picking them up.**

One day, Tyler told Style two things that were revealing about him as a person and a PUA:

  1. Tyler said that he was a successful PUA because he had no regard for how the women responded to his lines. Tyler’s strategy was to relentlessly throw line after line at women until he wore them down enough to talk to him.
  2. Tyler said that maybe he wasn’t getting into MLTRs because he didn’t enjoy oral sex. Style took that as confirmation that sex wasn’t driving Tyler’s obsession with the game. 



**Tyler also seemed to thrive on his growing influence within the community, and he’d been using pickup tactics that tore down the top PUAs.** Tyler was clawing his way to the top of the seduction community.

### A Community of Pickup Clones

Most of the men who found the seduction community had struggled with women their entire lives, and those failures had damaged their confidence and self-esteem.

In many cases, the game gave the men tools to be successful with women, which created a virtuous cycle: The success boosted their confidence and inspired self-improvements that affected all areas of their lives, which increased their inner game and made them more attractive to women.

However, in other cases, **instead of _learning_ from the pickup gurus and using their techniques to develop their own skills, many men in the community were simply _mimicking_ the gurus and becoming pickup clones. **Nearly every weekend, men arrived at Project Hollywood to take workshops from Mystery and Tyler Durden. They were all learning the same scripts, practicing the same routines, and buying the same gaudy clothes and accessories (per peacock theory). As a result:

  * Instead of being empowered to use their new skills and knowledge as a foundation to build upon, these men often panicked when they ran out of scripted lines. 
  * Instead of developing confidence and self-worth independent of women’s acceptance (or rejection), these men placed all their value on the success of their pickups. 



#### Stylemogging

When Project Hollywood put on the first annual Pickup Artist Summit, community members from around the world attended. One night during the summit, Style learned that Tyler Durden had been teaching a technique he developed, called Stylemogging.

Since Style was the top PUA in the community, **Tyler had studied all of Style’s phrases, mannerisms, and habits, and he’d broken them down into, essentially, a how-to guide for becoming a Style pickup clone.**

Style had already shared most of his lines and routines on the seduction message boards, but Tyler was observing and teaching everything else Style did, including many things that weren’t conscious or strategic. Tyler had turned Style’s entire personality into a formula that could be copied.

Many of the men at the summit had shaved their heads, like Style’s. They had read Style’s posts on the message boards, they used his lines—they wanted to _be_ him. One man even made his pickup alias Stylechild. Now the clubs that Style frequented on Hollywood’s Sunset Strip were full of these robotic pickup clones. Style was stunned and alarmed.

#### Style’s Social Robot Warning

One day, Style put up a post on Mystery’s Lounge, warning the community of the dangers of becoming a pickup robot.

Style wrote that a social robot:

  * Never had relationships, despite successful pickups
  * Was at a loss if he ran out of scripted lines when talking to a woman 
  * Couldn’t talk about a woman without rating her attractiveness
  * Assumed that any time a woman wasn’t receptive to his lines, that she was testing him
  * Saw any other man who was talking to a woman as competition
  * Felt a compulsion to sarge women in inappropriate settings, such as the workplace
  * Lost interest in things outside the community, including friends, family, work, and hobbies
  * Based his self-esteem on his pickup success



Young sargers—those who found the community while in high school or college—were most at risk of becoming a robot, because they were still developing their identities. For these men, **the rules of the game that dictated how they interacted with women became interwoven with their overall social development** , which had negative effects:

  1. Their social interactions were so driven by strategy that they assumed everyone else operated the same way, which led them to overanalyze other people’s words and actions. 
  2. They developed no real interests or hobbies outside the community, so there was no real substance beneath the rote pickup lines and routines. The irony was that**the purpose of the lines was to make men _appear_ interesting, but the social robots’ obsession with the game prevented them from _being_ interesting, which was the most effective way of attracting women**. 



### Project Hollywood Starts to Fracture

Tension was building at Project Hollywood.

Since the inception of Project Hollywood, Papa’s focus had shifted. First, Papa spent every night working on Real Social Dynamics, and he seldom went out sarging.

Second, when they had moved in, Papa had fantasized about turning his bedroom into a luxurious sexual sanctuary—but nearly two months into living there, the room was a mess, still unfurnished, and completely devoid of women.

An unknown number of unapproved houseguests were sleeping on the floor in Papa’s bedroom, closet, and bathroom, which broke house rules and incited an argument between Papa and Mystery. Papa and his guests not only ignored Style and Mystery, but they also constantly observed Style from a distance, so that they could take notes for their Stylemogging lessons.

After Mystery and Papa’s argument, **the house became split between the two competing businesses in the house: Mystery’s workshops, Mystery Method, and Tyler Durden’s, Real Social Dynamics.**

Style was becoming eager to move out of Project Hollywood.
