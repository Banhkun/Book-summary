## Chapter 7: Style Shifts From Learning Game to Creating a Lifestyle

With his article on the seduction community and his new assignment to interview Tom Cruise, Neil was reclaiming some of his old life—but he was keeping one foot firmly planted in the community.

### Style Shifts His Focus to Inner Game

Neil couldn’t have gotten a better assignment: Tom Cruise was a model for the seduction community. He was effortlessly confident—a quintessential AMOG. In fact, most of the men in the community studied Cruise’s characters to improve their body language.

In the film _Magnolia_ , Cruise even played Frank T.J. Mackey, a seduction guru that Ross Jeffries claims to have inspired. However, Cruise told Neil that his character was not inspired by anyone in particular; rather, Cruise and the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, had developed Mackey’s character. (Shortform note: In the movie, Mackey instructs his seduction students to “respect the cock” and “tame the cunt,” while a banner that says “Seduce and Destroy” hangs behind him.)

**Cruise lamented that a guru like the fictional Mackey could seduce men into thinking that seduction tactics are the best way to approach women and initiate relationships.** To Neil, it felt reminiscent of how Dustin had warned him about the corruption of the seduction lifestyle.

Neil stayed silent, but, internally, he pushed back against the attack on his community. Neil didn’t see anything wrong with learning the game; **how was learning the game of seduction any different from studying and practicing other skills, such as writing or driving a car?**

On the other hand, Neil was getting tired of regurgitating the same lines for every pickup. He wanted to be authentic and he wanted that to be enough to attract women.

As Neil talked to Cruise, he found Cruise to be centered, grounded, and comfortable with who he was. Cruise also encouraged Neil to embrace himself. **Cruise was inadvertently helping Neil gain the inner game—confidence and self-worth—that he’d been missing.**

#### The Game Is About Lifestyle

For Style’s birthday, his friends in the community threw him a party at a Hollywood club. Between friends, PUAs, and former lovers, about 300 people showed up.

Style dominated the club all night. People were constantly pulling him aside to talk to him, and women were handing him their phone numbers—and he hadn’t recited a single line of game.

Style realized that he’d been too myopic: He and the other sargers had been focusing on mastering the game simply to pick up women at clubs. But, **the real purpose of the game was in creating a lifestyle that was interesting, exciting, and fulfilling. Men with that lifestyle exuded confidence and vibrancy that naturally attracted women.**

Style was ready to graduate from sarging and build this lifestyle. He decided it was time for him and Mystery to create Project Hollywood, the seduction headquarters Mystery had described when he came out of the hospital.

### Project Hollywood

**Project Hollywood would be a home base for PUAs, a venue for parties and seminars, and a meeting place for Mystery’s workshops.** It had to be spacious, impressive, and outfitted for massive events.

Mystery and Style started planning:

  1. They’d have to find a mansion in the Hollywood Hills that had the space and amenities to throw huge parties, and that was close to clubs. 
  2. They’d find someone to put his name on the lease, so that they could both avoid the risk if things fell through. 
  3. They’d invite the top-performing PUAs to live in the mansion with them. 



First, Style and Mystery determined that the perfect candidate to put his name on the lease was Papa.

#### Papa Manages Project Hollywood

Two main factors made Papa the first choice to put his name on the lease for Project Hollywood:

  1. His dad was rich, and he had access to his dad’s wealth. 
  2. He’d recently moved to LA to study business at Loyola Marymount.



As soon as Papa came on board, he also became a self-appointed manager. Papa had been a neurotic seduction student at Mystery’s workshop, recording Mystery’s and Style’s advice, taking notes, and robotically applying corrections to his technique. He’d taken the same approach to running Real Social Dynamics with Tyler Durden.

**Papa wasn’t just going to be a name on the lease—he was also bringing his networking and business skills to Project Hollywood.**

First, Papa convinced a real estate agent to help them find a mansion to rent in exchange for teaching him the game. They ended up leasing the former home of Dean Martin, where the Rat Pack had hung out. The home boasted:

  * Close proximity to Hollywood clubs
  * A living room large enough to host a few hundred people, with a 30-foot ceiling and large bar
  * A multilevel backyard, with a hot tub, a pool, and a view overlooking Hollywood



To add to the party atmosphere, Papa bid on eBay for pool tables, movie projectors, tanning beds, and stripper poles. He had ambitions of renting the mansion out for movie premieres, after-parties, and corporate events.

Now, **instead of using his game to pick up women, Papa began using it to make connections with celebrities and promoters who could use Project Hollywood as a venue.**
