What is one way you could be more effective in your life—personal or professional—by using seduction tactics and principles of social interactions?

What is one way that using those tactics could become problematic in your life?

Think of an instance when you had to mentor someone at work or in another context. How did you teach your mentee the skills and principles she needed to know without simply teaching her to do everything exactly the way you do it?

What is an example of a different kind of community (such as a religious group or work environment) where members become robotic or clone-like? What are the consequences?
