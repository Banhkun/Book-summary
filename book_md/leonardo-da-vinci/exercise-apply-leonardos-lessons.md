## Exercise: Apply Leonardo’s Lessons

Isaacson extracts lessons from Leonardo’s life and work that you can apply to be more like the Renaissance genius.

* * *

List at least five topics you’d like to learn more about. Choose one to tackle first. Set time aside in your calendar for getting started, and write down the resources you have on hand (for example, books, a museum in your city, or an expert you can ask.)

**Practice Leonardo’s systematic observation.** Choose an object or phenomenon you’re interested in understanding better. Make a list of specific aspects of that object or phenomenon you want to observe. For example, if you’re interested in understanding how people interact with each other in a meeting, your list might include “How people interrupt each other, how speakers use eye contact, and how they signal agreement.”

**Use visualization to find intersections between different topics**. Choose a topic you’re interested in and write down how you will research it, whether it’s online, through books, or by asking experts. Next, create a mind map and add to it each new piece of information you learn. Highlight any intersections you find with other areas of knowledge. For example, you might start researching climate change, and find that science intersects with the economy, history, and anthropology.

**Follow Leonardo’s footsteps and strive for perfection** —but without letting it stop you from completing your projects. Think of a project you’ve put on hold, that you’re not sure how to approach, or that you’ve completed but aren’t totally satisfied with. Write down the opportunities for improvement that you see in the project. Next, choose one that you could tackle today. What is one small step you can take today to improve on it?
