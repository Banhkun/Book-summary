## Exercise: Consider Effective and Equal Communication

Bancroft emphasizes throughout the book that an abuser’s unwillingness to engage with his partner on equal footing—by listening to her thoughts and opinions with respect and consideration—shuts down communication and reinforces an unequal power dynamic, which can never be fixed until he changes his behavior.

Consider a time when you seriously differed with a partner or loved one. What was the basis of the disagreement, and why did it escalate?

During this argument, did you feel as though your partner was fully engaging with and listening to your perspective, or were they simply dismissing it? What made you feel this way?

During this argument, did you fully engage with and listen to your partner’s perspective, or were you dismissive? If you were dismissive, why weren’t you open to being persuaded?

If you could redo the conversation, what would you do differently? What would you like your partner to do differently?
