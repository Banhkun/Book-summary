## Exercise: Create Your Roadmap for Success

Often, the hardest part of making significant changes in your life is knowing where to start.

* * *

State your vision for your future and three things that need to happen in the next three years to make it a reality.

What are two things you can start to do today that would help you reach those short-term goals?

How will these actions disrupt your current life? Name two sacrifices youâ€™ll have to make.

Why is your vision important to you, and how does that make going through these sacrifices worth it?
