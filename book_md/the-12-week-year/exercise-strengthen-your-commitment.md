## Exercise: Strengthen Your Commitment

You have good intentions when you commit to certain actions, and when you feel emotionally attached to those actions, youâ€™re more likely to follow through.

* * *

Think about the different arenas in your life, such as family, community, spirituality, financial status, and health. What would a breakthrough in these arenas look like? Choose two and be specific.

What actions are required to achieve those breakthroughs? List two or three for each one.

What sacrifices would accompany those actions and overall breakthrough achievement? List two or three for each one.

Which actions are you willing to sacrifice and commit to so you can have a breakthrough? List any that apply and elaborate on why.
