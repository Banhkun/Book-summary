## Exercise: Use Your Time Effectively

Itâ€™s not possible to remove distractions, but knowing which distractions to look out for can help you manage them.

* * *

What are the two ways you currently distract yourself from work?

Do you feel you are able to control how much time you spend on these distractions? Why or why not?

Why do these distractions or any others appeal to you or serve your life?

If you knew these distractions were stopping you from accomplishing your dreams, what changes would you make in how you use your time? Be specific.
