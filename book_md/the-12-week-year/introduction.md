## Introduction

(Shortform note: _The 12 Week Year_ is organized into two sections. The first provides the theoretical basis for the actionable steps to create your 12-week plan, and the second provides the actionable steps. For this summary, we’ve chosen to group the theoretical concepts and actionables under each topic for ease of understanding and implementation.)

What would you accomplish if you had your full potential at your disposal? How would your life change if you were functioning at your highest level? You most likely have skills and abilities far beyond what you currently use and desires you’ve yet to realize. **These aspects are part of your “second life,” or the life in which your true talents are recognized and dreams achieved.** In this second life, procrastination is a thing of the past, you’re not driven by fear, and you’re confident in your ability to achieve success. So if this life is already yours for the taking, why haven’t you started living it?

The concepts provided in _The 12 Week Year_ will help you claim that potential by helping you increase your productivity so you can do more in less time and gain better results. You have the power to tap into your best self every day, and the actions required are not difficult. But the process isn’t easy because what’s been holding you back from this higher self is fear and a lack of motivation. Learning to adjust your routines to push past fear and increase motivation and performance requires a major shift in your mindset and behavior.

### The Power in Knowledge

The adage _knowledge is power_ is a bit of a misnomer. Knowledge alone doesn’t lead to success, nor do talent or luck. **You use your knowledge to strengthen your talent and remove the need for luck through successful implementation of your ideas.** You can have groundbreaking ideas all day long, but if you don’t implement them, they’re just thoughts.

_Execution_ is the key to greatness, and consistent execution of your skills and knowledge is what lifts you from average achiever to top performer. Consider the example of obesity in America.

  * Approximately 65% of Americans are obese or overweight despite the $60 billion health and fitness industry. In addition, more than 45,000 diet books exist on the market with guidance on how to eat healthier foods and live a healthier life. With all this knowledge readily available, you would think we’d be the fittest population in the world. But we’re not, because knowing how to lose weight and executing a plan to lose weight are very different things. 



The knowledge you gain in this summary will not be new. These ideas have been written about in various ways. What you _will_ learn is a successful plan of attack for how to execute that knowledge. You’ll be given clear instructions for how to change your life today to tap into your best future.

You can use these concepts to improve both your professional and personal lives by generating greater results from your actions. Along with increased success, other benefits of the 12-week program are decreased stress, increased confidence, and improved self-esteem.
