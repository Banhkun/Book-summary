## Exercise: Alternate High-Energy and Low-Energy Tasks

Rock argues that you can conserve your mental energy by alternating between high- and low-energy tasks.

* * *

List your daily work tasks and identify each as high-energy (planning, creating, and so on) or as low-energy (organizing, eating, and so on).

Create a work routine that alternates as much as possible between the high-energy and low-energy tasks you listed. (Donâ€™t forget to start the workday with the high-energy task of prioritizing!)
