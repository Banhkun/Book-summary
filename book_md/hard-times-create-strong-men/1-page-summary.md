## 1-Page Summary

In _Hard Times Create Strong Men_ , Stefan Aarnio argues that modern Western men are weak—and this weakness will lead to the decline of Western civilization, especially America. To avoid this, men must learn to be strong by taking ownership of every aspect of their lives so that they can defend the practices and ideologies that make America great.

Aarnio was an award-winning Canadian real estate investor who authored several books on topics ranging from masculinity to business. He wrote _Hard Times Create Strong Men_ in just 11 days and published it in 2018. His book combines original insights with extensive quotations from others, notably _The Way of Men_ by Jack Donovan and _The Way of the Superior Man_ by David Deida. Aarnio passed away from cancer in 2020.

In this guide, we’ll first describe how Aarnio’s life experiences led him to write this book. Then, we’ll share Aarnio’s explanation of why Western men have grown weak and why this weakness is a problem. Finally, we’ll lay out Aarnio’s definition of a strong man and Aarnio’s ideas on how to be a strong man at work and in relationships. Along the way, we’ll compare Aarnio’s ideas to other experts’, provide some historical context for his arguments, and share practical tips for putting his recommendations into practice.

### Aarnio’s Life: A Primer

The lessons in Aarnio’s book stem from his own life. Growing up, Aarnio lacked a strong masculine role model. His father was unable to sustain a successful business and struggled financially. He also couldn’t sustain a successful relationship; Aarnio’s mother lost her attraction to his father because she was forced to support him financially, and she ultimately divorced him. Aarnio thus had to learn how to function well as a man from his own studies and experiences as an adult.

(Shortform note: Aarnio’s parents’ divorce follows a familiar pattern: Marriages in which the female partner is the primary breadwinner are more likely to end in divorce. However, this isn’t always because the woman loses her attraction toward the man. Studies show that in many cases, the outearned male partner has an affair—perhaps in an attempt to reestablish his masculinity—that propels the marriage toward divorce.)

Aarnio decided to share these lessons on manliness after an encounter with his employees. Aarnio, who ran a real estate business, returned from vacation to find that his employees were neglecting their duties. When asked why, the male employees gave him several excuses for not doing their jobs—like that they didn’t love their work or that they thought he was “mean.” Aarnio couldn’t afford to fire them. So instead, he lectured them on “how to be a man”—a speech that none of them had ever heard from their fathers. These men then turned their behavior around and later thanked Aarnio for having that talk with them. This experience made Aarnio realize that _many_ men didn’t know how to function well in the modern world and led him to write his book.

(Shortform note: By teaching his employees how to be men, Aarnio acted as a “man mentor” to them. Other masculinity bloggers also espouse the importance of “man mentors,” who can help you navigate life as a man. They recommend that you seek out four types: an older friend who can provide general life advice, a professional mentor, a spiritual mentor, and an intellectual mentor.)

### Why Western Men Are Weak

Why are most modern men—such as Aarnio’s employees—weak? In this section, we’ll explain what went wrong with Western men. Namely, Aarnio argues that men have grown weak due to the cyclical nature of history, a weakening of traditional gender roles, and a turning away from Judeo-Christian religious values.

How has **the cyclical nature of history contributed to weaker men?** Aarnio contends that history operates in 80-year cycles, following the storyline of the poem by G. Michael Hopf that inspired the title of this book: “Hard times create strong men/Strong men create good times/Good times create weak men/Weak men create hard times.”

(Shortform note: There is some debate over the origins of the poem that inspired the title of Aarnio’s book. Most sources attribute it to Hopf's _Those Who Remain_ , a novel set in a post-apocalyptic version of the United States. However, some experts point out that the poem first appeared on the Internet in August 2016—four months before the publication of Hopf’s novel.)

From 1940-1960, American men faced hard times (such as World War II) and so grew strong. These strong men created good times from 1960-1980, as evidenced by the American manufacturing boom. But then, the widespread approval of feminism weakened men from 1980-2000. And since 2000, these weak men have been paving the way for hard times via their reactions to world events like the 2008 banking crisis—and hard times will begin anew in 2020.

> **What Others Say About the Cyclical Nature of History**
> 
> Like Aarnio, _The Fourth Turning_ authors William Strauss and Neil Howe propose that history operates in cycles. Specifically, they argue that history operates in saecula, or cycles of four Turnings, with each turning lasting between 15-25 years. But these cycles aren’t dictated by whether _men_ are weak or strong; rather, certain generations predictably develop certain characteristics depending on the circumstances of their birth, and so they shape the Turnings in predictable ways.
> 
> The First Turning is a High: It comes after a great turmoil is resolved and includes the installation of a new social order that prioritizes collective value. The Second Turning is the Awakening; people pull away from the social order imposed during the High and start to reject collective values in favor of individual rights. The Third Turning is an Unraveling; society embraces the new order put in place by the Awakening, and people become more distrustful of governments and grow more passionate about and extreme in their beliefs. The Fourth Turning is a Crisis: A major event or series of events creates a society-wide crisis, and people respond in a way that creates societal upheaval.
> 
> Strauss and Howe suggest that the most recent saecula began not in 1940 but in 1946, _after_ the end of World War II. The Awakening began in 1964 and was not a peaceful manufacturing boom; rather, people were starting to lose confidence in the massive corporations that previously brought economic success. Additionally, this was the period during which no-fault divorces were legalized, which, given Aarnio’s argument that divorce significantly weakened men (which we’ll discuss later), suggests that _this_ was the period during which feminism began to weaken men. The Unraveling began in 1984, with ineffective leaders and intense public debate over issues such as diversity and religion.
> 
> Strauss and Howe, who published their book in 1997, did not clearly delineate when the Crisis would begin. However, in 2020, Howe identified the 2008 financial crisis as the beginning of the Crisis. In their book, Howe and Strauss accurately predicted certain events that would pass in the Crisis, including a terrorist attack by a foreign group purporting to have nuclear weapons (as happened on September 11, 2001) and the spread of a new, highly contagious virus (such as the COVID-19 pandemic).

#### How the Decline of the Family Has Weakened Men

Aarnio also argues that **men have grown weak due to the decline of the traditional family unit**. Aarnio asserts that today’s 50% divorce rate is partly due to feminism. We naturally like whoever is opposite us on the energy spectrum; someone with flowing _feminine_ energy is attracted to someone with strong _masculine_ energy (and vice versa). Since women traditionally spent their days in a domestic role, they had high feminine energy—and so were naturally attracted to their husbands who worked outside the home and so had high masculine energy.

But thanks to feminism, women started working. Women who work have higher masculine energy, so they’re more likely to lose their attraction to their husbands and divorce them (since their energies are no longer opposite). Moreover, Aarnio asserts that since men and women are now ostensibly equal, they don’t _need_ each other—and so are less likely to get married in the first place.

> **What Others Say About High Divorce Rates and Low Marriage Rates**
> 
> Sociologists and economists propose an alternate explanation for the high divorce rate—which has reduced in the last several decades for college-educated couples. Statistics indicate that the divorce rate peaked in the 1970s and 1980s, and scholars agree that this was partly due to the “new feminist movement.”
> 
> However, they don’t attribute the high divorce rate of the 1970s and 1980s to the shift in women’s energies and thus their attraction levels; rather, they suggest that this increase resulted from a shift in people’s _expectations_ of marriage. Prior to the 1970s, people married with the expectation that women would stay home and men would earn money. But when women started working en masse in the 1970s, people who’d married prior to this societal movement realized that they had new expectations of marriage (for example, the wives wanted to work too), and this mismatch in expectations led divorce rates to skyrocket.
> 
> A shift in expectations regarding partnerships may also explain the decline in marriage rates. It’s now socially acceptable for unmarried partners to cohabitate; many of these couples live together and break up without ever getting married (and thus divorced). Additionally, couples tend to get married later because they expect their spouses to provide long-term companionship and are also willing to wait longer for the right person.

Aarnio adds that government policies and changing social norms have also contributed to the decline of marriage. Women are no longer reliant on their husbands for survival; now, they can easily divorce him and live not just on _his_ assets but those of the government via public assistance programs. Not only does this encourage divorce, it discourages men from getting married because they’re worried that their women will steal their assets. Moreover, people no longer turn to religious leaders or long-married couples for marital advice; instead, they turn to their single friends, who often encourage divorce.

(Shortform note: Some experts agree with Aarnio that American government policies—specifically, the 1996 introduction of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)—have contributed to the decline of marriage. However, they don’t state that women are incentivized to divorce their husbands or that men are discouraged from getting married because of the potential financial risk involved. Rather, they point out that TANF discouraged low-income couples from getting married by penalizing them financially—married couples received fewer welfare benefits than single people. Experts also agree with Aarnio that a couple’s social circle raises their risk of divorce, but studies indicate that the risk stems from having _divorced_ friends, not single friends.)

This decline of marriage has weakened men, Aarnio explains, by **robbing them of their fathers** , who play an irreplaceable role in their sons’ upbringing. Boys who grow up without a father miss out on the opportunity to learn about male-female relationships (by watching their parents) and so are more likely to struggle with their sexuality. They don’t learn how to be masculine and instead are forced to learn about it from other sources (like Aarnio’s book).

Moreover, in many households, fathers are the disciplinarians who punish sons for their bad behavior. Aarnio argues that without dads around, sons grow used to getting their way without any consequences and so are more likely to break the law and land in legal trouble.

> **What Studies Say About the Impact of Absent Fathers**
> 
> Some scholars support Aarnio’s contention that there is a relationship between boys with absentee fathers and homosexuality. Several researchers in the early 1900s found that many gay men grew up with dominant mothers and uninvolved fathers. However, researchers don’t agree that boys with absent fathers become less masculine. Rather, studies suggest that boys with absent fathers identify more with the feminine gender identity, and so they rebel against this by engaging in more masculine behavior.
> 
> Studies also support Aarnio’s contention that disciplinarian fathers have a significant impact on their children long-term. Research indicates that fathers discipline their kids with the intention of teaching their kids how to behave long-term in society, and this discipline has a bigger impact in later life. This may explain why fatherless sons have a delayed reaction to the _lack_ of discipline by acting out as adults and landing in legal trouble.

#### How the Decline of Judeo-Christian Values Has Weakened Men

Finally, Aarnio asserts that Western men have grown weak due to a decline in traditional Judeo-Christian values, such as the promotion of prosperity and family. Back when schools taught Judeo-Christian ideals, men were religious and so able to draw upon the power of the spiritual realm. Since they could access not just their _own_ intelligence and creativity but that of the _spiritual_ realm, they were able to grow more successful than they otherwise would have. But now, schools promote atheism—and atheist men who can’t access the spiritual realm are less successful and weaker as a result.

> **Do Schools Still Reflect Judeo-Christian Values?**
> 
> Some experts argue that while many American schools no longer _explicitly_ teach Judeo-Christian values, American schools still reflect those values in the way they’re structured and indirectly teach those values to their students. For example, in colonial days, teachers were often missionaries trying to save unbelievers from the damage of religious ignorance; in modern times, teachers continue to act as the missionaries did by modeling good behavior (that’s rooted in Judeo-Christian values) and promoting the pursuit of knowledge (which now relies on secular rather than religious texts).
> 
> Despite some Judeo-Christian values being built into the educational system, it may not be enough to help men access the spiritual realm or prevent schools from promoting atheism. If this is a concern, parents can instead choose __ to send their sons to religious schools.

### The Problem With Weak Men

We’ve now discussed why modern Western men are weak—but why does this matter? Aarnio argues that this matters because unless men become strong, Western Judeo-Christian society will face destruction from two possible sources: Communism and Islam.

#### How Communism Might Destroy Western Society

Citing an interview with Yuri Bezmenov, an ex-KGB agent who revealed Soviet spy secrets, Aarnio argues that Marxist powers like Russia are currently deep into a campaign to “subvert” or destroy modern Western culture and install communism instead. This is inherently bad because people die in Communist societies; _The Black Book of Communism_ suggests that the death toll of the ideology is nearly 100 million. (Shortform note: Two of the authors of _The Black Book of Communism_ have since disputed this figure, claiming that the book’s editor falsified these numbers.)

According to Bezmenov, the first two stages of this campaign were: 1) a systematic effort to destroy the morals, values, and beliefs of American society by promoting ideas that contradicted these values, and 2) getting these ideas promoted in institutions. Aarnio argues that both stages were successful. As evidence, he points to the fact that Americans have largely stopped practicing Judeo-Christian values and now instead worship the “new gods,” or false gods, of money, science, and atheism.

Money used to be backed by gold and so inherently valuable; now, it’s a false god because the US no longer runs on the gold standard. In 1968, when the US still had the gold standard, you had to work about 32 hours on minimum wage to earn an ounce of gold; in 2018, you must work nearly 175 hours to earn an ounce of gold. In this way, taking the US off the gold standard helped destroy traditional family values because it ensured that women _have_ to work to survive in the modern world.

> **Understanding the Gold Standard**
> 
> Several factors lead some economic experts to prefer staying off the gold standard. For one, although societies worldwide _agree_ that gold is valuable, it’s not _inherently_ valuable; gold is valuable because we say it is. Additionally, the price of gold is different between 1968 and 2018 in part because previously, world governments, which controlled the gold and thus the currency, had total control over its price despite the power of other market forces.
> 
> That said, experts do agree that many women were forced into the workforce in the 1970s after an economic downturn—although they don’t necessarily suggest that this downturn occurred because of the reversal of the gold standard—and that women’s increased participation in the workplace began the trend of many women prioritizing their careers over marriage and family.

Additionally, Aarnio argues that science—or what we can learn based on what we observe—is also a false god. The science that universities teach does not reflect a genuine quest for knowledge. Rather, universities only teach supposedly scientific ideas that they can use to support their Marxist ideals. Moreover, so-called science is not even economically useful to university students—cutting-edge science takes so long to be published that it’s outdated by the time it reaches the students, and so it doesn't help them get lucrative jobs in emergent fields and leaves them economically disadvantaged.

(Shortform note: One recent exception to universities’ reluctance to teach cutting-edge science is how rapidly many schools have embraced the AI revolution. Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, several universities have invested in hiring AI experts so they can teach their students effectively and help them get lucrative AI-related jobs.)

Aarnio also argues that we are currently in what Bezmenov identifies as the third stage of subversion: crisis. As is typical of this stage, the United States is currently experiencing a period of intense turmoil, with violence, protests, and political unrest. Many people want a socialist-style government to solve society’s current problems. This will inevitably lead to either civil war or invasion.

> **What Others Say About Bezmenov’s Ideas**
> 
> Bezmenov published a book in 1984 on what’s now known as the “Soviet subversion model,” but he didn’t live long enough to see the impact his ideas would have: Bezmenov passed in 1993, and his ideas gained attention in 2013 when a video interview he did was published on YouTube.
> 
> Bezmenov’s work remains controversial today. Academics often use his model to analyze disinformation campaigns. Some experts argue that Bezmenov’s contention that universities are influenced by Marxism and tend to teach ideologies rather than facts is merely a coincidence and not the result of a long-term Soviet brainwashing campaign. Others criticize his promotion of religion as the ideal method for protecting against subversion, and still others question whether Bezmenov could have known intimate characteristics of Russian operations due to his low rank in the KGB.
> 
> It’s also possible that Bezmenov himself would argue against Aarnio’s characterizations of his ideas. Bezmenov argued that generally, the first stage takes 15-20 years, the second stage takes two to five years, and the third stage takes two to six months. Since Bezmenov argued that the US had already been in demoralization for over 20 years in the 1980s, by Bezmenov’s calculations, we should have passed into normalization in the 1990s.
> 
> However, the evidence suggests that the United States still has all the hallmarks of being in the third stage (crisis): A 2022 report found that violent crime exceeds pre-pandemic levels. The Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 drew more attendees than usual. An increasing number of people believe that violence is sometimes necessary to further their political agendas, and nearly 40% of Americans believe that the country will face civil war within a decade. That said, Americans may not be as pro-socialist government as Aarnio fears. In 2022, a survey found that the number of pro-socialist Americans had dropped since 2019.

#### How Islam Might Destroy Western Society

It’s not just Communism; Aarnio suggests that the strong men of non-Western societies may also destroy Western societies. This is because modern Western Christians have grown tolerant (and therefore weak) and are as such vulnerable to attack by strong, intolerant groups—in particular, Muslims.

Aarnio explains that Christians are weaker than Muslims because Christianity is 500 years _older_ than Islam. 500 years ago, Christians were just as strong and intolerant as Muslims are today. But in the past 500 years, Christians have evolved past this intolerance and grown more tolerant and thus weaker. As a result, they’re vulnerable to attack by strong, intolerant groups—like those who practice Islam. Being attacked by Muslims would be problematic because Islamic values are incompatible with modern-day Christian values.

(Shortform note: Experts are divided on whether Muslims are intolerant (and therefore strong, as Aarnio argues) and whether Islamic values are compatible with modern-day Christian values. Some argue that tolerance is a key feature of Islam. Others argue that while earlier verses of the Quran (the sacred book of Islam) preach tolerance, later verses preach intolerance—and the later verses should be prioritized over the earlier ones. Similarly, some experts contend that different religions are generally incompatible, while others argue that Christianity and Islam are generally compatible because they’re both Abrahamic religions that believe in one god.)

Aarnio proposes that the Islamic ideology may take over Western society and replace our Judeo-Christian values in one of two ways. First, this may occur via the increase in the Muslim population. Muslim immigrants to Western countries are having more babies than Judeo-Christian citizens. These babies may grow up to vote in Islamic values that are incompatible with Western ideals and so transform the United States into a Muslim country.

(Shortform note: History suggests that Muslim immigrants and their kids may not necessarily grow up to vote Islamic values into law that are incompatible with Western ideals. After the US invaded Iraq under President George W. Bush, many American Muslims switched party affiliations and became Democrats. That change in political party precipitated a shift in social perspectives; notably, the percentage of American Muslims supporting LGBTQ rights increased from 27% to 52% in just 10 years despite the existence of some Islamic texts that condemn homosexuality.)

Alternatively, the third-world Islamic powers of the Middle East or Africa may invade the United States—just as groups that _lack_ wealth have invaded groups that _have_ wealth throughout history. To illustrate the likelihood of this happening, Aarnio compares the fall of Rome with the modern-day West. Rome’s wealth led it to dismiss Germanic tribes as too weak to conquer them and focus their energies instead on indulging their vices—such as binge-eating and having orgies—thus becoming more tolerant and weaker.

Similarly, America is ignoring its real problems—like a lack of strong men—in favor of trivial issues, like whether trans women should be permitted to play in women’s sports leagues. Eventually, the Islamic countries we dismiss as a threat will invade the United States, just as Germanic peoples invaded Rome.

> **Is America at Risk of Falling?**
> 
> Scholars generally agree that Rome fell due to invasion by Germanic tribes and increased corruption within its government. However, they point out several other factors that led to the fall of Rome that aren’t reflected in modern-day America. Notably, Rome faced an economic crisis that contributed to its downfall _not_ because its citizens focused on meaningless issues but because the empire lost its supply of free slave labor after it stopped expanding its borders. Additionally, Rome’s leaders couldn’t effectively defend the empire’s borders from outside forces because the empire was so big that they couldn’t communicate efficiently with their troops.
> 
> Since America doesn’t face these issues, it may have a better chance of defending itself than Rome did against a potential invasion from another country.

### What Makes a Strong Man?

Aarnio argues that the core difference between a weak man and a strong man is whether he embraces ownership of every aspect of his life. While a weak man ignores his problems or blames them on someone else (like his family or the government), **a strong man accepts that _he_ is the only person who can solve his problems and actively works toward doing so.**

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck_ , Mark Manson agrees that people should take ownership of their lives. However, he argues that _everyone_ —not just men— should do so to feel happier and more in control of their lives (not because they need to be strong). Additionally, Manson highlights the reality that even if you choose to ignore your problems or blame them on someone else, you’re not effectively avoiding responsibility: Ignoring your problems or blaming them on others is still a choice for which you’re responsible. Therefore, the question isn’t whether you take responsibility for your decisions but what values you base those decisions on.)

Aarnio adds that **strong men command respect** —both from women, who view them as sexually desirable, and other men, who view them as leaders. Crucially, this respect does _not_ stem from viewing him as “kind” or a “good person”—the definitions of which differ depending on what your culture values. Rather, this respect stems from universally appreciated virtues: A strong man always accomplishes what he says he will, no matter what. In contrast, weak men don’t command respect; notably, women are not sexually monogamous with weak men.

> **How to Command Respect**
> 
> Despite Aarnio’s claim that strong men command respect by having universally appreciated virtues, studies suggest that there may be no universally appreciated virtues. One study found that honesty, respect, kindness, openness, and tolerance were valued by many—but not all—nations, prompting the study authors to deem those virtues “relatively universal.”
> 
> So if, depending on your culture, always doing what you say you will doesn’t command great respect, how can you ensure that you become a strong man who’s sexually desirable and respected by others? In _The Magic of Thinking Big_ , David J. Schwartz suggests that the key is to respect yourself. If you truly believe you’re an important and valuable person, you’ll act with importance—which will lead others to react to you with respect and deference.

Finally, Aarnio argues that **a strong man has mastered four essential areas**. First, he is in control of his mind, through which he wields financial, social, and intellectual power. Second, he is in control of his body: He is strong and healthy enough to command the respect of other men and support his family for years to come. Third, he is religious in some way, and so able to connect with and draw power from the spiritual realm. Fourth, he is comfortable with his emotions.

> **How Religion Empowers Men to Prioritize Emotional and Physical Health**
> 
> Many men struggle to master the domains that Aarnio deems central to being a strong man in part because Aarnio’s ideas don’t necessarily jibe with traditional notions of masculinity. Notably, many men struggle to take care of their emotional health because they view doing so as feminine. They also may stretch their physical limits to impress other men and then avoid going to the doctor because they prioritize working to support their family instead.
> 
> Becoming religious (as Aarnio says all strong men are) can mitigate these struggles, as studies suggest that religious people may be better equipped to handle both physical and mental health challenges. For example, religious people can effectively rely on prayer to help control pain, and religious people who receive religious psychotherapy experience greater mental health benefits than those who receive traditional therapy. Good mental health matters because it’s essential to taking control of your mind. In _High Performance Habits_ , Brendon Burchard warns that having poor mental health harms your ability to focus and pace yourself and so leads to burnout, which harms your social standing (by leading to isolation) and your financial standing (by causing you to skip work).

### How to Be a Strong Man

We’ve now discussed what makes a strong man, but how do you _become_ one? Aarnio argues that you must be strong in two main spheres—your work and your relationships.

#### How to Be a Strong Man at Work

To be a strong man, Aarnio argues that you must **work**. This is your purpose as a man: to do whatever allows you to provide for your woman and your family. Aarnio contends that if you stop working, you lose your purpose and so lose your masculinity; therefore, both retirement and relying on the government for survival are unmanly. You should always be chasing as much money and power as possible, as both allow you to control your life, which is inherently manly.

(Shortform note: Over 70% of Americans share Aarnio’s view that men should be able to provide financially for their families. And while working forever to do so may seem foreign to some modern Americans, the concept of retirement is relatively new. In _The Psychology of Money_ , Morgan Housel explains that prior to World War II, most Americans couldn’t afford to retire. But Housel disagrees that you should constantly chase money and power. Rather, he recommends that you figure out how much money is enough to keep the lifestyle you desire, then learn to be happy with that amount. Otherwise, you may risk your existing wealth for wealth you don’t need—such as by risking your life savings on the stock market to buy a boat.)

Aarnio specifies that **you must choose the right work**. At first, it does not matter whether you _enjoy_ what you do; focus only on whether your work provides you with enough money to survive (and let your dependents survive, too). It’s only by becoming capable of providing for yourself and any dependents that you earn the privilege to focus on finding work that you _want_ to do. To achieve this goal, Aarnio recommends that you focus your energies on your passions in your free time. Such passions may include artistic pursuits, but they should also include goals like becoming an entrepreneur and running your own business.

(Shortform note: If you struggle to work at a boring job because it’s unfulfilling, do as the authors of _Your Money or Your Life_ suggest and redefine the word “work.” Choose to see work as any activity you do that aligns with your values, purpose, and dreams—whether it’s paid or unpaid. Broadening your definition of work in this way allows you to balance work you do and don’t want to do. Furthermore, acknowledge that the work you’re passionate about may never turn a profit—even becoming an entrepreneur is risky since 65% of businesses fail within 10 years. Acknowledging this risk will keep you motivated to pursue boring, paid work and even find it fulfilling because it allows you to pursue what matters most to you.)

##### Avoid Immediately Gratifying Pastimes

Aarnio warns that successfully pursuing your passions requires avoiding immediately gratifying pastimes such as video games. Men find video games addictive because they allow men to regularly troubleshoot issues, which men love doing. But video games only provide the _illusion_ of accomplishment; in reality, playing video games wastes time that you _could_ be spending on more productive pursuits. Moreover, it reduces your appeal to women, who dislike when men play video games because such a man is not working toward greater success and is therefore unmanly.

(Shortform note: If your video game usage interferes with other aspects of your life, you may have gaming disorder. Ninety-four percent of gaming addicts are men, perhaps due to a difference in male and female brain functions: One study found that men who gamed even for a short period had greater neural activation than women. Of course, the fact that you enjoy video games doesn’t mean that you’re addicted to them. However, experts recommend that you reevaluate your video game playing if you’re using it to distract yourself from other issues in your life. Additionally, pay attention if your playing upsets your partner: She may dislike it not because she views you as unmanly but because she’s feeling neglected in your relationship.)

Additionally, Aarnio recommends that you avoid pornography. When a man ejaculates, he expends tremendous sexual energy. If this ejaculation involves sex with a woman he loves, he benefits from the _battery effect_. This is a supercharging of your ability to fulfill your purpose that stems from the exchange of feminine and masculine energies during sex.

(Shortform note: Aarnio describes the health benefits of avoiding pornography, but how do you actually do so? Experts suggest several methods, such as installing a porn blocker on all your devices or joining an online community dedicated to avoiding pornography.)

However, ejaculating to pornography provides no benefits. Despite this, many men regularly masturbate to the pornography that’s now easily accessible on the internet. Aarnio recommends that instead of wasting your sexual energy and time masturbating to internet pornography, you should take advantage of what _Think and Grow Rich_ author Napoleon Hill called “sexual transmutation”: Redirect your sexual energy into creative efforts. Your sexual energy is a powerful creative force that you can harness to achieve financial or artistic success, especially because it allows you to connect with the spiritual realm that provides you with world-changing ideas.

(Shortform note: Other cultures make arguments similar to Hill’s and Aarnio’s regarding the power of semen retention. Notably, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners believe that semen is essential sexual energy and if you don’t ejaculate, you can transmute that energy into mental energy by meditating. But if you ejaculate too often, you’ll experience negative impacts on your health—like memory loss or reduced energy levels—that may impact your ability to succeed. That said, not everybody who stops masturbating experiences such benefits: Several participants in a yearly month-long no-masturbation challenge felt no change in their lives.)

#### How to Be a Strong Man in Your Relationships

Now that we’ve discussed how to be a strong man at work and in pursuit of your passions, we’ll discuss how to behave like a strong man in relationships.

##### Attract and Select the Right Woman

First, Aarnio explains that you must **learn how to attract women**. Do this by working on your purpose, which will increase your masculine energy and so attract women to you. Don’t resort to pickup artistry, which involves a series of techniques that you can use to convince women to have sex with you. Pickup artistry doesn't lead to fulfilling relationships because it relies on gimmicky tricks that convince a woman you’re someone you’re not. Eventually, this woman will discover your authentic self—which isn’t the person you portrayed yourself to be—and leave you.

(Shortform note: In _Models_ , former pickup artist Mark Manson elaborates on why pickup artistry doesn’t work. Manson specifies that women desire confident men—in other words, a man whose sense of self-worth depends on how _he_ judges himself. When dating, a confident man will adjust his behavior as much as the woman does—but no more—because he’s focused on deciding how _he_ feels about the woman instead of bending over backward to please her. Pickup artistry techniques only work temporarily because they show you how to _portray_ yourself as confident. But once the woman realizes that you’re not as confident as you initially seemed, she loses her attraction to you.)

Moreover, many pickup artists get hooked on sleeping with as many women as possible. This can hurt both the women you’re sleeping with and yourself. Aarnio writes that he destroyed his chances with the one woman he _actually_ cared about because he was dating too many other women simultaneously. (Shortform note: Other experts suggest that it’s possible to casually date multiple women without hurting them or yourself. To do so, make your expectations clear early on and avoid romantic gestures that may be misconstrued—like sending her flowers regularly.)

Second, Aarnio contends that you must **select the right woman**. Women fall into different ranges of the “Hot Crazy matrix,” ranging from 1-10 on a scale of physical attractiveness and 1-10 on a scale of mental instability. Moreover, the more physically attractive a woman, the more mentally unstable she may be as people forgive this instability. If you’re only seeking a dating relationship, select women who are 8-10 hot and 7-10 crazy. But if you want to get married, only pursue women who are 8-10 hot and 5-7 crazy, prioritizing stability over physical attractiveness.

(Shortform note: Aarnio cites the “Hot Crazy matrix” that a Tennessean lawyer posted on YouTube in a since-deleted video. This matrix is a spin on a similar way to rank women introduced on the TV show _How I Met Your Mother_. In one episode, perpetual playboy Barney Stinson suggests that women can be ranked on a “hot crazy scale,” stating that a woman is “allowed to be” as crazy as she wants—as long as she is equally hot. However, Barney doesn’t provide numbers or specify how hot or crazy a woman needs to be before you date or marry her. Neither Aarnio nor Barney specifies what exactly counts as a “crazy” woman; however, some researchers did find that men prioritize attractiveness over mental stability in relationships.)

When selecting a girlfriend or wife, Aarnio adds that you should evaluate the following factors. Determine whether you have compatible values; ideally, you’ll have grown up in similar environments and so have a baseline agreement as to what’s “normal,” or standard. Ensure that you like her parents; her relationship with her father will inform her relationship with you, and she’ll likely grow to physically resemble her mother as she ages. Choose someone whose income is lower than yours; otherwise, she’ll feel like you’re not fulfilling your purpose as a man and grow to resent you. And if you want kids, make sure she’s a good potential mother.

> **What Others Say About Choosing the Right Partner**
> 
> Others support Aarnio’s recommendations for selecting a good partner—but with caveats. _How to Not Die Alone_ author Logan Ury also emphasizes the importance of discussing how you grew up and determining whether you have compatible values; however, she argues that it’s OK if your expectations don’t exactly align as long as you talk about and plan for differences. _The Defining Decade_ author Meg Jay agrees that you should like her parents, not because of how she treats her father or how her mother looks but because if you don’t like her parents, you may be overlooking incompatible values in your partner.
> 
> Furthermore, _The Unplugged Alpha_ author Richard Cooper argues that you (like most men) will likely choose someone who makes less than you; however, her income should be relatively similar to yours so you don’t have to pay as much alimony if you divorce. And if you want kids, experts agree that you should choose a good potential mother by looking for someone patient, mature, and flexible.

Third, Aarnio recommends that you **have a monogamous relationship** with the woman you select. This is important not just to help you supercharge your purpose, as discussed earlier, but to help maintain your strength. Women are hypergamous: They’re wired to exchange sex for power and stability and so naturally seek out the strongest man available. But if you allow her to remain attached to you _while_ she continues to seek out men she likes better, this will make you weak.

(Shortform note: _The Unplugged Alpha_ author Cooper has a more nuanced take on how to have a monogamous relationship and remain a strong man. He recommends considering monogamy only if you’re over 30; if you’re younger, you haven’t dated enough women to know who will make a good girlfriend. Only date someone monogamously if _she_ asks to be exclusive; since women are hypergamous, this request indicates that she’s decided that you’re the highest-status male in her life. Finally, ask her to tattoo your name on her body and see how she reacts. If she sees you as a dominant man with whom she wants to spend her life, she’ll be willing to tattoo herself.)

##### Maintain Attraction in Your Relationship

Once you have a partner, Aarnio suggests that you **maintain attraction** by accepting—but not yielding to—her feminine demands. Citing _The Wife of Bath’s Tale_ , Aarnio argues that women desire “mastery over their men.” But as we learned earlier, people are attracted to opposite energies; masculine energies are attracted to feminine energies, and vice versa. So if you _actually_ give your woman control over you by prioritizing her __ needs, she’ll grow _less_ attracted to you. This is because if you prioritize her needs over your purpose of working, you'll develop a more feminine energy that automatically turns her more masculine—which she won’t like.

(Shortform note: If women desire their men _less_ when they control them, why did the Wife of Bath think that women wanted “mastery over their men”? It’s possible that the Wife of Bath and Aarnio define “mastery” differently. As scholars point out, _The Wife of Bath’s Tale was written in an age where women had no rights and no control over their lives_. Back then, a woman who had mastery over her man had mastery over her own life in a way that was not otherwise possible. In contrast, modern women _can_ control their own lives; to them, having mastery over their men _doesn’t_ equate to having control over their own lives. Rather, as Aarnio suggests, having mastery over their men has relational implications that turn the women off.)

As Aarnio notes, many men grow frustrated by women’s illogical behavior—like when they ask their men to prioritize them but lose attraction when they do. But this is simply a feature of feminine energy; feminine women live moment-to-moment and are easily swayed by their feelings, unlike rational, logical men. So don’t try to ignore her volatility or make her less volatile; if you do, you’ll push her toward masculinity, lose your attraction to her, and end the relationship. Instead, accept her for who she is and understand that without her occasionally frustrating feminine energy, you won’t be together.

> **How to Handle Changes in Your Energy**
> 
> In _The Way of the Superior Man_ , David Deida—whose work Aarnio cites extensively—explains that men can also change their minds easily. Depending on what’s going on in your life, you will desire either a “cool” woman or a “hot” woman. Cool women have a soothing presence and are relaxing to be around; hot women are more fiery and quicker to be swayed by their emotions.
> 
> If you have a partner and you suddenly find yourself craving a woman of a different temperature, Deida suggests that you work on yourself first—just as your reaction to a volatile feminine woman requires you to accept rather than change her. If you’re running hot, a glass of cool fruit juice, a massage from a cool woman, or a relaxed conversation can rebalance your energy. Likewise, spending time with hot, fiery people, eating spicy foods, or wearing warmer clothes can warm you up and enliven your spirit.

##### Modern-Day Homosexuality Is Unmanly

Aarnio’s advice on how to have a relationship as a strong man is predicated on the assumption that your partner is a woman. This is because, according to Aarnio, having a relationship with another man is unmanly.

Aarnio explains that the modern-day expression of homosexuality is unmanly because it harms women. In Roman times, they had what Aarnio calls “functioning homosexuality”: Older Roman men openly had sexual relationships with younger men. But that younger man was still expected to marry and have children with his wife. When he did so, he was expected to stop having sexual relations with the man he’d been seeing, but he was culturally free to develop a different relationship with a younger man.

In contrast, modern gay men date each other and exclude women from their relationships. Moreover, most of them don’t raise children. This, according to Aarnio, is “nonfunctioning homosexuality” because it allows men to shirk their manly duties of procreating with and taking care of women. Aarnio points out that if _every_ man in a society practiced nonfunctioning homosexuality, that society would not survive. Therefore, Aarnio argues that it is morally wrong and therefore unmanly to choose another man as a life partner.

(Shortform note: Aarnio’s argument that the difference between “functioning” and “nonfunctioning” homosexuality depends on whether the men procreate with and support their wives implies that ancient Romans accepted homosexual male relationships as long as they didn’t interfere with the men’s ability to raise a family. But researchers suggest that the Romans’ acceptance had nothing to do with whether the men involved could support women and families. Rather, the Romans saw these relationships as expressions of dominance: People accepted sexual relationships between men only if the older or higher-status man was the dominant, penetrative partner; any other configuration was seen as taboo.)
