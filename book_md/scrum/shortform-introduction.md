## Shortform Introduction

The way the business world operates, according to Jeff Sutherland, is fundamentally flawed. In _Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time_ , Jeff Sutherland explains the Scrum framework, a better management system than the traditional top-down approach. By using the carefully structured yet open-ended Scrum framework, a company, or any project team, can become much more efficient and productive.

### About the Author

Jeff Sutherland is a software developer who co-created Scrum alongside fellow software developer Ken Schwaber. A former fighter pilot and Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado Medical School, Sutherland has since helped dozens of businesses implement Scrum into their development process. He has been a CTO or CEO for eleven software companies, during which he developed Scrum into what it is today.

### The Book’s Publication

_Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time_ was published by Currency, an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group _,_ in 2014. Before _Scrum_ , Jeff Sutherland co-wrote _Software in 30 Days: How Agile Managers Beat the Odds, Delight Their Customers, and Leave Competitors in the Dust _alongside Ken Schwaber. More recently, Sutherland released another book on the subject, _A Scrum Book: The Spirit of the Game_ , which he co-wrote with James Coplien.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

Sutherland wrote _Scrum_ to explain and spread the ideas of Scrum to businesses outside the world of technology. Sutherland developed Scrum in the early 1990s with the help of Ken Schwaber and others. It was designed as a more effective way to develop software than traditional methods. Sutherland and Schwaber first presented Scrum at a research conference in 1995, and it has gained popularity ever since, especially in the technology industry. Tech giants such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Spotify, and Adobe use the Scrum framework in some capacity. Recently, the Scrum method has made its way into other industries, including education, construction, marketing, and finance.

#### Intellectual Context

Written well into Sutherland’s career as a product management expert, _Scrum_ explains the Scrum framework, a subset of the agile business model, to the masses. Agile methodology is a system for product development that focuses on incremental progress and close collaboration. Sutherland, with sixteen others, released the Agile Manifesto for software development in 2001 and it has since exploded in popularity. There are hundreds of books and guides about the agile business model and how to implement it.

#### The Book’s Impact

Although _Scrum_ didn’t sell particularly well, the ideas presented in the book have had a significant impact in the areas of business management and leadership and have influenced many more books on the subject. Another book, _The Elements of Scrum,_ which was based on Sutherland’s ideas,__ is taught at colleges and universities across the United States. Since the publication of _Scrum_ in 2014, the Scrum framework has garnered attention from business and leadership experts around the world. __

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Scrum_ was well-received among business experts but failed to gain enough attention to attract well-known book reviewers. Editorial reviews praise the book for its engaging and persuasive anecdotes and its easy-to-read explanations of the Scrum framework. User reviews, while generally agreeing that _Scrum_ is helpful, seem to have more negative opinions on the overwhelming use of personal anecdotes. The stories, mostly taken from Sutherland’s experience creating and using Scrum, give readers a sense of the writer’s perceived self-importance, with one reviewer even accusing Sutherland of megalomania.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

As the user reviews suggest, _Scrum_ is highly anecdote-driven. The stories are often about failed businesses or companies Sutherland helped save with the Scrum framework. Within the stories, Sutherland does provide meaningful research backing up his ideas. Most of the research is based on psychology/sociology, or data-driven studies that exemplify the effectiveness of certain practices.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_Scrum_ can be a bit redundant at times, as it goes over the same topics in slightly different ways. Also, readers would have benefited if the book had laid out what Scrum actually is much earlier. Instead, readers piece it together gradually as Sutherland jumps from story to idea to story.

Sutherland separates the book into nine chapters, each one tackling a different aspect of the Scrum framework. The first two chapters delve into the origins of Scrum and how traditional project management methods fail. The next few chapters contain the crux of his argument. They explain why Scrum works, with a small amount of information on how to use it dispersed throughout. The last few chapters look more deeply into how Scrum works, how it leads to happiness, and how it can change the world. Finally, the book ends with an appendix, which gives a brief description of the Scrum process and how to implement it.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we focus on the core principles of the Scrum framework. We’ve reorganized the nine chapters into an opening explanation of Scrum and six subsequent principles. We’ve also included commentary that supports some of Sutherland’s claims and provides actionable advice on how to implement certain strategies he recommends.
