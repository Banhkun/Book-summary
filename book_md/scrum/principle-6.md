## Principle 6: Why Happiness Matters

Sutherland stresses the importance of happiness in a workplace. Not only is it morally preferable, he says, it actually increases productivity.

Sutherland states that happy people are more successful in virtually every aspect of life. Happy people live longer, healthier lives, and are more likely to have a higher income and be more creative. He argues, though, that happiness does not necessarily _come from_ success. Instead, it _leads to_ success. In other words, if a team is happy, they’ll be more productive. If a team is unhappy, their productivity will decline. Therefore, Sutherland advises that you **should take steps to make sure your team is happy**.

(Shortform note: Research confirms Sutherland’s assertion that happiness leads to success rather than the reverse. Psychologists have found that happy attitudes and mentalities not only correspond with but in fact precede successful outcomes, indicating that a happy outlook brings about success, instead of success bringing about happiness.)

Happiness, he argues, comes from **the pursuit of a goal rather than the attainment of it.** Businesses, and society in general, often work counter to this idea. They reward the end-product over the journey. In contrast, the Scrum method seeks to make customers, workers, and managers happy by focusing on the joy of the process and implementing small changes in the work culture.

> **_The Happiness Equation_**
> 
> In _The Happiness Equation_ , Neil Pasricha agrees that Western culture’s relationship to work is problematic and leads to unhappiness. We see work as something we have to do to fund our free time, something that we must endure so we can find happiness outside of our jobs. Assuming you work around forty hours a week, this means you spend around a third of your time feeling unsatisfied and discontented. He argues that it can then be difficult to keep this feeling of discontentment from creeping into other parts of your life. Instead, he encourages you to, if possible, try to find work you're passionate about, even if it means taking a pay cut—choose happiness over money.

We’ll look at how to quantify happiness, what makes people happy, and how to achieve it in the workplace using Scrum.

### Measuring Happiness

Happiness can be tricky to quantify. Sutherland proposes measuring happiness in a relatively simple way. At the end of each Sprint, ask every team member how they feel about the company, their role in it, why they feel that way, and what changes might make them happier moving forward.

These questions can provoke some meaningful discussions and expose what’s most important to each person. The team should then focus on making changes in the next Sprint that will make them happier. By doing so, you will make the team happier and more productive. A win-win.

> **Measuring Happiness: Alternative Methods**
> 
> Since happiness is a subjective state, the most common method to measure happiness is the one Sutherland uses: self-reporting. However, experts note that self-reported happiness is often unreliable—people often rate themselves as happier than other people think they are.
> 
> To counter this problem, researchers often use other methods to measure happiness:
> 
>   * **Biological** : Some scientists attempt to measure happiness through biological markers such as hormones and neurotransmitters.
> 
>   * **Behavioral** : The frequency of certain behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, can be used to determine a person’s happiness.
> 
>   * **Implicit measures** : An implicit measure test measures feelings or attitudes that people are unwilling or unable to openly admit.
> 
>   * **Reports from others** : Asking a family member or friend about a person’s happiness levels can be effective.
>

### What Makes Us Happy

Sutherland claims there are three things that make people happy:

  1. **Autonomy:** Freedom to make choices and act upon them.
  2. **Mastery:** The feeling that you're improving at something.
  3. **Purpose:** The feeling that what you're doing is important and making a positive impact.



These are terms that are used to indicate what makes individuals happy, but they also apply to a group’s happiness.

A team that has the ability to decide for themselves how to go about their work will do so in more innovative and creative ways. They will also teach themselves how to improve the process, mastering their jobs as they learn and adapt. By checking in with the team members weekly, management also makes sure that the team feels they are working toward something worthwhile.

> **Happiness as an Element of Motivation**
> 
> Sutherland takes the terms autonomy, mastery, and purpose straight from Daniel Pink’s _Drive_. Pink describes these terms as the three components of _intrinsic motivation_ : the drive to do something for internal fulfillment rather than external rewards. Someone who is intrinsically motivated is much more likely to perform better and is much less likely to suffer from burnout.
> 
> Pink gives some ideas for increasing intrinsic motivation in the workplace. One thing Pink recommends is to allow employees a say in their assignments and goals. If people have time to work on something of their choosing, they’ll have a sense of agency and fulfillment in their jobs. Another tip is to conduct anonymous surveys. Getting anonymous feedback can help you see if your employees are happy or if they feel they are just a cog in the machine.

### How Scrum Leads to Happy Teams

Because a happy team is more productive, the Scrum framework is designed to build and maintain happiness. Here are some of the ways Scrum leads to happy teams:

#### Consistent Improvement

A central idea of Scrum is to always be looking for ways to improve. Constant improvement is also a contributing factor to happiness.

After achieving a certain level of success, Sutherland says it's common for a team to become complacent. The team has made great progress and vastly increased their productivity using Scrum. They may think they’ve improved enough. This can lead to a leveling off of productivity, which is not only bad for the continued success of the team, it's bad for each individual’s happiness.

Happiness comes from striving toward greatness—finding value in everyday work while building something that will make a positive impact in the future.

> **Purpose Prevents Complacency**
> 
> Many experts have also noted that a team with a strong sense of purpose is less likely to become complacent. In _Grit_ , psychologist Angela Duckworth equates purpose with happiness. She notes that while not everyone will find their job personally fulfilling, there are ways to develop or find purpose in your work.
> 
> People generally develop purpose at work through a three-part process:
> 
>   * They are interested in a job for selfish reasons.
> 
>   * They become better at the job through practice.
> 
>   * They start to see how their work benefits others and begin to prioritize other people before themselves.
> 
> 

> 
> Duckworth also gives three ways to help you find purpose in your current job:
> 
>   * Think about how your job benefits others and contributes to society. Look at the ways you help people with your work, and you may find yourself happy to do things you previously dreaded.
> 
>   * Change your work to more closely align with your interests and values. Even if you feel your job isn’t a great benefit to society, you may find that with a few tweaks it can be more beneficial to your personal growth.
> 
>   * Find a role model. Identify someone who has similar values and whose work you admire. This will show that it's possible to have a meaningful and impactful working life.
> 
> 


#### Transparency

Sutherland argues that clear and open communication leads to a happy workforce. To avoid miscommunication and wasted time, it should be clear what everyone is working on and how they are all working toward a common goal. In Scrum, everyone is allowed and encouraged to attend every meeting. This keeps everything out in the open and everybody on the same page.

Furthermore, _everything_ should be made visible to _everyone_. The team’s plans, salaries, and expenses should all be laid out. This assures that nothing is kept secret, that there are no hidden agendas or hierarchical manipulations. Transparency helps build trust and keeps everyone working together on an undivided front.

A transparent team will have the autonomy to work freely, the ability to improve regularly, and their purpose will always be at the forefront.

> **Building Trust**
> 
> The transparency Sutherland recommends will result in trust, which many experts say lies at the heart of successful teams. In _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team,_ Patrick M. Lencioni gives more insight into the ways an absence of trust between team members can negatively affect them. He defines trust as _the ability to be vulnerable with one another_. Without trust, team members will suppress their feelings, hide their weaknesses, and fall into the trap of workplace politics. They will be more likely to direct energy into unproductive activities, and less likely to ask for or offer help. Ultimately, a team without trust will be less happy and less productive.
> 
> To build trust, Lencioni gives some helpful advice:
> 
>   * **Share personal stories**. Simply getting to know someone will help you be more vulnerable around them.
> 
>   * **Have the team identify each other’s strengths and weaknesses**. This can help a person with low self-esteem gain confidence. It can also be an effective ego check for an overconfident team member.
> 
>   * **As a leader, show your own vulnerability**. A good leader will own up to mistakes and show the rest of the team that it's ok to ask for help.
> 
> 


#### Happiness Through Connection

Another key element of Scrum is keeping the team connected to each other and to the customers. Humans are a naturally social species, so a feeling of togetherness is a crucial part of feeling happy. The Scrum method maintains this connectedness through its emphasis on teamwork and communication—in the way feedback and knowledge-sharing are encouraged, in how joint goals are established, and in how hierarchies are discouraged.

This collaborative approach encourages bonding and eliminates competing interests within the team.

> **Promote Positive Relationships**
> 
> _The Leadership Challenge _provides tips for facilitating positive relationships in the workplace. As you may notice, most of these are built into the Scrum framework. Here are four relatively easy things you can do to promote bonding between team members:
> 
>   * **Develop common goals** : Encourage your team to share in a common purpose and make sure each individual knows how their work contributes to the overall objective. If the team shares a common purpose, individuals are more likely to help each other and see another’s achievements as a benefit to the team.
> 
>   * **Promote reciprocity** : Reciprocating another’s kindness or help is a foundational aspect of human interaction. Most people will naturally treat others as others treat them. As a leader, encourage your team to repay favors and offer help as much as possible. Also, be a role model in reciprocity. Don’t get stuck with the “not my job” attitude.
> 
>   * **Reward joint effort** : Prioritize collective success over individual success. When you do so, individuals will focus on group benefits and be less likely to withhold information from their teammates. Studies show group-based reward systems outperform individual-based systems.
> 
>   * **Encourage face-to-face interactions** : Encourage in-person interactions as much as possible. This will help establish trust and a collaborative mentality between employees. It will also help humanize each individual, whereas communication through email or phone may not have the same effect. If in-person meetings aren’t possible, make sure virtual meetings are held through webcams and that everyone keeps their cameras on.
