## Exercise: Make a Task List

See how much writing down your daily tasks can help your productivity. Then think about how using a task list changes when in a group.

* * *

Make a list of the things you need to do tomorrow and then order them by importance.

Now look over the list. Has simply writing the tasks down helped clarify what is most important? Do you think you will get more or less done if you make a list like this every day?

How do you think making a personal task list differs from making a list for a team? Will it be more or less helpful? Why do you think so?
