## Principle 2: Build and Maintain an Effective Team

In modern businesses, Sutherland insists, too much emphasis is put on _individual_ achievements, rather than the team’s accomplishments. But he argues that the _team_ , not individuals, is creating a product, so it’s important to focus on _collective performance_. This holistic approach to management, emphasizing teamwork, is a pillar of the Scrum framework. Sutherland describes the three common characteristics of successful teams. He then explains the three roles within a Scrum team and the specific things they should do to create value.

### Three Traits of Successful Teams

Sutherland gives us three common characteristics of effective teams:

#### Ambition

When creating a product, a team must aspire to be great. Without ambition, or what Sutherland calls _transcendence_ , it’s impossible to achieve great things. Just the decision to strive toward a higher goal can be enough to rise above mediocrity. From a leadership perspective, it's vital to instill in your team a common objective and to explain why that objective is worth pursuing.

Sutherland says one way to inspire your team is to challenge them. Set lofty goals, ones worth achieving, and the team will have a strong sense of purpose.

> **Set Audacious Goals**
> 
> In _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras also argue that success follows ambition. To prove their case, they examine companies that set what they call “big, hairy, audacious goals,” or _BHAGs_. They argue that merely having a BHAG sets a company up for success because it helps to motivate its workforce.
> 
> They say that a BHAG should be clear, compelling, and challenging, and they should align with the philosophy of the company. They suggest ways to ensure the success of your BHAGs:
> 
>   * **Fully commit to your goals** : It’s not enough to merely set an audacious goal, the entire organization must be willing to get behind it.
> 
>   * **Think beyond the profits** : Although companies are profit-driven, a visionary company looks beyond the quarterly profits and aims to achieve something great.
> 
>   * **Continue setting audacious goals** : If a company manages to meet one of their goals, they must not stop there. A company that continues setting ambitious goals even after success are more likely to maintain that success.
> 
> 


#### Freedom

Once an objective is set, Sutherland says, let the team figure out how to achieve it. A team should organize and manage themselves and be empowered to make their own decisions. This freedom, or autonomy, leads to a happier and more effective team. If people feel they’re being constantly guided by management, it can be deflating. Not only does it rob them of their ambition, but it also stifles their creativity. Both of these can lead to a drastic reduction in productivity.

As a leader, you shouldn’t tell your team exactly what to do or how to do it. Rather, you should provide them with an objective and the necessary tools to complete it. Set expectations, then step back and let them work.

(Shortform note: A _results-only work environment_ (ROWE) is a management strategy that allows for a great deal of freedom. In a ROWE, you measure and compensate employees by their output, or results, rather than the hours worked. Studies show that ROWEs can increase a company’s productivity, retention rate, and employee happiness. Best Buy, for example, implemented ROWEs in the early 2000s. Between 2005 and 2007, voluntary turnover dropped 90% while productivity increased 41%.)

#### Integrated Purpose

In a traditional business setting, one that uses the Waterfall model, there are usually separate teams assigned to each task. Once each task is completed, it's then handed off to the next team. This “handoff model” is slow and tedious, doesn’t allow for the quick correction of mistakes, and cultivates a culture in which communication between teams isn’t valued. For example, you might have a design team, a marketing team, a sales team, and a production team, all meant to stick to their own specific assignment.

Sutherland argues that the handoff model isn’t an effective way to work and that instead, your team should have integrated purpose, or what he calls _cross-functionality_. **Team members should have various specialties but not a strict separation of duties.** The team should be constantly feeding off each other’s skills. Collectively, the team should have all the tools and information necessary to complete the project, and they should be in a continual state of collaboration. This way, everyone on the team knows where they stand. If something changes, the whole team knows right away. If a problem occurs, the whole team works to fix it immediately.

(Shortform note: Experts caution that although teams should have some ability to take on each other’s roles, you should still allow for some specialization: When building a creative workplace, intellectual diversity is a key component. A team that is intellectually diverse has a wide range of experience, opinions, and perspectives. Teams with different perspectives and life experiences are better able to come up with creative solutions than teams whose members all think alike. With different backgrounds comes different ideas, and thus a more well-rounded, nuanced, and comprehensive approach to problem-solving.)

> **New Product Development**
> 
> Sutherland focuses on three fundamental characteristics of effective teams, but in the essay he based many of his thinking on, “The New New Product Development Game,” Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka describe _six_ characteristics of effective teams:
> 
>   * **Built-in instability** : Management gives the development team a broad strategy or goal at the beginning of a project. This should challenge the team while allowing the freedom to meet the challenges.
> 
>   * **Self-organizing project teams** : Discussed in detail above, a self-organizing project team is more creative and independent.
> 
>   * **Overlapping development phases** : A team is more likely to work as a unit if they don’t use the sequential approach of the Waterfall Method.
> 
>   * **Multilearning** : People involved in the project are constantly learning at the individual, team, and company level. Also, they learn things outside of their areas of expertise, acquiring a diverse knowledge and skill set.
> 
>   * **Subtle control** : Management, while allowing freedom, has enough control over the project to avoid too much risk or ambiguity.
> 
>   * **Transfer of Learning** : Knowledge is not only shared amongst the development team, it makes its way into other projects and other parts of the organization.
> 
> 

> 
> Although Sutherland only specifically names three common traits of successful teams, Takeuchi and Nonaka’s ideas are seen throughout the Scrum framework.

### The Scrum Roles

Sutherland proposes three roles within a Scrum team:

  1. **Product Manager**
  2. **Scrum Coach**
  3. **Developers**



These are the **only** three roles in a Scrum team. They are each responsible for working together to create consistent value throughout the Scrum process.

#### Product Manager

The Product Manager (or what Sutherland calls the “Product Owner”) creates the overall vision for the product and makes sure the product is both viable and valuable. The Product Manager’s responsibilities include:

  * Determining the goal of the project and what it should look like when it's finished
  * Creating the task list of everything that needs to be done to complete the project
  * Ordering the task list by the value it brings to the project
  * Relaying feedback from the customers or stakeholders to the rest of the Scrum team
  * Making changes to the project objective and the task list based on the feedback



The Product Manager is responsible for important decisions that will determine the success of the project. Her job is to convince the team of her decisions and make sure the work being done is bringing value.

(Shortform note: In _Inspired_ , Marty Cagan agrees with Sutherland’s basic framework of having a product manager direct the vision of the project, oversee its task list, coordinate messaging to customers and stakeholders, and adjust the project as needed. Cagan differs in that he calls this person a _project_ manager rather than a _product_ manager, and he draws attention to the difference—this person oversees the _work_ and the _process_ , not the technical details of the product itself. Although Sutherland uses the word “product” in his title for this role, he views the role in the same way Cagan does.)

#### Scrum Coach

While the Product Manager is responsible for making the product valuable, the Scrum Coach is responsible for making sure the team is working as efficiently as possible. She coaches the team in the ways of Scrum and keeps the team working within the Scrum framework. The Scrum Coach does this by:

  * Encouraging the team to self-organize and share knowledge
  * Keeping the team focused on the current task
  * Finding and removing any impediments to the team’s progress



The Scrum Coach meets with the team daily to make sure things are running smoothly. Like the Product Manager, she doesn’t assign specific tasks. She just ensures that communication is open and the team is making consistent progress.

(Shortform note: _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ discusses the way organizational coaches can help implement a company’s vision. An internal coach benefits an organization in three ways:

  1. They can quickly provide the team with the information or support they need.
  2. They can help the organization learn to be self-sufficient.
  3. They can quickly train new employees or leaders in the ways of the organization.)



#### Developers

The Developers are responsible for completing the items from the task list. They’re the ones building the product with guidance from the Product Manager and Scrum Coach. The Developers duties include:

  * Estimating the relative size of each task
  * Deciding how to complete the tasks within each Sprint
  * Finishing each task completely before moving on to the next



Although the Scrum Coach makes sure everyone is working within the Scrum framework, the Developers must still hold each other accountable. Because the Scrum framework gives the Developers the freedom to work as they see fit, it's their responsibility to create consistent value within each Sprint.

> **_Inspired_ Versus _Scrum_**
> 
> In _Inspired_ , Cagan discusses the importance of engineers to the Product Manager. The engineers, like Sutherland’s developers, are responsible for building the product. The engineers and the Product Manager should have a close, collaborative relationship in which they share ideas. The engineers will understand the product in more detail than the Product Manager, so they will be able to provide creative, realistic solutions to problems. This is similar to Sutherland’s ideas, in which the developers create the product while the Product Manager focuses on the big picture.
> 
> On top of the key positions, Cagan provides other roles that may be needed for product development, including marketing experts, researchers, analysts, and test engineers. Sutherland would probably be against these extra roles for two reasons: 1) All these duties should be performed by people on the original team and 2) the specialized roles would get in the way of collaboration. Instead, these people would just be part of the Developer team.

### Why Small Teams Are More Effective

Although you want your team to be dynamic and diverse, that doesn’t mean bigger is better. In fact, Sutherland argues that the bigger your team, the less effective they become. Ideally, he says that a team should consist of five to nine members. Adding extra members to your team will generate more problems than it fixes because the human brain can only hold so much information. More team members add more lines of communication, and our brains can’t keep up.

Furthermore, adding people to a project that is behind schedule will only slow it down even more. One reason is that it takes time to bring people up to speed, especially if the project is well underway.

> **Malcolm Gladwell and the Power of Small Teams**
> 
> In _The Tipping Point_ , Malcolm Gladwell argues that small groups have a stronger social influence than large groups. One reason for this is because of humans' limited emotional capacity. We’re only able to maintain meaningful relationships with a small number of people. In a business sense, this is why it's best to work in small teams. If you can actually have a relationship with every member of your team, you're more likely to work well together.
> 
> Gladwell shows that organizations work best when limited to 150 or fewer people. This is much larger than Sutherland’s suggested team size, but the idea behind it is similar. The human brain can only process so much information. Larger teams lead to less communication and more hierarchies, which can slow down progress.

#### Remove Specific Titles and Roles

Sutherland argues that one advantage of small teams is that you can more easily remove specialized roles and titles. He advises doing this because it will help communication flow more freely among team members. If each team member has a specific role or title, they tend to do things that only fit within that specialized role. Furthermore, they may be inclined to withhold their specialized knowledge in order to preserve the power they have within the team. Both of these lead to a less communicative, and thus, less effective team.

> **Transactive Memory**
> 
> Transactive memory is the idea that people who spend time together develop a specialized division of labor. In other words, each member of the group becomes a specialist in certain areas, and they rely on each other to remember and retrieve that particular information. You see this occur in couples, where one person knows how to fix the shower and the other is responsible for making the grocery list. But transactive memory is also helpful in work settings, as it reduces the memory load for each person and allows the group access to more information.
> 
> Although Sutherland recommends removing specialized roles, this is done to promote transactive memory within a team. Because team members are working together closely, they are more likely to share information. Because they don’t have specialized roles, they are less likely to withhold information.

### How to Fix the System

In a system that relies so heavily on teamwork, make sure you pay attention to how the team interacts and where team members tend to place blame when something goes wrong. When observing the mistakes or faults of others, it’s common to blame personality or disposition flaws rather than the situation. This phenomenon, called “Fundamental Attribution Error,” is common and can lead to disharmony, low morale, and arguments among teammates.

Sutherland claims that it’s not our inherent qualities but the system in which we work that dictates most of our actions. Instead of blaming individuals, the Scrum framework looks to find problems within the organizational structure and eliminate them. If there is something slowing the team down, it's up to the team to figure out why and find a solution. If there is a person struggling to complete a task on time, don’t complain to your coworkers or quietly grumble to yourself in the corner. Ask what the problem is. Offer to help them. Pointing fingers isn’t going to help the team get things done. Focus on fixing problems collectively.

> **Fundamental Attribution Error**
> 
> The fundamental attribution error is a long-recognized psychological bias that can negatively affect our personal lives and relationships as well as our professional ones. Here are some tips on how to avoid it:
> 
>   * **Find an honest reason:** If you find yourself judging another too harshly, come up with a situational reason a mistake may have occurred. This will help eliminate any negative thoughts.
> 
>   * **Remember the good things:** Fundamental attribution error usually occurs because of a pre-existing negative opinion of someone. Try to remember the good qualities about someone to help quell those negative feelings.
> 
>   * **Give the benefit of the doubt:** In general, assume people mean well, especially on the first occurrence of a mistake. Be sure to consider the circumstances, though. If a mistake is potentially harmful to others, giving the benefit of the doubt can be dangerous.
