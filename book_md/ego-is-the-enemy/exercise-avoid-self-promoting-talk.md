## Exercise: Avoid Self-Promoting Talk

Ego often drives people to talk about themselves in positive, self-promoting ways. But talk and action compete for the same finite resources: time and energy.

* * *

Think of a time when you spent an inordinate amount of energy on an ego-driven activity that didn’t advance your goals while convincing yourself that it did. (Perhaps you participated in online forums instead of working on your project, or planned what you would do with your success rather than doing the tasks needed to achieve it.) How did those activities delay your success?

How might your time have been better spent?

What might you tell yourself the next time you’re tempted to engage in such activities rather than work on your project? How can you redirect your ego so that you focus on what’s really important?
