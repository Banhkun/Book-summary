## Part 3: Recovering From Failure

Now that we’ve looked at how ego can get in the way of attaining and maintaining success, let’s look at how it can misguide you when you experience some form of defeat, as everyone must.

Failure will happen to each and every one of us in some form or another. You may be able to get through it and find success again, or it may defeat you for good. Whether or not your ego drives your reactions to setbacks will determine which outcome you realize.

Ego is especially dangerous in the _defeat_ stage of success for two reasons:

  1. Ego is especially difficult to ignore when it reacts to failure: Ego sees failure as a direct insult to your personal identity and instinctively takes over your emotions, **making it difficult for you to react rationally.**
  2. While ego makes all steps of life (aspiration, maintenance, and defeat) more difficult, **it will make _defeat_ permanent. **



However, a person who can meet failure with the proper attitude can turn it into eventual success. Simon Cowell, television personality and record producer, is an example of someone who faced multiple setbacks but powered through and remained successful because he figured out how to keep his ego in check.

Cowell entered the music industry by working in the mail room at EMI Music Publishing. In the early 1980s he branched out on his own and started a record company, which went bankrupt in 1989. He speaks of this experience as a defining moment: Through the 1980s, he had lived a lavish, ego-driven lifestyle where he spent too much money and partied too hard, but when his company failed, he lost almost everything he’d earned and had to move back in with his parents. He realized that he’d failed because he’d believed his own hype, and he resolved to do things differently from then on.

After that, he changed his attitude: Instead of chasing the trappings of success, he focused on doing the work. He became famous for his commitment to his career, his attention to detail, and his habit of seeking advice from people on a lower socio-economic level—taxi drivers and interns, for example—putting aside his ego that might otherwise prevent him from listening to such input.

By 2021, Cowell’s net worth had risen to $600 million and he’d become one of the most recognizable faces on television, intimately linked to the success of breakout shows including American Idol, the X Factor, and the “Got Talent” franchise. Had he let his failure defeat him or had he continued to seek superficial markers of success like fast cars, he likely would not have found such long-term success.

The following sections explore further how you can effectively manage your ego when handling failures so that you, too, can emerge from them stronger.

> **Develop a Growth Mindset**
> 
> Although Holiday doesn’t use the terms “growth mindset” or “fixed mindset,” his theories correspond to these well-known concepts. These two mindsets describe a person’s attitude in response to failure, and psychologists have long noted that consistently, **people who easily bounce back from failure do so because they’ve developed a growth mindset.**
> 
> Carol S. Dweck discusses these in depth in her book _Mindset_. As she outlines it, a person with a growth mindset believes they can improve their natural abilities through hard work and practice. In contrast, a person with a fixed mindset believes their abilities are unchangeable, and that whatever skills and intelligence they were born with establish limits for the rest of their lives.
> 
> A person’s mindset profoundly impacts how they respond to difficulties. Someone with a growth mindset sees setbacks as learning opportunities, while someone with a fixed mindset sees setbacks as confirmation that they can’t achieve their goal. Studies have shown that these traits are present in us even as children—when kids are given increasingly hard puzzles to solve, some will keep trying to solve the puzzles even when they’re defeated by them, believing that they’re capable of solving them if they just keep trying. Others, though, will give up once they run into difficulties, believing that they’re simply not capable of solving them. The first type of child has a growth mindset and the second has a fixed mindset.
> 
> A fixed mindset corresponds with an egotistical reaction to defeat—it can prevent future success for the same reasons Holiday outlines above. Someone who egotistically sees failure as a direct reflection of their identity has a fixed mindset and will be more likely to give up and allow that failure to become permanent.
> 
> Fortunately, Dweck argues that even if you have a tendency toward a fixed mindset, you can develop a growth mindset that will equip you with a better attitude toward failure. Many of the techniques and strategies that Holiday advises for overcoming failure are different ways that you can learn to see failures as opportunities for future growth (through a growth mindset) rather than as dead ends (through a fixed mindset).

### Turn Dead Time Into Alive Time

Holiday cautions that at some point, you’ll run into difficult times when things are not going well and it feels like life is on hold: _dead time_ , when your efforts feel wasted and pointless, or when you’re suffering the consequences of bad decisions. This might be a period of unemployment, a stint laid up in the hospital, or even prison.

When stuck in a period like this, you have a choice: endure it as dead time, or turn it into _alive time_ by using it to learn, grow, and prepare to be more productive after the dead time is over.

  * If your ego is bruised by your circumstances, it might drive you to be defensive, belligerent, or in denial. You’ll pass your days plotting your revenge or getting lost in distractions. When your dead time is up, you’ll have lost time to other people who’ve moved ahead with their lives. Your dead time will stay dead time. 
  * If, on the other hand, you can control your ego’s emotional reaction to your situation, you’ll be able to see opportunities in your circumstances, and you can use your time wisely so that you can emerge stronger and more prepared for the world. Your dead time will become alive time. 



President Jimmy Carter is an example of someone who was thrown into dead time after his reelection loss to Ronald Reagan in 1980 and used it to forge a new path forward. Instead of letting his ego fill him with self-pity or anger, he kept sight of his priorities (helping spread global peace) and started reaching out to people who could assist him. He gathered a group of capable people who shared his vision and opened the Carter Center, through which he continued to mediate peaceful solutions to international conflicts and advance human rights around the world, efforts for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

Because he turned his dead time into alive time, he was able to emerge from his defeat as a respected figure whose influence will be felt for generations.

> **How to Turn Dead Time Into Alive Time**
> 
> Holiday got the phrases “alive time” and “dead time” from advice given to him by bestselling author Robert Greene, who penned, among others, _The 48 Laws of Power_ and _The Laws of Human Nature_.
> 
> Greene introduced Holiday to these ideas when Holiday was stuck in an unfulfilling job, planning his next move. Greene advised him to spend the unproductive periods of his life learning and preparing for future productivity. Holiday then realized that the lower-level or dead-end jobs that we often take on at the beginning of our careers are, in fact, opportunities for us to grow (which also led him to his suggestion to “be a helper” earlier).
> 
> Greene’s book _The 48 Laws of Power_ contains a number of suggestions that might help you make the most of dead time, including:
> 
>   * Law 22 suggests you **surrender to failure** so that you can regroup and come back stronger.
> 
>   * Law 23 advises you **focus your efforts** , deciding which priorities are most important to you.
> 
>   * Law 25 suggests you **reinvent yourself** , first by becoming hyper-aware of who you are and how you appear to others, and then by adjusting your behavior to better suit your circumstances.
> 
> 


### Let Your Low Moment Transform You

Holiday notes that when you fail, you may hit “rock bottom,” where you’ve lost everything. During these times, you should reevaluate your life and your priorities.

When the world hands you failure, it tells you a truth. This might be something you already knew about yourself but didn’t want to admit (like that you rush into opportunities without evaluating the risks properly). Or it might be a truth about the world around us that you were denying (like that there’s just not enough demand for a product that you think is phenomenal).

Your ego may want to deny these hard truths. However, if your ego can’t admit, in a low moment, that your own deficiencies brought your troubles on you, you’ll be unable to learn from those troubles, grow, and prevent them from happening again.

> **Your Success Depends on Your Response to Failure**
> 
> Many psychologists and business experts argue, as Holiday does, that how you respond to failure determines how it will affect you long term. In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield boils it down to a formula: **Event + Response = Outcome**. This codifies the idea that how you respond to an event is as important as the event itself, and two different people can end up with very different results after having experienced the same setback if they respond differently.
> 
> Another management advisor, Ed Catmull, discusses how to embrace failure in his book _Creativity, Inc_. His main advice is to stop being afraid of failure, and recognize that **failure isn’t inherently bad—it’s a consequence of innovative work.** He urges people to normalize failure, and in fact, to expect it. That way, you’ll see it as merely a part of a larger process rather than an ending of the process.
> 
> Illustrating both of these principles, some CEOs who get fired end up heading another company, while others don’t. This is often determined in large part by how they react to getting fired (assuming, of course, that they weren’t dismissed for unethical reasons like stealing clients’ money). For example, after Jamie Dimon was fired as president of Citigroup, he didn’t allow his ego to dwell in anger or bitterness. Instead, he used his time wisely (turning dead time into alive time, in Holiday’s words)—he read widely, took up boxing to relieve his stress, and eventually reached out to the man who’d fired him to thank him for the good times they’d had together and to acknowledge the poor decisions he’d made that led to his dismissal.
> 
> In other words, he was able to put aside his own ego and face up to his mistakes. By reaching out and being willing to return to his industry in an honest way, he paved the path for his recovery—soon after his meeting, Dimon was appointed CEO of Bank One, brought the company to record profitability, and eventually merged it with JPMorgan Chase, ascending to the top role in the new conglomerate.
> 
> In contrast, other CEOs relieved of their command, including Ford’s Jacques Nasser, Hewlett-Packard’s Carly Fiorina, and Apple’s John Sculley, never again led a major company despite the fact that they were widely considered intelligent and capable leaders. None of them showed the willingness to reach out in an honest and open way or to make themselves available to their industry again in the way that Dimon did.

### Examine Your Mistakes

In a similar vein, Holiday advises that when you’re faced with great failure, you honestly assess the mistakes you made that got you there. He cautions that your ego wants to look only at what you did right, and therefore, makes it hard for you to look clearly at your own actions. However, if you’re unable to examine your mistakes, you’ll repeat those same errors and won’t emerge from your failures with renewed insight.

Further, he urges you to examine your mistakes even when they don’t trip you up; sometimes things might work out for you despite the fact that you made poor choices. In these situations, it’s tempting to ignore those poor choices and convince yourself that your success is well-earned, even though in truth you merely got lucky. But when things go well for you despite your mistakes, you need to honestly acknowledge the role luck played in your success, and work to correct your errors so they don’t trip you up next time—because luck will always run out.

Holiday points to the New England Patriots as an example of how you should examine your mistakes even when they work out well for you. In 2000, the Patriots picked Tom Brady as a back-up quarterback in the 6th round of the draft. When they discovered how valuable he actually was (leading them to a record nine Super Bowl appearances, six of them wins), they knew that their scouting processes needed improvement—having left him to the sixth round, they might easily have lost him to another team. Instead of ignoring their error because it worked out fine in the end, they set about examining and improving their operations so as to not let this kind of close call happen again.

> **Don’t Count on Luck**
> 
> Holiday advises that you face your mistakes even when good luck causes them to work out, because success due to luck isn’t stable. In _Fooled by Randomness_ , Nicholas Taleb also discusses this concept. Taleb cautions that a large part of a person’s success is often due to good fortune, but people tend to always attribute success to skill. This fallacy drives us to be blind to potential problems with a person's (or our own) strategy, leaving us vulnerable to bad fortune in the future and causing us to wrongly assess risk.
> 
> For example, if you have a habit of texting while driving but you haven’t had any accidents, you may attribute your clean driving record to skill. However, this attitude blinds you to the risks you take when you drive distractedly and leaves you more likely to have an accident in the future.
> 
> Further, if you were to _almost_ get in an accident as you texted while driving, you would be wise to examine your mistakes _then_ , even though those mistakes haven’t led you to disaster just yet.
> 
> This advice is another way to look at Holiday’s earlier advice to focus on _effort_ , not _outcome_ —in other words, focus on _process_ instead of _results_. If you focus on outcome only, then you’ll operate with a mindset of “the ends justify the means,” and you’ll only pay attention to mistakes if they hurt you—otherwise, you’ll ignore your mistakes, attribute your success to skill rather than the luck that’s truly behind it, and continue making the same mistakes until they take away all your success.
> 
> Holiday’s examination of the New England Patriots illustrates this theme. The team held themselves to a higher standard than simply the outcome of their choices. They correctly saw true success as getting the _process_ right, not just the _results_. People are able to do this when they don’t allow their ego to be satisfied with success at any cost, since success that comes from flawed processes will always prove temporary.

### Redefine Success

Holiday notes that because your ego likes recognition, it sometimes defines success based entirely on how much or how little recognition other people give you through honors, praise, awards, job titles, raises, and so on. But if you let your ego define success for you in this way, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment, because you can’t control how the world receives, judges, or acts upon your work.

If you define success based on recognition, then when your work is received poorly (as it inevitably will be at some point), your ego will fill you with anger and bitterness. Worse, if your ego fears a poor reaction, you may not go to the trouble of working on a project in the first place. Your ego asks, why bother?

If you allow your ego to drive your decisions in this way, you’ll deny yourself the opportunity to turn things around when you experience failure. Instead, if you view recognition, rewards, and rejections as peripheral elements of success, you’ll continue to work on your important projects for the sake of putting them out into the world, even when they’re ignored or poorly received, simply because you feel the world needs them. **Because you can only control your own actions, you should evaluate success through your actions alone, regardless of how your audience receives them: Focus on _efforts_ , not _outcomes_. **

> **Theories of Motivation**
> 
> Management experts have long questioned what will most effectively motivate people to do their best work—in other words, how do people measure success and what do they truly want to be rewarded with?
> 
> Clay Christensen takes up the topic in his book _How Will You Measure Your Life?_ , noting that while many jobs focus on incentives like job security, status, and compensation, these factors (what he terms _hygiene factors_) don’t make people feel properly fulfilled. Studies have shown that instead, so-called _motivators_ are what truly make people happy: things like challenges, responsibilities, learning opportunities, and the chance to make a meaningful contribution to the world.
> 
> Importantly, Christensen echoes Holiday’s advice and notes that _motivators_ are inherent in your work itself, while _hygiene factors_ are peripheral to your work. When you focus on motivators, the work itself determines your happiness, instead of the outcome determining your happiness.

### Cut Your Losses

Holiday warns that sometimes your ego can amplify failures you endure by not allowing you to stop when you’re behind. This happens when you start seeing your work as an extension of your identity. When your ego interprets threats to your _career_ as threats to your _person_ —to your status, to your reputation, to your value in the eyes of others—it wants to fight this failure at all costs. It wants you to throw all your energy and resources at the challenge, never admit that you were wrong, and never accept defeat. It wants you to bet everything on an outlandish scheme or break the rules in a last-ditch attempt to fix your failures—even though these methods are very likely what got you into trouble in the first place and will probably only increase your difficulties.

This is called the _sunk cost fallacy_ : When you’ve invested time, energy, and money into a project (sunk costs) and instead of admitting that those costs are irretrievable, you continue to throw good money after bad trying to make those costs mean something.

Sometimes the wiser decision is to cut your losses and move on to the next project. Everyone makes mistakes—for example, people misjudge market demand, expand businesses too quickly, invest in bad stocks, or aim for unrealistic goals. Then, their businesses fail, their stock portfolios dive, or they spend years chasing a too-lofty target they’re not cut out for (for example, aiming to be a rock star even if they have only mediocre musical ability).

To move past your losses so that they don’t define you for the rest of your career, you must control your ego, admit you messed up, and stop trying to fix these blunders. When faced with failure, determine honestly whether or not your errors are redeemable and ask yourself: Should I keep fighting for this? If I do, will I make it worse? Or should I let this go? If I do, can I emerge from this with my dignity intact, so that I can fight for something else another day?

> **Sunk Costs Trigger Our Emotions**
> 
> Psychologists and economists have long noted the effects of the sunk costs fallacy on human behavior. People get emotionally attached to money, time, or effort they’ve spent and don’t want to feel it’s been wasted, so they’ll spend lots more money, time, and effort trying to either recover their initial expenditure or make it feel worthwhile.
> 
> The sunk costs fallacy is one reason gamblers continue to throw money on the table after they’ve experienced losses. It also explains why people stay in bad or unsatisfying relationships for too long (Meg Jay explores this tendency in her book _The Defining Decade_ , pointing out that sunk costs have an especially strong hold over people who’ve chosen to move in together before getting engaged, because it becomes harder to extricate themselves from things like shared bills or pets).
> 
> It also explains why people won’t sell stock that’s on a downward trajectory, preferring to hold on to it hoping it will eventually regain its value, thereby justifying their decision to buy it in the first place as well as their decision to hold it while it sank. Nicholas Taleb explores this in _Fooled by Randomness_ , where he outlines some of the many reasons people make poor investment choices. Overall, he argues that people let their emotions guide their decisions because we are primarily driven by our primitive brain and therefore respond most strongly to fear and desire. This dovetails with Holiday’s argument of why our egos drive us to make myopic decisions. Both authors advise that you become aware of your emotional knee-jerk reactions and temper them with rational thought.

### Resist Feeling Hatred

Holiday discusses one additional way that your ego can make it difficult to recover from failure—succumbing to blame and anger. He acknowledges that when failure trips you up, your ego wants to hate someone for it because that puts the blame for your suffering on someone else. Unfortunately, hatred does nothing to release you from your failures. On the contrary,**hatred holds you to your failures longer.**

The paradox of hatred is that it accomplishes the exact opposite of what you hope it will accomplish. It exposes your bad side, which makes people lose sympathy for whatever difficulties you’ve endured. It also fills you with stress and unpleasant thoughts, which can be debilitating.

While it’s hard to “love your enemies,” the ability to do so is what separates great leaders from temporary ones. Hatred does more to destroy the one who is hating than the one who is hated because it’s debilitating—it will eat away at you with stress and unpleasant thoughts.

However, Holiday notes that love can be transformational. Even when you feel it’s undeserved, finding a way to love someone will allow you to get perspective on a situation and understand the forces at play that brought your failure about. You’ll resist placing blame on someone else and will be better able to see how you can emerge from your failure as a stronger person.

> **Tips for Moving On**
> 
> In his book _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ , Dale Carnegie discusses techniques for moving on after someone has wronged you. Like Holiday, he notes that holding a grudge will harm you more than it harms the other person because **it places a limit on your happiness—you won’t feel happy if they are also feeling happy.** It’s far better to let go of your anger so that you can move on.
> 
> Carnegie suggests three ways you can help yourself move on:
> 
>   * **Forgive and forget:** The fastest way to get over a hurt is to forgive the person and simply stop thinking about them. You’ll move on even faster if you can take it a step further and see some good that they did for you, and thank them for it.
> 
>   * **Immerse yourself in a larger cause:** When you’re involved in working toward a higher purpose, you're less sensitive to insults or wrongs because you’re thinking about something greater than yourself.
> 
>   * **Imagine yourself in their shoes:** We often blame other peoples’ shortcomings on negative personality characteristics, while blaming our own shortcomings on bad luck or circumstance. This is called _attribution error_. If you can get beyond this instinctive reaction, you can more clearly see what circumstances may have led the other person to act the way they did.
