## Part 1C: Attaining Success: How to Interact

As you strive for success, you’ll cross paths with many different people. Holiday discusses many ways that you can interact with others to help you further your progress toward your goals. He advises that you focus on keeping your ego under control as you navigate the world.

### Look for Teachers

In your quest to become a lifelong student, Holiday advises you to look for unusual sources of instruction—you can pay teachers or mentors for their guidance, but don't ignore the wealth of free instruction that’s available on virtually every subject.

  * Approach people in your industry who have become successful and ask them for help. People have a natural instinct to want to help others, and those who have found success are often happy to pass along their expertise. 
  * Study historical figures or people who have gone before you whom you look up to. The challenges they faced may hold lessons you can apply to your life. 



> **Seek Out a Mentor**
> 
> Many management experts have echoed Holiday’s advice to seek out people from whom you can learn, and in particular, when possible, to seek out mentors. A mentor is an experienced professional who helps a more inexperienced person in their career, offering informal guidance on a range of issues and taking a special interest in helping the more junior person advance.
> 
> In _The Power of Moments_ , Chip and Dan Heath explore what makes an effective mentor. They outline four things that a mentor should offer in order to push their mentee to best achieve their potential:
> 
>   * High standards: “I expect you to do well.”
> 
>   * Assurance: “I know that you can.”
> 
>   * Direction: “Here’s your next step.”
> 
>   * Support: “I’ll help you if you fail.”
> 
> 

> 
> The Heath brothers emphasize that a mentor must not protect their mentee from failure—the job of a mentor is to allow their mentee to fail and then to assist them afterward, so that they learn from that failure and it helps them grow.
> 
> In his book on networking, _Never Eat Alone_ , Keith Ferrazzi discusses several ways you can look for mentors. These include:
> 
>   * Working through an official mentoring program, either at your work or through a professional association
> 
>   * Asking your parents or older relatives to put you in contact with an experienced professional
> 
>   * Approaching business owners or prominent professionals in your local area
> 
> 


### Become a Teacher Also

To become an even better learner, Holiday advises you to become a _teacher_. This is because when you teach a skill or a piece of knowledge, you re-examine it from a different perspective and gain new insight. You must truly understand it from every angle in order to effectively communicate and explain it. For this reason, Holiday argues that Satriani benefited from his instruction of Hammett as much as Hammett did—through his lessons, Satriani honed his techniques and skills and went on to fill stadiums and sell millions of albums through his own music.

> **Learning by Teaching Is a Long-Acknowledged Tactic**
> 
> Many educators and psychologists agree with Holiday that when students teach concepts, they absorb them better themselves. They not only can remember them better later but can also apply them to other situations, indicating that they understand them more deeply.
> 
> This phenomenon has been called the “protégé effect,” by which students’ memory and understanding is improved when they explain a concept to someone else, not only because they need to retrieve it from their mind but also because they need to make it clear enough that someone else understands it, too. It’s an extension of another well-known theory called the “testing effect,” which helps students retain information by requiring them to retrieve it from their memory.

### Seek Out Three Levels of People

Holiday advises you actively seek out three types of people to regularly engage with:

  * A mentor or teacher from whom you can learn (someone above you)
  * A mentee or student whom you can teach (someone below you)
  * A colleague, partner, or competitor against whom you can challenge yourself (someone on your current level)



Each of these people will help you achieve success in different ways:

  * A mentor helps you suppress the ego that makes you resist improvement.
  * A mentee helps you conquer the fear that makes you doubt yourself.
  * A colleague or competitor wards off the laziness that might encourage you to coast on your existing skills. (Shortform note: Many management experts have noted the importance of viewing competitors as sources of inspiration. Timothy Gallwey discusses this in his book _The Inner Game of Tennis_ , where he notes that a competitor can push you to sharpen your skills, thereby making you a better player (or worker). In this way, competition is indistinguishable from collaboration.)



> **Hire Someone Better Than You**
> 
> Some experts suggest not only interacting with people who are better than you in some way, but also hiring them if you have the opportunity.
> 
> Stacey Cunningham, president of the New York Stock Exchange, argues there are several reasons for hiring people with more skills than you:
> 
>   * They’re a source of information that can keep you learning new things. Not only does this make you a better performer, it also keeps your work interesting and exciting.
> 
>   * They can fire up your competitive drive, which can keep you motivated.
> 
>   * They can allow you the freedom to pursue higher challenges: If you can trust that your team members are competent, you’ll feel comfortable delegating responsibilities to them so that you can explore other avenues of growth (either for your company or for yourself—for example, taking a class or making yourself available for speeches).
> 
> 

> 
> Cunningham notes that while hiring someone better than you is counter-intuitive because it inherently offends your ego (which wants you to be the top dog) and challenges your need to be fully in control of your underlings, in the long run, it’s the wiser move because it strengthens the whole organization as well as your own leadership.
> 
> Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar and president of Walt Disney Animation Studios, is an example of someone who lives this advice. As he explains in his book _Creativity, Inc_., he makes a habit of hiring people who are smarter than he is—not only because their innovations and productivity benefit the company, but also because by conquering his fear of people more qualified, he’s able to control his ego, which allows him to see people not as threats but as opportunities.

### Be a Helper

Holiday notes that because ego is not humble, it might prevent you from accepting a humble job in which your tasks are primarily designed to help another person while you yourself get little or no compensation or credit. An unpaid internship is a common example of this kind of position.

However, Holiday argues that these helper roles can be highly beneficial at the beginning of a career or a new project, when our skills and knowledge are undeveloped (or even outdated and wrong, if most of those skills and knowledge came from school books). **Humble jobs are an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of an industry from a unique angle and increase skills that will propel you to success later.**

Many successful business leaders started in internships or in lower-level positions that taught them many of the basics of the business. For example, Ursula Burns, Dennis Muilenburg, Mary Barra, and Steve Jobs, who served as CEOs of Xerox, Boeing, General Motors, and Apple, respectively, each started their careers as interns.

Holiday advises that to be an effective helper:

  * Help your boss be creative: Come up with innovative ideas for your boss to execute. Ignore your ego’s desire to take the credit—let your boss have the credit.
  * Foster collaboration: Introduce like-minded people to each other.
  * Do tasks others don’t want to: Seek out grunt work and learn from it.
  * Increase efficiencies: Look for ways to eliminate wasted time or resources. Come up with methods to streamline processes that benefit everyone.



> **Be a Giver, Not a Taker**
> 
> Another way to think about being a helper is that you should be a _giver_ instead of a _taker_ , a concept that Adam Grant fleshed out in his book _Give and Take_. Grant argues that people who give freely of their time, effort, knowledge, experience, and skills end up more successful than those who mainly try to reap the benefits of other peoples’ time, effort, and so on.
> 
> This holds true because in a socially connected world like ours, what goes around comes around. When you help someone else, they’ll want to help you in return later. Further, because it’s impossible to know who might be in a position to help us later in our careers, it’s best to offer help widely.
> 
> Further, these kinds of helper roles (especially in the form of internships) are increasingly recognized as an important step in a career. Surveys suggest that approximately 75% of college grads take on an internship at some point, and that many of these translate into full-time employment. Experts recommend that to make the most of an internship, you do many of the things that Holiday and Grant advise: seek information, help others whenever you can, ask lots of questions, and tackle jobs without being asked.

### Keep Your Temper

Holiday notes that sometimes you will be tempted to lose your temper—you’ll work for humiliating bosses, work beside vindictive colleagues, or interact with rude customers—but if you let your ego get the better of you and lose your temper, you can destroy your burgeoning career.

When you’re insulted or demeaned, your ego will want you to tell someone off or demand respect. Instead, do nothing. Holiday advises that you endure it, reminding yourself to keep your eye on the long game. Ignore this temporary difficulty. Brush it off, work harder, and stay in the game. **You can’t succeed if you get kicked out of the game.**

For example, if your manager constantly gives you a hard time for taking too long of a lunch break even when you hardly take a lunch break at all, remind yourself not to get distracted by such a small issue and to focus instead on learning what you can from the position so that you can eventually get a better position with a different manager.

> **Assertive Versus Aggressive**
> 
> While Holiday seems to advocate that you react somewhat passively to others’ aggression, most psychiatrists advise you to react with _assertiveness_ , which is the middle ground between aggression and passivity. Being assertive means standing up for yourself while being respectful of both your own needs and the other person’s. Being aggressive means putting your own needs ahead of another person’s, and often involves threats, rudeness, or disrespect. Sometimes people confuse assertiveness with aggression and out of fear of coming across aggressively, react passively instead. Unfortunately, allowing others to push you around often leads to stress, anxiety, and unhappiness.
> 
> Holiday’s point, though, is that sometimes you must be passive for a period of time until you gain enough influence that you no longer have to put up with bullying. Most importantly, you shouldn’t ever lose your temper, even if this means leaning toward passivity at times.
