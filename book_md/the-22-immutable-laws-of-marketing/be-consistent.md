## Be Consistent

While focusing your _message_ is important, so is focusing your _product offerings_. If you concentrate your effort on positioning your product as the best (or one of the best) in its category and building a marketing campaign around that product, consumers will know what to expect from your brand. By contrast, if you change your offerings or your strategy, your customers won’t know what to expect—and they’ll turn to a more familiar alternative. Use the following laws to maintain your consistency.

### Law #11: Use a Different Brand Name for Each Category

Over time, as the number of companies in a market shrinks, the category tends to divide into more specific categories. For example, what was once a single “computer” category eventually divided into mainframes, minicomputers, personal computers, laptops, and notebooks. Even popular music evolved from one general category into the multiple categories, including jazz, R&B, dance, latin, country, and pop. Each new category then develops its own hierarchy of brands. **If a market leader wants to enter one of these emerging categories, it needs a new brand name for that category.** Although it seems logical to extend the same, successful brand name to a new product, doing so confuses customers and hurts the company’s credibility (more on this in Law #13). Customers have come to associate the existing brand name with a specific attribute (Law #5), so the company needs a different brand name to link to an appropriate word for the new category.

For example, Volkswagen found success with its Beetle in the small car category, but the company flailed when it tried to extend its dominance to categories for bigger and faster cars with the Vanagon, the Cabriolet, and the Scirocco—all under the Volkswagen brand. As a result, Volkswagen lost a huge portion of its market share. By contrast, when Honda decided to enter the luxury car market, it created the Acura, which allowed Honda to maintain its existing dominance while Acura developed a distinct reputation in its own category. Ultimately, Honda and Acura became the market leaders in two different categories.

### Law #12: Consider the Long Term

Like many things in life, when it comes to marketing, the short-term effects of an action can be the opposite of the long-term effects. For example, when stores promote price cuts, their sales jump in the short term, but in the long term, they suffer because customers learn to wait for a sale instead of buying items at their regular prices. **Smart marketers must resist being swayed by short-term benefits and diligently consider the long-term effects of their actions.** Companies benefit more from longevity than from short-lived sales boosts.

Top beer companies Budweiser, Miller, and Coors endured long-term sales declines after chasing the light beer craze and introducing light versions of their products. Miller High Life had seen its sales grow significantly each year until it introduced Miller Lite. Five years after launching Miller Lite, sales for Miller High Life had nearly tripled—but then sales steadily declined for the following 13 years, falling below where they’d been before launching the light beer. Michelob faced a similar fate, with the sales of _all_ of its offerings (including the original as well as the light beer) eventually dropping lower than the sales the original Michelob had brought before the company introduced the light version.

### Law #13: Don’t Extend Your Brand to Other Categories

The beer companies in the last example lacked long-term perspective in one particular effort: line extension. Line extension is when a company with a successful product in one category tries to extend its success by launching additional products in other categories under the same brand name. For example, Heinz tried to leverage its position as the market leader in ketchup by introducing Heinz baby food. If you just thought, “Heinz _baby food_?!” then you demonstrated exactly why line extension doesn’t work. **The credibility you build in one market doesn’t necessarily transfer to other product categories.**

As Law #5 dictates, focusing your marketing message is critical because it creates a connection in consumers’ minds between your product and a single characteristic. Alternatively, if you try to be everything to everyone, you’ll end up being nothing to anyone. The same goes for your products: You’ll be more successful creating a strong association between your brand and a single product, and you’ll dilute the power of that association if you tether more products to the brand name. Put another way, **the public can only hold one association in their heads—and if you try to claim more associations, they lose any connection to your brand entirely.**

Market leaders seldom have line extensions:

  1. It’s more feasible to maintain market dominance if your company isn’t spread thinly over multiple product lines. Market leaders know that **it’s better to do well in one market than to perform poorly in many markets.**
  2. The market leader’s brand name often becomes synonymous with the product itself, which would obviously create problems if you tried to stick that brand name on other products. Imagine if someone asked you for the Kleenex, but they meant a Kleenex-brand _soap_ instead of a _tissue_. It just doesn’t work. 



Despite the perils of line extension, companies violate this law more than almost any other in this book because line extension happens almost effortlessly:

  1. **Companies are lured by short-term sales boosts** that line extensions often create—but, as we saw with the beer example in the last section, companies typically end up losing money in the long term. 
  2. **Line extension requires less money** than launching a product under a new brand name. 
  3. **Line extensions feel like a safer way to enter** the market if a company isn’t early enough to either be the leader (Law #1) or the opposite (Law #10). 



### Law #14: Sacrifice for Success

As many of these laws illustrate, it takes discipline and sacrifice to run a successful marketing campaign. Specifically, Specifically, there are three areas where it’s essential to sacrifice certain products, messages, and ideas in order to maintain a narrow, targeted focus:

1)**Product line:** As discussed in Law #13, **more products and services do not equal more profits because they dilute customers’ association with your brand**. Customers are more likely to come to you if they know they can unequivocally rely on you for _one thing_ than if you offer a smattering of _everything_.

For example, Federal Express dominated domestic shipping because the company focused on overnight service. As long as Federal Express claimed to be the leader of overnight service, it thrived. However, when the international shipping market expanded, Federal Express bought an international cargo firm to try to compete with companies like DHL, the market leader in international shipping. In doing so, Federal Express made two critical errors: It abandoned its focus on being the leader in overnight domestic service, and it didn’t replace “overnight” with a new association. Within two years, the company’s efforts to offer international shipping had cost the organization $1.1 billion.

2)**Target market:** Marketers mistakenly assume that targeting a wider audience in their ad campaigns will expand their customer base. However, your _marketing target_ (the audience your marketing message is meant to resonate with) is not your _customer base_ (the people who buy your products). Focus leads to success. **The most successful brands target a very specific demographic in their marketing—and that success leads to a much more diverse customer base.** Targeted messages are more successful in general, which raises a brand’s profile in the market, leading to a larger customer base.

For example, even though smokers were predominantly men, cigarette companies have often featured both men and women in their ads, hoping to attract more women to their products. By contrast, Marlboro not only targeted men, but it used images of the _manliest_ type of men: cowboys. As a result, Marlboro became the international market leader for cigarettes—and in the United States, the company led in sales among both men _and women_.

3) **Constant change:** Resist the temptation to constantly change your marketing strategy in an attempt to follow the changing market. If you change often, you’ll lose focus and weaken the association you’ve created in the public’s mind. Instead, **stick to the strategy that has been serving you well.** For example, White Castle has offered the same square sliders for almost 100 years—in fact, the fast food chain didn’t even add a cheeseburger to its menu until more than 40 years after its founding. And the strategy worked well: White Castle trailed just behind McDonald’s in revenues at the time this book was published.
