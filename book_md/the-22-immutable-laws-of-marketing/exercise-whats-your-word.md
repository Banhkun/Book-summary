## Exercise: What’s Your Word?

Reflect on how effectively you’re using the laws of focus and chosen attributes in your marketing.

* * *

What word have you chosen for marketing your product or service? If you don’t have a single word, what’s your main marketing message?

If you don’t have a single word, how could you boil your message down to a word?

How does your word compare to your competitors’ words? (For example, does another brand have a similar word? Do your competitors’ words address the same aspect, such as the targeted audience or services offered?)

Reflect on the word you’ve chosen. How important do you think this attribute is to your customers, and why?
