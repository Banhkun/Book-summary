## Be Strategic About Your Overall Marketing Plan

Aside from the details of your marketing campaign—such as your word and your primary message to consumers—be strategic with your overarching tone and approach. Use these laws to consider the big picture of your marketing plan.

### Law #15: Turn Your Negatives Into Positives

Despite all your effort to choose an attribute and connect it with your brand, you can’t help it if your competitors attach a different, negative attribute to your name. However, all is not lost: When competing brands and consumers call out something negative about your product, acknowledge it and turn it into a positive. Just as you need to acknowledge your position on the market ladder (Law #8), **you must acknowledge widely held beliefs about your product—especially negative ones.** Whereas people are often skeptical of positive claims, when companies make negative admissions about their products, the public generally accepts them as facts.

If you try to deny the negative—especially when it’s a widely acknowledged fact—you’ll lose credibility. The challenge is to **find a way to show that the negative attribute implies other positive attributes.** For example, Scope mouthwash claimed “good-tasting” as an attribute because it was common knowledge that its competitor, Listerine, had an awful taste. That put Listerine in a tough position: If the company tried to deny that the product tasted bad, it would lose credibility with consumers. Instead, the firm embraced the negative with the tagline, “The taste you hate twice a day.” This implied that the product’s terrible taste must mean it’s a powerful germ killer, and it encouraged customers to use the product despite its taste because it was good for them.

This strategy has saved numerous companies from crises, but it must be used carefully. Consider these two caveats:

  1. **The negative must be commonly known among consumers—** in other words, the negative must be a given, and that allows you to build upon it. If customers aren’t already familiar with the negative, you’ll either be calling attention to it or you’ll end up confusing them. 
  2. **Once you’ve established the negative, immediately pivot to the positive.** The point is not to apologize for the negative, but rather to use it as a prop for your message. 



### Law #16: Focus on Big, Bold Moves

In marketing, the only way to make headway against your competitors is to focus on individual, impactful strikes. The cumulative effect of countless small efforts won’t move the needle much—instead, **focus on finding opportunities to make a bold move that makes a big impression.** Your competitor may have just one weak spot, and you should direct all of your energy toward exploiting it. Such opportunities may be few and far between, but when you find them, capitalize on them. This means that your company’s top managers need to be on the front lines, aware of what’s happening in the marketplace, and intricately involved in the marketing process so that they can be ready to seize opportunities when they arise.

At the time of this book’s publication, Coca-Cola was marketing Coca-Cola Classic as well as New Coke—and the company was struggling to keep its lead over Pepsi. Ad campaigns tried different slogans, from “We have a taste for you” to “Catch the Wave” to “You can’t beat the feeling.” The firm needed to make a bold move to regain its footing. When it came down to it, Coca-Cola’s only ammo was its strong association with the phrase the “Real Thing.” The brand hinged on being the original cola, and the authors suggest that the only way to reclaim that position was to drop New Coke and put all its effort into promoting Coca-Cola Classic as the Real Thing.

### Law #17: Plan for Unpredictability

Marketing plans are often based on some assumptions about the future, but there’s an inherent risk of these plans backfiring if competitors do something unexpected, such as introducing a disruptive innovation. No matter how closely you watch the market and how thoroughly you study market research, **there’s no way to accurately predict the future unless you’re also writing your competitor’s plans.** In fact, market research can often lead you in the wrong direction, because it focuses only on what’s worked well in the _past_ and has no way of predicting the _future_.

Naturally, you don’t want to walk into the future blindly, or wind up winging it every step of the way, so there are ways to create flexible, more reliable plans:

  * **Watch long-term trends.** Granted, Law #14 warns against chasing fads and constantly changing your strategy—but there is a difference between fleeting fads and long-term trends (more on this in Law #21). For example, in the early ‘90s, a healthy eating trend had been gaining traction for years. Although ConAgra had previously introduced low-fat and low-sodium foods through line extensions, the company took advantage of the health-food trend and successfully launched the brand Healthy Choice. However, there is one caveat to consider when you’re following trends: Don’t extrapolate the trend and assume that its influence will reach every corner of the market or forever change the industry. In other words, although trends have longevity, be somewhat conservative in projecting a trend’s reach and endurance. 
  * **Expect change.** Change is inevitable, so although you can’t predict the future, you can safely assume that it will look different from the present. 
  * **Build flexibility into your company.** From executives to marketers to product designers, your organization must be built to adapt quickly and agilely to a changing market. (Shortform note: For an in-depth look at how Netflix adapted and thrived in a rapidly changing environment, read our summary of No Rules Rules.)



Most importantly, **come up with a short-term _plan_ and a long-term _direction_**. Your short-term marketing plan is built around a word or concept that sets your brand apart from the competition; the shorter scope requires less forecasting and fewer chances of disruption from unpredictability. Meanwhile, your long-term marketing direction creates a program that builds upon that word or concept, which provides guidance for future short-term plans without committing to concrete details that could be upended.
