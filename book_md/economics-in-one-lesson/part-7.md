## Part 7: Miscellaneous

A few fallacies don’t fit into any broad categories, but they are still critical to understand and are relevant to the modern economy.

### Destruction Doesn’t Stimulate New Business

**Fallacy:** Destruction—for instance, storm damage or war—requires repair, which leads to a net economic gain (the broken-window fallacy).

**Reality:** Destruction diverts money from discretionary spending to obligatory spending to repair the damage.

One common fallacy in economics is the broken window fallacy, which says that destruction leads to recovery, that recovery creates a boost to the economy. Like the other fallacies we’ve discussed, **this mistaken view results ignores the invisible costs** of recovery. To illustrate this, imagine that someone throws a brick through a bakery window, and the bakery owner has to pay $250 to replace the window. As a result, the glass repair person will get $250 that he wouldn’t have otherwise had, and, if he uses it to buy a new bike, the bike shop owner will have $250 that he wouldn’t have had. On and on it goes, as the money continues to change hands.

Per the broken-window fallacy, people look at the destruction of the baker’s window and see a net positive effect, as the money cycles through the community. However, this view overlooks the invisible victims of that destruction. The baker had planned to use that money to buy a new suit. Now, the tailor has $250 less than he would have if the window hadn’t been broken, and the stores where the tailor would have spent that money are losing out on his business, and so on. In reality,**the broken window didn’t stimulate any new business—it just shifted how that money was spent.**

The tailor’s plight is a secondary consequence. People overlook secondary consequences because they’re not apparent; the destruction of the window makes the tailor’s role invisible to everyone but the baker. **The fallacy shows an incomplete picture by focusing on the $250 _gained_ by the window repair person, whereas a complete picture also reveals the $250 _lost_ by the tailor.** Ultimately, the destruction causes an equal gain and loss, merely diverting the demand.

#### Applying the Broken-Window Fallacy to the Postwar Economy

**Fallacy:** Postwar recovery from wartime destruction stimulates the economy.

**Reality:** Postwar recovery doesn’t create new demand, but rather diverts consumer demand to goods and services needed to repair wartime damages.

The broken-window fallacy is one of the most ubiquitous fallacies in economics, taking on countless forms. For example, after World War II, there was a surge of demand for car manufacturing, home building, and the production of other goods that had been halted during the war. **Many people believe that wartime economic damage—via literal destruction of property or damage to industries that lose business during war—leads to a recovery that stimulates the economy.**

However, that view fails to distinguish between _need_ and _demand_ :

  * **Need does little to stimulate new business, because it merely diverts consumers’ demand** from some goods to others. Just as the baker’s broken window diverted his $250 from the tailor to the glass repair person, a postwar boom in home building diverts resources that consumers would have spent on other goods. Similarly, production capacity and manpower required to meet postwar needs are diverted away from other businesses. The destruction of war doesn’t _add_ to the country’s jobs or wealth, it simply _directs_ those resources toward wartime and postwar needs, which inherently takes those resources away from other industries. 
  * **Demand is a boon to the economy because it’s characterized by having purchasing power to buy that good _in addition to—_ rather than _instead of—_ other goods.** Purchasing power is not only measured in the amount of money a person or country has, but also the value of that money, considering inflation. Printing more money creates a larger amount of money, but it decreases each dollar’s value and, thus, does not increase purchasing power. 



When people mistake need for demand, they’re failing to see the big picture by confusing a _diversion_ of demand for _increased_ total demand. If you zoom in on one industry or another, you’ll see greater business activity, but you ignore the other groups of people who face only destruction in the wake of the war.

### Inflation Reduces Consumers’ Purchasing Power

**Fallacy:** Inflation puts more money in the hands of consumers, which boosts purchasing power, stimulates the economy, and supports full employment.

**Reality:** Inflation reduces consumers’ purchasing power by raising the prices of goods and decreasing the value of each dollar.

In the policies we’ve discussed so far, we’ve seen that every dollar that goes to one effort is a dollar taken away from something else. In order to get a complete picture of the effects of various policies, we must consider not just the _allocation_ of money, but also the _value_ of money, which varies based on inflation.

**Inflation is the result of the government taking on a cost that it can’t pay or doesn’t want to pay with tax dollars, so it simply prints more dollar bills.** Many people mistakenly believe that more physical dollars equates to more wealth, and they often promote inflation as a way to:

  * Make consumers wealthier
  * Stimulate an industry
  * Create full employment
  * Pull the country out of a depression



However, this view confuses _money_ with _wealth_. Money is just a medium for bartering goods. On the other hand, **wealth is the value of everything that is produced and consumed, meaning that wealth can’t be increased without increasing the production of goods.** Inflation doesn’t increase production, but rather the amount of money circulating.

To illustrate the effects of inflation, consider this example:

  1. The government prints extra money to pay war contractors.
  2. The prices of the war contractors’ goods increase, which raises the incomes of the contractors and their employees, whom we’ll call Group A.
  3. With their increased incomes, the contractors and employees then spend more money on goods and services.
  4. The higher demand enables the merchants who offer those goods and services—Group B—to raise their prices.
  5. With their increased profits, Group B spends more money on goods and services.
  6. The merchants of those goods and services—Group C—raises their prices in response to the increased demand.
  7. With their increased profits, Group C spends more money on goods and services from other merchants, Group D. 



This effect continues to ripple out until it has reached everyone in the country. Eventually, everyone reaches a higher income level—however, **since prices rise proportionately to the rise in incomes, collective wealth does not grow.** Furthermore, the groups whose incomes increase early in the process have the opportunity to use their money to buy more goods before price hikes catch up, while others have to deal with rising prices before the pay raise reaches them. This is what the discrepancy looks like for the example above:

  * Group A gains a 30 percent income increase before any prices have begun to rise. 
  * Group B gains a 20 percent income increase by the time prices have risen 10 percent on average. 
  * Group C gains a 10 percent income increase by the time prices have risen 15 percent on average.
  * Group D sees no income increase by the time prices have risen 20 percent on average. 



If inflation only continues for a few years, the rise in incomes and prices eventually equal out among all groups—but Group D never regains what it lost to high prices during inflation.

Additionally, **because of the common confusion between money and wealth, inflation allows the government to deceive taxpayers about the true costs of projects paid with deficit spending.** People measure monetary worth by dollar amount—they know that their paycheck is $2,000 and their house cost $250,000. However, when inflation changes the value of each dollar, people may not grasp that their wealth has decreased despite the fact that their paycheck is now $2,400.

If the government pays for a public works project with deficit spending instead of taxes, it can veil the consequences we discussed in Chapter 4, including decreasing the public’s purchasing power through taxation. However, the government will eventually have to repay the debt by imposing heavy taxes, or else it will let inflation take hold, which is also punishing to consumers. In this way, inflation is like another form of taxation, because it reduces consumers’ purchasing power—but, as our example illustrated, it is far more taxing on some groups than others.

Inflation attempts to _increase_ workers’ purchasing power by putting more money into their pockets, so that they can buy more goods. However, **inflation only serves to raise production costs through increasing the cost of labor, which raises prices on goods and ultimately _decreases_ workers’ purchasing power**, because the same amount of money buys fewer goods.

### Saving Increases National Wealth

**Fallacy:** Saving money doesn’t benefit national productivity and wealth because it’s not being spent directly with businesses.

**Reality:** Saving money in banks or through investments increases national productivity and wealth.

As we’ve discussed, when consumers spend money on goods and services, they are supporting that business, the wages of its employees, and its productivity. **Some economists have stated, then, that saving money deprives the economy of the boost that spending creates—but this incorrectly assumes that savings sit idly in a vault.**

In reality, people either save money through investing it or putting it into a savings account. Investments directly support industry by injecting money into a business and enabling it to buy capital (such as factories and machinery) to increase production. Banks use deposited money to fund loans for businesses, which enable those businesses to also invest in capital. In either scenario, **savings increases the capacity for production** , which increases employment and collective wealth.

In fact, **savings does more to increase production capacity than direct spending does.** To illustrate this, consider the difference between two brothers who receive inheritances that provide each one $100,000 per year. The first brother, Adam, spends on gifts, luxuries, and services that not only use up all of his cash, but also some of his capital. After several years, Adam is broke and has no money left to support the economy or himself. By contrast, the other brother, Brian, spends $50,000 a year and divides the rest between investments and a savings account. By the time Adam has gone through all of his money, Brian’s investments have grown his income, which allows him to continue supporting productivity and employment through his savings and further investments.

**If a large portion of the population suddenly stopped saving and began spending that money on goods instead, the increased demand would raise the price of consumer goods** , and the decreased investment in production would lower the price of capital goods. In the short term, the job losses in capital goods industries would increase unemployment; in the long term, this shift would reduce overall production.

#### Hoarding Money Doesn’t Cause Economic Depressions

Often, people believe that saving money does nothing for the economy because they are thinking of saving as hoarding money—as in, stashing cash in shoeboxes and under mattresses. This kind of saving typically happens after an economic downturn, when people are reluctant to spend or invest because:

  1. They worry that the economic recovery could relapse, and they want to conserve their money in case they lose their jobs. 
  2. They see how the downturn made prices drop, and they expect the prices to continue falling, so they are waiting for goods to get even cheaper before they buy. 



Similarly, banks hold money without lending or investing it only in response to an economic downturn, when they fear that the economic instability makes potential investments too risky. **People often blame cash hoarding for _causing_ and _prolonging_ economic depressions, but, in reality, it is the _result_ of economic depressions**—the real cause is instability created by government policies. Cash hoarding accounts for such a small percentage of the total money in the country that its impact on the economy is generally insignificant.

#### Interest Rates Balance Savings and Investment

Interest rates equalize savings and investments in the same way that prices equalize supply and demand. Interest rates are simply the price of loaned capital. **When savings rise, banks can offer lower interest rates to borrowers, which enables more businesses to take out loans in order to invest in capital.**

On the other hand, fears of high interest rates often raise concerns that companies will be unable to borrow and invest in improving production, and that this will reduce output, employment, and collective prosperity. In response, the government may impose policies that artificially lower interest rates—but the impacts of this tampering are the same as price-fixing:

  1. **Demand for loans increases** among businesses, because the interest rates are so affordable.
  2. **Demand for capital increases** , because more companies have loans to invest. 
  3. **Supply of capital decreases** , because companies buy more capital with their loans.
  4. **Savings decrease** , because low interest rates disincentivize savings. 



Additionally, the only way for the government to create artificially low interest rates is to substitute real savings with bank credit or newly created dollars. As discussed in the last chapter, creating money brings inflation, which lowers the value of the money being borrowed. When lenders see the value of money decreasing, they raise interest rates to compensate for the fact that the money they lend will be less when they get it back. In other words, **policies that artificially _lower_ interest rates eventually lead to _higher_ interest rates.**

### Final Thoughts

The policies we’ve reviewed—from tariffs to rent control—illustrate the harm that can be done by looking only at the short-term impacts of a policy on one particular group of people, and neglecting to recognize the long-term effects on the entire economic system. With this in mind, here are some final thoughts:

  * **A policy shouldn’t be written off just because it brings some negative consequences** —rather, those consequences simply need to be recognized and weighed in the decision-making process. For example, sometimes the benefits of taking out a loan outweigh the consequences of incurring that debt. 
  * **Many fallacies support policies that don’t stand up to common sense.** For example, it’s illogical that launching unnecessary public works projects is more productive than it is wasteful.
  * **Division of labor complicates economic policies.** If not for division of labor, each family would consume what it produced, and any changes to either output or consumption would have direct effects on the other. By contrast, division of labor makes each producer (who is simultaneously a consumer) want the prices of _her own_ goods to be as high as possible, and the prices of _other_ goods to be as low as possible. As we’ve seen, natural competition among producers keeps everyone’s self-interest in check—unless the government interferes with some policy that artificially alters the natural balance.
  * **Any change that benefits one group—or even society as a whole—will almost inevitably hurt some group of workers** , at least temporarily. For example, if crime suddenly dropped nationwide, unemployment would rise among lawyers, judges, police, and others employed in the criminal justice system. 



The second edition of this book was published in 1978, three decades years after the original. The author reflects on how the policies he explores have been pursued in the intervening decades, and he concludes that **not only are the harmful policies still being imposed, but they are more deeply embedded into the economic system of the United States and many other countries in the world.**
