## Part 2: Maximizing Production Levels Increases National Wealth

Many policies use various schemes to save jobs, increase employment, or increase wages. However, the ultimate goal should be to increase production levels, because more output creates larger profits for businesses, enabling them to expand production, hire more workers, and/or raise wages.

### Technology Doesn’t Kill Jobs

**Fallacy:** Labor-saving technology reduces jobs and, thus, collective wealth.

**Reality:** Labor-saving technology increases productivity and collective wealth, which often leads to an increase in employment.

For centuries, people have mistakenly blamed labor-saving machinery for eliminating jobs. The relationship between labor-saving equipment and employment seems like a simple equation: If a machine produces the same number of goods with half the manpower, then it eliminates half of the production jobs. However, that doesn’t tell the whole story. As in other policies we’ve discussed, the fallacy overlooks the indirect effects.

Let’s examine how machinery affects employment in the case of a coat company that buys a coat-making machine that requires just half the labor otherwise needed. On one hand, the company could choose to keep all of its employees and simply use the machines to increase production; in this case, there’s no loss in employment, and the company sees an increase in profits. On the other hand, **if company leaders fire half of the coat-making employees, there are several ways that the lost jobs can be offset, both within and outside of the company** :

  1. The company’s purchase of the machine pays the wages of the people who build the machine. 
  2. With the savings in labor costs, the company could expand, which would create new jobs. 
  3. The company could use the increased profits to invest in another business, which would pay wages in that business.
  4. The company leaders could pocket the increased profits, and use the money for their own personal spending, which would pay wages for those merchants.



There is another layer to this scenario: If other coat companies begin buying machines in order to stay competitive, it will drive down the price of coats, which reduces companies’ profits and employment. In this situation, there are two possibilities:

  1. **Shoppers buy more coats, which compensates for the lower price-per-coat.** High coat sales may even push the company to expand production, creating more jobs. 
  2. Shoppers buy the same number of coats as usual, but they keep more cash in their pockets because of the price markdown. In this case, **instead of _company profits_ offsetting eliminated coat-making jobs, _consumer savings_ do.**



Overall, **labor-saving machines raise production rates, economic well-being, and standard of living—and an increase in employment generally results from those effects.** The exception is in developing countries, in which outdated machinery requires an immense amount of manpower to accomplish basic tasks, resulting in full employment.

#### The Effect on Labor Unions

**If labor-saving machinery kills jobs—as the fallacy dictates—then the logical way to maximize employment is to perform all work as inefficiently as possible.** That is the approach that labor unions have taken, as they’ve developed make-work rules and featherbedding practices that are designed to protect their members’ jobs.

These practices require a project to hire more workers than necessary, or they limit workers’ efficiency and productivity, thus increasing the number of workers or hours to complete a project. For example, the theater union may require every stage production to hire people who move scenery—even for plays that have no scenery. Or, the painters union may prohibit the use of paint-spraying guns, so that workers have to use a paint brush, which is significantly less efficient.

### Spreading the Work Decreases Productivity and Employment

**Fallacy:** Spread-the-work practices lead to higher employment.

**Reality:** Spread-the-work practices decrease productivity and employment levels.

**The fallacy that efficiency kills jobs—and that inefficiency leads to higher employment—leads to labor union practices that spread the work among as many people and over as many hours as possible.** The fallacy is predicated on the belief that there is only a finite amount of work to be done, and thus it must be shared strategically to maximize employment.

We’ll look at two spread-the-work strategies, subdivision of labor and a shorter work week, and explain how they actually decrease productivity, which hurts employment and national wealth.

#### Policy 1: Subdivision of Labor

One way that unions spread work is by mandating that only members of a particular union perform tasks that are specific to that trade—even if the tasks are minor aspects of another worker’s job. For example, a plumber isn’t allowed to remove tiles herself in order to replace a pipe in the shower. Instead, she must call a tile-setter to remove and subsequently repair the tiles. Although the tile-setter has gained a day of work that she otherwise wouldn’t have had,**this spread-the-work practice increases the cost of the work, which harms overall employment.**

The spread-the-work requirement forces the homeowner with the broken shower pipe to pay two people instead of one. If the homeowner could have hired only the plumber to do the job, she would have used the extra money to buy a sweater, which means that the wages paid to the tile-setter would have gone to the sweater maker instead. While the equation simply trades one worker’s wages for the other’s, **the homeowner loses because she comes out with a fixed shower, when she could have had a fixed shower _and_ a sweater.** Both the fixed shower and the sweater represent overall production, which is an aspect of national wealth, meaning that subdividing labor hurts production and national wealth.

#### Policy 2: Shorter Work Weeks

Another method unions use to spread work is to promote shorter work weeks, with overtime pay of 150 percent of normal wages. Reducing the standard work week from 40 hours to 30 hours is intended to benefit workers in two ways:

  1. If an employee must still work 40 hours, the overtime pay will increase her paycheck. 
  2. If one employee’s hours get cut to 30, someone else will gain employment to pick up the extra 10 hours of labor. 



In reality, **there are two ways that a shorter work week can play out—and neither increases employment in the long run.**

One possibility is that the work week is cut to 30 hours _without_ increasing the hourly wage to compensate for workers’ lost earnings. This practice merely shifts labor hours and payroll costs among more workers, without increasing the company’s output or altering its labor costs, so the company’s production and profits remain the same. As a result,**the company has no extra money to create jobs by expanding its own business or support wages in another industry by spending the extra profits elsewhere.** Additionally, the workers whose hours were cut from 40 to 30 are taking home smaller paychecks, essentially subsidizing the wages of the new employees.

Another possibility is that the work week is cut to 30 hours _with_ a one-third increase in hourly wages, so that workers are taking home the same pay for less work. This option raises production costs, which puts some companies out of business and decreases supplies of the product. At this point, there are two possibilities:

  1. **Limited supplies and increased production costs raise the price of the product, meaning that consumers’ dollars don’t go as far.** Assuming the workers are among those customers, although their paychecks haven’t changed, they end up getting less for their money.
  2. **Company closures raise unemployment levels, which decreases demand for the product and lowers prices.** (Shortform note: The author doesn’t elaborate on this possibility, but presumably the lower demand and prices hurt the companies that are still in business, which could lead to cuts in pay or in staffing.)



(Shortform note: In recent years, a number of companies have begun experimenting with 30-hour work weeks, including Amazon, which offers workers the option to work reduced hours at 75 percent of their salaries, with full benefits. A Swedish company called Brath gives workers full pay for 30-hour work weeks, and company leaders insist that shorter days make employees more productive. For more information on this trend, read our summary of the article, “Enjoy The Extra Day Off! More Bosses Give 4-Day Workweek A Try.”)

### Full Production—Not Full Employment—Increases National Wealth

**Fallacy:** Full employment is the goal for national wealth and a high standard of living.

**Reality:** Full production is the goal for national wealth and a high standard of living.

Many people mistakenly push for full employment, thinking that will be the surest way to increase Americans’ prosperity and the national wealth. However, as we’ve illustrated, **policies that aim solely to increase employment** —including public works projects, labor union make-work practices, and 30-hour work weeks—**do not benefit individual or national wealth.**

Furthermore, the progress and innovations that have increased America’s wealth have actually reduced employment by eliminating the need for unfit workers, such as children and the elderly. By contrast, countries that have primitive, labor-intensive production methods have full employment out of necessity, but the people and nations are significantly poorer than further-developed countries with lower employment levels.

In reality, the goal should be to achieve maximum production, which raises wealth.**Higher output means a greater need for workers and more goods and services for everyone.**
