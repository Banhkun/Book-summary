## Exercise: What Are the Invisible Costs of Your Taxes?

Consider the invisible costs of your taxes.

* * *

Do you know about how much of your income goes to taxes? If so, how much?

If half of those taxes were eliminated, how would you primarily spend that money?

How much is your local sales tax?

Think of an item you bought recently, such as a shirt or textbook. What was the pre-tax cost of that item? What was the total cost with tax?

If you had no sales tax, do you think you would use that savings to buy more goods? Why or why not?
