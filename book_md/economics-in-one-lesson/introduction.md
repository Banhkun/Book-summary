## Introduction: A Narrow, Short-Term View Leads to Bad Policies

In this classic introduction to economics, Henry Hazlitt explains and illustrates the single most important lesson in economics: Every economic policy has secondary consequences that often do the opposite of the intended effect of the policy. Policies such as tariffs and minimum wage raises are enacted based on fallacies that overlook these consequences.

There are two reasons for these fallacies. First, **people commonly focus on how a policy would impact a specific group of people, while neglecting to consider the ripple effect on the rest of the nation.** For example, a narrow lens shows that raising the price of bread increases profits for bakers, grain mills, and wheat farmers—but a broader view reveals that the higher prices force consumers to buy less bread. People push economic policies that would benefit them and people like them, despite the possible harm to other groups. Lobbyists and advertising campaigns promote fallacies to minimize the negative consequences and garner public support for these policies.

Second, **many people focus on the short-term effects of a policy, while neglecting the long-term consequences, which may not become apparent until months or even decades later.** For example, while raising the price of bread _initially_ raises profits for bakers and their suppliers, the higher prices cause a drop in sales that _ultimately_ cuts into those profits. When people fail to consider long-term, indirect consequences, lawmakers end up imposing policies that can hurt the people they intend to help. Instead, well-informed analysis needs to be supplemented with the long-term, big-picture view of how the policy will affect everyone, both directly and indirectly.

(As a caveat, it’s also possible to assess economic policies with too broad a scope. If you focus too much on the long-term, you can overlook short-term damages. Similarly, if you only consider the overall impact on the nation, you may ignore harm to one or a few specific groups. However, most modern economic policies err on the side of being myopic.)

### About the Book

As the title suggests, this book is intended to be straightforward and easily understandable, regardless of your knowledge of economics. Hazlitt doesn’t extensively cite the economists whose theories he promotes or refutes. Rather, his focus is on how the amalgamation of various theories has turned into widely held beliefs and influenced government policies. However, he notes three especially influential economists:

  1. Frederic Bastiat—specifically, his essay, _Ce qu’on voit et ce qu’on ne voit pas_ , or _Things Seen and Things Not Seen_
  2. Philip Wicksteed—specifically, his book, _The Common Sense of Political Economy_
  3. Ludwig von Mises—specifically, his writings on inflation



(Shortform note: Hazlitt was a journalist who reported on business and economics. His work appeared in _The Wall Street Journal_ , _The New York Times_ , _Newsweek_ , _The Nation_ , and _The American Mercury_. His views support libertarian policies, though this book is considered a classic by both libertarians and conservatives.)

**In the following chapters, we’ll explore the consequences of economic policies and government interventions—** including rent control, inflation, and tariffs—**that result from short-term, narrowly focused fallacies.** Governments around the world have been fooled by these fallacies. In most cases, they didn’t learn from their mistakes, but repeated them generation after generation. In fact, the original version of this book was published in 1946, and nearly every type of misguided policy mentioned is still relevant today.

(Shortform note: We’ve grouped the fallacies into categories to clarify themes and make them easier to remember.)
