## Exercise: What’s Your Take on Raising Minimum Wage?

Reflect on your experience with and opinion of minimum wage laws. (Shortform note: Some researchers’ conclusions about the effects of minimum wage contradict Hazlitt’s argument. For example, the Washington Center for Equitable Growth found that raising the minimum wage did not lead to unemployment.)

* * *

State and federal elected officials regularly propose new minimum wage laws. In the past, what has been your opinion (or vote, if applicable) on raising the minimum wage?

Has this summary’s explanation of the effects of minimum wage raises affected your opinion? Why or why not?

If you’re in favor of minimum wage raises, what (if any) action do you think the government should take to support workers who lose their jobs as a result?
