## Exercise: Develop the Habit of Thinking Positively

Murphy argues that thinking positive thoughts will improve your life. Let’s explore how you can make it a habit to think positively.

* * *

Make a list of at least five happy and positive thoughts you can run through your mind throughout the day (for example, “Life is good”).

Describe a strategy you can use to remind yourself to focus on these positive thoughts. For example, perhaps you can set a reminder on your phone to check in with your thoughts.

Which one of Murphy’s methods will you try today to ensure your thoughts remain positive? For instance, you might try conscious repetition or visualization.
