## Shortform Introduction

In the self-improvement classic _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ , Joseph Murphy claims that all of your life experiences are the result of the interaction between your conscious and subconscious minds: Your subconscious mind _creates_ your life experiences according to your habitual conscious thoughts and ingrained beliefs. Murphy argues that **you can dramatically improve your life experiences by using your conscious mind to _imprint_ positive thoughts and beliefs upon your subconscious mind.**

### About the Author

Dr. Joseph Murphy (1898-1981) was a pioneering voice in the New Thought movement (which we’ll explore further in the Intellectual Context section below). He was a bestselling author, renowned speaker, and Minister-Director of the Church of Divine Science, a religious faction within the wider New Thought movement. This religion’s core belief is that God is good, the source of all creation, and omnipresent. Further, this faction teaches that negative circumstances only come about when we fail to practice the presence of God—in other words, when we think and act in ways contrary to God’s inherent goodness.

Murphy authored 36 books including:

  * _The Cosmic Energizer_ : includes ancient prayers, techniques, and meditations for calling upon the power of the universe to create abundance and joy in your life
  * _Grow Rich with the Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ : covers simple but powerful ways you can focus your attention to create prosperity and live the life of your dreams
  * _Within You Is the Power_ : presents powerful prayers and techniques from different cultures and ancient teachings from around the world



_The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ was Murphy’s most popular book. It was originally published in 1963 and has since been reprinted by various publishers including TarcherPerigee.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

_The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ contributed to the New Thought Movement: A spiritual movement that promotes the idea that we’re all connected to a benevolent “higher power.” According to this movement, we must align our conscious thoughts with this power by thinking positively to achieve success and happiness. Otherwise, our negative thoughts block our access to this positive force and create illness and failure in our lives.

Murphy’s ideas are not necessarily new, and his success is partly due to the work of previous authors writing within the same genre. The premise that positive life experiences come from aligning your conscious thoughts and beliefs with a benevolent higher power has become increasingly popular since the publication of _The Science of Getting Rich_ by Wallace D. Wattles in 1910. Wattles, like Murphy, asserts that your thoughts are the _cause_ of your success, and offers advice on how to _think constructively_ to create health, wealth, and satisfying experiences. Besides _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ , other successful books in this genre include:

  * _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ , Dale Carnegie: discusses how to cultivate a worry-free mindset
  * _The Power of Positive Thinking_ , Norman Vincent Peale: explores how positive thinking empowers you to reach your goals and live a fulfilling life
  * _Think and Grow Rich_ , Napoleon Hill: argues that you can _think_ what you want into reality 



#### The Book’s Impact

Published in 1963, _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ has since been translated into 30 languages and sold millions of copies. It continues to be one of the most popular books in the self-improvement genre and has inspired influential self-improvement authors such as Tony Robbins (_Awaken The Giant Within_) and Brian Tracy (_Eat That Frog!_). Both Robbins and Tracy write about similar ideas—that you have an innate ability to achieve extraordinary success and can unleash your potential by training yourself to think positively.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ enjoys thousands of excellent reviews—the majority of reviewers have labeled this book as “inspiring” and “motivational” and have employed Murphy’s techniques to make dramatic improvements to their lives.

However, some reviewers do find it difficult to take Murphy’s argument seriously—while he presents many anecdotal examples to demonstrate how people have improved their lives by employing his techniques, he doesn’t offer any scientific explanations to back up his statements. These reviewers find the book “weak on content,” “unconvincing,” and “too focused on religious concepts.” In addition, some reviewers find it difficult to move past the repetitive style of the book.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach and Organization

Throughout _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ , Murphy argues that you need to align your conscious thoughts with a higher power and have faith that your life will dramatically improve. He supports his argument with anecdotes that demonstrate how people have applied their conscious thoughts to solve a variety of problems, create happiness, and improve their lives.

Murphy organizes the material into 20 chapters to explain how improving your conscious thoughts can positively impact each area of your life: health, wealth, relationships, and success. However, the content of each chapter is largely indistinguishable from the content in others because each chapter simply reinforces one single concept—that your thoughts impact your life experiences. Because the chapters don’t progress to include any new explanations or research to back up Murphy’s argument, many reviewers note that the material suffers from repetition.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve reorganized Murphy’s ideas into four distinct parts to reduce repetition. This reorganization also makes it easier to separate Murphy’s philosophy from the actionable ideas you can apply in your own life.

  * **Part 1: You’re Connected to a Powerful Force** explains how your subconscious mind works: It identifies with your habitual conscious thoughts _and_ has an inbuilt connection to a benevolent higher power (Universal Consciousness). It also explores how Universal Consciousness creates your life experiences, and why you’re **_designed to be happy_**. 
  * **Part 2: Negative Thoughts Create Failure and Disease** clarifies _why_ your conscious thoughts sometimes inhibit the flow of Universal Consciousness to create negative experiences in your life. 
  * **Part 3: Train Your Subconscious Mind to Create Positive Results** discusses two steps to prime your subconscious mind to create positive results: deciding to think positive thoughts and trusting the process to work for you.
  * **Part 4: Methods to Realign Your Thoughts** presents specific methods to help align your conscious thoughts with the positive flow of Universal Consciousness so that you can train your subconscious mind to create positive experiences in your life.



We also compare and contrast each key concept with up-to-date psychological research, and we expand on Murphy’s methods with actionable ideas from other self-improvement practitioners and psychologists.
