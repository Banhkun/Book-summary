## Exercise: Consider What Instructions You’re Giving Your Subconscious Mind

According to Murphy, all of your life experiences are a result of your habitual conscious thoughts—these thoughts instruct your subconscious mind to orchestrate your experiences. Understanding how certain thoughts lead to certain outcomes can help you direct them toward what you want to experience.

* * *

Describe an experience you’ve had in the past week that felt positive to you (such as meeting up with a good friend).

How do you think your conscious thoughts instructed your subconscious mind to create this experience? For example, did you look forward to meeting up and have positive expectations about seeing your friend?

Now, describe an experience that felt negative to you such as getting into an argument with someone.

How do you think your conscious thoughts instructed your subconscious mind to create this experience? For example, have you had disagreements with this person in the past that you often replay in your mind?
