## Part 1: You’re Connected to a Powerful Force

In the self-improvement classic _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ , Joseph Murphy claims that all of your life experiences are the result of the interaction between your conscious and subconscious minds: Your subconscious mind _creates_ your life experiences according to your habitual conscious thoughts and ingrained beliefs. Murphy argues that **you can dramatically improve your life experiences by using your conscious mind to _imprint_ positive thoughts and beliefs upon your subconscious mind.**

We’ll discuss _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ in four parts. In this first part of the guide, we’ll start by exploring Murphy’s explanation of how your subconscious mind works—it identifies with your habitual conscious thoughts and forms conclusions about your beliefs. Next, we’ll explain Murphy’s belief that you’re **_designed to be happy_** because your subconscious mind has an inbuilt connection to a benevolent higher power (Universal Consciousness) that flows within you and around you to create your life experiences.

In the second part, we’ll explain _why_ your conscious thoughts sometimes inhibit the flow of Universal Consciousness to create poor health and negative experiences in your life.

In the third part, we’ll discuss two steps to prime your subconscious mind to create positive results: decide to think positive thoughts and trust the process to work for you.

In the final part, we’ll explore specific methods you can use to align your conscious thoughts with the positive flow of Universal Consciousness and train your subconscious mind to create positive experiences in your life.

### Your Two Minds: Conscious and Subconscious

According to Murphy, your mind is made up of two parts: the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. Let’s explore each part individually.

#### Your Conscious Mind

Murphy explains that your **conscious** mind is your _active_ mind. It contains all of the thoughts and feelings that you’re aware of at any given moment. You use it to judge your environment and to make choices and decisions based on these judgments.

(Shortform note: Research backs up Murphy’s judgment of the conscious mind as your active mind. According to Brian Tracy (_Eat That Frog!_), your conscious mind continually identifies, compares, and analyzes all of the information you perceive so that it can make decisions about what is relevant to you. However, Tracy notes that your conscious mind functions like a binary computer—it has no memory and can only think one thought at a time.)

#### Your Subconscious Mind

Murphy explains that your **subconscious** mind is your _passive_ mind. It’s always awake because it regulates all of your bodily functions, and it **records and stores your _every_ experience,** even when you’re not consciously paying attention. Over 90% of your brain’s activity takes place in your subconscious mind: It’s a reservoir of thoughts, feelings, and memories that lies beneath your conscious awareness.

(Shortform note: There is still much to be learned about how the subconscious mind works, but even in 1963, Murphy was right about its importance—neuroscientists have confirmed that 95% of your brain activity takes place beyond your conscious awareness, _in your subconscious mind_. Further, research reveals that your subconscious mind makes decisions about how you choose to feel or act _before your conscious mind even perceives the need to make a decision_.)

### Your Habitual Thoughts Imprint Upon Your Subconscious Mind

Murphy claims that your subconscious mind is _impersonal_ because it passively accepts your habitual conscious thoughts without question. In other words, it doesn’t judge any of your conscious thoughts (in the same way that your computer doesn’t judge the documents you save onto your hard drive). All of the thoughts you think in your conscious mind filter down into your subconscious mind and leave an impression. **The more often you think certain thoughts, the heavier the impression you leave on your subconscious mind**.

According to Murphy, the way your conscious thoughts imprint upon and mold your subconscious mind determines your personality traits and how you respond to your life experiences. This is because**your habitual thoughts train your subconscious mind to create associations and shortcuts** between all of the thoughts, feelings, and experiences it has stored.

> **Why Your Subconscious Mind Relies on Your Conscious Thoughts to Create Shortcuts**
> 
> Research supports Murphy’s claim that your conscious thoughts train your subconscious mind to create shortcuts. Your subconscious mind is an unlimited memory bank that permanently stores your every life experience: As Murphy describes, everything you experience is imprinted in this area of your brain. This memory bank processes 4 million bits (a measure of data transfer) per second and includes both significant and insignificant experiences, such as how you felt the first time you fell in love _and_ the many hours you’ve wasted on Netflix. According to one researcher, by the time you’re 21, your subconscious mind has stored more than 100 times the contents of the entire _Encyclopedia Britannica_.
> 
> According to psychologists, **your conscious mind relies on this memory bank to access the information you need** on a moment-by-moment basis. For example, when you need to remember the name of someone you’ve just bumped into, you retrieve the name from where it’s been stored in your subconscious mind. Since this memory bank is so full of information, it needs to create shortcuts so that it can quickly sift through everything it has stored and retrieve the information you need. Therefore, it relies on your conscious thoughts to categorize everything it stores in terms of how relevant it is to your habitual way of thinking.
> 
> For example, your subconscious mind may classify your best friend’s name as something important to remember, since you consciously speak with and interact with this person regularly. However, it’s unlikely to give the name of a stranger the same level of importance and precedence in its memory bank.

To clarify how your conscious thoughts mold your subconscious mind, we’ll first explore the process that enables you to use shortcuts to perform certain tasks automatically. Then, we’ll explore how, according to Murphy, this same process influences your feelings, behaviors, and personality.

#### Your Subconscious Mind Learns From Repetition

Murphy explains that you’re able to perform tasks without having to apply conscious thought, such as riding a bike or getting dressed, because the impressions your habitual conscious thoughts make **condition** your subconscious mind to act automatically. When you’re learning how to do something new, you have to focus on what you’re doing and apply _conscious effort_ in order to do it right. The more you practice this skill, the easier it becomes for you to perform the task without conscious effort. This is because your subconscious mind _learns_ how to perform the task and _takes control_ so that you can perform it automatically.

> **Why Repetition Leads to Automatic Behavior**
> 
> Since _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind’_ s publication in 1963, neuroscientists have developed the ability to observe how learning occurs at the molecular level—they can see what goes on inside our brains when we’re engaged in learning something new. While this research doesn’t specifically comment on the part that your subconscious mind plays in this process, it does include details about the impact of your short-term and long-term memory on learning, which are both stored in your subconscious mind.
> 
> The more you learn, the more you change the physical structure of your brain by strengthening specific neural pathways. Here’s a very brief overview of neural pathways:
> 
>   * The brain consists of a dense network of pathways consisting of neurons.
> 
>   * Synapses allow sensory information to be transmitted through this network of neurons.
> 
>   * This sensory information is stored in your short-term memory while your brain processes it by comparing it to the memories you’ve stored in your long-term memory (everything in your subconscious mind). This process determines whether the new sensory information is kept or discarded.
> 
> 

> 
> Neuroscientists believe that your memory and recall rely upon the relationship that your neurons have with each other. The stronger the relationship (the more frequently these neurons interact with each other), the stronger your ability to remember and recall what you need to do. This is because strong neural pathways heighten the transmission speed of information and allow you to effortlessly recall the information you need. This is why you can perform your routine tasks without conscious effort.
> 
> Every time you learn something new, you need to form new neural connections within the brain—this requires conscious effort and attention. When you attempt to do something new, your brain has to work much harder because you haven’t yet developed the specific neural pathways—the neurons required to achieve the task haven’t developed a relationship so their communication is inefficient. However, the more you practice, the more you strengthen your neural pathways and encourage the required neurons to interact and develop strong pathways. Stronger neural pathways allow your subconscious mind to take over the task without your conscious mind’s involvement.

##### Your Subconscious Mind Forms Conclusions About Your Beliefs

In the same way that practicing a new skill conditions you to carry it out automatically, **your habitual conscious thoughts condition your subconscious mind to _identify_ and classify everything it perceives in a specific way. **For example, if you habitually think that dogs are a threat, your subconscious mind classifies every dog it perceives as a threat. Murphy claims that this is because your subconscious mind forms conclusions about what your overarching beliefs are based on your habitual conscious thoughts. It then automatically relies upon these overarching beliefs to process and catalog all of the information it records.

The following examples illustrate how your subconscious mind creates conclusions from your overarching beliefs:

**Example #1:** You habitually think that “men are distrustful” and imprint this upon your subconscious mind. Your thoughts turn into a belief—your subconscious mind concludes that _every_ man you think of or see is distrustful: “Men are distrustful, this is a man, therefore he is distrustful.”

**Example #2:** You habitually think about how uncomfortable you feel around strangers and imprint this into your subconscious mind. These thoughts turn into a belief so your subconscious mind concludes that every new person threatens your sense of safety and comfort: “Strangers make me uncomfortable, this is a new person, therefore I should feel uncomfortable.”

> **Your Habitual Thoughts Determine Your Feelings and Behavior**
> 
> Murphy claims that your subconscious mind is at the mercy of your conscious mind—it simply carries out the orders it’s given based on your habitual conscious thoughts and overarching beliefs. However, he doesn’t expand further upon the interplay between your two minds: Your subconscious mind _is_ at the mercy of your conscious mind but it also _influences_ your conscious mind to think in specific ways and leads you to act _automatically_ in ways that align with your overarching beliefs.
> 
> According to Maxwell Maltz (_Psycho-Cybernetics_), the conclusions that your subconscious mind forms about your beliefs and how it should respond to your experiences affect the way you engage with the world. These conclusions trigger your emotions, color your perceptions and the way that you judge your environment, and lead you to react in specific ways to your environment.
> 
> Maltz argues that this interplay between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind then reinforces a behavioral cycle: Your subconscious mind’s interpretation of your environment justifies your habitual thoughts, feelings, and how you continue to behave—how you continue to think and behave further reinforces the way your subconscious mind perceives your environment, and so on.
> 
> For example, if you habitually worry about how much work you have to do and blame other people for wasting your time, your subconscious mind leads you to react to delays in ways that align with the conclusion it has formed about you: You don’t have time for delays, other people are to blame, you should feel angry. As a result, it makes you feel impatient and leads you to judge others harshly and lash out at those around you. It’s difficult to break free from this way of reacting to delays because your conscious and subconscious minds have become habituated to interacting in this way.

### Your Subconscious Mind Creates Your Life Experiences

Murphy argues that while your subconscious mind does influence your feelings and behaviors and lead you to create certain situations based on these reactions, it also plays a far more important role in your life: **It creates specific life experiences that align with your habitual conscious thoughts and beliefs.**

How exactly does your subconscious mind _create_ life experiences? Murphy claims that your subconscious mind is connected to a “Higher Power,” or Universal Consciousness—the invisible power or “life force” that created and continues to manage the entire universe. According to Murphy, this force lives within all organic and inorganic matter, connects us all, and governs all of the interactions that underlie the universe.

The following is an example of this life force and interaction at play: Ecosystems rely on multiple interactions to thrive—for example, bees are born _knowing_ that their job is to pollinate flowers, while seeds contain all of the intelligence they need to blossom into flowers. The resulting interaction benefits the survival and reproduction of both bees and flowers, as well as all of the organisms within the ecosystem.

(Shortform note: Murphy refers to this power as “God,” “Infinite Intelligence,” and a “Higher Power.” We’ll refer to this concept as “Universal Consciousness” throughout the rest of this guide for clarity and consistency.)

> **Your Subconscious Mind _Is_ Your Spiritual Mind**
> 
> Murphy’s ideas about how a higher power creates your life experiences are inextricably linked to the New Thought Movement that originated in the United States during the early 19th century. While many writers and philosophers, including Murphy, contributed to the movement, Prentice Mulford was pivotal in the development of New Thought Thinking. Many of the principles he discusses in a series of essays published during 1886-1892 (collected in _Your Forces and How to Use Them_) underpin New Thought philosophy.
> 
> While Mulford doesn’t specifically discuss the role the subconscious mind plays in creating experiences (Freud discovered the subconscious mind in 1900 after Mulford’s time), he does emphasize the connection between your “spiritual” unconscious side and a higher power. For Mulford, your unconscious mind _is_ your spiritual mind. Similarly, while Murphy reframes Mulford’s writings to include research about the subconscious mind, he (Murphy) also argues that your spiritual connection to this power lies at the heart of your every experience.
> 
> Despite its belief in a higher power, the New Thought Movement is not considered a religion. Rather, it is the expression of a blend of philosophical and scientific ideals accumulated from a variety of cultures and belief systems. There are various offshoots of this philosophy including Religious Science, Unity, and the Law of Attraction. In general, all adherents of New Thought share the following core beliefs:
> 
>   * God or Infinite Intelligence is the source of all matter within the universe, and it is omnipresent.
> 
>   * This God or Infinite Intelligence also lives within each of us.
> 
>   * Our life experiences are simply the manifestation of our mental and spiritual states. In other words, the interplay between our thoughts and God or Infinite Intelligence creates everything we experience.
>

#### How Your Subconscious Mind Orchestrates Your Life Experiences

Murphy argues that your subconscious mind is infinite and has no limitations: There is no limit to the amount of information it can record and store, and its connection to Universal Consciousness gives it access to all of the information in the universe. Through this access, it **_orchestrates interactions_ and creates experiences that line up with your habitual conscious thoughts, expectations, and beliefs**. These results reflect both how you feel about yourself and what you expect to experience in your life. They encompass every area of your life including your health, relationships, finances, and career.

Murphy claims that your subconscious mind leads you to these experiences through the use of intuition. Each time you feel inspired, have a gut instinct, or the impulse or urge to do something, this is your subconscious communicating and guiding you towards specific life experiences that match your habitual conscious thoughts. Murphy’s theory explains the coincidences and serendipitous moments that occur in your life.

For example, you’re on your way somewhere but feel impelled to take a different route. This route leads you to bump into someone you were planning to get in touch with. Though you may pass it off as a happy coincidence, Murphy argues that this is your subconscious mind creating your life experiences.

> **The Law of Attraction: The Universe Communicates With You Through Intuition**
> 
> Murphy claims that your subconscious mind creates life experiences that align with your habitual conscious thoughts. But he doesn’t explain _how_ it produces results. Therefore, we’ll consider how Law of Attraction theory argues this interplay occurs, as it aligns well with the principles of the New Thought Movement.
> 
> Like Murphy, the Law of Attraction (LoA) also claims that your life experiences match your habitual thoughts. This philosophy is centered around the belief that you get what you focus on: Positive thoughts lead to positive consequences, and negative thoughts lead to negative consequences. However, unlike Murphy, the LoA doesn’t factor in the role that your subconscious mind plays in this process. Instead, it argues that your thoughts and beliefs (what the LoA calls your “frequency”) send a signal to the universe. **The universe then delivers experiences that match your thoughts and beliefs**.
> 
> To visualize how this works, picture a vast, infinite ocean of magnetic thoughts and experiences _shared and influenced by the entire universe_. Each of your conscious thoughts is a magnetic drop in this ocean—the thought feels impelled to move towards an experience that matches it, and this experience feels impelled to move towards the thought that created it. In this way, your conscious thoughts influence the shape and the frequency of the currents and the waves (your life experiences).
> 
> Similarly to Murphy, the LoA claims that these magnetic pulls influence your emotions and your intuition—the universe _creates_ your feelings of intuition to guide you to experiences that match your thoughts. This explains why you’re repeatedly drawn to the same types of situations and life experiences.
> 
> For example, you habitually complain about your love life because you always feel attracted to the type of partner that lets you down. According to the LoA, you initially feel inspired to trust this type of partner because your habitual thoughts instruct the universe to guide you to the wrong type of partner. As a result, the universe sends you emotions and intuitive feelings that encourage you to start relationships that are destined to fail.
> 
> According to research, intuition does give us the ability to know something without conscious analytical thought—this knowledge comes from all of the information you have stored in your subconscious mind. While it’s clear that your subconscious mind does influence your emotions and your intuitive feelings, there isn’t any scientific research to back up the theory that these feelings are messages from the universe.

#### You’re Designed to Feel Healthy and Happy

Murphy believes that Universal Consciousness is a **benevolent force** that your subconscious mind is connected to, and the natural by-products of this force are positive: vitality, bliss, and forward motion. Because you have an innate connection to this force, **you are a physical extension of this positive force** —he explains that a stream of positive energy flows _within you_ to nurture you both physically and emotionally and _around you_ to create joyous life experiences. Consequently, Murphy concludes that **you’re _designed_ to think in ways that align with this energy so that you can live in a constant state of bliss.**

To visualize this, imagine that you’re rowing down a stream made up of this positive force of energy. Everything and everyone you pass on your way along this stream represents your physical and emotional well-being and all of your life experiences. **The stream comfortably flows towards good health, happy relationships, and satisfying experiences**.

> **Humans Turn to Higher Powers to Control the Uncontrollable**
> 
> Murphy’s claim that Universal Consciousness is inherently good, and his belief that its “good” energy can help _you_ to feel good too, is rooted in his religious background. Murphy was Minister-Director of the Church of Divine Science, a religious faction within the wider New Thought movement. This religion’s core belief is that God is _good_ , the source of all creation, and is omnipresent. This faction instructs followers to practice feeling the “presence of God” in order to connect to the inherent goodness within us and the universe.
> 
> The belief in an **inherently good** higher power lies at the forefront of most dominant religions. Yuval Noah Harari (_Sapiens_) explains that the idea of a benevolent God originally arose from the human need to control our environment. When faced with uncontrollable events, such as a drought or epidemic, humans created Gods and assigned them the power to control the things they couldn’t.
> 
> By assigning these Gods with personalities and biases, humans could believe that these Gods took an active interest in the human world. Further, they believed that by praying and providing offerings, they could negotiate with these Gods to intervene in the world and shape their experiences. The act of turning things over to a higher power gave humans a way of rationalizing uncontrollable events and the resilience to face challenges and upheavals.
> 
> The Church of Divine Science takes this concept of God a step further: It teaches that humans, through their connection to a higher power, _are_ God. According to this religion, we don’t need to pray to a higher power to intervene on our behalf. Instead, we can take control of our environment by connecting to the higher power that lives within us.
