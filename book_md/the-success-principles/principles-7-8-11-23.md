## Principles 7, 8, 11, 23: Set Goals

Setting goals is a powerful way to evaluate your dreams and make a plan to achieve them. This section outlines how to write goals and how to increase the likelihood you’ll achieve them.

### The Benefits of Goal-Setting

Goal setting has three main benefits:

  1. **You develop new skills.** To reach your goal, you’ll likely have to develop new habits and skills you can continue to use. For example, if your goal is to become a better ukulele player, cultivate the discipline to practice regularly. Even once you’re an accomplished player, you’ll still be able to use that discipline elsewhere.
  2. **You do things that scare you but are good for you.** Goal-setting helps you work through your worries to try new things that improve your life. 
  3. **You develop as a person.** Ultimately, it’s our goal as humans to live well, and goal-setting helps—in addition to developing new skills, it opens your mind to what is possible, allowing you to be a well-rounded, resilient, capable person. 



### Write Your Goals

When writing goals, incorporate these characteristics:

  1. **Quantity and timing.** Setting a measurable goal helps you determine whether you’ve achieved it. To be measurable, a goal needs to include a quantity, such as money or pounds, and a deadline. Example: I will weigh 130 pounds on my wedding day, June 4, 2022, and fit comfortably in my dress.
  2. **Detail.** Detail provides a concrete picture of what you want and stimulates your imagination. For example, if you have ideas about the dream town you’d like to settle in, write them down so your mind can ruminate on them. When you’ve detailed what you’re looking for, you’re more likely to recognize opportunities to help you reach your goals.



#### Turn Good Ideas Into Goals

Sometimes, a goal might start as just an idea: something you want, or a wish. **It may be a good idea, but if it’s too vague or you can’t measure when you’ll achieve it, workshop it into a goal.** Here are some examples:

Idea  | Goal   
---|---  
I want to own a house in Costa Rica.  | I will own a house in the beach town of Sámara, Costa Rica by 5 p.m. on September 23, 2023.   
I should eat better.  | I will have transitioned to eating only vegan meals and snacks by 8 p.m. on February 9, 2021.   
I should talk to my grandmother more.  | I will have talked to my grandmother four times (two times per month) by January 31, 2021.   
  
In the previous table, the goals include more detail than the ideas, which gives the brain a more specific outcome to work toward.

### Interact With Your Goals

Studies indicate that increasing your interaction with your goal makes you more likely to achieve it.

Researchers recruited participants from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia to study the effects of different goal-setting habits. They divided the participants into five groups, asked each participant to set a goal—something they wanted to accomplish in the next four weeks—and gave them one or more techniques to follow while working toward their goal. The table below summarizes which techniques each group of goal setters used and how they fared:

| **Group 1** | **Group 2** | **Group 3** | **Group 4** | **Group 5**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Think about goals  | x  | x  | x  | x  | x   
Write goals  |  | x  | x  | x  | x   
Write steps to achieve goals  |  |  | x  | x  | x   
Send list of steps to a friend or mentor  |  |  |  | x  | x   
Provide weekly updates on your goals to your friend or mentor  |  |  |  |  | x   
% Participants who achieved their goals  | 43  | 56  | 56  | 64  | 76   
  
The study showed that the more ways participants engaged with their goal, the more likely they were to achieve it.

In another study, people who wrote down their goals and reviewed them regularly earned nine times more over the course of their lives than people who didn’t set goals.

In addition to the techniques in the above study, here are five ways to engage with your goals:

**1\. Read and visualize your goals two or three times per day.** As you read a goal, visualize how it will feel to have achieved it. Visualization is a powerful tool to help you realize your goals. Studies have shown that the brain activity for doing an activity and visualizing the activity are the same. The system in your brain that does this is called the reticular activating system (RAS). Regular visualization activates your RAS, makes your goals feel achievable, and motivates you to take steps to get there: It creates a disconnect between your lived reality and what life will be like once you’ve achieved your goal. **This disconnect is called “structural tension” and it motivates you to make your reality match your visualizations.** For example, use it to speak up more in class, take on more ambitious projects, or other activities that will help you achieve your goal.

An important note on visualization: Some people see bright, colorful, three-dimensional pictures of their visions, while others just think about how things will be. Both work equally well for activating your RAS and working toward your goals. Principle 10: Expand Your Comfort Zone further discusses using visualization with your affirmations.

**2\. Write down your most important goal and keep it in your wallet.** Every time you open your wallet, you’ll remind yourself of what you’re working toward.

**3\. Create a goal book or vision board.** Use a journal, notebook, binder, or display board to record your goals. Write each goal at the top of a separate page and write about it in detail below. If you’re artistic, consider making art that represents what achieving your goal will look like. Or, place pictures of things you hope to achieve in the book or on the board. This could include places you want to travel and things you’ll own. Read your goals at least once a day to motivate you to act.

**4\. Write yourself a check.** This strategy could work well if one of your goals is to increase your earnings over time. Make the check out to yourself for the amount of money you’re hoping to get, write what it’s for in the memo line, and mark a future date that you’ll have achieved it.

Example: Actor Jim Carrey wrote himself a check for $10 million dated five years in the future, motivating himself to expand his acting career. Within five years, he had exceeded his goal, making about $20 million per movie.

### Break Your Goals Into Steps

Besides writing down your goal and interacting with it, break it into smaller steps you’ll take to reach it.

To identify the steps necessary for achieving your goal, ask yourself:

  * What are some things I need to do?
  * Which skills do I need to develop?
  * How much money do I need? How will I save it or raise it?
  * What resources do I need?
  * Whose support or assistance do I need?



There are six main ways to answer these questions:

1.**Talk to others**. Ask people what steps they took to get where they are now. For example, if you want to become a freelance writer, make appointments with freelance writers you admire and ask them what steps they took to succeed. They can also clue you in on pitfalls to avoid.

2\. **Talk to a coach, mentor, or teacher.** These people can advise you on how to approach your goal, even if they don’t have specialized experience in the area you’re considering.

3\. **Volunteer or do an internship.** These experiences can help you learn the skills it takes to operate a business or thrive in a chosen career. From there, apply what you learn to achieve your goals.

4\. **Consult books, manuals, or online courses.** Chances are you’re not the first person pursuing this particular goal. Exploring written materials or courses can provide you with a specific sequence of steps to follow. For example, maybe you want to become a graphic designer. Reading a variety of materials on the subject can help you learn the steps.

5.**Imagine that you’ve already achieved your goal and imagine the steps in reverse.** For example, if your goal was to become a marriage and family therapist, and you’d already achieved it, the steps you’d have taken would include leasing office space, logging hundreds of hours observing therapy sessions to get your counseling license, and earning a degree in psychology or a similar field.

6\. **Create a mind map**. In this instance, mind mapping consists of thinking of every task you’d need to do to achieve your goal, sorting them into categories, and deciding what order you’ll do them in. Here’s how to make one:

  * **Write your goal in the middle of a large circle.** For example, let’s say you want to earn some money selling gourmet caramel corn during the holidays.
  * **Write smaller categories of tasks in circles around the main circle.** Connect each one to the main circle with a line. In the caramel corn example, your subcategories of tasks might include Cooking and Marketing.
  * Draw lines or spokes from the category circles and write specific subtasks on each. For example, on spokes extending from the Marketing circle, you might write, “Consult friends and family about business name,” and “Hire Amy Smith to design my business logo.”



### Work on Your Steps Every Day

Now that you have a plan to achieve your goal, work on it every day. This allows you to keep up your momentum and achieve your goal faster. Here are some tips:

  * **Make a to-do list each day that pulls from steps you outlined in your mind map or other written plan.**
  * **Consider making your to-do list the night before.** This helps you hit the ground running in the morning rather than spending most of the morning planning your day. This method also positions your subconscious to think of the task all night and help attract the people and things you need to succeed the next day.
  * **Do your hardest task of the day first.** People tend to procrastinate on tasks that feel intimidating. But if you wait to do them until later in the day, you may struggle because you’re not as fresh or you haven’t left enough time. Instead, knock out the hardest task first.
  * **Use the rule of five.** Do five tangible things to help you reach your goal every day. When Canfield and his co-author on the first _Chicken Soup for the Soul_ book were working to get it on the _New York Times_ bestsellers list,__ they decided to do five things each day to support that goal—for example, mailing the book to five editors who might review it, or doing five radio interviews to promote it. The more they promoted the book, the more people would hear about it and buy it. It took over a year, but eventually, the book made it to the top of the list.

### Challenges: Reasons, Worries, and Life Obstacles

Once you’ve settled on your goals and your plan to achieve them, it’s common to encounter challenges that impede or discourage you from working on them. Embracing these challenges as a normal part of life allows you to work through them. They are:

  * **Reasons**. Once you write a goal, you may find yourself thinking of reasons to not pursue it. For example, if you’re trying to increase your monthly sales, you may think it’s impossible because you’ve maxed out your current sales territory.
  * **Worries.** Worries are any negative emotions that surface for you when thinking about a goal. For example, you might worry that you’ll fail, or that launching a business will consume your savings.
  * **Life obstacles**. Life obstacles are things that happen to you once you start pursuing a goal that make it hard to pursue. For example, you may discover that your government doesn’t allow you to run your business as you planned.



Example: Stu Lichtman wanted to salvage a shoe company in Maine that owed $2 million to creditors. To help the business recoup some money, Lichtman arranged for the sale of one of the company’s unused factories. However, the state had a lien on the factory, so the sale wouldn’t result in any proceeds for the company. **Lichtman asked the governor if they’d be willing to remove the lien, arguing it would help prepare the company for takeover by another business, saving 1,000 jobs.** The governor agreed.

### Activity: Write 101 Goals

In the book, _The Magic of Thinking Big_ , author David Schwartz suggests readers write down all the goals they hope to achieve in their lives. Making goals you’ll achieve throughout your life rather than just within a short span of time can motivate you to work toward them over the long term. Here’s how to do the activity:

  1. **Decide where to write your goals.** Options include three-by-five notecards, a single sheet of paper, or a goal book.
  2. **Write them in detail.** Include when, where, why, how much, and so on.
  3. **When you reach your goal, check it off and write “victory.”**



Example: Before Lou Holtz became a famous football coach at the University of Notre Dame, he read Schwartz’s book and wrote down all of his goals. He came up with 107 goals, which included things like eating dinner at the White House, shooting a hole in one in golf, and of course, coaching at Notre Dame. He has now achieved 102 of his goals twice!
