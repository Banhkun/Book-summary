## Part 2: Act With Intention | Principle 12: Act Like You’ve Made It

Achieving success requires taking action. In Part 2, you’ll learn to forge ahead, even in the face of challenges and fear.

### How Would You Act if You’d Already Made It?

One powerful technique to achieving your goals is to act as though you already have. In the same way that visualization stimulates your reticular activating system (RAS), acting as though you’ve already achieved your dream activates the Law of Attraction: You start recognizing the people and opportunities that might help you reach your goals.

To start acting as though you’ve achieved your goals, think about how your life would be different. Consider:

  * How you’d feel
  * How you’d think
  * How you’d talk
  * What you’d wear



You can also try to model the behaviors of successful people. Successful people tend to:

  * Be self-confident
  * Celebrate their accomplishments
  * Feel comfortable taking risks
  * Say what they want and don’t want
  * Think they can achieve anything



### Throw a “Come as You’ll Be” Party

To practice acting as though you’ve achieved your goals, plan or attend a “Come as You’ll Be” party: **a party set five years in the future where you act as if you’ve achieved your goals.** Canfield first attended one in 1986. Participants had to act in character for the entire four-hour party. They brought props, like “books” they had written and photos of themselves achieving their goals.

One participant, Susan Jeffers, brought three books she had written, though she had yet to publish even one. When Jeffers shared that she had published these books, attendees responded that they’d seen her interviews on popular talk shows. Another attendee who was an aspiring stock trader had someone call him every 15 minutes. He’d talk animatedly and then give commands about whether to buy or sell shares. Canfield carried copies of his yet-to-be-written New York Times bestseller.

Most of the party’s attendees went on to achieve their dreams, including Canfield. **He attributes their success to marinating their brains in the imagery of achievement for four hours, which in turn activated their RAS and motivated them to achieve the goal.** The attendees had to put in concerted effort going forward to reach those goals, but the party provided an important starting point.

Throw a Come as You’ll Be Party for your close friends, or consider making it part of your company’s training program. You’ll create a supportive jumping-off point for the people around you who are looking to propel themselves toward their goals.

> **Acting the Part: From Bank Teller to Branch Manager**
> 
> * * *
> 
> When Canfield visited his local bank, he usually saw one teller who was more dressed up than the others. Instead of wearing just a shirt and tie, he wore a suit like the managers. Over the course of a few years, this employee went from teller, to loan salesman with his own desk, to loan officer, to branch manager. When Canfield asked him about it, he said he’d planned to become the branch manager. **In preparation for the role, he’d studied how the managers dressed and how they treated employees and customers.** He studied and acted the part long before reaching his goal.

> **Success in the PGA: Jim Nantz and Fred Couples’s Story**
> 
> In college, Fred Couples and Jim Nantz discovered that they both wanted to make it big in the golf world. Couples wanted to become a pro-golfer and win the Masters Tournament while Nantz wanted to become a sports announcer for CBS. **They role-played Couples winning the tournament and Nantz interviewing him countless times.** Over a decade later, Couples succeeded in winning the tournament and Nantz was his interviewer, just like they’d practiced. Acting as though they’d already succeeded put both men on the path to making it come true.
