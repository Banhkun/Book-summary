## Principles 20-21: Always Strive to Improve

Working to improve yourself and become successful means that you don’t stop once you’ve achieved one goal—you’re constantly improving yourself or your work.

The world is changing rapidly. Working to improve and grow is a necessity for successful people. But if you let the fast pace of the world dictate the pace at which you improve yourself, you may feel like you’re barely keeping up; creating changes in yourself takes time. **Working systematically on small changes can help improve yourself and your work.**

### Even Slight Improvements Make a Difference

In _The Slight Edge_ , author Jeff Olson discusses the outsized impact that making small changes can have on your life. For example, doing slightly more of something, like substituting a glass of water for your daily soda, can save you hundreds of dollars a year and spare you thousands of calories. Similarly, watching one hour less of TV each day adds up to 365 hours that you could use another way, like improving your cross-stitch skills.

### Decide How You’ll Improve and Track Your Progress

Try the following steps to implement improvements in your life:

1.**Consult the list of categories from “Principle 3: Decide What You Want” and pick one to work on.** For example, you may want to improve your strength and flexibility and commit to practicing yoga twice per week. Whatever your interest, decide what you want, and make a plan to reach it.

2.**Use a scoring system to track your progress.** Scoring yourself allows you to evaluate whether you’re improving or have succeeded. For example, to deal with his hectic schedule, Vinod Khosla, the founder of Sun Microsystems, made a goal of getting home to eat dinner with his children at least 25 nights per month.

Keeping score can work for your company, too. Some companies use scoring metrics called “critical drivers”—specific, positive outcomes—to work toward important benchmarks and improvements. If a critical driver reaches or exceeds a certain threshold, it results in increased revenue and profits for the company. For example, a critical driver for an insurance company might be the number of customers who are insured with more than one type of insurance. Learning to identify these drivers and develop a plan to improve them increases your company’s success.
