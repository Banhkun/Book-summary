## Principles 36-37: Learn Throughout Your Life

Just like developing new habits, learning throughout your life is key to being successful and adapting to changing times. Canfield offers four strategies to learn more:

1.**Watch less TV; read more.** The average person in the U.S. watches six hours of TV a day. Eliminating one hour of TV a week would help you make time for other pursuits, such as learning a language, spending more time with family, or reading. Reading is one of the most beneficial activities because it allows you to learn from people who have already achieved great things.

If you’re hoping to become an expert in your field, reading for an hour each day on related topics can greatly accelerate the pace of your learning. If you read a book a week, you’ll have read over 1,000 books in 20 years, putting you in the top 1 percent of people in your field.

2\. **Listen to inspirational audio programs.** Listening to inspirational audio programs allows you to learn from experts. People spend an average of 30 minutes commuting each way, which adds up to 1,250 hours in five years. Filling that time listening to the wisdom of experts allows you to learn and adjust accordingly. Visit JackCanfield.com to access Canfield’s audio programs on a variety of topics.

3\. **Attend success rallies and conferences.** Success rallies and conferences are events with speakers, coaches, and other professionals who can provide guidance and inspiration that’ll help you become successful. Similarly, you can find telesummits—recordings of conferences—online that feature between eight and 24 speakers. Type “telesummit” into your web browser to access them.

4\. **Train your team.** To ensure that you’re constantly moving forward as a company, everyone needs to be learning how to advance themselves and their work. Here are two ways to train your team:

  * Let employees attend training or hire trainers to lead private sessions for your company. Do a mix of professional development and personal development training.
  * Create a library of resources employees can use, like books, DVDs or CDs.



5\. Visit this book’s resources page for additional information, including:

  * Suggested courses to learn to read faster
  * Canfield’s curated list of books that discuss keys to success. Topics include nutrition, quantum physics, and psychology.
  * Recommended training and organizations that provide training for companies and individuals
