## Principles 44-45: Network, and Find Mentors and Coaches

To be successful in your life and career, cultivate a network of people you can call on for advice and do business with. This section covers how to find mentors and coaches, and how to network.

### Find a Mentor

**Sometimes, we seek career advice from friends and family who aren’t well-equipped to provide it.** They may not have pursued a similar career or have experience with the challenges you face. Cultivating a group of mentors in your field whom you can call on regularly for advice helps you advance your career and achieve your goals.

Though you may have a sense of what you’d like to do in your career, you may still be shortsighted or need help overcoming challenges. A mentor who has been in the field longer than you have has experience and advice they can share to help you.

Here are the steps to finding and securing a mentor:

  1. **Research potential mentors.** Look for people who have the skills, expertise, or experience you need to achieve your goals. Search online, read trade publications, and ask others in your field who they think would be a good mentor for you. If multiple people recommend the same person, it’s a sign that person would be a good mentor.
  2. **Arrange a conversation, either in person or virtually.**
  3. **Make a list of things you’ll cover in your first conversation.** Most importantly, ask if they’d be willing to be your mentor, and explain that this entails speaking with you for a few minutes per month.
  4. **Work your way through your list of potential mentors, asking around until you get a yes.** Not everyone will agree to be your mentor, but someone eventually will. 
  5. **Give back to your mentor.** Think of ways to make mentorship worth your mentor’s time. For example, when you meet monthly, you could connect them to others in your network.



#### Changing Course: Jason Dorsey’s Story

Jason Dorsey was an undergraduate student at the University of Texas when a local entrepreneur spoke to his business class. Inspired by the speaker’s career, Dorsey asked him to be his mentor. During their first meeting, the mentor asked Dorsey about his career plans. Dorsey wanted to graduate from college and pursue a career on Wall Street before earning an MBA, starting his own business, and retiring early. He also dreamed of inspiring youth to secure their dream jobs. **Dorsey’s mentor suggested a modification to his plan: Instead of waiting to work with youth, Dorsey should work with them sooner while he was young and could relate to them better.** Dorsey decided to write a book to share his ideas with youth, speak at schools across the country, and offer training to teachers and counselors. His nickname became Gen Y Guy. He now trains companies on how to retain young employees.

### Find a Coach

A coach is a professional whom you pay for advice that can help you advance your career farther, faster by:

  * Weighing different opportunities.
  * Identifying your values, purpose, and goals.
  * Making a plan to reach your goals.
  * Balancing your career and your personal life.



There are different types of coaches for different needs. For example, Canfield offers coaching for professionals as well as coaching for people who want to publish a book.

### Build Your Professional Network

**Just as a mentor can provide guidance on your career and personal life, forming a professional network can open doors to new career opportunities such as new clients, business partners, and jobs.** Seek out networking events to build these connections.

Further, you’ll have people you can count on when you need help. For example, when Canfield and his business partner need help, they ask themselves, “Who in our network can help us with this?”

Build your network in three stages:

  1. **Share your work.** Tell people what kind of work you do and what your skills are. This helps them determine where your professional worlds intersect. For example, if you’re a home inspector, perhaps you’d reach out to real estate agents to make them aware of your work. When people know who you are, and what you do, they’ll seek out your services or refer your services to others.
  2. **Cultivate credibility.** Once people know your work, build trust with them so that they feel comfortable working with you or referring your services to others. Some easy ways to build credibility are showing up for meetings and providing the service you say you will. 
  3. **Provide mutual benefits.** In this stage, continue building trust with your connections until you both regularly benefit or profit from the exchange. You both benefit by doing business together and from each others’ connections to people in your industry or outside of it.



Sometimes, people unthinkingly undermine their networked relationships. For example, if you’ve made a connection with a vendor you like, but whose prices you don’t, you may continue shopping around for a vendor with better prices. However, you’d be better off negotiating a deal with the vendor you already have a connection with, thereby nurturing a long-term relationship.

#### Networking to Achieve a Goal: Miriam Laundry’s Story

After her niece committed suicide, Miriam Laundry made a goal to help 100,000 children around the world believe in themselves. She wrote a children’s book on the subject and sought to break the Guinness World Record for the largest online discussion in a 24-hour period. **As Laundry started sharing her goal, the people she told used their networks to share her book with more children and encourage them to participate in the discussion.** In one instance, after Laundry won an award for her endeavor, the award-giver connected her with a company that wanted to help her finance the cost of making the discussion an international event and bringing a Guinness World Record judge to her city. On the day of the event, over 103,813 people from 29 countries participated. Laundry credited her networking connections for her success.
