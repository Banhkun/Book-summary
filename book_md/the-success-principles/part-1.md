## Part 1: Learn the Success Basics | Introduction

Jack Canfield made it big as a co-author of the best-selling _Chicken Soup for the Soul_ book series, but it took years for him to achieve success. In _The Success Principles_ , Canfield details 67 principles to help anyone achieve their goals and dreams. **To develop the principles, Canfield interviewed successful people, from athletes to authors.** He applied the principles to his own life, and he teaches them to people all over the world through seminars. His students have accomplished feats such as becoming millionaires, receiving a Teacher of the Year award in their school district, and sustaining fulfilling relationships.

The basic formula for success is to identify what you want, know that you deserve to have it, and use the book’s principles to get you there. Think of the book as a road map: It can show you where to go, but you have to drive the route. In other words, achieving your goals requires you to make the time and effort to do the work.

### Shortform Introduction

We reorganized Canfield’s principles for clarity and coherence: We’ve grouped them into eight parts by theme (two more than Canfield’s six), combined similar principles, and omitted repetitive principles (Principle 9: Success Leaves Clues; Principle 22: Practice Persistence; and Principle 24: Exceed Expectations). The eight parts are:

  * Part 1: Learn the Success Basics
  * Part 2: Act With Intention
  * Part 3: Use Feedback to Your Advantage
  * Part 4: Prime Yourself for Success
  * Part 5: Grow Your Professional Skills and Network
  * Part 6: Cultivate Successful Relationships
  * Part 7: Cultivate Your Financial Success
  * Part 8: Make the Most of Technology



### How to Use This Book

Canfield offers the following tips for applying the principles in this book:

  1. **Read the book twice.** The first time, read it to gain the big picture of what you’ll work to achieve. The second time, spend the time you need to apply each step successively.
  2. **Mark it up.** Highlight material that is interesting to you and write notes in the margins. Interacting with the text will help you remember it and solidify principles.
  3. **Don’t dismiss principles you don’t like.** If you’re resistant to a certain principle, it might be a sign that you could benefit from applying it to your life.



While reading, try to:

  1. **Be mindful of your emotions.** You may react positively to the book’s advice, or you may bristle at certain concepts. You might feel resentful or sad that you didn’t learn the information sooner. Whatever your emotions, focus on feeling satisfied that it’s the right time for you to be learning the concepts. 
  2. **Give yourself time to apply the principles.** Learning the principles doesn’t mean you can achieve your goals overnight. For example, you couldn’t learn to speak French fluently with just a few months of practice at home. Applying the principles will take time. Even if you hit a wall and don’t feel like you’re making progress, don’t give up—give yourself more time than you think you need, and apply the principles diligently to achieve success.
