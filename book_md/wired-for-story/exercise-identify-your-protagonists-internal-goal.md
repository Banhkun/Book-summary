## Exercise: Identify Your Protagonist’s Internal Goal

Cron explains that everything your character does is driven by their internal goal. Identify this goal and use it to start a powerful story.

* * *

First, decide what external goals your protagonist wants to achieve or accomplish.

Next, you’ll figure out what _internal_ goal underpins the external goals. What is the protagonist’s internal motivation for pursuing their external goals? For instance, getting a new house is an external goal, but it may be driven by the _internal_ goal of achieving a sense of self-sufficiency.

How did your protagonist develop their internal goal? What was their worldview-changing event that created the inner conflict that fuels their goal?

Now that you know your protagonist’s internal goal, identify what obstacles you could put in their way to make it harder for them to achieve that goal. Remember that the more you put your protagonist through, the more satisfying their ultimate victory will be.
