## 1-Page Summary

Becoming a manager for the first time can be challenging. In _The First-Time Manager_ , Jim McCormick argues that to succeed in your new management role, you must **shift your focus from _tasks_ to _people_ and build a strong team of empowered employees capable of achieving exceptional results.** Whether you’re freshly promoted or looking to brush up on your management skills, McCormick provides the ultimate guide to successfully navigating the role and responsibilities of a manager, including tips for winning the trust of your team, managing performance, and delegating tasks.

McCormick is an expert in organizational risk and the founder and president of the Research Institute for Risk Intelligence. He’s served in executive roles for various real estate and construction companies. He’s given risk management speeches to a range of businesses and institutions, including Wells Fargo, the FBI, and colleges such as Rutgers University. He’s also the author of _The Power of Risk_ and _Business Lessons From the Edge._

In this guide, we’ll first share McCormick’s advice for transitioning into your new managerial role and winning the trust of your employees. Then, we’ll describe ways to build and empower a team that takes initiative and produces great results. Lastly, we’ll explore ways to handle your responsibilities as a manager effectively and prepare yourself for future opportunities. Along the way, we’ll provide insights from other business and management experts and supplement McCormick’s methods with actionable tips that can help you succeed in managing people.

### Part 1: How to Transition Into Your New Role as Manager

McCormick writes that your first goal as a new manager should be to**win the trust and confidence of your team.** He explains that trust doesn’t come with the title—some employees may be skeptical or indifferent about you, and you'll likely be compared with the previous manager. In this section, we’ll discuss how to introduce yourself as a competent manager and start earning the respect of your employees.

(Shortform note: In _Start With Why_ , Simon Sinek says people don’t automatically trust you just because you’re their manager because trust is a feeling __ that can’t be rationalized. It comes from the limbic brain, which is the part of your brain that’s responsible for your emotions. Because of this, you can’t earn people’s trust with logic or titles alone—you must _prove_ your trust by showing them that you share their beliefs and values. Sinek explains that people trust others who have similar beliefs, ideals, and values as they do.)

#### Exercise Your Authority Sparingly

First, to build trust with your team, McCormick suggests you **use your authority and power sparingly.** Many first-time managers mistakenly assume they need to establish dominance over their team and start issuing orders and acting assertively. But McCormick explains that your employees know you’re in charge. Making a show of authority will only give people a negative impression of you, potentially causing resentment or distrust. On the other hand, using your authority judiciously ensures that people respect it when it matters.

To avoid alienating people with your authority, you should **refrain from making any changes to how the team operates early on.** McCormick explains that most people dislike change and fear the unknown. Making changes right when you arrive can even seem like an insult to the previous manager.

Eventually, you’ll likely want to make some changes. When you do, communicate the change ahead of time and provide as much detail as possible to help employees prepare for it. Explain the reason behind the change and how it will affect them. To help employees be more receptive, ask them for suggestions on how the changes can be implemented effectively. Sharing information and getting employees involved helps them trust that you have their best interests at heart and makes them more receptive to the changes.

> **Gain Trust With Humility and Curiosity**
> 
> Other experts agree that as a new manager, you shouldn’t showcase your authority, and they say another way you can win people's trust and respect is to practice humility. In _Leadership Strategy and Tactics_ , Jocko Willink suggests you do so by considering yourself a part of the team instead of above it, as the latter creates resentment. You can also practice humility by avoiding condescending language, performing basic tasks with your team, and not acting defensive if you feel challenged. By being humble, people will respect you and naturally follow you.
> 
> McCormick also argues you shouldn’t make changes early on in your role, but what _should_ you do instead? Other experts say your first priority should be gathering information __ about your team and their workflow. Seek information from a variety of sources—different departments and roles—so that you have a wide-ranging view of your team’s needs, obstacles, and potential. Only after you have a deep understanding of your team should you start thinking about making any changes. When you do, start by only making changes to the one area that would have the most positive impact on your organization.
> 
> In _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne say as long as you treat people fairly in the change process, they’ll be accepting of the changes, even if they disagree with them. You can make the change process seem fair by helping people feel respected and heard. The authors echo much of McCormick’s advice, but add that you should invite your team members’ input early on and explain how you considered their input when sharing the reasoning behind your decisions.

#### Start Building Relationships With Your Employees

McCormick writes that another way to transition smoothly into your new management role is to **build relationships with your employees.** This makes people feel valued and helps you understand how to best support them.

McCormick recommends you start by meeting with each employee individually within the first 60 days. Focus on establishing a personal connection and communicate that you care about them individually and are there to support them. Lay out expectations for how you want to communicate with them—for instance, that you want them to share their goals, give feedback, and be open about their challenges.

(Shortform note: Building relationships with employees is one key component to leading with _radical candor_ —a way of managing people that focuses on truly caring about your employees. In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott says you can lead with this mindset by understanding and respecting your employees’ whole selves. When you meet with each employee, invite them to share things about their personal lives but respect their boundaries. When you show you care personally about your employees, they bring their best selves to work and achieve better results.)

After your first meeting, continue to have weekly one-on-one meetings with each employee. This not only helps you get to know them better, but it’s also a more efficient way of addressing any concerns they may have. Rather than having to vie for your attention or interrupt your work, employees can reserve the topics they want to discuss for their regular meeting with you.

(Shortform note: While McCormick recommends holding weekly one-on-one meetings, he doesn’t specify how to best conduct them. In _The Hard Thing About Hard Things_ , Ben Horowitz explains that one-on-ones are private, relatively informal meetings that you can use to discover problems and build on ideas. To run effective one-on-one meetings, let your employee drive: Let them set the agenda and encourage them to do 90% of the talking by asking open-ended questions.)

##### Communicate With Honesty and Transparency

A key element of building relationships with your employees and earning their trust and confidence is **practicing honest and open communication.**

(Shortform note: Although honest and open communication is highly valued by employees and executives, it’s lacking in many workplaces. In one study, less than 50% of respondents felt they worked in an environment in which people could talk about issues effectively and honestly, but nearly 100% said this type of environment was important to them.)

McCormick provides a few tips for communicating with honesty and transparency:

**Tip #1: Admit what you don’t know.** Many managers think they have to know everything or they’ll be judged negatively by their employees. But McCormick says you should admit when you don’t have the answers—doing so establishes trust. If you lie about what you know, you lose credibility and respect.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with McCormick and give tips for how to respond when you don’t know the answer: First, verify your understanding of the question. Then, if you still don’t know the answer, be honest, tell them you’ll need to do research, and give a date when you’ll follow up with them. This makes you seem human and relatable yet also assures people that you’re doing what you can to meet their needs.)

**Tip #2: Share what you _do_ know. **A good manager readily shares information with their employees instead of withholding it from them. If you leave your team in the dark, especially about matters that concern them, you’ll only spark rumors and spread inaccurate information.

(Shortform note: Some experts caution against sharing _too_ much information with your employees, as this could cause people to become distracted or overwhelmed. Instead, they recommend you find a middle ground: Give them the facts they need to succeed in their tasks and have an open door policy where your employees can ask any questions they might have.)

**Tip #3: Practice active listening.** To come across as engaged in a conversation so that the other person feels heard, adopt encouraging body language, make supportive statements, ask questions, and restate what the other person said. Active listening helps your employees feel valued and encourages them to speak up.

(Shortform note: When practicing McCormick’s active listening techniques, be sure you genuinely care about what the other person’s saying. In _The Energy Bus_ , Jon Gordon says you need to show empathy for the other person to feel heard, not just give off active listening cues. In _Time to Think_ , Nancy Kline advises specifically _against_ restating what the other person said. Restating people’s words gives the impression you weren’t listening well enough to remember them. Instead, she recommends you simply remain quiet and give them as much time as they need to say everything they want to say. This allows them to unravel and express everything on their mind.)

### Part 2: How to Build a Strong and Effective Team

Now let’s shift our focus to what’s arguably the most important task of a manager: Recruiting and maintaining a team of strong and effective individuals. In this section, we’ll discuss how to hire and train the right people, evaluate their performance and give feedback, and empower your team to take initiative.

#### Hire New Employees

First, to build a strong and effective team, you must **hire the right people and train them to succeed in their roles.** Bad hiring decisions can cost you time and money, while hiring the right person can add immense value to your team. Let’s look at some tips for identifying, selecting, and training the right candidates.

(Shortform note: According to some research, a bad hire can cost between $17,000 to $240,000 depending on the industry and position. Three out of five bad hires were due to employees being unable to perform to quality standards expected by their employers, which underscores the importance of having an effective hiring and training system.)

##### Identify and Interview Prospective Employees

To attract the right candidates, write a clear and effective job description. McCormick suggests that it cover three types of requirements: First, specify the knowledge and technical skills required for the job. Second, explain the behavioral qualities you’re looking for, such as being punctual. Third, lay out interpersonal requirements important for the job, such as accepting feedback positively.

(Shortform note: Some experts advise against listing a specific set of skills and behavioral qualities, arguing that this can limit your applicant pool and exclude people with diverse backgrounds and experiences who could bring great value to your organization. When writing your requirements, ask yourself whether each one is really necessary for the role to avoid narrowing down your options unnecessarily.)

Once you have prospective candidates to interview, McCormicks recommends you prioritize attitude over qualifications. He argues that an employee with a good attitude is more valuable than a better-qualified employee with a bad attitude. When interviewing your candidate, ask questions assessing attitude—for example, “What’s your ideal workday like?” Specifically, you should look for traits like commitment and good judgment as opposed to interest in social activities or holidays.

(Shortform note: In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek describes how many effective teams adopt the attitude-first approach to recruiting that McCormick suggests. For instance, the US Navy SEALS prioritize candidates who have good attitudes and can work well with the team over those with bad attitudes, even if they’re better performers. This is because team members with good attitudes will enhance the rest of the team’s performance while those who are difficult to work with will undermine the team’s efforts. Therefore, if the candidates you’re choosing between have all met a minimum standard of skill and competence, you should hire based on attitude to build a team capable of collaborating and achieving higher-level results.)

##### Train New Hires

Once you’ve selected a candidate, the next step is to train them to perform well in their role. McCormick suggests you **find a good trainer** to effectively train new hires. This should be someone who can clearly explain each responsibility and break down the job into smaller pieces so that the new hire doesn’t get overwhelmed. McCormick cautions against assigning a person who’s leaving or was recently fired from the role to train new employees because they won’t provide quality training. Once you have a trainer in mind, meet with them and discuss a training plan.

Next, spend the first day helping the new hire familiarize themselves with their new work environment. Take this time to **clearly communicate your expectations** —for instance, that you value attitude and continuous improvement. Provide them with support so that they can meet your standards and don’t expect perfection from them—this will prevent them from feeling overwhelmed.

> **Tips for Effective Training**
> 
> According to former Intel CEO Andrew Grove in _High Output Management,_ there are three elements to effective employee training: It must be consistent and regularly scheduled (as opposed to being a one-time workshop), tailored to the company’s practices, and be led by an authority figure. Ideally, Grove recommends you train your subordinates yourself. However, if you lack the time or knowledge to explain the job responsibilities well, it may be helpful to find a trainer and create a plan that satisfies those three factors.
> 
> When communicating expectations, other experts recommend you also ask employees what they expect from you __ so they can succeed in their role. This allows you to give them the support they need and help them avoid getting overwhelmed. One way you can help is by providing examples of good work done by other employees. This gives your new hire a clear idea of what you’re looking for. Having examples of good work to reference could also help you avoid having unrealistic expectations. Clear expectations not only enable people to perform tasks well, but also make them feel more motivated and prepared to do their job.

#### Manage Your Team’s Performance

To build a strong team, **manage your employees’ performance by providing regular feedback, conducting periodic performance reviews, and enforcing discipline when appropriate.** These techniques will help you enhance their overall productivity while helping them improve their skills and achieve their goals.

(Shortform note: McCormick focuses on how to manage and discipline employees on an individual level, but Michael Watkins recommends you also evaluate your team as a whole. In _The First 90 Days_ , Watkins suggests you review prior meeting minutes or team reports, look for similar patterns or disagreements among the answers people give in one-on-one meetings, and watch how the team interacts during meetings. This helps you keep track of how your team is performing as a unit.)

##### Give Regular Feedback

According to McCormick, a good manager makes sure their employees know how well they’re performing by **providing feedback on a regular, ongoing basis**. There are two types of feedback you can give: praise to encourage positive behavior and constructive criticism to help someone improve their behavior or performance.

When giving praise, describe in detail the work or behavior you’re praising. This helps people understand what behaviors you’re looking for and makes them more likely to behave similarly in the future. Also, describe the positive outcome that resulted from their actions because people enjoy feeling like they’re contributing to something greater.

(Shortform note: In _Nonviolent Communication_ , Marshall B. Rosenberg suggests you also express the positive emotion __ that resulted from the praiseworthy action. For example, if an employee shared an innovative solution to a problem, you could also mention how it made you feel excited. Rosenberg writes that sharing how someone’s behavior made you feel (in addition to describing the behavior and what they accomplished) makes your praise less judgmental and easier to accept.)

When giving constructive criticism, McCormick recommends you focus on addressing the behavior and not judging the person, which degrades people’s confidence and performance. Treat the behavior as a misunderstanding, ask for their input instead of doing all the talking, and give this criticism in private, such as in your office, so people feel less embarrassed.

> **Balance Praise and Criticism to Avoid Feedback Fatigue**
> 
> Many experts agree on the value of frequent feedback but note that finding the right balance of praise and criticism is crucial for motivating your employees to perform better. In _When They Win, You Win_ , Laraway suggests you aim for a ratio of five-to-one positive to negative pieces of feedback. Giving too much criticism makes people defensive and reluctant to make improvements. It can also cause people to experience feedback fatigue—or feeling overwhelmed and mentally drained by too much feedback. This happens because feedback requires change, which is often hard to do.
> 
> In addition to following Laraway’s ratio, there are some other ways to combat feedback fatigue:
> 
>   * Decide on the most important feedback and give it first. Then, wait until the person has implemented it before giving more feedback.
> 
>   * If you notice you’re repeatedly giving negative feedback to the same person, try to dial it back: First, tell the other person that you gave them too much feedback. Then, reaffirm their competence by acknowledging their positive behaviors and work. Finally, ask for their input on the best steps to move forward.
> 
> 


##### Conduct Performance Reviews

In addition to having informal feedback conversations, McCormick advises that you also **conduct formal performance reviews once or twice a year** to improve your team’s performance.**** These are periodic evaluations of each employee’s work that let them know how well they’re meeting expectations and how they can improve. According to McCormick, employees often want more feedback than many managers may assume.

(Shortform note: In _No Rules Rules_ , Reed Hastings describes an alternative approach to performance reviews: an annual 360-degree review. During these reviews, _everyone_ can evaluate and give feedback to one another, not just the manager. These can be written or conducted live. Either way, allow employees to give feedback to anyone—to bosses, coworkers, and subordinates—and encourage recipients to follow up about ways to improve. Encouraging feedback on all levels allows you to capitalize on the intelligence and perspectives of all team members, maximizing your organization’s ability to grow and improve.)

McCormick adds that you should be fair, honest, and objective when conducting performance reviews. Avoid rating every team member as satisfactory or above. This may be tempting to do, but giving inaccurate ratings deprives employees of the opportunity to grow and improve.

(Shortform note: To make objective evaluations of your team members, Michael Watkins, in _The First 90 Days_ , recommends using six criteria to assess them: competence, judgment, energy, focus, relationships, and trust. If you still find it hard to be honest or objective during your evaluations, consider seeking an expert outside of your team who can help assess an employee’s functional skills.)

##### Resolve Work Problems and Enforce Discipline

You’ll also need to know how to**resolve work problems and take disciplinary actions when appropriate.** This ensures your team maintains high standards and people are fairly rewarded for their efforts.

If you experience behavioral or performance problems with an employee, McCormick suggests you create a performance improvement plan. You can make one by dividing a sheet of paper into three sections—strengths, areas of improvement, and goals. Then, work with your employee to fill out each section and decide on a time frame for the goals.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that, while well-intentioned, performance improvement plans (PIPs) can often make things worse, not better, because they cause employees to feel insecure about their jobs. Instead, they recommend you discuss behavioral or performance issues and goals for improvement during your regular one-on-one meetings. Try to encourage honest conversations and understand the root cause of the behavior.)

You may need to occasionally dismiss an employee. Before you fire a worker, McCormick suggests you consider all possible alternatives, such as giving them additional training. However, while firing people can be hard, it’s often beneficial for the employee—they’ll likely be thankful to be in a position that better suits their strengths. Before dismissing someone, McCormick suggests you check that you have their performance or behavior documented to avoid potential lawsuits.

(Shortform note: McCormick recommends firing employees only as a last resort, but others advocate moving more quickly to dismiss problematic workers. In _No Rules Rules_ , Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings says you should fire any employee you wouldn’t fight to keep on your team. Instead of spending money and time on performance improvement plans, Hastings suggests offering a generous severance package. To have a top-tier team, you must replace good employees with great employees, he writes.)

#### Empower Your Team to Innovate and Take Initiative

McCormick writes that you can nurture a high-performing team by **empowering your employees to be innovative and to make independent decisions.** He explains that technology has made centralized decision-making outdated and ineffective. As a result, teams that can operate with self-efficacy will be better able to keep up with the fast pace of business.

(Shortform note: In _No Rules Rules_ , Reed Hastings argues that empowering your employees to make decisions on their own is not enough. You also need to share enough information with them so they can confidently make good decisions. Hastings advises you to be transparent with information, even if it’s sensitive financial data. If you’ve cultivated a team of trustworthy and talented individuals, sharing information with them should not be a risk but an advantage.)

##### Know What Kind of Support Your Employees Need

To empower your team members, first figure out what kind of support they need from you. Different employees need different amounts of control and encouragement from you to function at their best.**** Assess the support your employees need based on two things: motivation and skill level.

First, evaluate how much motivation your employee has. This helps you determine how much encouragement they need from you. A highly motivated employee needs little encouragement while an unmotivated employee needs a lot of encouragement.

Second, assess the level of their knowledge and skills. This helps you determine how much oversight and control you should exercise—for example, how detailed your instructions should be or how often you should check in on their work. The more knowledgeable and skilled an employee is, the less control they require to perform well.

> **Support Your Employees Based on Their Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)**
> 
> Tailoring your support based on motivation and skill is only one approach to figuring out the best management style for each of your team members. In _High Output Management_ , Andrew Grove proposes a different factor you can consider, which he refers to as _task-relevant maturity_ (TRM), to determine how involved you need to be. An employee’s TRM is how experienced, skilled, and mentally prepared they are to complete a specific task under specific circumstances.
> 
>   * For employees with low TRM, Grove recommends giving detailed guidance on what needs to be done and how it should be done, similar to what McCormick suggests you do with less motivated or skilled employees.
> 
>   * For employees with medium TRM, Grove suggests you mostly provide ideas but let the employees provide much of the structure and guidance themselves.
> 
>   * For employees with high TRM, give objectives but don’t get involved in the team’s work. Often, giving people the autonomy to do their work the way they see fit will boost their motivation.
> 
> 

> 
> Considering TRM in addition to motivation and knowledge might help you get a more accurate gauge of what your employees need from you. For example, someone might have high motivation and skill, but if they’ve been sent to do work in a new location, they may need more guidance and support than usual.

##### Build Your Team’s Confidence

McCormick writes that you can also empower your team by **finding ways to boost their confidence** so they feel capable of taking initiative and making decisions on their own.

One way to boost your team’s confidence is to provide them with little victories. You can do this by first assigning tasks that are relatively easy and within their capabilities. That way, they can achieve good results and feel more confident about their skills and their work.

(Shortform note: In addition to boosting your team’s confidence with small wins, make sure to give them time to pause and celebrate. In _Leadership is Language_ , L. David Marquet explains that giving your team time to celebrate provides them a sense of closure and progress, which boosts their productivity and engagement. They can reflect on the work they’ve done, learn from their experience, and improve their performance for upcoming tasks.)

Another way to increase your team’s confidence is to encourage employees to make decisions on their own. To do this, react to mistakes productively and don’t expect perfect decisions. People who fear making the wrong decision won’t make any at all, and if you harshly criticize those who do take initiative, you’ll only discourage them from trying. If someone makes a flawed decision, review the situation, discuss what could be done better next time, and thank them for taking the initiative.

(Shortform note: In _Turn This Ship Around_ , L. David Marquet recommends encouraging a language change to empower team members to make more decisions. Tell employees that instead of asking for permission, they should say what they intend to do—for example, “I intend to start on the next project phase.” This language change forces team members to make more decisions since they have to decisively state what actions they plan to do instead of asking others what they should do. This leads employees to take ownership of their tasks and become more engaged in their work.)

##### Motivate Your Employees

To run an empowered team, you also need to **keep your employees motivated.** To do this, figure out what drives them individually—what keeps them engaged in their work and pushes them to perform well. McCormick recommends several ways to motivate your employees:

**Method #1: Align individual and company goals.** Motivation varies from person to person, so McCormick recommends getting to know your employees’ goals, whether they’re interested in learning a new skill or networking with more people. To inspire them to do their best work, try to match their goals with those of the company—for instance, if they want to learn a particular skill, offer them training or mentorship opportunities.

(Shortform note: Promoting your employee’s goals in a way that benefits the overall organization also improves employee retention. Research shows that the main reason employees quit their jobs is because they feel they’re not growing or developing. One way to align employee goals and company needs is to transfer or promote them to a role that matches their goals. If this isn’t viable, try to provide them with education, exposure, or experience opportunities—offer courses or workshops, assign them mentors, or give them opportunities to practice skills they’re interested in.)

**Method #2: Share positive outcomes.** People enjoy contributing to something bigger than themselves. Showing how their efforts contribute to a positive outcome gives their work more meaning and motivates them to work hard.

**Method #3: Give rewards.** Rewards show people that their performance and efforts matter and are therefore a great motivator for employees. You should not only reward successful endeavors, McCormick writes, but also thoughtful and well-executed ones that don’t succeed. This encourages people to take innovative risks instead of playing it safe to avoid failure.

> **Boost Your Employees’ Intrinsic Motivation**
> 
> In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink explains that people are driven by two types of motivation—extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic motivation comes from external rewards, such as money or recognition. Conversely, intrinsic motivation is based on internal satisfaction, such as purpose or enjoyment. Pink says intrinsic motivation is more powerful and self-sustaining, leading to better performance in the long run.
> 
> Sharing positive outcomes aligns with one element of intrinsic motivation: purpose. Like McCormick, Pink notes that humans are biologically wired to want to contribute to a cause that reaches beyond themselves. He writes that you can enhance this sense of purpose when sharing positive outcomes by using words that reflect meaningful ideals like “honor” or “beauty” as opposed to less inspiring words like “value” or “differentiation.” For example, if you’re leading a marine conservation team, you might discuss how your efforts have restored the beauty of coral reefs.
> 
> Rewards, on the other hand, are external motivators. Pink argues that most rewards actually _decrease performance_ because they reduce people’s sense of autonomy. Once people start doing things for external rewards, they feel less in control of their lives and subconsciously reason that they don’t enjoy the task if they’re getting compensated for it. To reward people without depleting their motivation, Pink suggests giving unexpected rewards once the task has already been completed.

### Part 3: Tips to Excel as a First-Time Manager

We’ve discussed how to transition into your new role as manager and how to effectively build and nurture a productive team. In this section, we’ll explore tips for excelling in your management role.

#### Use Your Time and Resources Wisely

McCormick writes that great managers know how to use their time and resources effectively. Two ways you can increase your efficiency are to **delegate tasks to your employees and run productive meetings.**

**1) Delegate tasks.** Delegate by reflecting on your current tasks and reassigning any that might help your employees develop their skills or improve your organization's efficiency. Consider which person on your team is best suited for each task, then meet with them to discuss it in detail. By delegating tasks, you can save time and energy for important responsibilities and prevent high turnover, which often occurs when employees are only assigned low-value work.

(Shortform note: When delegating tasks, don’t tell people what to do and how to do it. In _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Steven R. Covey says this delegation approach wastes time and energy, which defeats the purpose of delegating the task. Instead, tell your employees the goal and allow _them_ to devise the plan of action. To help them succeed, communicate six things: The results you’re looking for, the rules and guidelines, ineffective methods, available resources, how the results will be evaluated, and the consequences of success or failure.)

**2) Run productive meetings.** McCormick suggests sending out a meeting agenda in advance to all participants. This ensures everyone is prepared beforehand, which wastes less time. Only invite people who need to be there and during the meeting, discuss the most important topics first. Running productive meetings saves your organization time and money.

(Shortform note: In _Death By Meeting_ , Patrick Lencioni suggests having multiple types of meetings with different purposes and structures. He recommends four: The check-in meeting (a daily 5-minute meeting for everyone to discuss what they’re working on), the tactical meeting (an hour-long meeting to discuss updates on larger logistical issues, like whether the team is meeting goals), the strategic meeting (a two-to-four hour long meeting to discuss three big questions), and the review (a longer discussion about the direction of your organization). Having multiple types of meetings ensures everyone knows what to expect, what needs to be accomplished, and how to prepare accordingly.)

#### Keep Developing Yourself

According to McCormick, good managers also continuously develop their emotional intelligence and communication skills. By improving these skills, you’ll gain a better understanding of how to support your team’s success.

Having high emotional intelligence means you have good people skills, can recognize your own and other people’s feelings, and can cope well with stress. McCormick says emotional intelligence can be improved and suggests you work on doing so to improve your ability to build relationships and empower your team.

(Shortform note: While McCormick doesn’t explain how you can develop emotional intelligence, other experts provide some guidance. According to Jean Greaves and Travis Bradberry in _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , the first step is developing more self-awareness—knowing your emotions. You can practice this skill by paying attention to how your body responds when you experience an emotion—for example, you might notice your heart beats quickly when you’re anxious. By recognizing your body’s physical responses to an emotion, you can more quickly recognize how you’re feeling in your daily life.)

McCormick also argues that you must be able to express yourself well if you want to manage people and projects successfully. To improve your communication skills, both verbal and written, seek out training or books as well as clubs to practice public speaking in.

(Shortform note: Research shows that effective communication has become even more important in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of hybrid and remote work. One study analyzed 6.5 million job postings and found that effective communication was the most sought-after soft skill, appearing 35 times more than other skills like empathy or adaptability. This supports McCormick’s suggestion to improve your communication skills regardless of the field you’re in.)

#### Work Well With Your Superiors

Your success as a manager depends not only on how well you work with your team, but also on how well you work with your superiors. Just as you should seek to understand your employees, you should also **understand the needs and work preferences of those you report to.** Figure out how your manager likes to communicate and adapt accordingly. As a rule of thumb, you should always keep them updated on your current projects and be respectful of their time by being well-prepared.

(Shortform note: Proactively figuring out how to be the best employee you can be for your superiors is often referred to as “managing up.” In _The First 90 Days_ , Michael Watkins gives a few additional tips on how you can do so. He recommends having a discussion with your boss about what success looks like in your role. You should then learn your boss’s working style by being observant or talking with people who have worked with them in the past. Watkins also suggests you discuss differences in your work or communication styles to avoid potential conflicts or misunderstandings.)

#### Prepare for Future Opportunities

Once you’ve cultivated a team of empowered employees and learned to successfully handle your managerial responsibilities, you can start positioning yourself for promotion. McCormick suggests you **plan for someone to replace your current role once you’re comfortably performing your job well.** This way, you can avoid creating a gap in your department that would make it difficult for upper management to promote you. By having someone who can fill your position, you put yourself in a better position to be promoted.

If you already have someone in mind, let them handle small portions of your job until they’ve learned most of it. If you don’t have a potential replacement in mind, consider letting several employees take on some of your tasks. Once you have someone capable of taking over, start talking about their potential to your boss.

(Shortform note: McCormick’s suggestion to prepare a replacement for your role is known as “succession planning,” a practice encouraged by many experts. If you’re not sure which employee is best suited for the job, figure out which team member the other team members _already_ go to for support. This is a sign that this person has good leadership abilities and communication skills. However, before you start handing over some responsibilities, discuss their career aspirations with them first and make sure they’re interested in being promoted. Once they’ve expressed interest, talk about your role with them and let them shadow you before delegating tasks.)
