## Exercise: Identify Your Success Strategies

Lencioni says that to maintain organizational health, you need three primary strategies that your company can use to achieve its core purpose. These strategies will provide your company with guidance when creating _short-term goals_ , _areas of improvement_ , and _to-do_ _lists_.

* * *

Clearly state your organization’s core purpose and brainstorm all the possible ways you can achieve that purpose. (For example, imagine that your purpose is to influence more people to care for the environment. You might be able to achieve this by handing out brochures in public places like universities or train stations, getting popular people like celebrities or influencers to advocate for your cause, petitioning government organizations to change or enforce policies, holding rallies, selling products at popular grocery stores, and so on.)

Next, paste your strategy list from the previous step below, re-organize your list into several groups based on their common themes, and give each theme a descriptive name. (For example, your themes might be “make eco-friendly products more available to the public,” “increase public awareness of environmental issues,” “change government policies around environmental issues,” and so on.) These will be your success strategy options.

Finally, state the top three success strategies that you think will be most helpful in achieving your core purpose and describe _why_ they’ll be the most effective. These will be the core success strategies that will guide your short-term goals.
