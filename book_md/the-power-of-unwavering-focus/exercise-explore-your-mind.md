## Exercise: Explore Your Mind

Dandapani asserts that your mind is a space and that your awareness is an orb that moves around that space. In this exercise, you'll have a chance to practice guiding your awareness.

* * *

Dandapani explains that before you start guiding your awareness, you must first become _conscious of your awareness_. Focus on your awareness and write about what youâ€™re experiencing at this very moment. Sensory perceptions? Thoughts? Feelings?

Try to detach your awareness from whatever it's currently hooked on. Recall that Dandapani suggests focusing on a small physical motion like wiggling your toes or reinterpreting a distracting activity. (For example, think of your Instagram feed as just lights on a screen.) Then write about how it went. Were you able to dislodge your attention? Was it difficult or easy? How so?

Lastly, without getting up or changing your environment, set an intention for your awareness. What part of your experience would you like to focus on now? See if you can gently guide your awareness to this region of your mind, and hold it there for as long as you can. Then write down how it went. What was this experience like? What was challenging or easy about it?
