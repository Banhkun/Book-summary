## Chapter 3: Deliberate Practice

In the first chapter, we talked about purposeful practice: reaching new levels of performance by pushing yourself just beyond your comfort zone. But truly effective practice is more complicated than that. You need to go a step beyond even purposeful practice. You need to embrace _deliberate_ practice.

### Principles of Deliberate Practice

Truly effective practice goes a step _beyond_ purposeful practice, to _deliberate_ practice. Working hard and pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone, by themselves, are not enough. Deliberate practice builds on the principles of purposeful practice, but it applies them in a systematic, rigorous framework that leads to the level of performance we see from experts. Unlike purposeful practice, **deliberate practice isn’t about fulfilling your potential—it’s about _building_ it, making possible what was once impossible.**

With deliberate practice, you are working with highly developed and well-accepted training methods that have been proven effective in getting results. These methods have been honed and perfected by those who came before you into a near-science. With purposeful practice, if you push yourself, you might see improvement. With _deliberate_ practice, you’ll become an expert. There are a few key features of deliberate practice.

Deliberate practice is defined by five characteristics that separate it from purposeful practice.

  1. **Deliberate practice can be measured precisely.** Whether it’s a win/loss record in chess or your finish times in a sprint, there are objective ways for you to evaluate your performance. It is informed and guided by the past achievements of great performers in a given field and an understanding of what exactly it is these individuals did that made them great.**** There are defined standards of excellence with deliberate practice—a mental representation of what ultimate success looks like.
  2. **Deliberate practice is competitive**. This provides aspiring experts with a motivation to keep practicing and improving. You want to be the best in your field.
  3. **Deliberate practice is time-tested.** You’re not trying to do something that no one else has ever done before. Instead, you’re operating in a field where best practices have been developed over a long period of time—even _centuries_. You’re following the template that experts before you have followed successfully, using skills that have been developed over a long period of time. This gives these fields a large body of past work to which current students can look for reference.
  4. **Deliberate practice is done under the tutelage of teachers and coaches.** With deliberate practice, you’re working in a field whose high level of development and venerable history of best practices have produced a highly skilled and sophisticated cadre of professional mentors who can guide you every step along your path to expertise. You’re working within a practice regimen designed by a coach, with lesson plans drawn from training techniques that have proven to be effective over the long history of the field in which you’re working.
  5. **Deliberate practice demands rigorous training and maximal effort, which is often unpleasant.** Like purposeful practice, it is precise and targeted: you’re working to master a specific skill, not achieve some vague general “improvement.” This is why effective deliberate practice usually rests on a foundation of existing skill sets: you’re applying deliberate practice to an area where you _already_ have some foundational knowledge or skill.



Thus, for deliberate practice to be effective, it’s best to employ it in the right field. Some pursuits, like playing in a rock band, are too subjective. There’s no clear definition of what constitutes a “good” or “great” band. There’s no clear-cut way to measure performance.

**It’s also a slow, iterative process. Contrary to popular belief, there are no big leaps or breakthroughs**. It’s grinding and painstaking, with progress being made in a series of little steps. What looks to an observer like a sudden leap forward is actually the last in a series of baby steps.

**Critically, it depends on effective mental representations, which show you how to do your task properly and correct yourself when you make mistakes**. And, as we’ve seen, mental representations and improved performance form a virtuous circle: the better you get, the more fleshed-out and detailed your mental representations will be, which, in turn, gives you the tools to improve even more.

### Innate Talent or Deliberate Practice?

Anders Ericsson studied the development of musical ability in violinists at the Berlin University of the Arts. He and his team of researchers grouped the students into three categories of ability: broadly speaking, they were “best,” “better,” and “good.” The purpose of the experiment was to try to understand what separated the outstanding musicians from those who were simply “good.” **Was it a matter of innate talent, or was it a product of deliberate practice?**

Given the extreme difficulty of playing the violin, it requires a great deal of solitary practice time to master the instrument. It is crucial to practice outside of scheduled sessions with one’s teacher. The students were honest with the researchers: the intensive solo practice sessions weren’t fun. It would have been much more pleasurable devoting that time to something else. But they saw practice as being crucial to their development as musicians, so they kept at it.

**The researchers found that the only major difference among the three groups was how much time they devoted to solitary, deliberate practice**. They calculated that the “good” students would practice an average of 3,420 hours on the violin by the time they turned 18; the “better” students would practice an average of 5,301 hours; and the “best” students would practice an average of 7,410 hours.

There were no shortcuts to becoming an excellent violinist. All of the top achievers had devoted several thousand hours of practice to the instrument: none of them were “prodigies” who simply surpassed their peers without putting in any practice. The quality of practice was also crucial: the students were not merely repeating the same exercises over and over in their practice sessions. Instead, they were employing the principles of deliberate practice—precise goals, competitive focus, and operating within a time-tested training regimen based on the best practices of centuries of accumulated knowledge in the field.

### Putting Information Into Context

If we look back to Steve’s experience with memorizing numbers, we’ll recall that he used purposeful practice. And, to be sure, it was very effective in getting him to memorize far larger strings of digits than he had been able to before: he went from being stuck at nine to memorizing an 82-digit sequence.

But the world’s best digit memorizers have performances that far outshine Steve’s. Feng Wang of China, for example, has proven able to recall up to 300 digits! How is this possible? **Feng is using deliberate practice, applying the known techniques of the world’s greatest digit memorizers.**

In his case, the technique is about developing a mental representation for all 100 possible pairs of two digits from 00 to 99. Each of these pairs represents some symbol or object. For example, 63 is a banana and 89 is a monk. **He is thus able to break down long strings of numbers into more meaningful, context-specific chunks of information, which aids in memorization**. He then places them in a specific location within his mental map (a pot, let’s say). Thus, the four-digit string “6389” isn’t a meaningless jumble of numbers, it’s “banana” and “monk,” and when he retrieves them from his mental map, it’s “There is a banana in the pot; the monk splits the banana.”

### Picking Your Experts

But what if you want to improve in a field that doesn’t quite have the same clear-cut standards for excellent performance that a field like classical music does? How do you find the experts after which you should model your training?

If this is the case, try to get as close as you can to finding who the experts are in your field. Although it is subjective and therefore liable to error, you can usually start with identifying people who have been acknowledged as exceptional by their peers. For example, while there are no defined criteria for what makes a good screenwriter, people whose work has been critically acclaimed and commands the respect of people who are knowledgeable about the field would be reasonably good candidates to consider as experts.

**Once you’ve identified your experts (or at least the next best thing), you should investigate _how_ they achieved their level of performance**. Again, this may be difficult because of the important role that we know mental representations play in achieving this level of mastery. Because it’s such an internal process, it’s difficult for an outsider to learn about someone _else’s_ mental representations simply by observing that person. Moreover, one expert’s mental representations may be very different from another’s.

But if you can’t unlock their precise mental representations, you can usually study how they train. You may not be able to know exactly what they’re _thinking_ , but you can certainly find out what they’re _doing_. Hone in on the things they’re doing differently from everyone else and try to replicate it. If you see that it’s working, great, keep doing it! If it’s proving to be ineffective, try something else.

### The Myth of the 10,000 Hour Rule

In his book _Outliers_ , Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become great in essentially every field of human endeavor. It’s appealing because it’s simple to remember and posits an easy cause-and-effect relationship.

But it isn’t true: it’s a gross oversimplification of the accepted research on the effects of deliberate practice. What Gladwell did was extrapolate the data that Anders Ericsson (the author of _Peak_) compiled from the study of the violin students, which we discussed earlier in this summary. If you’ll recall, the results of that study showed that the best violin students would practice around 7,400 hours by the time they turned 18—Gladwell simply extended that rate of practice to the age of 20 to get the 10,000 hours figure, because it was a nice, round number.

But there’s nothing particularly significant about the figure of 10,000 hours. Moreover, the number (if there can even be said to be such a number) varies greatly from field to field. Digit-memorization at the level of a Feng Wang takes far fewer hours of practice than becoming a concert violinist.

Also, Gladwell’s figure treats “practice” as monolithic: he makes no distinction between different _kinds_ of practice. But as we’ve seen,**quality of practice matters more than quantity**. Sitting in your room and merely repeating the same lesson over and over again for a set number of hours is far different from true deliberate practice, which makes use of clear goals and effective mental representations, in which you address weaknesses and make specific improvements. Not all practice is created equal.

(Shortform note: We believe that Ericsson misconstrued Malcolm Gladwell’s point. In _Outliers_ , Gladwell was arguing that if 10,000 hours of practice are required to achieve mastery, only the privileged have the resources, free time, and parental support to devote to practice, especially as children. Gladwell’s focus wasn’t on the particular number of hours or the type of practice. Read more in our summary of Outliers.)
