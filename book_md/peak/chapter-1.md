## Chapter 1: The Right Kind of Practice

We are in awe of the world’s peak performers in music, athletics, and countless other fields. People like tennis star Roger Federer, Olympic vaulter McKayla Maroney, or history’s brilliant composers like Beethoven, Chopin, and Rachmaninoff seem to us to be otherworldly figures, overflowing with an almost divine talent. Surely these individuals must be in possession of some rare gift, some innate spark that the rest of us simply don’t have.

But that isn’t the case at all. **How did these people become so good at what they do? The answer may seem banal, but it’s true: they practiced.** They practiced the right way, they practiced with the right people, and they practiced a _lot_. Moreover, across all these fields, the principles of effective practice are the same, because they involve the same mental processes. The specific techniques may differ, but the basic process of challenge and improvement is the same: ballerinas and laparoscopic surgeons both become great using the same basic process. And because we can look to the great achievers of the past and present and study their success, we have a blueprint: we, too, can achieve new heights of performance.

We’ve all heard the phrase “practice makes perfect.” The more you work at something, the better you’ll get at it. But is this true of _all_ kinds of practice? Will mere repetition of the same task over and over again really improve your abilities? Or is there a certain _kind_ of practice that truly challenges you to reach greater and greater heights of achievement, one that unlocks your true potential?

**Most of us think of “practice” as the simple repetition of a task**. And, to be sure, this kind of practice will yield some results. If you’re learning how to play tennis, for example, you’ll probably be able to iron out your most embarrassing mistakes and figure out how to serve the ball somewhat competently. You can go out and play tennis with your friends and be able to hold your own (or at least not embarrass yourself). But still, some weaknesses in your tennis skills persist and certain elements of the game elude you.

For most people in most fields, this level of performance is good enough. They don’t push themselves to achieve beyond this point. They have a general idea of what they want to achieve, practice until they reach an acceptable level, and consider themselves to have “learned” it. But this approach actually stunts your learning. Once you reach your accepted level of performance, you’ll plateau and stop improving. Without changing your practice routine, you’ll never improve.

Crucially, it’s _not_ about mere repetition or devoting more time to the task. **Once you’ve reached your accepted level of performance, additional years of merely repetitive practice don’t help**. An average driver who’s been driving for five years is no better than her counterpart who has 20 years of driving experience. At this point, you receive diminishing returns on your practice. To truly improve, you need to change _how_ you practice. It’s not just about practice: it’s about _purposeful_ practice.

### Breaking Through Your “Natural” Limits

_Purposeful_ practice has four distinct components that distinguish it from merely repetitive practice.

  1. **Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals**. If you’re learning to play a piece of music, your practice regimen shouldn’t be “I’ll just play for an hour every day.” It should be, “I’ll play the piece until I can do it without any mistakes three times in a row.” The key to purposeful practice is putting a series of small steps together as you work toward a longer-term goal. Each subsequent step challenges you just a bit more than the previous one. 
  2. **Purposeful practice demands complete focus**. You need to give the task at hand your full attention and keep your mind squarely on the thing you’re trying to achieve. If your practice routine is filled with distractions, if you’re procrastinating, or if you are doing it in a location where you’re not going to be able to focus, you’re unlikely to be successful. People’s ideal conditions for focus and attention vary (some people need music to study, for example, while others require absolute silence). But however you do it, you need to keep your mind squarely on the thing you’re trying to achieve.
  3. **Purposeful practice involves feedback**. You need someone who can guide you, praise you when you do something right, tell you precisely _how_ you’re falling short—and how you can improve. This way, you can check your progress: you always know exactly where you stand in the learning process. If you’re falling short, you need someone who can tell you precisely _how_ you’re falling short—and how you can improve. But you also need meaningful _positive_ feedback as well. Indeed, positive feedback is critical for maintaining the kind of motivation and discipline required for purposeful practice, which is often tedious, long, and unpleasant.
  4. **Purposeful practice requires you to step out of your comfort zone**. You’re never going to improve if you only do the things that are already easy for you. Once you’ve gotten comfortable, it’s time to challenge yourself further. The _quality_ of practice matters much more than the quantity. For example, research has shown that doctors who have been practicing for 30 years actually do _worse_ on certain measures of performance than their colleagues who are only a few years out of medical school. This is because the senior doctors aren’t engaging in purposeful practice. Most of their day-to-day activities keep them squarely in their comfort zone: they aren’t being challenged at all.



The effects of purposeful practice can be nothing short of remarkable. Evidence shows that **the actual structure and function of the human brain change in response to the right type of mental training** , just as muscles change and grow in response to physical exercise. MRIs show that the brains of people with particular skills look very different from those of people _without_ those skills.

One experiment at the University of Alabama showed that the region of the brain controlling the left hand was significantly larger in violin, cello, and guitar players (for whom control of the fingers on the left hand is vitally important) than it was in non-musicians. In fact, the string players’ brains had adapted to the years of purposeful practice by converting a portion of the brain normally reserved for controlling the palm into one solely dedicated to the left fingers.

### Breaking Homeostasis

**Why does this method of practice work? Because it challenges homeostasis**. This is the level of stress or exertion to which your body is accustomed. The principle is well-understood by physical trainers: to really see those gains at the gym, you need to exert your muscles and cardiovascular system to the point where your body can no longer maintain homeostasis. Once this happens, your body adapts to reach homeostasis at a _new_ level.

By pushing your body hard enough and long enough, you “trick” it into using its desire for homeostasis to your advantage. Over time, your body will change in ways that enable you to run that extra mile or lift that extra 50 pounds.

Much the same principle applies to the human brain. The more you push yourself, the more the structure and chemistry of your brain will adapt to meet the new challenges. Of course, just like in the gym, you can’t push yourself too hard—that will only lead to burnout. But by forcing yourself to go just beyond your comfort zone, you can begin to trigger remarkable structural changes. It is in this sweet spot beyond your comfort zone that your brain can change most quickly and effectively. _This_ is what underlies purposeful practice. A few examples of purposeful practice in action will show just how powerful it can be.

#### Breaking Through the Plateaus

Anders Ericsson, author of _Peak_ , once conducted an experiment at Carnegie Mellon University, the purpose of which was to measure the capability of human memory and the effect of practice on improving memory. The test subject, an undergraduate named Steven, was read a series of digits, which he was then asked to repeat back to the author.

The results were remarkably consistent at first: Steven was fairly successful at memorizing eight-digit number strings, mediocre with nine-digit strings, and totally unsuccessful with ten-digit strings. **It seemed that he had reached some sort of natural plateau** , a sharp mental barrier than prevented him from memorizing any more than nine numbers.

Ericsson decided to try a different approach, with a new method of training. He would present Steve with _five_ -digit strings: if Steve repeated it back correctly, Ericsson would add one more digit to the string to make it six digits. If Steve got it wrong, Ericsson would drop the length of the string by two digits. This approach kept Steve constantly challenged, asking him each time to slightly outperform his previous best performance. **_This_ was purposeful practice in action: a well-defined goal, with each baby step along the way challenging the learner a bit more.**

And it worked: in a few days, Steve managed to memorize an 11-digit sequence, two better than his previous record. He had smashed through the barrier: the “natural” ceiling had proved to be an illusion. As the author continued with this training method, Steve’s memory continued to improve and reach new heights: after hundreds of sessions, Steve was able to successfully recite back 82 digits! Throughout, he was motivated by the positive feedback he received from the author and the team of co-researchers, as well as his own intrinsic desire to challenge himself and achieve new levels of performance.

#### Growing the Hippocampus

**To become a licensed cab driver in London, one must pass a series of tests, believed to be among the most difficult in the world to pass**. The tests measure “The Knowledge,” everything that a London cabbie is required to know, including every street, park, monument, government office, hospital, place of worship, museum, hotel, restaurant, and general point of interest. They must know the fastest route to get _to_ any of these places _from_ any other place within the giant metropolis. Needless to say, mastering “The Knowledge” is an extraordinary feat, one that tests the limits of human memory.

**How do they achieve this? Through purposeful practice**. They must first master a list of 320 journeys (trips between two points within the city), memorizing the location of every conceivable landmark or point of interest along each journey and finding the optimal route from the beginning to the endpoint. But this is only the start. The successful candidates continue to challenge themselves, finding new journeys and adding more buildings and landmarks to their memory.

**One experiment showed that the hippocampus—the part of the brain engaged in spatial navigation—is larger in London cab drivers than it is in non-cab drivers**. The same experiment showed that, _before_ they completed their training, applicants to the taxi program had similarly sized hippocampi as individuals who had never applied to become taxi drivers. Drilling down even further, the research showed that successful applicants who had managed to become licensed taxi drivers had larger hippocampi than both the unsuccessful applicants and those who had never entered the program at all. This proved that there was something about the process of gaining “The Knowledge” that altered the structure and capabilities of the drivers’ brains.
