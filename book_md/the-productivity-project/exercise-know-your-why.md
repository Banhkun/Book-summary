## Exercise: Know Your Why

Bailey argues that to become more productive, you must first have a compelling reason for doing so. He explains that knowing _why_ you want to become more productive will help keep you motivated and hold you accountable.

* * *

To start thinking about your why, brainstorm three to five values that are important to you (such as honesty or creativity).

Describe how these values are connected to some of your long-term goals (personal or professional).

How will becoming more productive help you reach these goals?
