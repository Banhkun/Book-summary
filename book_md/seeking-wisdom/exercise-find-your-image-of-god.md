## Exercise: Find Your Image of God

Cameron explains that the first step in your spiritual journey should be coming up with your image of God. If your image of God isn’t an entity you can trust and love, it’ll be difficult to reach your full creative potential.

* * *

Describe the image of God that you grew up with, or that is dominant in the society that you live in. List the characteristics that describe this God—its appearance, attitude, behavior, name, and so on.

Describe how you feel about this God—what characteristics do you like and dislike? If there are any aspects of this God that you strongly disagree with, explain what they are and why.

Now describe your ideal image of God. If it has a physical form, what does it look or smell like? If it has a voice, what does it sound like? What are the characteristics of its personality? How would you feel if you were in the presence of this God?
