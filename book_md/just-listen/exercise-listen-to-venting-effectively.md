## Exercise: Listen to Venting Effectively

Goulston emphasizes the importance of listening effectively to overcome someone’s emotional barrier and help them feel understood. Apply his listening strategies to influence the people in your life.

* * *

Think of a time when you were talking to an emotional person and you didn’t allow them to thoroughly vent their feelings. What did you do instead of listening? For example, maybe you told them to calm down or you rushed to offer solutions. How did they respond?

How could you have applied Goulston’s advice to help them vent their emotions thoroughly? For example, could you have asked them to explain their problem to you and encouraged them to keep explaining when they paused?

Consider how you could have made the person you were talking to feel more understood. Did you empathize with their feelings or ask them to explain why they were feeling the way they did? Knowing what you know now, what would you have said differently?
