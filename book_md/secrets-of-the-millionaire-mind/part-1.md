## Part 1: Your Money Mindset Defines Your Level of Wealth

T. Harv Eker argues that there’s only one thing holding you back from the wealth that you want: your money mindset. We’ll discuss this concept in three parts.

In this first part of the guide, we’ll explain what your money mindset is, how your childhood influenced its formation, and how it impacts your attitude and behavior around money. We’ll also discuss your “financial setpoint”: the amount of money you feel you can comfortably manage.

In the second part, we’ll explore the difference between a _poor mindset_ and a _rich mindset_. We’ll also clarify how negative conditioning leads you to develop tendencies that inhibit you from taking positive actions to improve your finances.

In the final part, we’ll cover specific techniques and strategies to help you adopt a rich mindset so that you can develop wealthy habits and ensure your financial success.

### What Is Your Money Mindset?

According to Eker, your money mindset is a construct of all of the beliefs you hold about money. This construct programs the way you relate to money because:

  1. Your thoughts and beliefs determine how you feel. 
  2. Your feelings determine the decisions you make and how you act. 
  3. Your actions determine the results you get and how much money you have. 



Therefore, this programming leads you to develop habits and behave (often unconsciously) in specific ways to create results that align with your money mindset.

> **Your Thoughts About Money Impact Every Area of Your Life**
> 
> Eker claims that your money mindset holds all of your beliefs about money, and these beliefs lead you to think, feel, and act in ways to produce results that align with your beliefs. Many personal development practitioners teach this concept—the consensus is that people develop patterns of behavior based on beliefs that they’re unaware of.
> 
> However, while Eker narrows down this concept to focus solely on money, psychologists and self-help practitioners argue that your beliefs impact _all_ areas of your life, even if they _seem_ to relate to just one. This is because how you think, feel, and behave in one area of your life influences the decisions you make in all areas of your life.
> 
>   * For example, you feel insecure about your love life. Each time you get into a relationship, you give up a lot of your time and energy in an attempt to make the relationship work. Your insecurity about your relationship leads you to neglect your friends and your personal goals, such as maintaining a fitness routine or working on side projects to meet your financial goals. 
> 

> 
> The example illustrates the difficulty with singling out thoughts and beliefs for specific areas of your life—in this case, your beliefs about your love life impact your finances, your fitness, and your friendships. Therefore, throughout the rest of this guide, reflect on how your thoughts and beliefs in all areas of your life impact your finances and vice versa—how your thoughts and beliefs about money impact your overall life experience.

#### Your Money Mindset Is a Result of Childhood Conditioning

Eker claims that your current money mindset is a result of childhood conditioning. As a child, you unconsciously absorbed thoughts, emotions, and beliefs about money from your role models and your environment. Everything you heard, saw, and experienced about money influenced your beliefs about how to manage your finances, and conditioned you to behave in specific ways.

These thoughts and opinions now make up your mindset and determine what you believe about money. These beliefs then unconsciously dictate how you think, feel, and behave when you manage your finances.

For example, if your role models worked hard but never had enough money to enjoy themselves, you may have the belief: “There is never enough money, no matter how hard I work.” This belief creates an uncomfortable feeling every time you think about going to work or managing your finances, and it leads you to act in unproductive ways such as frivolously spending your money instead of saving it. Your discomfort may also cause you to resent people who do have enough money. In contrast, if you grew up in an environment where money was not a cause for concern because there was always enough, you’re less likely to feel discomfort or resentment around the subject of work and money.

> **Your Conditioning Is a Result of What You Believe to Be True**
> 
> The author of _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz, validates Eker’s argument that you picked up beliefs throughout your childhood that conditioned you to behave in certain ways. He argues that _you unconsciously adopted the opinions and beliefs of others as**truths**_ , regardless of whether or not these opinions were based on facts.
> 
> Why did your mind accept what you heard, saw, and experienced as truth? It’s because your nervous system can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality—it can only respond to what you think or imagine to be true. When you were young, you were less able to question what was going on around you and to form your own rational conclusions. As a result, you simply absorbed everything you experienced and _your mind accepted these experiences as truths_.
> 
> **As an adult, you can decide what you choose to believe** but, according to Maltz, the “truths” you accepted as a child continue to live in your mind and inform your feelings and behaviors. He suggests that you take control of these outdated truths and replace them with what you _choose to believe_ by regularly visualizing yourself acting in ways that align with what you want.
> 
>   * For example, if you want to believe that you can enjoy your work _and_ earn a high income, visualize yourself performing this work and try to imagine how it would _feel_ to achieve this. 
> 

> 
> Maltz claims that, with constant practice, your mind will gradually become accustomed to accepting your new thoughts and beliefs as _truth_ and will let go of the old, unproductive beliefs.

##### Your Childhood Influences: Are You Conforming or Rebelling?

Eker argues that while your money mindset is a result of childhood conditioning, it doesn’t always mean that you’ll replicate your role models when it comes to managing your money. You may end up producing entirely different results depending on **how you originally chose to interpret** what was going on and whether you chose to conform or rebel against your upbringing. In either case, your interpretation of your upbringing defined the beliefs in your money mindset.

(Shortform note: Eker claims that your** _interpretation_** of your experiences defines your beliefs. Similarly, Maltz (_Psycho-Cybernetics_) argues that **_the way that you identify with your experiences_** determines the beliefs you form. For example, if your guardians couldn’t afford to buy you something you wanted, you could’ve identified with this experience in multiple ways—you could’ve appreciated your parents for doing the best that they could, or you could’ve responded with feelings of anger and disappointment. Whatever emotion you chose created corresponding beliefs in your mind.)

**If you didn’t question your upbringing** , it’s likely that you chose to conform to the opinions of your role models. As a result, your money mindset now leads you to act in ways that replicate your upbringing: If your role models struggled to make money, you now struggle to make money. If they felt comfortable managing their money, you now feel comfortable managing your money.

(Shortform note: According to psychologists, you’re more likely to have conformed to your role models if you’re the type of person to place more weight on what other people think about you than on how you think and feel about _yourself_. As a result of this thought process, you grew up acting like everyone else so that they’d accept you, and you avoided taking actions that would invite criticism from others.)

**If you chose to rebel against your upbringing** , you may find yourself acting in complete opposition to your role models. For example, if your role models struggled with money, you may have made the _conscious decision_ to _never let yourself live in poverty_. Or, if your role models were comfortable with money but didn’t give you the time and love that you needed, you may have _unconsciously associated_ money with lack of love.

Further, Eker argues that **your interpretation of your upbringing determines your _motivation_ for making money**. If you grew up feeling like you never had enough money, you may be motivated by fear—you’ll make money to ensure you always have what you need and will always feel discomfort at the thought of losing it. On the other hand, if you grew up feeling like money represented well-being and enjoyment, you’ll have a more balanced outlook and pursue money in more fulfilling ways. **Your motivation stays with you and impacts the way you manage your finances**.

> **How Childhood Rebellion Can Lead You to Sabotage Your Own Self-Interests**
> 
> As Eker briefly notes, sometimes we decide to rebel against the money mindset modeled to us in childhood. Accordingly, even if you grew up in an environment of wealth and luxury, and you were taught the most effective ways to manage your money, you could find yourself acting in ways that create poverty.
> 
> Why would you choose to rebel against what you want or what’s good for you? According to psychological research, rebellious behavior occurs when we seek to differentiate ourselves and form our own separate identity—this type of behavior often gets triggered when adolescents transition into adulthood and attempt to reject their childhood identity.
> 
> Rebellion is inspired by a clear recognition of what you don’t want (you don’t want to be a child, you don’t want to be like your role models) but fails to factor in _what you do want_ (you want to be self-sufficient and enjoy well-being). The more negative emotions you feel around what you’re rejecting, the less likely you are to think about what you actually want to experience in your own life. As a result, your rebellion leads you to focus on negative thoughts and emotions that lead you to engage in self-destructive behaviors.

### Your Financial Setpoint

As we’ve noted, your money mindset includes all of the beliefs about money that you accumulated throughout your childhood. Eker claims that these beliefs also include a conclusion about **the amount of money you trust yourself to manage effectively**. This amount defines your capacity for wealth—we’ll refer to this as your “financial setpoint.”

  * There are various analogies you can use to visualize this setpoint. For example, think of it as a cup that can only hold so much water. This cup is your capacity for wealth.



Your money mindset creates specific results that align with your financial setpoint: It programs you to think and behave in specific ways to create results that conform to your unconscious beliefs about how much money you can manage. Even if you manage to earn money past this amount, you won’t be able to hold onto it for long. This is because your money mindset operates from the belief that you can’t handle the challenges that come with managing more money. **In other words, your money mindset ensures that your finances always reflect your financial setpoint**.

> **Why Would You Limit Your Financial Setpoint?**
> 
> Throughout the book, Eker very briefly touches on concepts such as the law of attraction and the role your subconscious plays in guiding your thoughts and actions to match your financial setpoint. But he doesn’t explain exactly _why_ you would limit yourself by setting a low financial setpoint. Therefore, we’ll refer to research based on the _psychology of success_ to provide some insight into why your financial setpoint is where it is.
> 
> According to Maltz (_Psycho-Cybernetics_), you developed limiting beliefs as a way to protect yourself from emotionally uncomfortable (unsafe) situations—the way you identified with the uncomfortable situation led you to feel _unwanted_ negative emotions. You reacted by forming a conclusion about what led to this discomfort and you made the decision to avoid similar situations and **protect yourself from future discomfort**. Your mind stored this decision as a belief. Even though you’re not conscious of this belief, it continues to impact your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
> 
>   * For example, your parents worked hard for their money and didn’t have a lot of time for you. Every time they achieved a level of comfort around their finances, friends and family members would ask for handouts. Your parents always gave their money to those who asked. They continued to work hard and rarely spent any money on themselves or made time to enjoy themselves. 
> 

> 
> You observed all of this and felt uncomfortable. You resented your parents for working so hard and having so little time for you. You resented them for prioritizing the needs of others. You also resented all of the people that took advantage of your parents. These feelings of resentment led you to **associate _having money_ with _being taken advantage of_** , and you decided that you would never let yourself get treated that way. This turned into a belief and created your financial setpoint: If you have over $X you’ll get taken advantage of, so it’s safer to never have more than that amount.

#### The Poor Stay Poor While the Rich Stay Rich

Eker explains that financial setpoints are why poor people stay poor and rich people stay rich. Different people can comfortably manage different amounts of money depending on their financial setpoint. Some people only feel comfortable managing small amounts of money, while others can comfortably manage millions of dollars.

Eker claims that lottery winners always end up losing their winnings due to their low financial setpoint—according to Eker, generally, only poor people play the lottery, hence his assumption that lottery winners have a low financial setpoint. They only feel comfortable managing a small amount of money, so they inevitably spend all of their winnings to return to an amount of money that they’re comfortable with.

(Shortform note: According to statistics, 70% of lottery winners lose all of their money and are more likely to declare bankruptcy within 3-5 years after they collect their winnings. However, it’s not as black and white as Eker makes out—some lottery winners manage to hold onto their winnings and use the money to make a positive difference in their communities. For example, one high school teacher used his winnings to set up a summer camp for kids—he invested his money in a way that benefited his community and also created ongoing income.)

On the other hand, a number of self-made millionaires have lost all of their money only to get it all back again. According to Eker, they feel extremely uncomfortable when their finances fall below their financial setpoint. As a result, their programming leads them to take proactive action to earn the money that they’re accustomed to having so that they can feel comfortable.

(Shortform note: While Eker’s claim that multi-millionaires often fight back to regain the money they lose does seem to be the norm, a number of wealthy people have lost all of their money and never made it back. For example, when Allen Stanford was convicted of fraud in 2008, he lost his entire fortune ($2.2 billion). He’s currently serving a 110-year sentence, so it's unlikely that he’ll ever make this money back again.)

While you may think your balance hovers around the same amount due to external factors (financial emergencies, necessary supplies you had to buy), Eker believes that your financial setpoint is the only factor that determines your bank balance.

(Shortform note: Eker’s claim that external factors don’t determine your bank balance may come across as reductive when you consider the higher costs of living that low-income households face. For example, for people living in poor neighborhoods, auto insurance companies charge 30% extra while home insurance companies increase their fees by 150%. Further, some predatory loan providers target low-income earners by offering small loans with extortionate interest rates (up to 400%). These external factors all contribute to your bank balance and impact your ability to grow your finances.)
