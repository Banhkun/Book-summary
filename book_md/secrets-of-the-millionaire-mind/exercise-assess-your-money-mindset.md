## Exercise: Assess Your Money Mindset

Eker claims that your money mindset is a result of childhood conditioning. This exercise will help you examine how your current finances reflect or oppose your upbringing.

* * *

Think about your financial situation. What’s one thing you think you do well when it comes to managing your money?

Where did you learn how to do this? (Remember, you may have learned by conforming _or_ rebelling.) Was there something specific you heard, saw, or experienced throughout your childhood that taught you how to manage your money this way?

Think about something that’s not currently going well with your finances. How do you think this relates to what you heard, saw, or experienced throughout your childhood?

Think about your financial assets—include your bank balance, savings accounts, any assets, and investments. Has this amount fluctuated over the past three years? What do you think your financial setpoint is?
