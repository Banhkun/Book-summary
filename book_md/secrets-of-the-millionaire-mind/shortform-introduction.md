## Shortform Introduction

In _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ , T. Harv Eker reveals **the difference between rich people and poor people**. This difference doesn’t lie in what they _do_ , but in how they’ve been _conditioned to think and feel_ about money. Eker argues that these thoughts and beliefs _impel you to take actions that either move you toward financial success or away from it_ —if you’re not happy with the state of your finances, it’s because your unproductive thoughts and beliefs about money hold you back from the financial success that you want.

According to Eker, **you can dramatically improve your finances** by taking conscious control of your thoughts and _adopting a rich attitude_ —this rich attitude will inspire you to take new actions that lead to your financial success. Eker outlines the different ways that rich people think and act in relation to money and includes practical techniques you can use to immediately practice this rich attitude and increase your income.

### About the Author

T. Harv Eker is a Canadian multimillionaire, bestselling author, successful entrepreneur, and motivational speaker. He shares his knowledge about financial success in his popular Millionaire Mind Intensive events and seminars.

Eker experienced poverty and suffered the failure of multiple businesses. Determined to turn his life around and become a millionaire, he started to analyze the way rich people managed their money so that he could understand the _cause_ of his own failure. His research led him to improve his attitude towards money so dramatically that he managed to turn a $2,000 credit card loan into a million dollars in the span of two and a half years.

Eker now shares the methods he used to create his millions through his Millionaire Mind Intensive events and seminars. While there has been some controversy about the sales tactics he uses to upsell additional courses and events, the seminars are hugely popular and attendees come from all over the world to listen to Eker’s advice.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: HarperCollins Publishers, 2005

Prior to _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ , Eker also self-published _Speedwealth_ in 2004, a short guide on how to earn millions from your business in less than three years. This book is exclusively available for sale at Eker’s events and seminars.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

Unlike the majority of mainstream financial books (for example, I Will Teach You to Be Rich or _The Automatic Millionaire_), _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ doesn’t offer practical action-based advice on how to improve your finances. Instead, it addresses how your thoughts and beliefs impact your ability to create and hold onto wealth.

The premise that your thoughts and beliefs define your financial success has become increasingly popular since the publication of _The Science of Getting Rich_ by Wallace D. Wattles in 1910. Wattles asserts that your thoughts are the cause of your success, and offers advice on how to think constructively to create wealth. Other successful books in this genre include:

  * _Think and Grow Rich_ , Napoleon Hill: Argues that you can think what you want into reality 
  * _The Psychology of Money_ , Morgan Housel: Discusses why you make irrational decisions about money
  * _Money and the Law of Attraction_ , Abraham Hicks: Explores how you can attract money by believing that you already have it



#### The Book’s Impact

_Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ ranked as the bestselling title on _The New York Times_ and _The Wall Street Journal_ upon its publication in 2005. It’s since sold over five million copies.

Eker was able to quickly gain traction and enjoy bestseller status without the support of a conventional marketing campaign by coming up with a way to cleverly leverage his network of followers. Eker employs many self-promotion tactics in his events and seminars. He relentlessly pushes his products and services to his network of subscribers and seminar attendees, and he offers cross-promotional discounts and rewards to encourage buy-in. For example, the original edition of the book included two free tickets to his Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Many reviewers highly recommend _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ as an inspirational and motivational read—they feel it empowered them to challenge their thoughts and beliefs about money, take action to change their mindsets, and build on this momentum to improve their finances.

While the book does include valuable insights about the wealth mindset, some reviewers feel slighted by the lack of detail or practical information—for example, Eker makes claims about how rich and poor people think but doesn’t back up his statements with research or statistics. In addition, he suggests a number of things you _should_ do to make money but doesn’t explain _how_ to do these things. As a result, many reviewers think the book is “too shallow” and overly repetitive. They also find his opinions about how poor and middle-class people think offensive and reductive. In addition, some reviewers find the book distasteful due to the amount of advertising Eker slips in for his own seminars.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ is split into two parts. The first part explains how childhood influences conditioned your behavior towards money and how this shapes your financial reality.

The second part explores 17 ways in which rich people think differently from poor people and includes techniques and strategies to help you adopt a rich attitude and improve your finances. Eker attempts to organize the material into distinct principles but the thought processes and behaviors regarding money interlink and overlap with each other.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve reorganized Eker’s ideas into three distinct parts to reduce repetition. This reorganization also makes it easier to separate Eker’s principles from the actionable ideas you can apply in your own life.

  * **Part 1: Your Money Mindset Defines Your Level of Wealth** explains what your money mindset is and how it impacts your attitude and behavior around money. 
  * **Part 2: The Poor Mindset** explores the difference between a _poor mindset_ and a _rich mindset_. It also clarifies how negative conditioning leads you to develop tendencies that inhibit you from taking positive actions to improve your finances. 
  * **Part 3: The Rich Mindset** presents specific techniques and strategies to help you adopt a rich mindset so that you can develop wealthy habits and ensure your financial success.



Additionally, we include psychological research underlying _why_ people often adopt a negative attitude or fail to meet their financial goals, as well as actionable ideas from other self-improvement authors and psychologists. We also compare and contrast Eker’s strategies with those of other popular financial authors like Ramit Sethi (_I Will Teach You to Be Rich_) and David Bach (_The Automatic Millionaire_).
