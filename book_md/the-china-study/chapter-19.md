## Chapter 19: Is History Doomed to Repeat Itself?

Eating a whole foods, plant-based diet isn’t a new idea. Socrates, via Plato, predicted that a society that indulged in the luxury of meat would lead to a society plagued with inflammation and disease. The winning athletes in the ancient Olympics also knew that eating a plant-based diet was the key to good health and performance. So how did we get here, promoting meat’s health benefits and worrying that vegetarians don’t get enough protein?

Despite the detour we’ve taken as a society, there’s reason to believe that we’re slowly returning to a culture that values plant foods.

#### Reasons for Hope

These reasons provide a summary of the book’s main arguments.

**Reason #1:** The body of evidence supporting a WFPB diet, from hundreds of rigorous studies, keeps growing.

**Reason #2:** We have a better understanding of how animal proteins usher carcinogens into cells and increase growth hormone levels, increasing cancer risk.

**Reason #3:** We have the technology to measure blood sugar, cholesterol, and insulin to better track how a WFPB diet can treat and even reverse Type 2 diabetes.

**Reason #4:** We have a better understanding of how animal proteins can mimic our own, potentially leading to autoimmune diseases.

**Reason #5:** We understand the mechanisms behind how animal proteins increase calcium and oxalate in the kidney, leading to kidney stones.

**Reason #6:** There’s growing evidence that antioxidants in plant foods can prevent vision issues such as cataracts and macular degeneration.

**Reason #7:** We now know that animal protein makes blood more acidic, which depletes bones of calcium, increasing your risk of osteoporosis.

**Reason #8:** Literacy rates throughout the world are higher than ever. This means more people can access health information and apply it to their diets.

**Reason #9:** Vegetarianism is less taboo than 20 or 30 years ago, and vegetarian restaurants are popping up all over the country, even beyond big cities. Also, many “traditional” restaurants now include plant-based offerings.

**Reason #10:** The medical community is slowly becoming more receptive to getting training in nutrition. In recent years, Campbell has given about 200 lectures at medical schools and conferences.

Making dietary changes, especially ones so counter to how our culture tells us to eat, is hard. But as the public becomes aware of how the food and drug industry influences what lands on our plates and as doctors come to view food as a valid treatment option, these changes will feel not only natural but obvious. We may be able to remain an affluent country while defeating our diseases of affluence.
