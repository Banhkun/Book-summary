## Introduction

Diet books are frequent bestsellers and America’s health industry is worth billions of dollars. Clearly, we want to be healthy.

But even though there’s a huge amount of health information out there, most of us still aren’t really sure what we should be eating to be our healthiest.

_The China Study_ has the answer: **Eat a whole foods, plant-based (WFPB) diet.**

**Whole Foods:** Throughout the book, the authors (T. Colin Campbell, Ph.D., and his son Thomas M. Campbell II, MD) recommend eating foods in their least processed forms.

For example, rather than eating potato chips, eat a potato. Substitute whole-grain pasta for your usual white pasta.

**Plant-Based:** The authors also recommend a diet that’s free of all animal products, including meat, fish, dairy, and eggs. Just as importantly, they recommend eating lots of antioxidant- and fiber-rich plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to protect against disease.

The WFPB diet is relatively simple. If eating well and preventing illness is really this straightforward, why are we so bewildered about what it means to eat well?

### The Confusion Surrounding Diet

Is gluten bad for us? Do eggs increase cholesterol? Is dairy the best source of calcium?

The aim of this book is to eliminate the confusion surrounding health and diet and expose the problems in our current health systems.

**Problem #1: The goal of the “health” industry is to make a profit, not to make us healthy.**

Part of the problem is that genuine, useful research is buried beneath fad diets, miracle pills, and marketing propaganda. As we’ll see in Part IV, the people and companies who give us health advice are often also the ones who profit from our diseases.

**Problem #2: We don’t know how confused we really are.**

Another part of the problem is that even though we’re confused, we all _think_ we know a lot about health. But much of this “knowledge” is actually myth. For instance:

  * Synthetic chemicals are _not_ the primary cause of cancer.
  * Your genes are _not_ the most important factor in determining whether you’ll die of the ten leading causes of death.
  * Vitamin and mineral supplements do _not_ protect you from disease.
  * Your doctor knows little about nutrition and likely _doesn’t_ know how to help you be the healthiest you can be.
  * Animal proteins, including low-fat milk and lean meats, are _not_ healthy for you. In fact, they’re linked to numerous diseases (outlined in this book).



#### What Does the Research Say?

The idea that **our favorite meat- and dairy-rich meals could be making us sick** is a hard truth to face. The authors acknowledge that their findings are provocative. But they also insist that these findings are _not_ the mere product of personal opinion. The book’s tenets are based on over 800 rigorous, peer-reviewed studies from around the world. Some of their findings include:

  * Diet alone can reverse heart disease, and reducing the amount of animal protein you eat is more important than reducing the amount of saturated fat.
  * What we eat greatly affects our cancer risk.
  * Type 1 diabetes is linked to the type of milk a child is fed as an infant.
  * Type 2 diabetes patients who change their diets can stop taking medication.



**Ultimately, diet is the most powerful medicine in the prevention and reversal of disease.**

#### About the Authors

_The China Study_ is written by father-son team T. Colin Campbell, Ph.D., a biochemist, and Thomas M. Campbell II, MD, who became a doctor after writing the first edition of the book with his father.

The elder Campbell is a Professor Emeritus of Nutritional Biochemistry at Cornell University. The book is based, in part, on his 40+ years of research and more than 300 published scientific papers. The authors supplement this research with hundreds of other studies indicating that the healthiest way of eating is a WFPB diet.

The book takes its name from the China Study conducted by Cornell University (a team headed by T. Colin Campbell), Oxford University, and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. One of the most comprehensive, rigorous studies of its kind, **the project examined the diets, lifestyles, and diseases of inhabitants of rural China.** Their findings were groundbreaking, but this study wasn’t the first to suggest that animal products could be detrimental to health. Several other projects led Campbell along the path toward his landmark research in China.

### The Research Leading up to the China Study

Several key research projects led to the development of the China Study.

#### Project #1: Alleviating Malnutrition in the Philippines

For 10 years, Campbell worked on a project in the Philippines funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. There were two main problems to address.

**Problem #1: Malnutrition.** The goal of the program was to alleviate malnutrition by making sure Filipino children ate as much protein as possible. At the time, it was unquestioned that childhood malnutrition was caused by a lack of dietary protein.

**Problem #2: Liver cancer.** Aside from being malnourished, many children in the Philippines were getting liver cancer, which is usually rare in children. Campbell discovered that the kids from the wealthiest families, who were eating the _most_ protein, were the ones most likely to get liver cancer. This was counter to Western wisdom that said that the kids eating the most protein should be the healthiest.

As Campbell was contemplating this puzzling finding, he came across liver cancer research out of India. His discovery of this research was the next step toward his development of the China Study.

#### Project #2: Indian Research on Rats and Liver Cancer

The research out of India involved two groups of rats. Both groups were administered the carcinogen aflatoxin.

Group 1 ate a diet that was 20% protein (roughly the percentage of protein in the average Western diet).

Group 2 ate a diet that was 5% protein.

Shockingly, **_every_ rat eating a 20% protein diet showed evidence of liver cancer and _none_ of the rats eating a 5% protein diet showed evidence of liver cancer.**

Campbell was struck by how these findings clarified his hypothesis that protein consumption in the Philippines was somehow related to childhood liver cancer.

#### Project #3: Campbell’s Research on Rats and Liver Cancer

Based on the rat study in India and his observations in the Philippines, Campbell developed his own study exploring the relationship between protein and cancer in rats. The program was well-funded for 27 years by respected groups like the National Institutes of Health and the American Cancer Society.

The results both corroborated and expanded on the findings of the Indian study.

**Results:**

  * Low-protein diets kept the carcinogen aflatoxin from causing cancer.
  * Low-protein diets kept tumors from growing.
  * Casein, which comprises 87% of milk’s protein, caused cancer to develop and spread at every stage of growth.
  * Proteins from plants _didn’t_ cause cancer to develop or spread.
  * The percentage of animal-based protein that increased the rate of cancer growth in rats was the same percentage regularly consumed by American humans.



### The China Study

These three studies led Campbell and fellow researchers at Cornell to team up with Oxford University and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine to conduct the China Study.

Hoping to understand how nutrients (like protein) and lifestyle factors influenced disease rates in humans (rather than rats), researchers looked at the diets, lifestyles, and diseases of 6,500 people in rural China (and in subsequent studies, Taiwan). These researchers had unprecedented access to subjects and medical records. They were also well-funded. In addition to various grants from American institutions, the Chinese government invested millions of dollars in the study.

As we’ll see in later chapters, the study’s results were controversial but clear: **People who ate the most animal foods had the most chronic disease; People who ate the most plant foods had the least chronic disease.**
