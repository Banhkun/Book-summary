## 1-Page Summary

As a nation, we’re fascinated by diets. We spend billions of dollars every year trying to lose weight, feel better, and get healthier. But most of us are failing. Americans are some of the sickest and most overweight people in the world, and yes, our diet is to blame. But sugar and fat, the usual culprits, might not be the only, or even the worst, offenders.

In _The China Study,_ T. Colin Campbell, Ph.D., and his son Thomas M. Campbell II, MD offer evidence that suggests that the foods we should actually be avoiding are animal-based. In hundreds of studies, eggs, cheese, milk, and meat have all been shown to increase your risk of everything from obesity and diabetes to cancer and autoimmune diseases. The authors’ goals are to 1) provide you with the evidence that **a whole foods, plant-based (WFPB) diet can prevent and even reverse disease** , and 2) explain why these findings aren’t better known.

**The benefits of a WFPB diet include:**

  * Losing weight
  * Living a longer life
  * Looking and feeling younger and more energetic
  * Lowering cholesterol and blood pressure
  * Reducing the need for expensive surgeries
  * Reducing your risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer’s, and osteoporosis, among other illnesses.



_The China Study_ is based, in part, on the research project of the same name, one of the most extensive nutrition studies ever done. For the project, T. Colin Campbell’s Cornell team partnered with Oxford University and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine to study the diets, lifestyles, and diseases of inhabitants of rural China. What they discovered shocked them: Eating plant foods may be one of the leading determiners of health in rural China, and eating animal protein may be one of the leading causes of disease in the Western world.

_The China Study_ has chapters devoted to individual diseases and disease groups, but regardless of the illness, the message is the same: **Eat more plant foods and avoid animal foods.**

### The Principles of the Whole Foods, Plant-Based Diet

The Campbells distill their research findings and the findings of hundreds of other nutrition and disease studies into eight basic principles.

**Principle #1: Various nutrients work together to achieve health.**

No single nutrient is responsible for good health. What matters most is how the various nutrients in foods work together to create change in the body and maintain good health. This is why eating whole foods rather than taking nutrition supplements is so important, which brings us to Principle #2.

**Principle #2: Avoid supplements—get your nutrients from food, not pills.**

Supplements are problematic because they’re poorly regulated, often have side effects, and aren’t always effective. Further, the way nutrients function in the body is complex, and it’s not always clear whether certain benefits come from a single nutrient or from the whole food, so you’re better off eating the whole food.

**Principle #3: Almost any nutrient you can find in animal-based foods, you can find in a healthier form in plant-based foods.**

Plant foods have more of almost every nutrient, including fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Animal foods have fewer nutrients and more fat. The only exception to this principle is vitamin B12, which is only present in animal foods.

**Principle #4: Genes alone don’t cause disease—we have considerable control over which genes get expressed.**

Genes only affect us when they’re activated, and diet is one of the biggest triggers of gene activation. This explains why, in populations made up of people who share a genetic heritage, disease rates vary widely. Some of these people are eating more foods that trigger the expression of genes that lead to disease. Researchers can actually turn “bad” genes on and off in mice by altering the amount of animal protein they feed them.

**Principle #5: Good nutrition can counter the negative effects of carcinogens.**

We think that carcinogens cause cancer, but, like genes, carcinogens likely need to be activated to do harm. They’re often activated by diets high in animal protein. Conversely, antioxidant-rich plant foods can diminish the potency of carcinogens.

**Principle #6: The same principles that prevent disease can reverse it.**

A WFPB diet can prevent heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Even more surprising, it can also _reverse_ these diseases.

**Principle #7: Nutrition that prevents one disease is probably beneficial for health in general.**

Whole, plant foods seem to reduce risk across the board. Therefore, a diet that’s good for your heart is also good for your brain, liver, kidneys, and nervous system.

**Principle #8: Good nutrition works holistically with physical activity, mental and emotional health, and our environment.**

Positive lifestyle changes work together and build off one another to promote health. For example, eating well gives us more energy. Having more energy makes it easier to exercise more. Exercising more promotes mental and emotional health. When we’re in a better mood, we eat healthier meals, and the cycle continues.

### Recommendations

Although their main goal is to provide evidence in support of a plant-based diet, the Campbells also offer advice for healthier living. These recommendations include the following:

  * **Eat plant-based proteins**.**** These come in the forms of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eat as much as you want, as long as what you’re eating is plant-based and unrefined.
  * **Avoid animal-based proteins** to decrease your risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and kidney stones, among other illnesses and health issues. Animal-based proteins are those in meat, fish, eggs, and dairy.
  * **Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables** to increase your antioxidant intake and protect yourself against free radicals. This also ensures you’re getting all the essential amino acids for healthy growth and increased strength.
  * **Eat three more servings of fruits and vegetables a day** to cut your risk of stroke. One serving could be a potato, half a cup of broccoli, half a cup of peaches, or a quarter of a cup of tomato sauce.
  * **Focus particularly on consuming vitamin C** in whole foods like peppers, strawberries, broccoli, papayas, and peas.
  * **Eat 10 extra grams of fiber a day**. This is the amount of fiber in a cup of raspberries or peas. A cup of beans has more than 10 grams. Get your fiber from real foods, not from supplements.
  * **Eat a high-carb, rather than a low-carb, diet.** But make sure you’re getting your carbohydrates from whole, not refined, foods.
  * **Get less than 10% of your calories from fat** to prevent or treat heart disease.
  * **Reduce your intake of milk products** —casein has been shown to increase cholesterol and promote tumor growth.
  * **Don’t spend time, money, or energy on weight-loss programs that promise quick fixes.**
  * **Exercise 15-45 minutes a day** , every day.
  * For general disease prevention, **get vitamin D by spending 15-30 minutes in the sun** every few days.
  * **Eliminate saturated fat from your diet.** Saturated fats are generally found in animal products. Foods with especially high amounts include beef, pork, poultry skins, hot dogs, bacon, lunch meats, butter, lard, high-fat dairy, and fried foods.
  * To decrease your risk of osteoporosis, **exercise, reduce your salt intake and get calcium from plant sources** like beans, leafy greens, and plant-based milks.
  * To protect your vision as you get older, **eat lots of spinach, collard greens, broccoli, carrots, winter squash, sweet potato, and citrus.** Get your antioxidants from whole foods, not supplements.
  * **Avoid supplements**. Exceptions are for vitamin B12, if you eat a WFPB diet, and vitamin D, if you live in an area with limited sunlight.
  * **Don’t be moderate.** Try going “cold turkey” on animal products for a month.
  * **When in need of treatment, explore your options.** Although highly trained, your doctor may not have the nutrition knowledge to recommend lifestyle changes that could serve as alternatives to surgery or drugs.

So if meat and dairy are so bad, why haven’t we heard about it?

We live in a country that prioritizes the profits of a few over the health of all. **The food and drug industries, the medical institution, the government, and universities all play their parts in conducting research and setting dietary guidelines that maintain the status quo.** It’s not that everyone in the American health system is corrupt—industries, understandably, have a product to sell, government workers have elections to win, doctors lack training in nutrition, and well-intentioned journalists and health organizations spread bad information. But the problem is systemic, and it puts the lives of Americans at risk.

_The China Study_ challenges the status quo and presents you with groundbreaking findings and practical advice that may make you rethink the way you eat.
