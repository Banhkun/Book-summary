## Exercise: Your Health Beliefs (Part I)

Before diving into the findings presented in _The China Study_ , take stock of your own beliefs and knowledge about diet and nutrition.

* * *

Make a brief list of foods you know are good for you.

Now make a brief list of foods you know are bad for you.

What about foods that fall in the middle? List two or three that are healthy in moderation.

Finally, how would you describe the healthiest diet or way of eating? (For instance, is it high in protein like the paleo diet? Is it a system like Weight Watchers that assigns points to foods?)
