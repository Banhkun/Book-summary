## Chapter 9: The Autoimmune System

Most people, doctors included, agree that autoimmune diseases are some of the hardest to treat because their cause isn’t well understood and there’s no cure. Is it possible that our food choices affect even these stubborn and grim illnesses?

In people with autoimmune disease, the body attacks itself. The immune system thinks it’s assaulting foreign invader cells, but it’s actually destroying normal body cells. Tens of millions of Americans have autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Type 1 diabetes, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Before looking at food’s role in the development of autoimmune diseases, let’s look at their bodily source, the immune system.

#### How the Immune System Works

We can think of the immune system as our body’s military. **White blood cells are the soldiers, keeping us safe by attacking foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses.**

Whenever it confronts a new invader, the immune system creates a protein that mirrors the invader protein. This mirror protein molds itself onto the invader and destroys it.

**The Problem: Some invaders look a lot like our own cells.** The molds that fit and destroy invaders can also fit and destroy the normal cells that look like them.

Sometimes, the immune system’s molds get confused. They can’t tell the difference between invaders and similar-looking cells, so they attack the normal cells. This is the root of an autoimmune disease.

#### Autoimmune Diseases May Have a Common Cause

While the presentation of each autoimmune disease differs, we can speak about them as a group and even discuss a common cause because of six ways they’re alike:

**Commonality #1:** Each is a disease in which the body’s immune system attacks itself.

**Commonality #2:** All studied autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in northern areas far from the equator, where there’s less sunlight.

**Commonality #3:** Some of these diseases cluster together in individuals. For example, MS and Type 1 diabetes often occur in the same individuals and Parkinson’s and MS are both common in the same geographic areas (and may also affect the same individuals). Numerous other associations like these exist.

**Commonality #4:** For all these diseases, consumption of animal foods in general, and cow’s milk in particular, has been linked to greater risk. Let’s take a look at how they may be related.

Foreign proteins are called antigens. There’s evidence that **antigens that trick our bodies into attacking themselves come from the foods we eat** in the form of undigested proteins. The immune system may treat undigested proteins from food as foreign invaders.

Cow’s milk especially has many proteins that mimic those in our bodies. In some people, these antigens confuse the immune system. Instead of attacking undigested milk proteins, it attacks similar-looking body proteins.

**Commonality #5:** A virus may trigger several autoimmune diseases.

**Commonality #6:** The “mechanisms of action” of these diseases, or the process of development, are similar. There’s evidence that vitamin D is involved in the most prominent mechanism.

Just as a deficiency in “supercharged” vitamin D can increase prostate cancer risk, it can also increase your risk of developing an autoimmune disease.

Supercharged **vitamin D is a necessary component of your immune response.** Without it, your immune system doesn’t work as efficiently.

As seen in Chapter 8, excessive amounts of calcium and animal proteins (which cause excess acid in the body) hamper the body’s ability to supercharge vitamin D from sunlight.

* * *

These six commonalities allow us to talk about autoimmune diseases as a group. In this chapter, the Campbells discuss two in particular: Type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.

### Type 1 Diabetes

Type 1 diabetes develops primarily in children and there is no cure. In people with Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops producing insulin because the immune system has destroyed the cells that make it.

#### The Role of Milk

Multiple studies have found that **infants weaned early and fed formula with cow’s milk have a 50-60% higher risk of developing Type 1 diabetes.**

This may be because some infants can’t fully digest the milk protein in formula. These undigested proteins can get into the blood. The immune system attacks these foreign invaders. Unfortunately, **the pancreas cells responsible for making insulin look exactly like these undigested milk proteins.**

A virus may corrupt the immune system, causing it to destroy both the foreign milk proteins and the identical pancreas cells. Consequently, the infant develops Type 1 diabetes. This known connection is one reason **doctors recommend breastfeeding over formula.**

In one study, every diabetic child had antibodies to the milk protein BSA at levels above 3.55 IgG. This indicated that they’d consumed a lot of cow’s milk. Conversely, every child who didn’t have diabetes had antibodies to this milk protein lower than 3.55 IgG. _There was no overlap._ The number 3.55 neatly split the children into two groups that aligned exactly with whether they had diabetes or not.

Although it’s not clear that these BSA antibodies _caused_ the development of diabetes, it’s a possibility. Further supporting this argument is the fact that Type 1 diabetes is more common in countries where children consume the most cow’s milk.

#### The Role of Genes

Some children are genetically susceptible to Type 1 diabetes. However, genes don’t _cause_ the disease. In a study of identical twins, if one twin had diabetes, there was only a 13-33% chance the other would develop the disease, even though they had exactly the same genes.

Further, of children with genetic predispositions, fewer than 10% actually get Type 1 diabetes.

Another sign that genes are not determining factors is the fact that Type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide at a rate of 3% per year. Genes remain relatively stable over hundreds of years, so this increase has nothing to do with evolving DNA.

While certain genes increase your chances of developing the disease, **cow’s milk consumption is likely one of the triggers that determines whether or not you’ll get the disease.**

#### Using “Controversy” to Stifle Research Publicity

Because the dairy industry is so powerful in the U.S., and because most of us, including scientists and doctors, have a personal bias toward milk and dairy products, these common findings aren’t publicized.

**As a way to undermine these findings, some scientists call them “controversial.” But they’re not.** What people interpret as controversy is really just the confusion of hearing that something they’ve always been told is good for them may actually trigger a lifelong disease.

Critics of studies linking milk proteins and Type 1 diabetes point to five studies (there are only five) that failed to find a statistically significant link.

But we need to keep in mind that there are many reasons a study might fail to find a link:

  * The study didn’t involve enough people.
  * The subjects didn’t have a variety of infant feeding practices, so it was hard to detect a relationship.
  * Data from asking people to remember how they fed their infants years ago could be unreliable.
  * Researchers may have studied the wrong time in the infant’s life.



There’s ample evidence that eating dairy can contribute to the development of Type 1 diabetes. Could it be a risk factor for other autoimmune diseases?

### Multiple Sclerosis

About 400,000 Americans have MS, a disease of the nervous system that’s usually diagnosed between the ages of twenty and forty.

In people **with MS, the immune system attacks myelin, which insulates nerve fibers.** With this insulation damaged or stripped away, electrical signals go awry. These errant electrical signals can damage surrounding tissues, causing further damage.

People with MS gradually lose the ability to see or walk, and the disease comes with numerous unpredictable symptoms. Let’s look at some of the risk factors.

#### Risk Factors

##### Risk Factor #1: Living North of the Equator

MS is 100 times more common in the far north than near the equator. Living in the far north is also a risk factor for Type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

Some researchers think this statistic has something to do with differences in the magnetic field, but other researchers have connected this finding to diet. **People in the far north generally eat more dairy than people living at the equator.** So, is the real risk factor living in the north or eating dairy? The answer is still unclear.

##### Risk Factor #2: Eating a Diet High in Saturated Fat

One researcher divided early-stage MS patients into two groups. Group A ate a typical diet while Group B ate a diet low in saturated fat.

80% of the patients in Group A died of MS within 34 years. **Only 5% of the patients in Group B died of MS within 34 years** ; the remaining 95% were only mildly disabled.

##### Risk Factor #3: Consuming Cow’s Milk

Multiple studies show a correlation between the amount of cow’s milk consumed and risk for MS. This may be due to a virus in cow’s milk, although this is only speculation at this point.

##### Risk Factor #4: Genetic Predisposition

Genes account for 25% of your total MS risk. That means **75% of your disease risk is environmental and largely under your control.**

Studies show that migrants adopt the MS risk of their new home country, showing that your genes aren’t the most important factor in the disease’s development.

* * *

Despite numerous studies linking cow’s milk and autoimmune diseases, in 2003, the website of the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation stated that there was no “credible evidence” that diet impacts the initiation or development of MS. They also noted that dietary changes are expensive, although it would seem that being unable to see and bedridden for the last years of your life would also be expensive, at best.

The current website has removed the statement about a lack of credible evidence. Instead, they refrain from addressing diet at all.

#### Summary of Recommendations

  * Breastfeed your infant and decrease your child’s consumption of cow’s milk to lower his or her risk of Type 1 diabetes.
  * Eliminate saturated fat from your diet. Saturated fats are generally found in animal products. Foods with especially high amounts include beef, pork, poultry skins, hot dogs, bacon, lunch meats, butter, lard, high-fat dairy, and fried foods.
  * Get vitamin D from sunlight by spending time outside 2-3 times per week. You may know how much time in the sun causes your skin to get red. Plan each session in the sun to be ¼ of this length of time. For example, if 30-40 minutes in the sun makes your skin red, spend 10 minutes in the sun, three times a week, to get the vitamin D you need.
