## Chapter 8: Cancer (Part II)

Campbell, who won the American Institute for Cancer Research’s Research Achievement award in 1998, believes that the nutritional principles discussed in this book have the same effect on many cancers, as discussed in Chapter 3. In this chapter, we look at the research on diet and three groups of cancer in particular: breast cancer, large bowel cancers, and prostate cancer.

### Breast Cancer

One out of eight American women will get breast cancer in her lifetime. Like most cancers, this is yet another disease of affluence.

There are multiple risk factors and animal foods are linked to almost all of them.

#### Breast Cancer Risk Factors

##### **1\. High Blood Cholesterol**

As we’ve seen, both dietary fat (found in greater quantities in animal foods than in plant foods) and animal proteins have been shown to increase cholesterol.

##### **2\. Prolonged Exposure to Female Hormones**

These hormones include estrogen and progesterone. The earlier a female starts menstruating, and the later she starts the process of menopause, the greater her exposure to estrogen over her lifetime.

Animal foods seem to play a part in increasing cancer risk at every stage of a woman’s life:

  * **Adolescence:** In girls, there’s an association between eating high-fat diets and starting menstruation earlier. Because animal foods are often high in fat, they may contribute to early menstruation.
  * **Adulthood:** High-fat diets have also been shown to increase estrogen levels during reproductive years.
  * **Menopause:** Diets rich in animal foods are associated with delays in menopause of three to four years. These additional years of estrogen exposure increase breast cancer risk.



In the China Study, researchers compared the estrogen levels of Chinese women to the levels of British women, whose breast cancer risk is similar to that of American women.

Chinese women in the study didn’t start menstruating until an average age of 17. Due to their low-fat diets, they also started menopause earlier than British women. Also due to their low-fat diets, Chinese women had half the estrogen levels of British women during their reproductive years.

Because**the reproductive lives of Chinese women were 75% shorter than those of British women** , and because their estrogen levels were lower throughout life, **they had 35-40% less exposure to estrogen over their lifetimes.** This dovetails with the fact that Chinese women get breast cancer at one-fifth the rate of Western women.

In summary, eating a WFPB diet means you naturally consume less fat. This diet raises the age of a girl’s first period, lowers the age of menopause, decreases female hormone levels, and decreases blood cholesterol. In these ways, **the WFPB reduces at least four breast cancer risk factors.**

##### **3\. Hormone Replacement Therapy**

Another risk factor is the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Many women take HRT during menopause to protect their bones, prevent heart disease, and decrease menopause symptoms.

However, HRT has been shown to increase your breast cancer risk by 26-30%. Further, while HRT does seem to help protect against bone fractures and colorectal cancer in later life, some studies suggest it increases your risk for cardiovascular disease.

There may be a healthier alternative to HRT—eating plants.

Eating a plant-based diet can help smooth the transition into menopause. When women go through menopause, their reproductive hormones decline to a base level. The steepness of this decline may dictate how severe your menopause symptoms are.

**Because plant-eaters have lower levels of these hormones throughout their reproductive years, the drop to base level is less dramatic than for meat-eaters.** Therefore, plant-eaters experience fewer menopause symptoms.

##### **4\. Genes**

Your genes also increase your risk of getting breast cancer, but probably not as much as the media tells us. Although the “breast cancer genes,” BRCA-1 and BRCA-2, have received a lot of attention, **studies find that less than 3% of breast cancer cases are genetic.** Additionally, only 0.2% of the population carries these genes, so only a small percentage of breast cancer cases can be attributed to them.

The fact that half of the women who carry BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 never get breast cancer also demonstrates that your genes are not your destiny.

It’s not that the discovery of these genes wasn’t important. But we need to pay attention to not only who carries these genes but also what causes them to be expressed. As we know, a diet high in animal fats and proteins has been shown to act as a trigger for both carcinogens and cancer-causing genes.

##### **5\. Environmental Chemicals**

Environmental chemicals pose another risk. There are different types of carcinogenic chemicals:

**Carcinogen Type #1:** We can’t metabolize these carcinogens, so they stay in our bodies, accumulating in body fat and the breast milk of lactating mothers. These carcinogens include dioxins and PCBs. **90-95% of exposure to these chemicals comes from eating animal foods.**

**Carcinogen Type #2:** We can metabolize these carcinogens, but the process of metabolism creates dangerous byproducts that alter our DNA. These carcinogens, PAHs, come from car exhaust, tobacco smoke, smokestacks, and some petroleum products.

Animal foods can accelerate the rate at which PAHs bind to DNA and cause cancer. Nutrition can also alter the toxicity of certain carcinogens.

**While these carcinogens are dangerous, their role in causing cancer is less important than what we choose to eat and how these foods activate or suppress the carcinogens.**

#### Conventional Versus Lifestyle-Based Prevention

If you have a family history of breast cancer or test positive for one of the BRCA genes, you have a few options. Three are conventional and one is lifestyle-based.

**Option #1: Do nothing**. Having a genetic predisposition for a disease doesn’t mean you’ll get it.

**Option #2:** **Tamoxifen**

  * **Pro:** This drug has been shown to decrease cancer risk by 49%, which is huge.
  * **Cons:** Other studies have failed to replicate these results. The drug may only work for women who have extremely high estrogen levels. Additionally, tamoxifen is dangerous. It raises the user’s risk of stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and uterine cancer.



**Option #3:** **Mastectomy**

Some women choose to have a preventative mastectomy to remove breast tissue and therefore dramatically reduce their risk of the disease.

But again, family history and a BRCA gene don’t guarantee that you’ll get breast cancer. There may be an option that is less drastic and just as effective.

**Option #4:** **Lifestyle Choices**

**Proven ways to reduce breast cancer risk include eating a low-fat diet free of animal products and refined carbs, cutting out alcohol, and exercising.**

These choices prevent estrogen levels from getting too high, rather than treating them once they’re already high.

Paired with regular screenings, this fourth option can be just as effective, and safer, than the other options, even for women who’ve already had a mastectomy.

### Colorectal Cancer

Colorectal cancer, or large bowel cancer (including colon and rectum cancer), is the fourth most fatal cancer in the world. It’s the **second most fatal cancer in the U.S.** , and some researchers say that, by the age of 70, half of all Westerners will get it.

#### Dietary Impact on Colorectal Cancer

This is one group of cancers for which the impact of diet is generally well-known, and many doctors have accepted that diet is a leading cause, and prevention, of the disease.

Following the same pattern as other cancers, only about 1-3% of colon cancers are attributable to genes alone, meaning lifestyle factors (particularly diet) play a huge role in preventing this disease.

Fiber and calcium have each been the focus of multiple studies on colorectal cancer.

##### The Importance of Fiber

As **fiber** , which the body can’t digest, pulls water into the intestines, it **keeps things running smoothly in the digestive tract and absorbs carcinogenic chemicals.** Therefore, consuming lots of fiber protects us from cancers of the intestines.

Although fiber has been maligned for hindering iron absorption, it may actually increase your levels of hemoglobin, or iron in the blood.

Studies show that **eating ten additional grams of fiber every day can lower your risk of colon cancer by 33%.** For reference, 10 grams is the amount of fiber in a cup of raspberries or peas. A cup of most types of beans will give you far more than 10 grams.

Additionally, various studies have shown that increased fiber intake reduces colorectal cancer risk by 42-52%.

**We can’t get fiber from animal foods** , only plant foods, so again we find a link between plant foods and disease prevention.

##### **Fiber Supplements**

Studies indicate that it may be a _fiber-rich_ _diet_ , rather than fiber itself, that has benefits.

Fiber isn’t a single substance. The term includes hundreds of substances that play complex biochemical and physiological roles in the body. It’s hard to clearly demonstrate fiber’s impact on cancer prevention because of its complexity.

Most studies on fiber use whole-food sources, not supplements. Consequently, it’s hard to know if it’s the fiber or the food as a whole that has benefits, as a South African study on colorectal cancer shows.

> **South African Study on Colorectal Cancer**
> 
> In 1985, white South Africans got colorectal cancer at seventeen times the rate that black South Africans did. Many researchers thought it was because black South Africans ate a diet high in fiber-rich maize.
> 
> But the investigation found that **black South Africans were increasingly eating refined maize-meal, which doesn’t have fiber.** Currently, black South Africans actually eat less fiber than white South Africans.
> 
> Still, black South Africans get colorectal cancer at a lower rate than white South Africans.
> 
> This study **calls into question the idea that it’s the fiber alone that’s preventative, rather than the plant foods of which fiber is a part**.
> 
> Later studies showed that white South Africans ate a diet higher in animal protein, fat, and cholesterol. The cancer-promoting effects of animal foods may have counteracted the greater amounts of fiber the white South Africans ate.

##### **The Role of Calcium**

Calcium is thought to prevent colorectal cancer through two mechanisms:

  * **Mechanism #1:** Hindering the growth of certain colon cells.
  * **Mechanism #2:** Binding with bile acids, which are thought to accelerate cancer development in the colon.



Because of the belief that calcium prevents large bowel cancers, the dairy industry has promoted dairy products as cancer-fighting foods.

But the China Study demonstrated that rural Chinese don’t consume much calcium. Still, their rates of colon cancer are much lower than those of Americans.

It turns out that **the countries that consume the most calcium, which are in Europe and North America, have the highest rates of colorectal cancer.**

While calcium may have some impact on the development of colorectal cancer, the benefits are unclear. Dairy’s animal protein and fat content may undermine any advantages of its calcium.

### Prostate Cancer

The prostate, located between a male’s bladder and colon, is the size of a walnut and produces fluid that aids the sperm in fertilization. Prostate cancer grows slowly and may not cause discomfort until it’s advanced. Some studies say **half of all men age 70 and older have prostate cancer.**

#### The Link Between Dairy and Prostate Cancer

Prostate cancer is yet another disease of affluence—it’s far more prevalent in Western countries than in developing ones.

In a handful of studies, **men who consumed the most dairy had double the risk of developing prostate cancer of men who consumed the least dairy.** Even more startling, their chance of dying of the disease was four times as high.

##### How Dairy Contributes to Prostate Cancer

**Mechanism #1:** **Consuming animal foods increases IGF-1.**

The growth hormone IGF-1 is responsible for managing cell reproduction. In normal ranges, IGF-1 works efficiently. Too much of it, and cells reproduce at too fast a rate and old cells aren’t removed quickly enough. This promotes cancer.

Men with high IGF-1 levels are 5.1 times more likely to develop prostate cancer than men with low IGF-1 levels. Consuming animal products causes our bodies to produce more IGF-1 than we need, increasing our cancer risk.

**Mechanism #2:** **Calcium and animal protein block the production of vitamin D.**

Our bodies use vitamin D from sunlight and certain foods to make a “supercharged” form that prevents cancer, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases, among other illnesses.

Calcium and animal proteins (both found in animal foods) can inhibit the body’s ability to turn vitamin D into supercharged vitamin D. Lower levels of supercharged D have been shown to promote cancer development.

These mechanisms show that animal foods possibly promote prostate cancer development in multiple ways.

In a controlled study (conducted by Dr. Ornish) of men with early prostate cancer, only 5% of the patients in the “diet-and-lifestyle” group (as opposed to the “standard-care” group) eventually needed conventional prostate cancer treatment. Ornish also found that **the blood of the diet-and-lifestyle group repressed the growth of cancer in cultures and that over 500 of these patients’ genes were expressed differently due to dietary and lifestyle changes.**

Recent research found that men with prostate cancer who eat three or more servings of dairy a day have a 141% increased risk of dying within ten years, compared with men with prostate cancer who eat less than one serving of dairy a day.

* * *

All of these cancers are largely preventable, but the preventions are a challenge to conventional medicine. Doctors and cancer organizations either aren’t aware of this research or aren’t interested in sharing it. (More on why in Part III.)

### Summary of Recommendations

  * To lower your daughter’s breast cancer risk, consider limiting her fat intake (high-fat diets are associated with early menstruation, which is a risk factor for breast cancer).
  * You can reduce your breast cancer risk, even if you have a genetic predisposition, by exercising, avoiding alcohol, eating a WFPB diet, and getting regular screenings.
  * To prevent colon cancer, eat 10 extra grams of fiber a day—this is the amount of fiber in a cup of raspberries or peas. A cup of beans has more than 10 grams of fiber.
  * Get your fiber from real foods, not from supplements.
  * For general disease prevention, get your vitamin D by spending 15-30 minutes in the sun every few days.
  * To lower your risk of prostate cancer, eat less dairy.
