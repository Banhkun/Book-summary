## Chapter 10: Other Diseases

No matter what your pet idea is, you’re almost guaranteed to find a study, somewhere, that supports it.

Is the belief in the healing power of a whole foods, plant-based diet a pet idea? How do we know it’s not just another fad diet? The answer is in the thousands of studies providing evidence that plant-based diets prevent and cure a multitude of health issues. Chapter 10 explores some of these various issues, including osteoporosis, kidney stones, vision problems, and brain health.

We tend to think of these health issues as the natural consequences of aging. But they might actually be the natural consequences of our diets.

### Osteoporosis

#### The Calcium Myth

We all know that calcium builds strong bones. Americans consume more calcium, in the form of dairy products, than most people in the world. So our bones should be stronger than everyone else’s.

But they’re not. **Americans age 50 and older have one of the highest hip fracture rates in the world.** The few countries with higher rates, like Australia and New Zealand, eat more dairy than we do. How can this be?

##### Reason #1: Animal Protein in Milk Increases Acid in the Body

When our blood and tissues become more acidic, the body pulls calcium from our bones to neutralize the acid. This calcium loss weakens bones.

Studies suggest that **70% of fracture risk in women over 50 can be attributed to eating animal protein.** Women who eat a lot of animal protein lose bone four times as quickly as those who get most of their protein from plants. More than 87 separate studies have found a link between animal protein and increased risk of bone fractures.

Further, **populations that get most of their protein from plant sources have virtually no bone fractures.**

##### Reason #2: Calcium Decreases the Body’s Ability to Regulate Calcitriol, a Supercharged form of Vitamin D

In a normally functioning system, calcitriol determines how much calcium we absorb from food and how that calcium is distributed in the body.

But if we take in too much calcium over long periods of time, calcitriol becomes less effective at managing calcium, and we may excrete more than we absorb.

**Dairy contains both animal proteins, which produce acid, and high amounts of calcium, which can disrupt the body’s ability to properly use that calcium.** Because of these two factors, eating dairy products may increase rather than decrease your risk of osteoporosis.

#### Evidence-Based Ways to Minimize Your Risk

  * Exercise. Most kinds of physical activity help increase your bone density.
  * Get your calcium from plant sources, like beans, leafy vegetables, and non-dairy milks.
  * Reduce your salt intake. Studies link high salt intake to osteoporosis risk.



### Kidney Stones

Having a kidney stone is one of the most physically painful experiences you can have. It usually requires a trip to the ER and heavy pain killers.

**15% of people in the U.S. will have a kidney stone in their lifetimes.** Kidney stones are another affliction of affluence, much more common in developed countries than in developing ones.

#### Diet and Kidney Stones

##### Animal Foods and Kidney Stones

Most kidney stones are formed of calcium and oxalate. Consuming animal products dramatically increases levels of these substances in your urine. Over time, this results in kidney stones.

##### Plant Foods and Kidney Stones

Free radicals may also trigger the formation of kidney stones. Eating plant foods increases your consumption of antioxidants, which fight these free radicals.

One study showed that **a plant-based diet eliminated kidney stones in patients with a history of recurring stones.** Increasing fluid intake also decreases your risk of getting a kidney stone.

### Vision Problems

#### Macular Degeneration

**Macular degeneration affects over 1.6 million Americans** and is a leading cause of blindness. The disease destroys the macula, which is responsible for transforming light into a nerve signal, the process that allows you to see. Unfortunately, this process also produces free radicals. These free radicals can damage the macula.

If this process is the same in everyone, and light hitting the eye always produces free radicals, why do some people develop macular degeneration and others don’t?

##### Diet and Macular Degeneration

As mentioned throughout the book, antioxidants combat free radicals. Some studies show that as much as **88% of blindness from macular degeneration could have been prevented if the people affected had consumed more antioxidants.**

In another study, people with the highest levels of carotenoids in their blood reduced their risk of macular degeneration by two-thirds. Researchers have found particular benefits in carotenoids from spinach, collard greens, broccoli, carrots, winter squash, and sweet potato.

Supplements did not confer the same benefits. The processes of various carotenoids working together are just too complex to put into a pill.

#### Cataracts

Cataracts are cloudy areas on the lens of the eye. **Half of all Americans will have cataracts by age 80** ,**** but they’re less serious than macular degeneration because we have effective surgeries to remove the clouded lens and replace it with a new one.

Like macular degeneration, cataracts are associated with free radical damage. Consequently, we can help protect ourselves from the formation of cataracts, and avoid surgery, by eating a diet rich in antioxidants. In a study of 1,300 people, **those who consumed the most lutein, an antioxidant found in spinach and dark, leafy greens, cut their risk of cataracts by half.**

### Cognitive Impairment and Dementia

By 2050, **14 million people will have Alzheimer’s** , which is a leading cause of death in the U.S. Alzheimer’s, a form of dementia, develops when the protein beta-amyloid forms plaque in the brain.

Cognitive impairment is less serious than dementia, involving confusion and mild memory loss. But people with mild cognitive impairment have ten times the risk of developing dementia as those who don’t. Let’s look at the risk factors for both of these widespread brain health issues.

#### Risk Factors

Cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and Type 2 diabetes tend to occur in the same populations and sometimes in the same individuals. Therefore, they share many of the same risk factors:

**Risk Factor #1: Hypertension** , which can be controlled by eating fewer animal foods.

**Risk Factor #2: High Blood Cholesterol** , which also can be controlled by eating fewer animal foods.

**Risk Factor #3: Free Radicals** , which, again, can be controlled by eating fewer animal foods. Animal protein escalates the damage of free radicals, while plant foods, which contain antioxidants, fight free radicals.

**Risk Factor #4: Genetic Predisposition**

Genes play a role, but as we’ve seen with other diseases, this role is minimal compared with other factors.

Studies have shown this time and time again. Japanese men living in Japan have a lower rate of Alzheimer’s than Japanese American men living in Hawaii. Africans have a lower rate of Alzheimer’s than African Americans. Because in each of these studies the groups compared shared a genetic heritage, the findings demonstrate that genes are not as important as environmental factors in the formation of Alzheimer’s.

#### Diet and Brain Health

There’s a lot of research supporting the idea that cognitive impairment and dementia aren’t inevitable. We can dramatically lower our risk by changing our diets.

Scientists have found the following associations between diet and brain health:

  * Populations that eat more fat and cholesterol and fewer grains have higher rates of Alzheimer’s.
  * Vitamins E and C, found in plant foods, and selenium, found in both animal and plant foods, reduce free radical activity and are associated with less memory loss.
  * Older adults who consume the most vitamin C and beta-carotene score the best on tests of mental acuity.
  * Adding three more servings of fruits and vegetables to your daily diet can reduce your risk of stroke by 22%. Reducing your stroke risk reduces your risk of vascular dementia.
  * Low blood levels of folic acid, found in plants, increases risk.
  * High blood levels of homocysteine, found in animal foods, increases risk.



The point of all these studies? **Eat more plant foods and fewer animal foods.**

### Summary of Recommendations

  * To reduce your risk of osteoporosis, exercise, reduce your salt intake, and get calcium from plant sources like beans, leafy greens, and plant-based milks.
  * If you’re prone to kidney stones, decrease your consumption of animal proteins, increase your consumption of plants, and drink lots of water.
  * To protect your vision as you get older, eat lots of spinach, collard greens, broccoli, carrots, winter squash, sweet potato, and citrus. Get your antioxidants from whole foods, not supplements.
  * Eat three more servings of fruits or vegetables a day to cut your risk of stroke. One serving could be a potato, ½ cup of broccoli, ½ cup of peaches, or ¼ cup of tomato sauce.
