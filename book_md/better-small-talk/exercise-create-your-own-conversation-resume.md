## Exercise: Create Your Own Conversation Résumé

King recommends creating a mental resume of your most interesting life experiences that you can draw on in any conversation. In this exercise, you’ll think about what might go on your conversation résumé and how you can speak about those experiences engagingly.

* * *

Reflect on what’s been going on in your week. Has anything interesting happened at work or on the weekend? Write a three-sentence mini-story to describe this experience.

Think more broadly about the last few months of your life. Are there any ongoing experiences that might be interesting to share? (For example, you or your partner might be pregnant, you might be training for a race, and so on). Write a mini-story about this experience.

Zoom out even farther and think about your entire life. Do you have any unique or extraordinary life experiences to talk about? Can you transform them into a mini-story?

Finally, reflect on what’s happening in the news—do you have any opinions or insights into current events? Write a mini-story that covers a current event and your take on it.
