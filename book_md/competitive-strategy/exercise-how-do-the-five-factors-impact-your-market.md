## Exercise: How Do the Five Factors Impact Your Market?

According to Porter, five factors shape a market’s competitiveness and profit potential: supplier influence, buyer influence, new competitors, alternative offers, and rivalry aggressiveness. Let’s explore how each factor impacts your market and the way your business operates.

* * *

Consider how many suppliers your business has to choose from, how many markets these suppliers serve, and how difficult or expensive it would be for you to switch suppliers. Write down at least one way your suppliers impact your ability to compete or generate profits.

Think about how many potential customers there are in your market and how many sellers they can choose to purchase from, how easy it is for them to switch between sellers, and how likely they are to seek out the best deals. Write down at least one way these customers impact your ability to compete or generate profits.

Reflect on the costs and challenges associated with competing in your market. Is it easy for new competitors to enter your market? Explain why or why not.

Consider the availability and quality of substitutes for your product or service, as well as their pricing. Are your customers likely to seek out substitute offers? Explain why or why not.

Think about the number of competitors in your market, the extent of differentiation in their offerings, whether they have high fixed costs, and your market’s growth rate. Are your competitors likely to adopt aggressive competitive strategies? Explain why or why not.
