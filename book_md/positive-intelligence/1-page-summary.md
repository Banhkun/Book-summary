## 1-Page Summary

In _Positive Intelligence_ , Shirzad Chamine explains that all of your stress and unhappiness is the result of antagonists in your brain—harmful patterns of thinking he calls _Saboteurs_ —that sabotage your thinking and the way you experience life. Chamine provides advice on how to connect with your higher self—your _Sage—_ to counteract these antagonists and improve every facet of your life. Most of his examples relate to improving your performance at work as leaders or teams, but he also explains how you can use your Sage to improve other areas of your life including parenting, performance in sports, finding meaning in your life, and improving your interpersonal relationships.

Shirzad Chamine is a best-selling author, lecturer, and coach who has trained hundreds of business executives. He has multiple advanced degrees, including a master’s degree in electrical engineering and an MBA from Stanford.

In our guide, we’ll examine the 10 Saboteurs that Chamine describes, as well as how to use your Sage to keep these Saboteurs in check and improve your _positive intelligence quotient_ (PQ). We’ll also explain how you can use attentional exercises to improve your PQ. Finally, we’ll add scientific context for many of Chamine’s ideas, as well as alternative techniques for the tips he offers.

### How Your Brain Sabotages Your Happiness and Success

According to Chamine, all stress comes from harmful thought processes that interfere with our ability to behave and reason rationally. These thought processes developed as survival mechanisms, but in adulthood, they hinder our happiness and success in every aspect of our lives.

According to Chamine, our brains can either work against us or for us in promoting our happiness and success. When it works against us, it’s because the part of our brains that developed for pure survival is in charge. This part of the brain is responsible for keeping us safe from dangers to our well-being during childhood by helping us identify and avoid threats. For example, a bad grade is a threat to our academic well-being, so our survival brain might push us to study intensely to avoid that threat. However, when we become adults, the survival brain does more harm than good: It continues to exaggerate threats and push us into states of high stress over things we can overcome if we use the other part of our brain, the one that developed to help us _thrive_ instead of just _survive_.

(Shortform note: Some experts distinguish the “survival brain” from the “learning brain.” They note that when your brain is in survival mode, you’re unable to focus on anything except perceived threats. People who’ve experienced trauma are likely to spend more time in the brain’s survival mode, and the more time spent in that mode, the harder it becomes to switch to learning mode. While Chamine suggests that being in survival mode during childhood is often beneficial, children can also suffer from spending too much time in survival mode because it makes it difficult to learn and thrive even in childhood. To help children enter learning mode, it’s important to give them a strong support system with healthy attachments to adults.)

In adulthood, the survival brain manifests as different mental antagonists, which the author refers to as _Saboteurs_. **These antagonists are tendencies our brains have to cope with stress in various unhealthy ways** , because our brain tells us that they’re the only ways to survive that stress.

(Shortform note: Chamine’s description of Saboteurs matches closely with the definition of cognitive distortions. Cognitive distortions are inaccurate or irrational thoughts that usually come from gut instincts and that negatively affect the way we think. In contrast to the techniques advised by Chamine, some experts recommend cognitive behavioral therapy for dealing with cognitive distortions. In the notes below, we will address some of the cognitive distortions that may fuel the Saboteurs Chamine discusses.)

Chamine adds the caveat that there are a few types of stress that are healthy: 1) the distress of mourning a loss and 2) the immediate, temporary distress that accompanies a negative event. This stress signals to you that the event could be damaging and that you need to do something to prevent further harm—like how the physical pain of using an injured limb signals you to stop using it to avoid further damage.

(Shortform note: Chamine’s caveats don’t address how we react to _ongoing_ negative events, but research suggests that the stress from such events—such as the Covid-19 pandemic—keeps us in survival mode for long periods of time. This is because we are continuously dealing with an active threat, so surviving the threat in the short term doesn’t make our survival response turn off. This ongoing stress response can continue to keep us safe, but it has negative long-term effects on our health. To better cope with this type of event, we may have to be more accepting of stress and understand that it may take a long time for it to fade.)

Chamine explains that there are a total of 10 Saboteurs:

  * The Judge
  * The Stickler
  * The Pleaser
  * The Hyper-Achiever
  * The Victim
  * The Hyper-Rational
  * The Hyper-Vigilant
  * The Restless
  * The Controller
  * The Avoider



Chamine writes that the Judge is distinct from the other nine Saboteurs, acting somewhat as their manager. Thus, we’ll discuss the Judge first and then group the other nine thematically and address them separately.

#### The Most Powerful Saboteur: The Judge

The Judge is the most dominant of all the Saboteurs. The Judge passes judgment on you, on others, and on your circumstances, finding faults in all of them—while also making you think you’re just being rational and trying to fix your or others’ flaws.

(Shortform note: Chamine identifies the Judge as the most dominant Saboteur for everyone, but he bases his claim on observations he’s made while coaching individuals and teams in a business context. Since this is a population with a common trait—a desire to perform better at work—it’s possible that these individuals are dominated by the Judge Saboteur but that other people are guided more by other Saboteurs.)

**Self-judgment** : The Judge tells you that you’re not good enough as you are, that your level of achievement determines if you’re worthy of love, and that if you allow yourself to be satisfied with who you are, you’ll stop improving and never be good enough. It tells you that you have to suffer to make yourself better and that happiness is just laziness.

(Shortform note: These types of self-judgments are characteristic of and can be exacerbated by _toxic productivity_ , or the cultural tendency to place excessive value on work and professional accomplishments, to demonize rest, and to glorify suffering. While this mentality may lead to greater professional success, it’s shown to be damaging to mental health and work-life balance, and it can also negatively impact your physical health.)

**Judgment of others** : The Judge sets similarly unreachable standards for other people in your life. It causes you to fixate on the Saboteurs it sees in other people. When the other person picks up that you’re judging them, their Saboteur reacts poorly, which reinforces your Judge’s assessment of them and creates a harmful cycle.

(Shortform note: Chamine addresses judgment of self and judgment of others as largely separate issues, but other experts suggest that they’re interrelated and that judging others reinforces your own insecurities. It also tends to give you an ego boost, which may temporarily assuage your Judge’s influence over you but will ultimately make you feel worse about yourself because the flaws you’re pointing out in other people are the same flaws you see in yourself. This suggests that judging others not only negatively affects them and your relationship with them, but also your own self-image and happiness.)

**Judgment of your circumstances** : The Judge also tells you that “You can only be happy when” some future event happens. In this way, it places a condition on your happiness—however, your happiness shouldn’t have a timetable and shouldn’t need to be dependent on your future circumstances. This Judge also moves the goalposts every time you get close to the thing that’s supposed to make you happy: If your Judge tells you you won’t be happy until you get a six-figure job, when you finally get that job, the Judge now fixates again on a future event that must happen before you can be happy, like getting a new vacation home or a job that pays seven figures.

(Shortform note: In _Stumbling on Happiness_ , Daniel Gilbert suggests that shaping your present choices around a future goal of happiness can actually reduce your future happiness. This is because you can’t accurately remember what made you happy in the past or correctly predict what will make you happy in the future, so even if you achieve what you think is a desirable goal, you might not derive much joy from it: By the time you achieve it, it will no longer be something that makes you happy. He suggests that you’re more likely to stumble into happiness by chance rather than achieve it through plans and goal-oriented choices, like changing jobs to make a higher salary.)

#### The Other Nine Saboteurs

The Judge also employs one or more of the other nine Saboteurs to develop patterns of unhealthy stress management and thinking. Which Saboteurs these are depends on your personality and your needs. Some of these Saboteurs share similar traits and themes, as we’ll explain below.

(Shortform note: Many of these Saboteurs are fueled by different cognitive distortions, which are biases or mindsets that skew our thinking and cause us to feel bad, think negatively, and misinterpret things. Anyone can be prone to cognitive distortions. However, many of these Saboteurs also overlap with things like neurodivergent conditions and trauma responses. Chamine doesn’t address how such conditions and responses affect the Saboteurs’ influence or whether his advice applies equally to people who have them.)

##### Critical Saboteurs

Some Saboteurs are characterized by a tendency to be overly critical and demand that we and others live up to their expectations.

**The Hyper-Achiever** is driven to impress others with personal achievements in order to feel good about themselves. They’re more concerned with how others view them than with staying true to themselves, and they alter their behavior and identity based on what they believe others would value rather than what they themselves value. They can be competitive and often prioritize work over other areas of their lives. They often view their emotions as distractions from their work and, as a result, they neglect their emotions and have trouble opening up to others. Because they seem so outwardly successful, others often feel like they need to imitate their fixation on achievement in order to better themselves.

**The Controller** feels the need to control their circumstances and other people. They compete with or challenge others in order to connect with them and have trouble understanding why people respond poorly to this approach. They feel impatient and anxious when they can’t be in control of a situation and believe that others want them to be in control as well. They feel others won’t accomplish as much if left to their own devices, struggle with being told what to do, and push people past their limits. Others feel resentful and smothered by the Controller.

**The Stickler** is a perfectionist. They hold themselves to high standards of organization, work ethic, and doing things the “right” way. They’re highly critical of others who don’t meet these standards, but they’re also extremely sensitive to criticism from others. They have no tolerance for mistakes and are inflexible in their thinking and in their work. Others are likely to resent them because they seem self-righteous and impossible to please.

> **Cognitive Distortions for Critical Saboteurs**
> 
> These three Saboteurs are fueled by cognitive distortions that relate to personal accountability, high standards, and control.
> 
> Specifically, the Hyper-Achiever is fueled by the tendency to minimize positive achievements (thus focusing only on “hyper” achievements), which leads them to dismiss their own accomplishments so that they’re never satisfied with what they’ve done. They’re also prone to magnification of negativity, so your Hyper-Achiever Saboteur tricks you into thinking that every setback is much bigger than it really is, and also that it’s the result of a personal failing in you or in someone else.
> 
> The Controller is fueled by a control fallacy, which is the belief that you are responsible and in charge of everything in your and other people’s lives. This leads to the sense that you’re personally responsible for everyone’s success, which causes you to resent others when they resist your attempts to control them. It’s also fueled by an entitlement fallacy, or the belief that certain rules—such as the rule that other people should do what you say—should apply to other people but not to you.
> 
> The Stickler is fueled by the personalization distortion, which, like the control fallacy, causes you to think that you’re responsible for things that are completely out of your control. A stickler is someone who commits adamantly to certain traits and behaviors, believing that if those are not followed, bad things will happen. The personalization distortion causes strong feelings of blame, making you beat yourself up for not preventing negative events even though they were unpredictable. It also causes you to take things personally and assume that other people are blaming you for things beyond your control. An extreme manifestation of the personalization distortion is rejection sensitive dysphoria, which is a reaction to criticism so intense that it causes you to experience physical pain.
> 
> All three of these Saboteurs are also fueled by unrealistic standards—or perfectionism—which causes you to believe that the only way to avoid mishaps in life is to maintain almost impossibly high standards and to be intolerant of mistakes.

##### Distractive Saboteurs

Some Saboteurs are particularly likely to try to distract you from your problems and negative emotions, making you seem distant and detached from others.

**The Restless** Saboteur is pleasure-seeking and can’t be satisfied with what they currently have. They tend to multitask and have many projects going at once, but they’re easily distracted from these and need constant novelty in their lives. They have trouble contemplating their feelings and fear negative emotions and missing out. They use their pleasure-seeking to avoid living in the present and dealing with their feelings or problems. Other people can have trouble connecting with them because of their avoidance of these, and it can be difficult to keep up with their changing needs and interests.

**The Avoider** places a disproportionate focus on positivity in order to avoid negativity. They’re conflict avoidant and struggle to say no and maintain healthy boundaries. They choose to let problems fester rather than confront them, especially if confronting them may upset someone else. They work hard to create a peaceful balance in their life and are anxious about losing it. They suppress their negative emotions for the sake of keeping the peace. This can keep them from forming deep bonds with others, and others often feel they can’t trust the Avoider to be honest about their feelings.

**The Hyper-Rational** Saboteur relies on a purely objective and rational approach to every aspect of life. They view emotions as hindrances to productivity and objectivity, and they tend to be skeptical and argumentative. They’re often brilliant but arrogant, and they attach their value as a person to their intellect and objectivity. They’re frustrated by and disdainful of others’ emotions, and they often feel lonely and like no one can understand them. Their analytical approach to interpersonal relationships can cause them to have shallow relationships and to intimidate others.

> **Cognitive Distortions and Conditions for Distractive Saboteurs**
> 
> These Saboteurs are fueled by cognitive distortions of your abilities and discomfort with emotion.
> 
> The Restless Saboteur is fueled by the mistaken belief that you can multitask, which studies have shown is not actually possible. You can’t give your attention to more than one thing at a time, and trying to do so decreases your efficiency and makes you busier—which may actually be appealing to the Restless Saboteur because if they’re perpetually “restless,” they can avoid thinking about their problems and emotions. However, some aspects of the Restless Saboteur are also characteristic of ADHD, such as pleasure-seeking and the need for novelty.
> 
> The Avoider is fueled by an underestimation of your coping abilities, which is often related to an overestimation of perceived threats. The fear of being unable to effectively cope with negative situations causes you to avoid those situations as much as possible, suppress negative emotions, and focus only on the positive. It can also lead to the avoidance of unpleasant tasks, or procrastination, which studies show is not the result of poor time management or lack of willpower, but rather an inability to manage the emotions related to unpleasant tasks. Persistent procrastination that disrupts your life can manifest as executive dysfunction, which can also be a trait of ADHD and other conditions like autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
> 
> The Hyper-Rational Saboteur is fueled by low emotional intelligence. The belief that emotional thinking and rational thinking are mutually exclusive or contradictory is a fallacy, as ignoring emotions causes you to ignore important contextual information. In fact, studies show that people who score better on tests of rational thinking are also more aware of and better at responding to emotions, suggesting that the Hyper-Rational Saboteur’s influence actually makes you less rational, and that “hypo-rational” might actually be a more accurate descriptor for this Saboteur than “hyper-rational.”
> 
> All three of these Saboteurs are prone to emotional repression and avoidance, which studies show can have a negative impact on both physical and mental health.

##### Fearful Saboteurs

Some Saboteurs operate from a sense of fear of negativity and stress, which tends to sap their energy and causes them to fixate on their struggles and worries.

**The Pleaser** tries to gain the approval of others by helping or flattering them, and they put the needs of others ahead of their own needs. They’re typically not able to express their own needs clearly and try to meet them by expecting others to reciprocate their help—which then leads to feelings of resentment when they don’t receive such help. They fear being selfish or making others dislike them. Their fixation on helping others can cause them to burn out, and it can make others dependent on them.

**The Hyper-Vigilant** Saboteur feels constantly anxious about all the things that could go wrong and often overreacts when things do. They expect others to mess up, and they fear backlash when they themselves mess up. They often rely on rules and authority for a sense of security. Their constant vigilance can be exhausting for themselves and others, and the energy they could devote to achieving what they want in life is used up by their anxiety.

**The Victim** uses emotion and a sense of martyrdom to get attention from others. They respond to stress by sinking into negative emotions like depression and apathy. They feel misunderstood, burdened by misfortune, and dependent on their personal problems. While they crave connection, their emotional unpredictability and tendency to isolate push others away. Others feel guilty that they can’t seem to help the Victim.

> **Cognitive Distortions and Trauma Responses for Fearful Saboteurs**
> 
> All 10 of the Saboteurs have characteristics similar to trauma responses, but these three in particular are often explicitly identified as trauma response behaviors. While Chamine acknowledges that the Saboteurs develop as defense mechanisms for threats in childhood, he doesn’t address the fact that such defense mechanisms may also be beneficial in adults who are experiencing trauma.
> 
> The Pleaser is characterized by people-pleasing behavior, which can be the result of low self-esteem, a fear of being seen as selfish, and a fear of negative consequences for saying no or failing to help others. However, people-pleasing is also a very common way to respond to trauma and is known as fawning. Fawning is one of the “Fs” of trauma responses, which also include fight, flight, and freeze, and it’s often a way to prevent genuine harm from an abuser or someone who’s presenting an active threat to you.
> 
> The Hyper-Vigilant Saboteur is fueled by catastrophizing, or the tendency to blow negative beliefs or predictions about the future out of proportion and always assume that the worst is going to happen. Catastrophizing can feel like a way to blunt the effects of a negative event by preparing yourself for the worst outcome, but the worst outcome is usually unlikely, and the stress of catastrophizing can be more harmful than the negative event itself. However, hypervigilance is also a trauma response, and, like fawning, it is sometimes used to minimize harm from abusers. Hypervigilance is particularly common in people with post-traumatic stress disorder.
> 
> The Victim is fueled by the mental filtering cognitive distortion, and it usually comes from the belief that people deserve whatever happens to them, a mentality that can be comforting because it can make us believe nothing bad will happen to us as long as we do everything right.

### The Sage: How to Combat Your Saboteurs

The Sage is the part of you that can control and override the Saboteurs. It embodies the part of your brain that developed to help you thrive and not just survive. The Sage accepts who you are and what your life is like in the present and views every change in circumstances as a gift.

(Shortform note: Since the term “sage” refers to someone with sound judgment

The Sage has five techniques it can use to propel your life forward in a positive way: empathy, exploration, innovation, navigation, and execution. Mastering and utilizing these skills will help you improve in all areas of your life, whether you’re participating in a team that’s trying to increase your company’s profits, confronting a conflict with your spouse, looking to add a deeper meaning and greater happiness to your life, or working on any other type of problem-solving or growth.

(Shortform note: In _First Things First_ , Stephen Covey identifies four human “gifts” that resemble the Sage’s techniques that Chamine describes. These gifts can help you improve your relationships with others and, consequently, your life in general. The gifts are 1) self-awareness, which he describes as understanding how you affect others and vice versa, much like empathy, 2) morality, which is similar to your power of navigation, 3) willpower, which Chamine doesn’t address in his five powers, and 4) creativity, which could encompass both exploration and innovation. Covey doesn’t describe a gift equivalent to the Sage’s power of execution, as Covey’s descriptions are more conceptual compared to Chamine’s more actionable advice.)

#### Technique #1: Empathy

This technique allows your Sage to offer gratitude, acceptance, and kindness to you and others. It is most beneficial when you or another person is feeling pain or fatigue. Empathizing heals and rejuvenates you so you can carry on with the emotional work you’re doing. This skill combats the Judge’s insistence that you or others aren’t trying hard enough and that you need to be stricter and more punitive to see improvement. It also helps you see past other people’s Saboteurs and keep them from provoking your own.

(Shortform note: When you offer yourself and others empathy and compassion, you experience a physiological response that helps your body rest by lowering your stress response. This, in turn, helps you relax. Conversely, thinking critically about yourself or others increases your body’s stress response, causing an accelerated heart rate and sweating. While you might be tempted to be more empathetic as a way to lower your stress response, it’s important to avoid falling into the trap of toxic empathy, or the tendency to empathize with others so intensely that their needs and problems begin to take precedence over your own. This can lead you to feed the Pleaser Saboteur. Balancing empathy for others with empathy for yourself can help you avoid this trap.)

People are often reluctant to offer empathy because they fear it will encourage negative behavior. They worry that showing compassion after someone makes a mistake is like condoning that mistake. However, Chamine asserts that empathy helps heal the damage done by mistakes that would otherwise stand in the way of learning and growth.

> **Empathy Versus Sympathy**
> 
> People often confuse empathy with sympathy, which can lead to a misuse of both skills. Empathy refers to feeling and understanding another person’s emotions, while sympathy refers more to feeling bad for someone. Some experts suggest that sympathizing with someone who’s behaving badly can mean you’re condoning their behavior because the pity you feel for them can cause you to want to spare them from the negative consequences of their behavior.
> 
> Empathy, on the other hand, provides emotional context to understand what someone’s feeling and what may be motivating their behavior. It’s possible—and even beneficial—to empathize with someone you strongly disagree with, and such empathy can open the door to communication that can help correct the other person’s negative behavior.

In order to employ your Sage’s empathy, Chamine recommends you visualize the recipient of your empathy as a child. For yourself, he suggests keeping a photo of yourself from childhood in a place that’s easily accessible so you can look at it when you’re feeling judgmental of yourself. For others, he recommends imagining what they were like before the Saboteurs of adulthood began to affect them. This will automatically prompt you to treat that person with more understanding and compassion.

(Shortform note: Other ways to practice empathy for others include going out of your way to meet new people and open yourself up to new perspectives, working on a project with them that combines your shared interests, and reading about people who are different from you (research suggests that reading fiction improves empathy and emotional intelligence). To get better at offering empathy to yourself, engage in self-care and activities that are comforting to you, write a letter to yourself describing what you’re feeling without placing blame on anyone, or talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend who’s struggling.)

#### Technique #2: Exploration

By exploring, you can tap into your natural curiosity to discover new ideas or solutions to problems. It’s most effective when you know you have a problem but you need to understand it better to solve it.

Many of us resist exploration because we’re focused on pushing ahead or on rebutting someone else’s argument, and we therefore don’t think about how we can re-examine what we’re seeing in the moment. If you already think you know what comes next, or if you’re just trying to win an argument, you’ll focus only on the information that supports your thinking rather than understanding every angle of a situation or listening neutrally to the other person’s point of view, and therefore you won’t explore alternative insights.

To effectively use exploration to defeat your Saboteurs, Chamine recommends approaching a difficult situation from the perspective of an anthropologist fascinated with what they’re studying. In this way, you can put your emotions to the side and become someone whose sole purpose in that moment is to learn more without judging what you’re learning. This will counteract your Judge’s tendency to only pay attention to information that supports your side. It will also counteract other Saboteurs’ influences, like the Hyper-Rational tendency to dismiss others’ emotions or the Victim’s tendency to view others’ opinions as a personal attack.

> **Applying Empathy to Exploration**
> 
> Other experts suggest that the exploration stage also requires you to use _empathy_ as you’re taking in other perspectives. The authors of _The Anatomy of Peace_ explain that to fully understand a conflict, you need to take on a cooperative mindset, which involves treating others with compassion and empathy and opening yourself up to change. They contrast this with a combative mindset, which is when you view others and differing perspectives as obstacles instead of as tools for collaboration. A combative mindset can lead you to view others as inferior, dismiss their opinions as unimportant, and mistreat them as people. This keeps you from exploring the real problem at hand.
> 
> In _Nonviolent Communication_ , Marshall Rosenberg explains that we’re rarely taught how to listen to others with empathy, so we tend to listen while preparing our own responses or figuring out how to “fix” the other person’s problems. As Chamine explains, we’re only listening to the information that supports our own ideas, causing us to miss important details and perspectives.
> 
> While they’re well-meaning, non-empathetic responses to others’ problems cause us to view the other person more as a project than a person. These responses include consoling the other person, giving them unsolicited advice, questioning what they’re saying, correcting them, or trying to turn their experience into a learning experience. Instead of these tactics, Rosenberg recommends frequently paraphrasing the other person’s words to make sure you’re understanding correctly.

#### Technique #3: Innovation

This technique allows you to create new, unexpected ideas and solutions to a conflict or problem without judgments or biases holding you back. It’s about generating as many new ideas as possible without evaluating them at all. Innovation works best when you’re in a situation where the old method of doing things is no longer effective and you need a new tactic.

(Shortform note: In _Getting Things Done_ , David Allen explains that, in addition to avoiding judgment, you should refrain from trying to organize your or your team’s ideas as they come up, letting them arise organically and only worrying about organization after the brainstorming phase is over. Organizing takes mental energy that would be better used on creativity. He also recommends writing your ideas down rather than trying to keep track of them in your head so you can free up mental energy and space for even more innovation.)

Withholding judgment can be difficult because our Judge wants to evaluate each idea as it comes to us. In a group setting, passing judgment makes people feel more self-conscious about their ideas and keeps them from suggesting things that are unique or outside the box. The same applies to your personal idea-generating process. Evaluating ideas as they come to us allows our Saboteurs to hold us back from truly great ideas because they’ll often decide an idea is too impractical, too difficult, or otherwise not worth considering. We remain fixed in our previous assumptions and ways of doing things and can’t come up with novel solutions.

To use innovation to overcome your Saboteurs, Chamine recommends that you follow each new idea that you or someone else generates with a “Yes…and…” statement. After you or someone else expresses an idea, say “Yes, here’s what I love about this idea…” and then you share your next idea. This encourages you (and your team if applicable) to acknowledge and show appreciation for each idea before moving on to the next, and it blocks out the negative feedback that would accompany sentences starting with “No” or “But.”

> **How to Brainstorm Effectively**
> 
> Judging ideas as they come can make us susceptible to cognitive biases such as the familiarity bias, which makes us view ideas more favorably if they’re similar to ideas we’re already familiar with. This closes us off to more innovative ideas that could greatly improve our current methods.
> 
> One reason brainstorming in groups isn’t always productive is that doing so often results in convergent thinking, which is when people’s ideas influence each other so that, when one idea is put forth, other ideas that follow are likely to be similar to that first idea. Brainstorming by yourself results in more divergent thinking, which leads to a wider variety of ideas.
> 
> Instead of a traditional, in-person brainstorming session, some experts recommend virtual brainstorming, in which members of a group brainstorm individually and then anonymously add their ideas to a shared collaboration tool like Google Docs. Once all the suggestions have been gathered, team members can comment (also anonymously) on each other’s ideas, and they can be refined from there. This method could be combined with Chamine’s “Yes… and…” technique so that each comment not only addresses the positive aspects of the idea in question but also suggests a new direction or a separate but related idea.

#### Technique #4: Navigation

The navigation technique helps you choose your next steps when there are many options available and you’re not sure which is best. You’ll use this technique to evaluate your different options and decide—based on your personal values or the values of your team—which option is best. These values become your navigation tool, and the more you use this tool, the stronger your values will become, and the more effectively you can use them to guide your actions.

To navigate effectively, you have to be in touch with your personal values, which can be difficult when your Saboteurs try to add false values. For example, the Hyper-rational Saboteur may try to push you toward paths that look better on a résumé but aren’t emotionally fulfilling. The Stickler may try to push you toward the path that leaves the least room for error even when those errors could be beneficial.

To take advantage of this technique, Chamine recommends that you imagine yourself at the end of your life looking back on this moment and ask yourself what you’ll wish you had done. This helps you shed your temporary concerns or superficial values and think about what truly matters to you. This way you can see what decisions work best in the moment, which will help you avoid regret in the future.

> **Finding Your Values**
> 
> In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins explains that understanding our values can be difficult because many of them developed without our conscious knowledge. Many came from social conditioning from parents, teachers, or peers, so a lot of your current values relate more to behaviors that you were rewarded for than principles that are personally important to you. This opens the door for your Saboteurs to influence your values by tying them to other people’s perceptions of you.

> Robbins explains that there are two types of values: _ends_ , or values that relate to a desired future outcome, and _means_ , or values that relate to methods of achieving a desired outcome. He emphasizes that you should be aware of the differences between these two and avoid focusing exclusively on means because you’ll risk losing sight of what you ultimately want to achieve.
> 
> For example, if the _end_ value you want to achieve is to be self-confident, you may decide to pursue this through the _means_ of exercise, focusing on the value of physical health. However, if you become overly fixated on the belief that you need to change your physical appearance, you may actually damage your self-confidence. Chamine’s exercise of imagining your future self looking back on you in the present moment can help you align your ends values with your means values.

#### Technique #5: Execution

This technique allows you to take action without interference from the Saboteurs. It’s the tactic you should use once you’ve clearly identified the path you should take. It allows you to do what’s right calmly and without emotional attachment to the outcome.

All of the Saboteurs try to interfere with your execution skills. They use their hang-ups to cause you to waste your time and energy, limit your options, and lose track of what’s best for you.

To use your execution skills, Chamine recommends anticipating the ways your Saboteurs will try to interfere with your action in advance. For example, your Avoider might tell you the new sales technique you’ve developed is too confrontational, or your Stickler might tell you your household’s new chore wheel technique will fail because your roommates won’t do a good enough job cleaning. Once you’ve thought through the different lies your Saboteurs might tell you to keep you from taking action, it will be easier to confront and dismantle those lies when they come up later.

(Shortform note: In _The Oz Principle_ , Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman explain that taking action and executing a plan requires commitment and accountability, and they offer some tips for how to stay on track with your plan. They recommend that you keep track of your results, which will also help you measure your progress as you go. They also recommend that you stay vigilant and don’t let momentary successes keep you from moving forward with your plan—staying aware of your inner _cheerleader_ and not letting it take too much control (which is the inverse of Chamine’s advice to be aware of your Saboteurs). Additionally, they suggest that you get comfortable with the feeling of risk, as this will help you bounce back and learn from failures and mistakes.)

### PQ: Positive Intelligence Quotient

Your overall ability to keep your Sage in charge and your Saboteurs at bay makes up your Positive Intelligence Quotient (PQ). Chamine rates PQ based on percentages, with 100% meaning your Sage is always in control and your brain is always working _for_ you, while 1% would mean your brain is always working _against_ you. Even though a score of 51% would mean your brain is working for you the majority of the time, Chamine has found that a score below 75% still means that the overall impact of your Saboteurs outweighs the impact of the Sage, suggesting that the negative impact of your Saboteurs is three times stronger than the positive impact of your Sage. He says that only 20% of people have a PQ of 75% or more.

(Shortform note: The reason the Saboteurs’ influence so heavily outweighs the Sage’s may be the result of humans’ negativity bias. Like the Saboteurs, this bias benefits us when we need to identify real threats, but it becomes harmful when it leads us to ruminate on everyday stressors. Since it’s not possible to eliminate stressors in our lives, overcoming the effects of the negativity bias requires consciously focusing on and more thoroughly processing positive things so they have a greater impact on our minds than the negative.)

Understanding your Saboteurs is the first step to increasing your PQ, and consciously employing your Sage’s powers is the second step. Chamine offers some exercises to strengthen your PQ brain to make this process easier.

#### A PQ Exercise

Remember, your Saboteurs exist in your survival brain and your Sage exists in the more advanced part of the brain that helps you thrive. Therefore, Chamine recommends that you use an attentional exercise to shift your thinking from the survival brain to the advanced part of the brain. The more you do this exercise, the more easily you’ll be able to shift your brain into the Sage state because your brain will form and strengthen new neural pathways to facilitate this shift. This will make your Sage stronger, improving its ability to combat your Saboteurs and enabling you to improve your overall thinking and every aspect of your life. Chamine designed these exercises to fit into your schedule so you don’t have to set aside extra time to do them.

To do this exercise, you’ll shift your attention away from your brain and onto your physical senses for at least 10 seconds at a time. For example, you may focus your attention on what you see in front of you, on the ambient sounds around you, or on the sensations of your clothes on your body. Whatever sense you choose, allow the sensory experience to fully occupy you and shut out the noise in your brain. Doing this for ten seconds—or approximately three breaths—counts as one repetition of a PQ brain exercise. Chamine recommends doing 100 repetitions per day.

You can do this exercise when you’re doing any activity, whether it’s focusing deeply on the feeling and taste of your food as you eat it, tuning in to the feeling of your muscles straining while you exercise, or immersing your brain in the physical sensation of hugging a loved one. In fact, you may find that you already do such attentional work during activities like showering, which requires little thought and involves a lot of physical stimuli. This may explain why people find themselves having more sudden insights while showering.

In order to establish this exercise as a routine and make it easier to remember to do, Chamine recommends doing a few reps every time you go to the bathroom, since that’s something you do several times per day. He also recommends doing a few reps any time you notice one of your Saboteurs trying to derail you, which is also likely to happen several times per day. If you do this consistently for a few weeks, the exercise will become habit.

> **PQ: A Mindfulness Practice**
> 
> The brain’s ability to change its structure in response to stimuli is called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity allows you to turn a behavior into a habit—and it’s also what allows you to learn how to shift into your Sage state more easily. The attentional exercise Chamine describes is a type of mindfulness, and research shows that practicing mindfulness can improve neuroplasticity. It can also improve mental health issues like anxiety and depression.
> 
> However, research suggests that conditions like depression can interfere with your brain’s neuroplasticity, making it harder to change. In cases where you’re trying to improve such conditions, it can be beneficial to pair your mindfulness practice with medication, as research suggests that certain antidepressants and other drugs can improve neuroplasticity.
> 
> Beyond increasing your PQ, other benefits of mindfulness include improved sleep, reduced blood pressure, improved memory, and better chronic pain management.
> 
> In addition to Chamine’s exercises, there are many ways to practice mindfulness. Some of these include spending more time focusing on your senses—like focusing on the taste of your food throughout your entire meal rather than just 10 seconds at a time. You can also use techniques such as body scan meditation, which involves paying close attention to each part of your body as you mentally scan it from top to bottom or bottom to top. You can also use kid-friendly activities like a sensory scavenger hunt—finding one thing in your environment that appeals to each sense—to teach children how to be mindful.
