## 1-Page Summary

Do you feel uneasy about attending social events or lack confidence when talking to people outside your social circle?

In this Master Guide, we’ll explore how to confidently approach and engage in conversations with new people. Our guide compiles suggestions and techniques from a range of authors and experts—including communication and body language experts, a charisma coach, an award-winning public speaker, an emotional intelligence expert, and a self-proclaimed “recovering awkward person.”

### Introduction: The Key to Conversing Confidently

Many people feel socially anxious and hold back from approaching new people because they believe they’re not _good_ at talking to others. Communication experts suggest that the first step to overcoming social anxiety is to recognize what makes people _want_ to interact with you. They agree that **the only thing you need to be good at when meeting new people is making them feel good about themselves**.

**People want to feel liked:** In _How to Talk to Anyone_ , communications expert Leil Lowndes argues that the need to be liked governs all social interactions. When people are unsure about whether you like them, they feel self-conscious. This makes them feel uncomfortable and they struggle to engage with you. On the other hand, when they’re sure that you like them, they feel at ease around you and enjoy your company—they like you because you make it easy for them to feel good about themselves.

**People want to feel interesting:** Self-proclaimed “recovering awkward person” Vanessa Van Edwards (_Captivate_) explains: **When you’re genuinely interested in other people, they find you interesting too** because of the “reciprocity effect,” a phenomenon where we like being with people who clearly like us, and we mirror the positive behavior they display toward us.

**People want to feel important:** Meanwhile, best-selling self-help author Dale Carnegie (_How to Win Friends and Influence People_) theorizes that more than anything else, the thing people want from their social lives is to feel important. In his eyes, people need feelings of “importance” as much as food or sleep.

To sum up, if you make people feel liked, interesting, and important, they’ll like you and enjoy engaging with you. In this guide, we’ll explore how to make others feel good and engage in confident conversations in five parts:

  * **Part 1** discusses how to prepare ahead of time so that you feel more at ease and can approach conversations with confidence and openness. 
  * **Part 2** explains how to send the right signals with your body language to make a good first impression and show others you want to get to know them. 
  * **Part 3** presents specific techniques for confidently approaching others and initiating conversations.
  * **Part 4** focuses on how to maintain a conversation that allows the other person to shine and showcase their best qualities.
  * **Part 5** explores how to end on a positive note that leaves a great lasting impression.



### Part 1: Plan Your Approach

You’ll feel more confident about interacting with new people if you **plan your approach _before_ you attend social events**. This involves being intentional about who you want to meet, where you want to meet them, and what you want to say to them.

#### Who Do You Want to Meet?

**You’re more likely to make others feel good and engage in confident conversations if you talk to people that make _you_ feel good. **

Van Edwards suggests that you can identify such people by thinking about those currently in your life who value and support you, so you can be on the lookout for people with similar characteristics. These might be people who eagerly help you achieve your personal and professional goals, who you feel comfortable reaching out to in a time of crisis, or who simply make you feel good about yourself.

Once you have an idea of the type of people who make you feel good, consider what types of situations you're likely to find them in.

#### Where Do You Want to Meet Them?

**You’re more likely to make others feel good and engage in confident conversations if you attend events where you feel happy and comfortable.**

Van Edwards recommends that you make a list of all the settings you love, loathe, and feel OK about, then accept invitations in places you love, reject ones in places you loathe, and take time to consider the ones that are in the locations you feel OK in. For example, do you find bars loud and overwhelming? If so, it’s probably best to avoid them since you’ll feel uncomfortable and have a hard time engaging with others. Do you love the feel of an intimate coffeehouse? If so, go there, because you’ll feel in your element and will naturally project confidence that will attract others.

However, Lowndes warns that restricting yourself to specific situations and activities limits your ability to engage with people who have other interests. The more you try out or read about different activities, the easier you’ll find it to communicate with a wider range of people.

#### What Do You Want to Say to Them?

**You’re more likely to make others feel good and engage in confident conversations if you prepare what to say in advance.** This involves thinking about what kinds of topics you’ll be expected to talk about, preparing questions that make it easy for people to engage with you, and coming up with compelling responses to common questions you’ll likely be asked.

##### Method #1: Find Out Who’ll Be There

Before attending any event, find out who’ll be there—will it include people from a single profession or interest group? According to Lowndes, knowing what types of conversations you’ll be expected to engage in will indicate what topics you should brush up on.

##### Method #2: Create a List of Thought-Provoking Questions

In _The Fine Art of Small Talk_ , speaker and communication expert Debra Fine suggests that you prepare specific questions about the person (or people) you want to meet, the event, or the situation. Her examples of the kinds of questions you can prepare include:

  * What’s your favorite way to relax after work?
  * What do you like about [open mic night, Amber’s parties, the Smithsonian]?
  * Have you ever been to [a protest, a seminar, a meetup] like this before?
  * Are you from around here? Are there any local events I should know about?



Lowndes adds to this by suggesting that you stay up to date on current affairs so that you can find common topics to discuss.

##### Method #3: Craft Stimulating Responses to Common Questions

When people first meet each other, they usually ask two questions: “Where are you from?” and “What do you do?” Normally, they each respond with fact-based answers—for example, “I’m from New York and I’m an engineer.” But, Lowndes argues, this sort of answer shuts down a conversation—if your conversation partner’s never been to New York or knows nothing about engineering, they won’t know how to continue the conversation.

Instead, Lowndes suggests extending your responses to these two questions in a way that stimulates a response—by using interesting facts, jokes, or general observations. This requires coming up with different variations depending on who you’re talking to and the social context you’re in. If you’re seeking to make friends, keep your responses fun and general. For example, “I’m from X—where they make the best goat’s cheese in the world.” If you’re talking to them for networking purposes, consider what interest this person could have in you or your work and include that in your response. For example, “I’m an engineer and have been working on X for the past two years.”

### Part 2: Make a Great First Impression

**Once you arrive at a social event, focus on making a great first impression.** This involves sending open body language cues to appear welcoming and make others want to engage with you.

#### Your Body Language Determines People’s First Impressions of You

Why should you pay attention to your body language if you want to make a great first impression? According to Lowndes, people rely on body language to form an instinctive impression of everyone they come across within the first few seconds of _seeing_ them. This means that, before you get a chance to utter your first words, people have already made assumptions about your personality, your feelings, your confidence levels, and your social or professional status. Most importantly, **they’ve already decided whether you’re the type of person that they want to spend time with.**

Additionally, award-winning public speaker Peter D. Andrei (_How Highly Effective People Speak_) explains, the first impressions people have about you influence how they _continue_ to think about you. He says that the assumptions others initially make about you influence their long-term relationship with you due to a phenomenon called _the halo effect: the tendency for people to base their overall impression of a person on one observed quality_.

The halo effect is the result of a combination of other cognitive biases, including the primacy effect, attribution substitution, and confirmation bias. When you notice an initial positive quality in a person (primacy effect), you’ll attribute a host of other positive qualities to that person (attribute substitution), and then see small signs that point to those positive qualities as confirmation of your beliefs (confirmation bias).

In other words, if your body language initially makes others feel as if you like them, they’ll _continue_ to feel that you like them, regardless of what you say or do.

#### Distinguish Between Open and Closed Body Language Cues

Now that you understand how important body language is in making a positive first impression, here’s some practical advice for making yourself appear more approachable and likable.

##### Adopt Open Body Language Cues

According to body language experts Allan and Barbara Pease (_The Definitive Book of Body Language_), **people who are friendly and approachable tend to hold a relaxed and open posture** , raise their eyebrows to signal that they’re happy to engage in conversation, make eye contact, and smile.

Lowndes clarifies that people interpret good posture as a welcoming signal because it implies that you’re proud and confident and have nothing to hide. They’ll assume that you’re an accomplished person who deserves their attention. She adds that people interpret a relaxed and open stance as a sign of an honest and welcoming personality because it signals that you’re calm, unafraid of appearing vulnerable (because you have nothing to hide), and approachable.

To come across as calm, self-assured, and trustworthy, she suggests that you practice keeping your arms loosely by your sides with your palms and wrists facing upwards. If you’re approached by people you want to talk to, turn your body totally toward them to show them they’ve got your full attention—this implies that you’re happy to be in their company and puts them at ease.

##### Avoid Closed Body Language Cues

According to Allan and Barbara Pease, people who don’t want to be approached tend to hold a stiff or guarded posture (for example slouching with their arms folded), avoid eye contact, and frown.

Lowndes explains that people interpret poor posture as an unwelcoming signal. Trying to minimize your physical presence by slumping implies that you’re insecure or ashamed and don’t want to be approached. Further, she says that people interpret fidgeting and guarded movements as insincerity because they make you look suspicious and defensive:

  * Fidgety movements, such as shuffling your feet or touching your face, come across as signs of discomfort, tension, or distraction. 
  * Guarded movements, such as folding your arms or clutching something in front of your body, also convey discomfort. Additionally, they give the impression that you’re placing barriers between yourself and other people. 



### Part 3: Make Your Approach and Start a Conversation

After making a good first impression upon your arrival, **the next thing you need to do is approach someone to talk to**. Approaching others can be intimidating—most people prefer to keep to themselves or talk to people they already know rather than risk rejection or awkwardness.

However, Fine suggests that**you should actively approach strangers andaccept that if you want to have conversations, it’s your job to start them**. She explains that the second most common fear in America is of starting conversations, particularly with strangers. Because this fear is so common, you’re unlikely to face rejection if you initiate conversation—in fact, your conversational partner is likely to be relieved that you made the effort.

If you’re afraid to talk to someone because you fear you’ll have nothing in common, Fine suggests you **keep in mind that humans are more alike than they are different**. If you give other people a chance, you’ll find you can connect with almost anyone.

Let’s explore a three-step process for approaching and initiating conversation with others.

#### Step #1: Choose Someone to Approach

Fine suggests that you first scan the room and find someone who’s on their own, who’s not engaged in a conversation or an activity, and who makes eye contact with you. **When you make eye contact, smile at the person.** Fine explains that this shows the other party you’re interested in them and immediately establishes a rapport. Their natural response will likely be to smile back; right off the bat, the two of you share a positive feeling.

Additionally, Lowndes suggests that you read body language cues to **differentiate between those who want to be approached and those who don’t. **Recall: A relaxed and open stance implies that you’re welcome to approach them. If they’re slumped, guarded, or fidgety, you probably won’t get the warm response that you want.

##### Time Your Approach

Van Edwards recommends that you **interact with people in the places and at the times when they’re most likely to be receptive to conversation**. In general, this means approaching people once they’re settled in. She says the best locations and times to engage with people are:

  * Near the bar, once people have gotten their drinks and are looking to socialize
  * With the host, who can introduce you to other people
  * Where people are sitting and eating and are open to company and conversation



On the other hand, you’ll find it difficult to approach others when they’re in transition—for example, when they’re arriving at or leaving an event, getting drinks at the bar, or using the bathroom.

#### Step #2: Introduce Yourself

Once you’ve chosen who you want to approach, you’ll then need to confidently introduce yourself to them. Let’s explore three different methods that will help you express your interest in others _and_ set the stage for engaging conversations.

##### Method 1: Say, “Hi. My Name Is…”

Fine suggests that, once you’ve chosen who to approach and have established rapport through a smile, you should walk up to them, make eye contact, smile again, and shake their hand. Say, “Hi. My name is…” Then, stay focused as they return the introduction. Remember their name**** and use it immediately: For instance, say “Nice to meet you, Albert!” **If you miss a person’s name, Fine recommends asking them to repeat it.** Everyone has the right to be called by their name, she notes, and those with difficult names will appreciate it (and feel important).

Dale Carnegie expands on Fine’s suggestion by explaining that _everyone_ is thrilled when someone learns and uses their name. Carnegie argues that a person’s name is the most important word in any language to them—saying it is a subtle and welcome compliment. In contrast, forgetting a name or getting it wrong suggests you didn’t care enough to get it right. Use a person’s name often, he says, and respect it.

##### Method 2: Ask for Introductions

According to Lowndes, another effective way to approach new people is to ask mutual acquaintances to make introductions for you. Before they introduce you, ensure that they’ll pad out these introductions with a few details, such as the new person’s hobbies or interests, so that you have the opportunity to show your interest and start a discussion.

Alternatively, if your acquaintances are too busy to introduce you, ask them for information so that you can find a shared interest to use as an icebreaker. With this information, you can easily approach someone new using a variation of the following line: “Hey, I was just talking to … and she told me that you …”

##### Method 3: Use and Take Notice of Visual Gimmicks

Alternatively, Lowndes suggests that you can forgo standard introductions and, instead, draw attention to yourself by wearing or carrying something unusual, such as a unique brooch or a colorful shirt. This gives people an excuse to approach you and gives you something to talk about. Likewise, pay attention to what those around you are wearing or carrying so that you have an excuse to approach them. Using a complimentary phrase such as, “Wow, I love your shoes! Where are they from?” not only helps you to start a conversation, but it also shows others that you’re interested in them and what they have to say.

#### Step #3: Start a Conversation

The three methods we’ve just covered will help you feel more comfortable about introducing yourself to others. Now let’s look at four different methods for transitioning from this initial encounter into engaging conversations.

##### Method 1: Break the Ice

According to Fine, it doesn’t matter much _what_ you say as an opener; in theory, you could say _anything_.**What matters is that you initiate the conversation and show genuine interest in the other person’s answer.** Her recommendation, if you’re having trouble, is to open with a statement that uses the context of the situation, event, or venue, and then ask them a related question.

Psychiatrist and professor Mark Goulston (_Just Listen_) reiterates the importance of expressing interest in others when starting conversations: To gain someone’s attention and curiosity, focus on learning about them instead of talking about yourself. Goulston explains that if you try to sound interesting, you risk coming off as annoying or self-obsessed. Instead,**by displaying sincere interest in the person you’re talking to, you’ll likely inspire them to reciprocate interest in you.**

##### Method 2: Initiate Thought-Provoking Conversations

Van Edwards asserts that to make others like and remember you, you have to **break out of the boring small talk mold andignite interesting conversations that push people to think of new and different things.** She explains that we’re most compelling to others when we’re unscripted because novelty triggers activity in the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning and is linked to dopamine pathways that arouse pleasure and fuel interest.

To start novel conversations, you can ask questions that 1) people don’t expect, to shake them out of their rut, and 2) engage people by prompting them to talk about subjects they love and are excited to talk about. For example, “What’s the most exciting thing that happened to you today?” or “What’s the one thing you’re most looking forward to doing this year?”

### Part 4: Keep the Conversation Flowing

The methods we’ve just covered will help you feel more confident about approaching others and initiating conversations. Now let’s explore different techniques for keeping the conversation flowing in a way that allows your conversation partner to shine.

#### Technique #1: Focus on Their Positive Traits

In _4 Essential Keys to Effective Communication_ , poet and relationship skills trainer Bento C. Leal III suggests that the key to good conversations is figuring out what makes others unique and worthy. To do this, consider the positives of each person you encounter and your relationship with them—what are their skills, talents, positive traits, and so on? What can you learn from them?

Lowndes adds to this by explaining that, the more you focus on others’ good qualities, the more they’ll appreciate you for seeing the best in them. She suggests that you focus your attention only on the good things about them. Don’t put them down or make jokes at their expense. Likewise, don’t draw attention to their faults—for example, if they fumble in some way or say something inappropriate. Instead, do your best to make them feel comfortable and accepted for who they are.

One way to put this into practice is to give genuine compliments. Think about what you’re learning about them and what they seem to care about, and use complimentary statements to uplift them. This will make them feel appreciated and will encourage them to continue talking. For example, if they’ve been discussing parenthood, say something like, “Well, it sounds like your children are lucky to have you.”

#### Technique #2: Ask Open-Ended Questions

According to Fine, a conversation flows best when you create opportunities for your partner to share details you can explore more deeply. **Therefore,ask your conversational partner open-ended questions that demand more than a one-word answer.** Show interest and encourage them to talk about themselves: The more your partner gives you, Fine says, the more you’ll have to work with later.

Journalist Kate Murphy (_You’re Not Listening_) expands on this by explaining that **open-ended questions allow the speaker to direct the conversation** —in contrast to closed questions that steer the conversation in a particular direction. By asking open-ended questions, you can encourage the other person to speak freely about whatever they want.

For example, if someone tells you about getting lost while traveling abroad, you could ask an open-ended question like, "How did you react?" instead of a closed question like, “Did you have a map?” The first question allows the speaker to choose the direction of the conversation, while the second one narrows the conversation to a detail chosen by the listener.

#### Technique #3: Highlight Shared Connections

According to Van Edwards, finding your similarities with others makes you more appealing to them because **we like and get along more easily with people who agree and share common interests with us**. You can take the following steps to identify and illuminate your similarities with others:

  1. Find out if you share friends or interests, or are engaged in any of the same online or in-person groups, like a book club or gym class.
  2. Ask _why_ the friend, interest, or group you have in common matters to the other person. She suggests asking “why?” repeatedly as a way to probe deeper and enrich your understanding of the conversation. 
  3. Offer to help or be a resource for the other person if 1) you feel you’ve developed a genuine connection with them and 2) you have something useful you can provide them.



#### Technique #4: Listen Attentively

In _The Charisma Myth_ , charisma coach and keynote speaker Olivia Fox Cabane explains that being a good listener is important because humans tend to associate the people, places, and things around them with their emotional state, even if the connection isn’t logical. This means that **how your partner feels when talking to you is far more important than what you talk about**. If you make them feel good by being genuinely interested in them, they’ll perceive you as a fascinating conversationalist—even if you do nothing but listen.

World-renowned emotional intelligence expert Travis Bradberry (_Emotional Intelligence 2.0_) adds that listening isn’t just about hearing words, but also understanding the accompanying signals. He says tone, volume, and pacing all signal subtext and emotion (for instance, if someone speaks quickly and quietly, they may be intimidated). Stay focused on the conversation at hand. Half-focused listening prevents you from picking up important information and makes the other person feel disrespected.

Cabane offers three tips on becoming a good listener. The first is to _practice_ _mindfulness_ , which will help you concentrate on your partner’s words. Second, _don’t interrupt_. No one likes to be cut off mid-sentence. Finally, instead of talking as soon as your partner stops speaking, _allow for a pause_ to absorb what they’ve just said. They’ll feel like you’re trying hard to understand their words.

Murphy expands on the value of pausing: By refraining from speaking immediately after the other person stops, you give the other person time to get their whole thought across—which is important because people often don’t say exactly what they mean on their first try. Additionally, encountering a pause often prompts a speaker to elaborate on their point, sharing details they may not have shared otherwise.

### Part 5: End on a Positive Note

At the end of your conversation, exit in a way that leaves others with a positive _lasting_ impression of you and how you made them feel.

Fine suggests that, when it’s time to leave, you thank your conversational partner for their expertise, their time, or the joy of conversing with them.**A genuine compliment or expression of gratitude leaves the other person feeling good about you and gives you an air of confidence and poise.** She also suggests that if you want to see the person again, issue an invitation and don’t take it personally if you’re turned down.

In _Never Eat Alone_ , entrepreneur Keith Ferrazzi adds more practical advice for maintaining a connection with your conversational partner: Follow up between 12 and 24 hours later. When you do, thank the person for their time, remind them of a part of your conversation—a joke they made, or a topic you agreed on—and suggest you meet again. You don’t have to set a time or invite them to anything specific right away—just express that you _want_ to meet again, and let them know you’ll be in contact soon to discuss the details.
