## Exercise: Plan Your Approach

Think about how you can prepare to approach new people at an upcoming social event or occasion.

* * *

Write down an event you’ll be attending soon where you’ll meet new people. Now, list the types of people who’ll be there, noting their professions or interests. (For example, you’re attending a book club and will be meeting literature enthusiasts.)

Based on what you wrote, list two thought-provoking questions you might ask to initiate a conversation. (For example, “What’s the most memorable book you’ve read recently?” and "If you could recommend one book that had a significant impact on your life, which one would it be?”)

Write down at least one way you might respond to the questions, “Where are you from?” and “What do you do?” in a way that stimulates a response. (For example, “I'm from a city nestled between mountains and surrounded by lush forests.” and “During the day, I’m a website designer, and I spend my evenings playing jazz piano.”)

Now that you’re prepared, how do you feel about the prospect of attending the event? (For example, does being ready give you a feeling of confidence?) Do you feel it’s worth preparing like this in the future? Explain your answers.
