## Part 4.1: Diving Deep Into Games

Operations, rituals, and small talk are all simpler forms of social interaction. By analyzing them, we’ve seen how an interaction is a sequence of exchanges, and how our beliefs shape the behaviors we enact. Now that we’ve covered these simpler interactions, we can move on to games. Games are more complex but, because we’ve explained small talk, we only need to add a bit more detail: specifically, about the deceptive nature of games.

Part 4.1 explains what games are and why they matter to each of us. We’ll then explore a reworked catalog of games to update Berne’s “thesaurus” with contemporary examples.

In Part 4.2, we’ll discuss the basic pattern that games follow and the purposes they serve in our lives. Finally, Part 4.3 will explain how to use Berne’s recommended strategies for identifying and overcoming your own unhealthy games.

### Defining Games

#### Games as Natural Phenomena

**A game is a set, stereotypical pattern of interaction,** Berne says. Think of it as an “act” that someone puts on—for example, a husband who regularly explodes, apologizes, then _acts_ like it never happened. This pattern can occur across thousands of households, and so can any other game—the same “acts” occur in many specific instances throughout a population.

In this way, games are almost _natural_ _phenomena._ They’re __ like migration patterns, or bird mating dances. Berne is simply saying, “Look! Here are all these consistent, identifiable patterns in the fabric of human social exchange,” in the same way an ecologist points out patterns in a forest ecosystem.

(Shortform note: Insofar as the approach of science is to find and confirm patterns in the fabric of reality, Berne’s approach here is quite scientific. A 2006 paper in the Transactional Analysis Journal argues that Berne was a phenomenologist: He observed patterns across thousands of patients and described what he saw. This contrasts with Freud’s work, which relied heavily on individual case studies. But you need a large, representative sample to accurately generalize any psychological phenomenon across a population, in order to buffer the effect of outliers that might skew results in a smaller sample size. Freud, however, extrapolated much of his theory from a small set of his patients—which is why much of it isn’t considered empirical.)

##### Games in Plain Language

So a game is a natural phenomenon, a pattern. Now let’s look at the characteristics of this kind of pattern.

**A game is a habitual way of behaving. Games are social—we play them in our close relationships.** Each game follows a consistent sequence of “moves,” aimed toward an (unconsciously) desired outcome. That aim is typically to reinforce an existing stance of yours.

In this example, try to spot the four aspects mentioned above. This game, called “Mr. Vesuvius,” continues the previous example. It goes like this:

  * Mr. Vesuvius is a regular working man in regular suburban America. He’s a hard worker and provides for his family, but struggles with emotionality.
  * Failing to manage his daily stressors, pressure gradually builds in Mr. Vesuvius. Then his kid or wife steps slightly awry, and suddenly Mr. Vesuvius erupts. A shattered cup becomes an excuse to pour weeks of pent-up frustration out onto the unfortunate family member. _They don’t understand how hard he works, they give him no respect, and never show him any care._
  * Eventually his anger wanes, and he walks off. He comes back to apologize, but pivots sharply to explain how justified the eruption was. Soon after, he’s laughing and smiling once more. 



You might know this game; it’s fairly common. We’ll look more closely at each move of a game, and their functions, throughout this part of the guide. First, two more important aspects of games:

  * **We play games unconsciously.** These are not intentional social games, like learned strategies for flirting or debating. Mr. Vesuvius isn’t consciously choosing to behave as such—he’s stuck in a game. (And because we aren’t aware of the games we play, Berne later recommends that we develop self-awareness so we can escape them.)
  * **Games are typically unhealthy**. A game is driven by some unhealthy, underlying belief, usually resulting from childhood trauma (here Freud’s influence on Berne is apparent). Take for example Mr. Vesuvius’s belief that “People won’t respect me if I’m kind, so I should strike first.” In Berne’s view, that belief causes him to create situations that reinforce the belief. 



> **Games and Mindfulness**
> 
> In the 1960s, mindfulness hadn’t yet surged in popularity as it has today. If it had, might Berne have made use of the effects it can have on psychological growth?
> 
> As Berne notes, one of the primary characteristics of games is that we play them unconsciously. One of the primary functions of mindfulness meditation is to train your awareness, which heightens how conscious you are to normally unconscious aspects of your experience.
> 
> Mindfulness correlates positively with successful behavioral change, and it seems to be effective for treating everything from substance abuse to binge eating. Closer to Berne’s main interest, Mindfulness-Based Relationship Enhancement (MBRE) has been found to improve empathy, shared well-being, and communication in intimate relationships—it’s hard to imagine he wouldn’t have taken an interest in such an effective tool.

##### Games in Terms of Transactional Analysis

With games explained in plain language, let’s look at a few more of Berne’s technical distinctions.

**In a game, each player acts according to an underlying motive**.**** These come from their beliefs, and players aren’t conscious of them. Berne isn’t clear about this, but we can infer that a player’s motive is typically to reinforce their stance. So if Player A believes “I am essentially unlovable,” she’ll play a game that tries to prove this. It follows that...

**Games are dishonest.** Unaware of the habits they’re stuck in, the player of a game tries to manipulate, provoke, or otherwise cause the other to prove her right. Again, this manipulation isn’t conscious. Berne says this is a key characteristic of games.

Say for example that Player A struggles to accept love. She shies away from affection, and starts to lash out when her romantic partner gets too close. Eventually the other feels spurned, insults her in a fit of anger—and so, her belief is confirmed.

(Shortform note: Berne’s view of games seems fairly deterministic: He seems to believe that, in most cases, people are ignorant of the psychological forces driving their behaviors, and incapable of acting otherwise. While 1960s culture may have been less self-aware, we’ve become increasingly focused on personal development, with more and more people engaging in awareness practices like mindfulness. The problems Berne indicates remain: We’re still susceptible to behaving without thinking, and cognitive biases often have us uncritically seeking confirmation of our beliefs. But in theory, dishonest relational styles may grow less prevalent as our culture continues to invest in personal growth: Widely held goals like achieving happiness, fulfillment, and well-being aren’t compatible with dishonest, deceptive behavior.)

Games aren’t _blatantly_ dishonest, though. **On the surface, games look like superficially believable interactions** , and the underlying motive isn’t obvious. Often, neither player consciously knows the game they’re playing. These are deceptive exchanges at play: You say one thing, but mean another.

Berne would say that the woman above _appears_ to be upset with her partner, but it’s actually about a deeper psychological issue—her self-destructive belief.

**People play games that complement one another’s** —Player A’s game fits like a puzzle piece into Player B’s game. Berne gives the example of “Wooden Leg” (we’ll call this “Poor Little Me”), where Player A leverages any minor hurt to shirk their responsibilities. This enables Player B to play “You Lazy Bum,” harrying Player A into their work. Player A now feels even more pitiable, which in turn leads Player B to pity them even less.

**Games are dramatic** —there’s usually some confrontation or emotional flare-up, like a fight over where to go for dinner. This happens in “Cornered,” where a simple plan for dinner or dancing gets derailed when one player triggers some sore spot in the other, and an argument ensues.

An argument is often the game's “payoff,” the end result the players seek. Berne states that the players appear to be upset but are secretly pleased, because the fighting confirms their stances.

(Shortform note: Berne’s idea of a “payoff” at the end of a game seems to anticipate the idea of rewards from the habit loop. In short, you perform a habit because there’s a reward at the end, usually some form of pleasure that, on a neural level, offers dopamine. In Berne’s model, the game’s “payoff” is the reward—one that usually validates your beliefs—while Charles Duhigg’s notion of rewards is more general. James Clear introduced the idea of “cravings,” to explain how we’re drawn into repeating habits. Berne may have intuited this notion as well, as he later characterizes games as indulgences—very close to _cravings_.)

#### Why Games Matter

Games play a more significant role in our lives than we realize. Since we’re typically unconscious of them, they can impact us in ways we don’t understand. For example, you might feel confounded by an inability to build a lasting relationship. This could be due to a game you’re playing!

Berne gives several reasons to explain the “so what?” of games, which we’ve distilled below along this theme: Games quietly influence how our lives unfold, often beneath our awareness. **Unless we notice them and learn to change them, we’ll get stuck in patterns we never chose for ourselves.**

**#1: Your games are your inherited relational style.** They come from at least as far back as your grandparents, Berne says, and possibly up to 100 years. They’re how you deal with discomfort and how you relate to the people closest to you (even if it’s by arguing over dinner spots). You express your characteristic emotions through your games—for example, Mr. Vesuvius’ outburst-game is a major part of who he is.

So if you’re unaware of your games, you probably don’t have a great handle on how you habitually relate to others. Or of the emotional palette and patterns that compose your life. Becoming aware of them is the first step toward more consciously shaping that social-relational style.

(Shortform note: One study found that nurture, more than nature, appears to predict adult attachment styles. This seems to support Berne’s case: That how we’re raised, more than genetics (he doesn’t mention this) determines how we relate to others. On the other hand, consider that your family’s inherited games are like your “emotional genetics”: traits and habits that persist through many generations. If we’re raised through persistent, inherited habits, is “nurture” much different from the inherited “nature” of our genes? This likely depends on whether your parents strictly followed what they were given, or broke off and developed their own perspectives. But could that inclination to individuate also be an inherited, nature-set tendency?)

**#2: You may unknowingly pass your games on.** Much of raising children, Berne says, happens as we unconsciously teach children our games. Children imitate their parents, so if they see you berating the dog when you spill soup, they’ll absorb that—“when something upsetting happens, dump your frustration onto vulnerable others.”

Becoming aware of your games is therefore a significant opportunity to break your family’s negative cycles. Maybe you’ve inherited a dysfunctional relationship with anger, or crippling shyness, or mildly narcissistic tendencies—we all get _something_ that’s not great. But if we can notice these (and learn to change them), we put ourselves in a position to raise healthier children.

(Shortform note: This is much like the idea of generational curses: Repeated stories and behaviors pass from parents to children, such that the kids live lives similar to their parents’. Breaking these can help us to be more than just a “chip off the old block,” freeing us to develop in our own directions. The difficulty is that our education skips over “How to Grow 101,” leaving most to learn how to overcome unhealthy habits, and form new ones, on their own. The habit loop—James Clear explains a habit as a cycle of cue → craving → response → reward—is one piece of the puzzle. When wielded with sufficient self-awareness, it can enable you to untangle inherited habits and, as Clear explains, to reshape your identity to support new behaviors.)

**#3: Your games determine who enters your life.** Your close social circle and your intimate relationships are both made up of people who mesh with your games, Berne says. But maybe yours aren’t too healthy, so you keep ending up in failed relationships, or you find that old friendships feel frozen in time. Maybe your games are holding you back, and you aren’t even aware of them.

We inherit our games but they don’t fully reflect our unique personalities, Berne says. So we can infer that if you form relationships according to games you didn’t consciously choose, those relationships won’t really match you either. So again, learning your games and reshaping those habits puts you in a better position to live consciously, as opposed to being governed by unconscious, inherited forces.

(Shortform note: A 2016 study found that “opposites attract” actually isn’t true. In contrast, Berne’s view seems accurate—the study’s authors say that we choose partners who are very similar to us. When we meet a potential partner, we look for shared values and common ground. We also look for shared behavioral tendencies, like Berne suggests. The more connections we can find, the more we’ll trust that person, and feel that we can cooperate with them toward shared goals. Picking your partner based on these similarities is so common, they say, that it’s practically a “psychological default.”)

#### Classifying Games According to the Areas of Life

Berne gives multiple ways to classify games, with the clearest simply dividing them into several areas of life. Below, we’ve reworked Berne’s scheme and updated his examples.

**Pseudo-Small Talk** develops out of small talk, when the friends of a group have drawn closer. These games often start as small talk, then develop some counterproductive or unhealthy quality. From Berne’s writing, it isn’t clear how this change occurs.

In the pastime “Water Cooler,” for example, two normal adults vent frustrations about their bosses. In the game version, they might start muttering insults in earshot of her, hoping to get a rise out of her. That would confirm their belief that she’s overbearing, though it might get them fired (remember that many games are self-destructive).

(Shortform note: It’s interesting to note that, as Berne describes it, previously unharmful small talk can become unhealthy games when people grow closer. Why is this? It may be that before we know someone well, we “put on a good face,” so as not to conceal our less wonderful qualities. However, once we start to trust someone, we open up more—which can lead to more authentic relating on the one hand, and exposure of our nastinesses as well. Berne might say that once you’ve engaged in small talk with someone long enough, you can tell what games they’ll play. So if you have games in common, you may only play them once you’re sure you won’t lose face by acting in a potentially unsavory way.)

**Couples Games** are the unhealthy habits that often develop between two people in a close, committed relationship. They can go on for years, and they may have a seriously negative effect on the players’ lives. Some are what today we’d call abuse.

Say for example a man holds the unconscious belief that “women deserve no respect.” He treats his partner poorly, gradually damaging her mental health. After a while depression sets in, and she starts gaining weight. Her partner then gets mad—“I can’t believe you’ve let yourself go like this.” His belief led him to create a situation that “proved” his belief, and he’s unconscious of it all along, Berne would say.

(Berne does say that “game” used as such isn’t meant to trivialize these situations. Instead, it refers to the _regulated_ nature of such an interaction—there’s a discernible pattern it follows.)

(Shortform note: Whether abusers are aware of their behavior or not is up for debate. Stephanie A. Sarkis Ph.D., the author of _Gaslighting: Recognize Manipulative and Emotionally Abusive People—and Break Free_ , suggests that some abusers are fully conscious of what they do and even study strategies to get better at it. On the other hand, plenty of emotional abuse seems to get meted out by people unconscious of what they’re doing. This can lead to difficult situations where, for example, an emotionally unavailable partner is hardly aware of what they’re doing. Automaticity, the phenomenon wherein habits become unconscious and second nature, may help to explain this. If Berne is right that our games develop in childhood, then they’d surely be automatic by adulthood.)

**Sex Games** flirt around sexual interaction, but instead offload the “satisfaction” of healthy sexuality to the game’s reward, according to Berne. In other words, people who play these derive pleasure from exchanges that stop short of actual sexual interaction.

Berne gives the example of “Kiss Off,” where Player A might believe, “Other people ought to want me, but can’t have me.” At a club or party, she teases and flirts mildly with other people. Someone pursues her, playing into her game, but she refuses advances beyond that initial flirtation.

(Shortform note: This is a fairly mild example of where Berne’s sexism seems to have influenced how he described some games. This category also demonstrates one of the weaknesses of Berne’s approach: Most of the games make reference to Freud’s psychosexual stages, which no longer enjoy much support. For example, it’s not much use to describe a woman’s flirtatious tendencies as deriving from unconscious “phallic” frustrations. Berne is inconsistent in his language choices—on the one hand, he argues that plain language, like in his game names, helps understanding. On the other hand, he still uses opaque Freudian jargon to diagnose many games. This may reflect Berne’s competing desires to make T.A. accessible through _Games People Play,_ while also fighting for credibility in the academic community.)

**Career Games** are long-term games, and may consume the player’s life. With serious career games, the player’s lifestyle, character, health, and financial situation can all fall apart around the game.

“Addict,” for example, can last for years, and it often derails the player’s life. Say Player A holds some belief like “I am worthless.” Various difficult circumstances (remember that each instance of a game has a unique history) lead Player A to substance abuse. This kicks off a destructive cycle that damages her health and position in society.

People may try to help her—likely playing ”Good Samaritan”—but according to Berne’s model, Player A will find some way to perpetuate her game. She may feel more worthless because people want to help. It confirms her belief, reinforcing her game.

This game-loop may take years off the player’s life, and it can remain unresolved without effective intervention.

(Shortform note: Though he doesn’t place it in this category, Berne characterizes homosexuality as a pathological lifestyle: He calls gay men “professional homosexuals,” as if to suggest that it’s a career game. And like career games, he argues that the game “Homosexuality” wastes time and handicaps the individual’s ability to live a good life. Psychiatry historically treated homosexuality as an illness to be cured. This is actually a step back from Freud, who wrote that same-sex desire is neither an illness nor something to be ashamed of. “Ego-syntonic Homosexuality” has since been removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, though Berne’s blatant homophobia lives on in _Games People Play._)

Career games exemplify another point Berne makes: that people play their games at various intensities. He compares these to the severity of a crime: first-, second-, and third-degree.

  * **First-degree** games are generally mild or benign. Many of us play “Morning Joe,” a very mild form of “Addict,” which at the most involves some grumpy mumbling. 
  * **Second-degree** games are preferably kept under wraps. “Day Drinker”, for example, may involve a flask, a concerned partner, and worsening health. 
  * **Third-degree** games lead to serious legal or fatal consequences. “Florida Man,”—a meme that mocks off-the-rails crimes perpetrated by men in Florida—can, for example, involve methamphetamine-fueled car chases that end in murder and the perpetrator’s arrest.



**Criminal Games** are illegal activities as viewed through Berne’s framework. These games occur in the criminal underground and in prisons.

Berne’s example is “Want Out,” played by inmates who appear to want reduced sentences. Say Player A is an inmate who believes, “The world is uncertain, and uncertainty is frightening.” He behaves as if he wants to get out early, but when the opportunity arises he falls apart. His underlying fear, Berne says, causes him to sabotage his own chances because prison is certain, thus safe.

(Shortform note: Mental health treatment wasn’t widely available to inmates until at least the mid 20th century, despite the fact that mental illness is far more prevalent in prisons. Berne’s T.A. was one of the first therapies used, part of the Asklepieion program in Marion, Illinois. In this controversial program, therapists and trained inmates aggressively used the “games” framing to force inmates to think and behave differently, demanding that they admit their games and let go of them. Asklepieion found limited success and spread to at least ten additional prisons before several violent incidents in therapy groups led to the program’s end.)

**Therapy Games** are played by mental health professionals and their patients. Berne says that these can prevent real therapy from taking place, because they give the illusion of progress.

For example, “Greenhouse” involves trained group therapy members who focus excessively on feelings. Player A may believe, “My feelings are precious, delicate things, not to be mishandled.” He presents each one like a rare blossom, and the group acts appropriately awed. Berne says they thus create a hothouse in which emotions are revered, but little real progress is made. The “Greenhouse” player, he states, simply builds a self-absorbed focus on their own emotions, reinforced by the group’s participation.

(Shortform note: Ineffective therapy is a real issue, and can even leave patients worse off than when they started. Part of the issue is similar to what Berne describes: Well-educated, trained clinicians overestimate their own effectiveness, and they tend to resist changes that could improve patient outcomes. This is a case of ego getting in the way of effective therapy, and highlights the fact that holding a therapy license doesn’t mean you’ve resolved your own psychological dissonance (one study, for example, found that around two-thirds of clinicians experienced mental health issues).)

**Positive Games** are generally productive, not destructive. Because games are deceptive by definition, Berne says that it’s difficult to identify wholly positive games. Instead, these games have a beneficial effect that offsets their negatives.

“Mission Trip,” for example, involves financially privileged, college-age Americans going to less developed countries. They build schools, take pictures with the locals, and feel that they’re doing some good in the world.

Using Berne’s model, folks who play “Mission Trip” (and related games like “Peace Corps” and “Teaching English Abroad”) unconsciously do so to confirm some belief like, “I am a good person.” In that way the trip is for their own benefit, but because these trips do have net positive outcomes, they’re “good” games.

We’ve based these tongue-in-cheek game names on Berne’s style. He states that colloquial names communicate the character of the game more effectively than technical names. For example, compare “I Can’t Believe Them” with something like “verbalizing projected oral sadism.”
