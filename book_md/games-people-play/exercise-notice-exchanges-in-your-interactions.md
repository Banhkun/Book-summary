## Exercise: Notice Exchanges in Your Interactions

Practice seeing social interaction through Berne’s model of _exchanges_.

* * *

Think back to a recent argument you’ve had with someone close to you. Using the idea of _exchanges_ , try to identify where the **disrupted exchange** happened, and how it derailed communication.

With that disrupted exchange in mind, recall Berne’s _ego states_. Reflect below on which you may have acted from, and which the other did.

Now consider how you may have been caught in an unbalanced exchange. If you’re part of a disrupted exchange in the future, how might you balance your ego state and resolve the conflict? (For example, maybe a friend angers your parent ego state, and you need to find a way to return to the rational adult.)
