## Exercise: Consider Your Level of Self-Sovereignty

Reflect on your progress toward game-free living.

* * *

Berne argues that fuller human experience depends on breaking out of our inherited conditioning and acting for ourselves. In what ways have you been conditioned by your parents and culture?

All of us lie somewhere along the complex spectrum of personal development. To what degree do you feel youâ€™ve learned the capacities Berne recommends? (Remember, he suggests we develop awareness, uninhibited self-expression, and sincere connection.)

How has developing these capacities improved your life, if they have at all? If you wanted to go further, what could you do to increase your self-sovereignty, based on Berne's recommendations?
