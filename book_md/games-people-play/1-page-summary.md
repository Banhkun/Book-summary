## 1-Page Summary

If you’ve ever felt the déjà vu of a repeating conflict in a close relationship, or known someone who seems to manufacture their own drama, you’ve probably experienced the “games” that people play.

In this 1964 psychology classic, Dr. Eric Berne sheds light on our unconscious social habits. Many such interactions are healthy and harmless, while others—our “games”—are often destructive to us and our relationships. Fortunately, we can grow beyond our games into a healthier, more fulfilling way of relating.

_Games People Play_ is Berne’s analysis of social interaction. Berne was an MD and psychiatrist who broke off from the Freudian psychoanalytic tradition after 15 years of training to pursue his own theory of social psychology.

He wrote _Games People Play_ for clinicians, so to make the ideas more accessible, we’ve minimized the technical jargon and focused on the essence. We'll move from an overview of Transactional Analysis (T.A.)—Berne’s system—through to games, and conclude with his suggestions for growing past your games.

### A Crash Course in Transactional Analysis

Berne studied social interaction, usually looking at close relationships. He felt that people's social habits hinted at their underlying psychological issues. These habits imply our _stances_ , deeply rooted beliefs that determine how we relate to others. Uncovering these unconscious stances, and the games they fuel, is how Berne (who died in 1970) helped his patients to grow.

(Shortform note: Despite gaining mainstream popularity, Berne struggled to gain acceptance from the psychoanalytic community. Some consider T.A. a pseudoscience, since his taxonomy of games references categories he theorized more than empirical evidence.)

Let’s look first at the key concepts Berne created to explain social interaction. We’ll discuss his account of its origins in infancy, his model of personality, and how to use T.A. to analyze interactions.

#### We All Need to Be Seen and Heard

Transactional Analysis begins with the idea that humans need consistent recognition from one another. Berne called this “stroking,” and it stems from the fact that infants will die without literal stroking. By adulthood, though, we’ve learned to make do with more symbolic contact, or _recognition_.

**Our need for recognition is analogous to hunger—if you don’t “feed” it, your physical, mental, and emotional health will decline**. Berne cites one study showing that prisoners in solitary confinement develop psychoses and a second that used sensory deprivation to induce temporary psychosis in a lab setting. In other words, lack of social contact leads to psychological starvation.

In order to stave off that starvation, Berne argues, we unconsciously build our days around social interaction. By doing this we help each other gain the recognition we need to stay healthy.

(Shortform note: While we need social recognition to remain healthy, Berne seems to say that _all_ social interaction happens because we need strokes. But this perspective reduces subjective experience to mere biological drives. Applying Berne’s logic to regular hunger, he might say that we eat because we’d die otherwise. But it’s unlikely this is the widespread rationale for eating _—_ and equally incomplete to suggest that we interact solely because we need to survive.)

#### Exchanges, Sequences, and Ego States

Berne then argues that we can break social interaction down into discrete chunks, like the bars of a piece of sheet music. One chunk is one _exchange_ , a back-and-forth between two individuals.

When you greet your friend—“Hey there! / G’morning!”—that’s one exchange. If you keep chatting, each back-and-forth is another exchange. This is our primary way of giving social recognition.

(Shortform note: Berne doesn’t provide any concrete evidence for the existence of exchanges (he terms them “transactions''). With this in mind, it’s more useful to think of T.A. as a set of mental models than verified truth. Concepts like “strokes'' and “transactions” help to make sense of social interaction, even if they aren’t “real” per se. They make up a mental framework, a set of tools, similar to the way concepts like perspective, line, and composition help you to interpret drawings and paintings.)

**You and your friend's exchanges change with your states of mind**. Berne proposed that three states of mind, or "ego states," compose the human personality: adult, child, and parent.

  * **The adult** is your rational self. It comes online to handle complex decision-making and other significant calculations and also handles mature adult behavior.
  * **The child** is the source of spontaneous emotions, developing out of early childhood experiences. It stores and plays back significant emotional associations: If you were bullied as a kid, your response to that intense emotional experience is deeply embedded in your personality.
  * **The parent** is all about value judgments and tradition. Everything you inherit from your family about the right and wrong ways to act, think, and feel becomes your parent state—and you’ll pass it on too.



(Shortform note: Berne’s “ego states'' have some parallels with Freud’s model of the psyche. Roughly, the child maps to the Id (impulses and unconscious energies), the adult maps to the Ego (rational calculation and decision-making), and the parent maps to the Superego (handling moral judgment and values). But they also differ—for example, Berne doesn’t attribute all motivation to the libido, Freud’s idea of a psycho-sexual energy that supposedly drives all behavior.)

You’ve probably made some silly mistake before and had a parent or partner reprimand you. According to T.A., they’re talking down to you from their parent state, scolding the child state in you. This would likely cause a child-state reaction from you: When we get treated like children, it “energizes” the corresponding patterns in the brain, according to Berne.

Exchanges follow one-to-the-next like links in a chain. So long as they remain _reciprocal_ , the participants’ mind states are in balance (adult to adult, child to child, and so on). However, Berne says, if one participant breaks that balance by, for example, behaving childishly when spoken to from the adult state, that’s a _disrupted****_ exchange.

(Shortform note: Berne’s notion of reciprocal versus disrupted exchanges is a useful way to explain the psychological level of abrupt communication breakdown. To build on this, also consider the perceptual level: Much miscommunication occurs because the receiver of a message interprets it differently from how the sender intended. Misinterpretation often accompanies emotional tension, like anger or defensiveness—states characteristic of a disrupted child or parent state. Berne doesn't provide a clear way to resolve a communication breakdown, but in The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz offers two principles that can help: _Be impeccable with your word_ , saying nothing malicious or untrue, and _make no assumptions_ , so that you voice your own confusions to maintain clear, reciprocal exchange.)

Finally, there are _deceptive_ exchanges, where you say one thing, but (unconsciously) mean another. These operate on two levels: on the surface level you might say, “I can’t believe you’d treat me like this!” and on the psychological level you mean, “I need to offload my stress onto you.” Berne contends that these exchanges form the basis for games, which are a fundamentally deceitful form of interaction.

> **Three Elements of a Speech Act**
> 
> Linguist Deborah Tannen offers a three-fold model of communication that’s somewhat similar to Berne’s. Say your partner just dropped a full dinner plate on the floor, and you say “Holy crap, why the heck did you do that?” This involves:
> 
>   * The explicit content: _What caused you to drop the plate?_
> 
>   * The emotional subtext: Anger and blame cast onto your partner
> 
>   * An implicit judgment: _You’re a dumb klutz and I, having not dropped anything, get to judge your competence_.
> 
> 

> 
> We’re very sensitive to the second and third elements, and they’re usually what we’ll respond to. This is similar to Berne’s model, where the players are really communicating through the game’s subtext.

In T.A., chains of exchanges make up the various forms of interaction. For example, you could break down a dinner date into each back-and-forth, and look at how the participants’ mind states interacted. Noting which states they exchange from helps you make sense of the interaction: whether they’re in balance, whether they’re playing games, or whether there are disruptive exchanges going on.

### Games Are Our Social Theatricals

**Berne defines a game as a stereotypical “act” that someone puts on, typically to gain a desired reward.** For example, some people turn every little chore into a full-blown melodrama, looking for any excuse not to do it. Each such game is a pattern of behavior that occurs throughout the population, Berne says.

Berne calls them “games” because they’re standardized: They have rules, and there’s a reward at the end**.** We’re unconsciously driven to get that reward, just like with any other habit. Games are also typically destructive, so understanding yours can help you to grow beyond any dysfunctional relational habits.

(Shortform note: Keep in mind that Berne’s games are _not_ intentional social games, like jockeying for power and status, making people laugh, or learned strategies for dating. They’re closer to social pathologies: dysfunctional ways of relating to others, à la “don’t play games with me,” said to (or by) the high school drama queen. Gossip, for example, provides pleasure and helps us to feel more powerful, but isn’t something we do all that intentionally. In fact, it may have had some evolutionary value, helping us to survive by fostering in-group cohesion—and this may mesh with Berne’s assertion that games help maintain our biological equilibrium: If games do so, then they’ve been doing so for many thousands of years.)

From another angle, your games are the ways you learned to deal with life’s challenges,**** typically as inherited from your family. When we’re children, significant life experiences shape how we relate to the world—a steadfast mother helps you learn trust; a best friendship gives you a sense of self-esteem; a school bully teaches you to stand up for yourself.

From these experiences, Berne says, we form deeply rooted beliefs about our place in the world. **These _stances_ concern things like right and wrong, should and shouldn’t, and what we deserve (or don’t)**: “People are basically good/bad,” “Life is great/a drag,” “Dreams are/aren’t real.” These beliefs then give rise to our games**.**

#### Our Games Come From Our Stances

Most of us don’t form particularly positive stances, and **games are usually unhealthy** (hence the need for therapists and personal growth techniques). Instead we learn things like, “People don’t like me, so I ought to scowl right back,” or “I am unlovable; no one has ever loved me.” Here’s how it works:

  * Player A believes “Life is a constant struggle,” and so she interprets all her experiences through that filter. Inevitably she’ll see the worst in her partner, too, and that’s where the game comes in. 
  * Player A acts according to her belief, so she’s constantly finding things to be stressed out about. Eventually this causes her partner to get fed up with her, and they call her out—“God, why are you always so _negative_?”
  * People don’t like to be criticized, so they fight. Eventually it breaks off, and A retreats to sulk. Here’s the reward: The fight confirmed her belief that “life is a constant struggle,” and that validation provides pleasure despite being embedded in an otherwise self-destructive pattern.



The key is that **the game is mostly unconscious**. Player A doesn’t realize she’s just defending a belief, and she didn’t intentionally provoke her partner. But it happened nonetheless and, according to Berne, she unconsciously desires the fight because of the reward: It reinforces her belief and allows her to feel “right” about her world.

(Shortform note: Berne describes here a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy: Insofar as you believe X to be true, you’ll create situations that prove it true. The placebo effect is the classic example: Believing that inactive, fake medications will work can actually cause them to have some effect. When it comes to mental health, this can cause downward spirals: Negative self-talk compounds on itself and makes things even worse.)

#### The Basic Pattern of a Game

Though Berne doesn’t explicitly lay it out, we can infer that the basic pattern of a game goes as follows:

  * Player A holds some unconscious belief, and it gives them a hidden motive. Neither they nor the other players are aware of this motive, which is generally to create a situation that reinforces their belief.
  * Working from that belief, **Player A indirectly causes Player B to behave as they want them to**. 
  * Player B typically plays into the game, and there’s some back-and-forth until B ends up proving A’s belief to them.
  * Player A now feels validated: They got the outcome they wanted and reinforced their belief.



On the other side, Player B plays their own game—people play games that complement one another. A’s game works to prove B’s, too, so both players enable each other to keep playing.

  * Say Player A is complaining about an annoying coworker, and Player B flares up—“God, can’t you stop being so negative?” Here, Player A’s game of “I Can’t Believe That…” complements Player B’s game of “Toxic Positivity,” allowing them both to keep playing.



##### Gather Details to Understand a Game

To truly understand a game, Berne states, you need to know the individual’s specific life history. The general pattern alone is not enough. Let’s go through a detailed example to illustrate a potential case. This game is called “Mr. Vesuvius,” and it goes like this:

  * Mr. Vesuvius is a regular working man in regular suburban America. He provides for his family, but struggles with emotionality. He believes that “Anger is a justified way to punish rule-breakers.”
  * Mr. Vesuvius never learned to manage his stress and is prone to anger; his father was the same way. When his kid or wife steps awry, Mr. Vesuvius often erupts. A door accidentally slammed too hard becomes his excuse to berate the offending family member.
  * Eventually his anger wanes, and he walks off. Soon he returns with a back-handed apology, saying “sorry, but” and defending his outburst.
  * With the offender cowed, Mr. Vesuvius has won his game: He got the reward of dumping all his frustration on an easy victim, and he reinforced his belief in justified anger.



Knowing more about a specific Mr. Vesuvius, in particular, enables you to better understand that instance of the game. Plenty of others play it, but background differences mean that each player has slightly different underlying motivations.

#### A Catalog of Games by Life Areas

Berne gives multiple ways to classify games; the clearest delineates them by areas of life:

**Couples Games** are the unhealthy habits that often develop between two people in a close, committed relationship. They can go on for years, and they may have a seriously negative effect on the players’ lives. (Shortform note: Some are what today we’d call abuse, like “love bombing.”)

**Sex Games** approach sexual interaction, but then instead derive satisfaction from the game’s reward, according to Berne. People who play these receive gratification from noncommittal flirting, making people fight over them, and so on.

(Shortform note: Here Berne’s sexism has influenced his interpretations. “Frigid Woman,” features a sex-refusing wife who “provokes” her husband into repeated advances, just so she can say, “Aha! All men _are_ pigs!” There’s no real reason to go with Berne’s interpretation of her motives here: Any psychologist’s interpretations are subjective. They’re working to understand the subjective experience of another individual, and are thus subject to biases: We all tend to interpret things through our favored beliefs and mental frameworks.)

**Career Games** are long-term games that can consume the player’s life. Their lifestyle, health, and financial situation can all fall apart around the game. “Addict,” for example, can last for years, and often derails the player’s life.

(Shortform note: Extending Berne's notion of lifelong games, we might say that some have generation-spanning careers. Alcoholism, for example, can pass from parents to children. There's a physiological aspect—which Berne doesn't mention—to such inheritance, too: Traumatic childhood experiences can lead to chronic health problems. In this view, you don't control what games you inherit—but we each have the opportunity to combat any "generational curses" we receive, and thereby prevent our descendants from inheriting the destructive patterns.)

**Criminal Games** are illegal activities, occurring in the criminal underground and in prisons. For example, inmates who appear to want reduced sentences play “Want Out.” But really, they believe, “The world is uncertain, and uncertainty is frightening,” and so they’ll ultimately sabotage their own chances because prison is certain, thus safe.

(Shortform note: Transactional Analysis was one of the earlier treatments attempted in prisons: The psychiatrist Martin Groder drew on Berne’s game analysis, blending it with shock-and-awe style group therapy. This was Asklepieion, a rehabilitation program that ran at a federal maximum security prison for a full decade. Trained group members would shout, shame, and antagonize the “patients,” trying to force them to change their views and behaviors. The program succeeded in some ways, including by readjusting political dissidents to accept mainstream society. It was duplicated in 10 other prisons before being shut down due to multiple violent incidents within the therapy groups.)

**Therapy Games** are played by mental health professionals and their patients. Berne says that these can prevent real therapy from taking place, because they give the illusion of progress. “Psychiatry,” for example, features patients and therapists who get wrapped up in the experience of therapy. They believe that they’re making progress, but they really just enjoy being wrapped up in the _illusion_ of progress.

(Shortform note: Ineffective therapy is a real issue, and can even leave patients worse off than when they started. Part of the issue is similar to what Berne describes: Well-educated, trained clinicians overestimate their own effectiveness, and they tend to resist changes that could improve patient outcomes. This is a case of ego getting in the way of effective therapy, and highlights the fact that holding a therapy license doesn’t mean you’ve resolved your own psychological dissonance—one study, for example, found that around two-thirds of clinicians experienced mental health issues.)

**Positive Games** have a net positive that offsets their deceptive qualities. For example, many privileged Westerners enjoy “Mission Trip” or “Peace Corps,” where they build schools, take pictures with the locals, and get to feel like good people.

We’ve based these tongue-in-cheek game names on Berne’s style. Colloquial names, he says, capture the feel of a game more effectively than psychoanalytic jargon like “verbalizing projected oral sadism.”

(Shortform note: Berne is right, insofar as jargon can often obscure the real message, make things sound more important than they actually are, and cause people to disconnect from what’s being said. Plain language has many advantages over jargon-heavy writing. However, Berne doesn’t consistently apply his own advice, often using Freudian psychoanalytic jargon like “oral frustration” and “transference reaction” that obscures his meaning.)

#### Identify and Overcome Your Games

Berne saw mostly destructive games because, he says, people with constructive games don’t go to therapy. Below, we’ve condensed and clarified his steps to identify games:

**Step #1** : Identify whether some social habit of yours seems to fit the pattern of a game. Is there a concealed motive in play? Are the exchanges deceptive? Is there some dramatic ending, or a self-validating outcome?

**Step #2** : When you think you’ve found a game, test it by trying to break it. According to Berne, attempting to break a game pattern results in significant resistance from the player. So if you notice substantial emotional resistance in you or the other person, you’ve likely found a game.

**Step #3** : If you want to better establish the pattern, look for more instances of it in the world. The more examples you find, the more you confirm that the game really exists. Then, describe the game’s characteristics, and learn to recognize it anywhere.

**Once you’ve identified a game, there’s one key to overcoming it: You need an effective pattern-breaking solution**. Berne explains that a good solution has a few characteristics:

  * **It’s tailored to the specific situation**. Games are general patterns, but every specific situation is distinct. You need to create a disruption that fits the game and the person playing it. A direct call-out might work for someone less invested in their game, while Mr. Vesuvius might need a calm, patient pointing-out of his pattern.
  * **You use your adult state to intentionally disrupt the game.** You refuse to communicate from the ego state the player talks to, and players are often taken off-guard by this rational treatment—at best, you snap them back into their adult state, too.
  * **It’s precise and considerate.** Bluntly confronting people’s games is often less effective than threading the needle. Emotions can be volatile in game playing, so you need to be precise and mindful of triggers—your own and others’.



(Shortform note: Tony Robbins discusses his “pattern interrupt” technique in Awaken the Giant Within _,_ arguing that you need to cut through the old habit with an unexpected interruption. His technique _is_ somewhat blunt, though—like screaming and plunging your head into ice water to snap out of negative self-talk. It’s possible that sometimes you need a hammer (Robbins), and sometimes you need a needle (Berne). Alternatively, you can employ mindfulness to dampen your reactivity, making it easier to make new choices and form new habits.)

For example, you might disrupt someone’s game of “No _I’m_ Less Wrong” by cheerfully acknowledging their superior reasoning abilities. No longer able to feed off a feeling of intellectual superiority, their game may just deflate.

### After Games Comes Self-Sovereignty

**Ultimately, games are a shallow, often unhealthy form of interaction**. We default to them, Berne says, because the more fulfilling social form—intimacy—is either unavailable or too terrifying for most people.

But it’s possible to grow past your games, into a fuller life that involves intimacy. Berne calls this advanced stage of personal development “autonomy,” and we’ll refer to it as self-sovereignty. To transcend games and reach self-sovereignty, we need to develop three capacities:

**#1: Present Awareness:** This is the capacity to live in the here and now, to engage with raw reality. Presence affords you a deeper relationship with direct experience and enables you to show up more fully in life.

**#2: Freedom of Choice:** This means expressing your genuine emotions, uninhibited by parental and cultural conditioning. When you make choices that are true to you, unafraid of others’ expectations, you more fully become yourself.

**#3: Sincere Connection:** Present awareness and uninhibited choice enable you to show up, sincerely and vulnerably, in your relationships. From here intimacy can arise, which Berne believes is the most rewarding form of social living.

> **Berne's "Autonomy" and Maslow's "Self-Actualization"**
> 
> When _Games People Play_ was released in 1964, the humanistic psychology movement was just picking up steam. Humanistic psychology shifted away from the traditional focus on psychological problems and asked instead, “What about the human potential for living full, meaningful lives?” Berne’s work exemplifies this transition—he was concerned with pathologies, and he also focused on the potential to grow beyond them.
> 
> Another more widely known psychologist was directly involved—Abraham Maslow, famous for his hierarchy of needs, is considered a founder of the humanistic movement. At the top of his pyramid sits _self-actualization_ , the need to grow into the best version of yourself. And there’s some interesting overlap between his ideas and Berne’s. For example, they both hold that _spontaneity_ or uninhibited self-expression is crucial to peak development.
> 
> Elsewhere, they differ: Berne describes a type of automobile driver who is “at one” with the car, skillfully and fluidly navigating, and with great enjoyment. This sounds much like Maslow’s conception of peak experiences, a core indicator of self-actualization that involves feeling deeply immersed in the immediate experience. Yet for Berne, this is one step beneath true _presence_ , which is closer to deep appreciation of the immediate experience à la mindfulness.
> 
> He also holds that “the most perfect form of living” is _intimacy_ , which is fundamentally relational—not something you can achieve by yourself, like some peak experiences (being “in the zone” as an athlete, reaching big personal goals, and so on). In this way, Berne’s conception of fulfillment pivots away from our culture’s usual emphasis on the individual. We often frame a fulfilling relationship as subordinate to a satisfying individual life, but what if it were the other way around?

#### Achieving Personal Sovereignty

Despite our parental and cultural conditioning, we can recover the capacities of self-sovereignty. Berne argues that we had them as children, then lost them as we were molded by societal pressures. But we chose how to adapt—which of our parent’s traits to toss out, for example—and therefore we can reverse those decisions.

For example, maybe a parent insisted you follow a strict path through school to become a doctor. That pressure inhibited your ability to choose for yourself, but you can return and undo the negative effects it had.

Berne doesn’t say specifically how to do this, but he does sketch out the broad steps. Below, we’ve distilled his recommendations into four steps.

  * **First, overcome the influence of inherited conditioning.** The expectations of parents and society often inhibit us from expressing who we really are. So to truly reach self-sovereignty or autonomy (which literally means “self-governing”), you have to throw off the influence of culture and tradition. 
  * **Second, shake off the expectations of others.** After addressing your cultural conditioning, shed the expectations of your immediate friends and acquaintances. Often, friends who don’t grow with you start to hinder your development.
  * **Third, stop indulging in your games.** Games provide us easy, but ultimately unfulfilling, rewards. They’re more analogous to a chocolate bar than a soul-warming bowl of soup; you won’t grow healthy on games alone. Once you notice that you’re indulging in some self-validating behavior, it’s time to let go of that shallow gratification.
  * **Fourth, take the helm of your life’s ship.** Focus on developing habits that reflect who you really are, and practice making only the choices that align with that. When you think, feel, and act as you genuinely want to, Berne argues, you can develop authentic relationships that transcend the influence of games and yield a fuller experience of life.



(Shortform note: Here, it’s clear why _Games People Play_ has been labeled as an early self-help book. Despite the clinical content, Berne’s prescription for personal growth is familiar. His first two suggestions map well to _individuation_ , which has been an important topic in psychology since Carl Jung first discussed the human need to realize your unique selfhood. And he wasn’t the first to suggest we should overcome unhealthy habits: Dale Carnegie, who died before Berne wrote _Games People Play_ , encouraged people to be present and break bad habits. And his fourth suggestion, while a good reminder, is also nothing new—thinkers as far back as Aristotle have emphasized the importance of self-actualization in achieving a fulfilling life.)
