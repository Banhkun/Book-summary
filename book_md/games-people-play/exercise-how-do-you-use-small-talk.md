## Exercise: How Do You Use Small Talk?

Get to know the social patterns you inhabit, according to Transactional Analysis.

* * *

Think back to a recent social event you attended, and consider the small talk you may have engaged in. Since Berne's examples are a bit dated, try to think of the modern versions and name them below.

Now consider how you showed _up_ to those chats—what _character_ or “role” did you enact in each? What _stances_ or beliefs of yours might underlie the act you put on? (For example, you might act like a clown to make your friends laugh, believing that “I need to be funny for people to like me.”)

With a stance identified, can you notice how you unconsciously look for reinforcement of that belief? How do you feel when people validate your act, or when they rebuff you?
