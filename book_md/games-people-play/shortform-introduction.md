## Shortform Introduction

If you’ve ever felt caught in a frustratingly habitual argument with your significant other, or known someone who seems to always attract drama, you’ve probably experienced one of the “games” that people play.

In this classic of popular psychology, Dr. Eric Berne sheds light on our unconscious social habits. Many of these interactions are healthy and harmless, while others—our “games”—are often unhealthy, even destructive, to us and our relationships. In _Games People Play,_ Berne __ offers a lens through which to understand these patterns, and he lays out the steps toward a healthier way of living.

### About the Author

Eric Berne was a Canadian-born psychiatrist and author, prominent in the late 1950s and 1960s for creating Transactional Analysis, a new branch of psychiatry. **Berne broke from the established approach of the time by focusing on social behavior, a pivot away from individually focused psychoanalysis**.

Berne wrote _Games People Play_ in 1964 __ to bring his approach to the public. It was a surprise hit, and it spent over two years on _The New York Times_ bestseller list.

Soon after its release, Berne and his colleagues founded the International Transactional Analysis Association. Today the ITAA has members in 50 countries, who employ Transactional Analysis in counseling, therapy, education, and business development.

Berne was known for his wry humor, which is evident throughout the book, especially in the names he gives to the many games described.

### The Book’s Publication

_Games People Play_ was first published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, now an imprint of Penguin Random House. Berne followed it with _What Do You Say After You Say Hello?_ and _Sex in Human Loving_ before his death in 1970. _Games People Play_ has been republished multiple times, with the 2011 reprint featuring a new foreword from the then-president of the ITAA. We’ve based our guide on this edition, which makes no changes to the original text.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

Psychology in Berne’s time was a field very much in development. Behaviorism—which takes observable behavior as the object of study—dominated in America, and Freudian psychoanalysis still held sway as well. It was the latter branch that Berne sought to join, training for more than 15 years and obtaining his MD from McGill University.

When he was rejected for membership as a psychoanalyst in the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute, Berne went his own way. He developed Transactional Analysis—his theory of how people relate—through the 1950s. Two books present his ideas: _Games People Play_ , a slightly less technical overview; and _Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy_ , a fully technical articulation of his theory. T.A. was part of the humanistic psychology movement of the 1950s and 60s, a “third wave” to the first (Freudian psychoanalysis) and second (behaviorism à la B.F. Skinner).

Berne’s theory of how games work is still relevant, but many of his specific descriptions are somewhat outdated. What was in vogue in the 1960s was very different from today’s cultural mainstream—our slang, our mannerisms, the way we dress, the ways we relate to one other have all changed. Far more of us “hang out” or “chill” than have cocktail parties, for example.

Many of Berne’s games make sense; others are recognizable yet have a 60s’ feel to them. “Alcoholic” is clear, but “Schlemiel'' is opaque, unless you’re familiar with old Yiddish stereotypes. “Frigid Wife” and “Perversion” similarly demonstrate the author’s outdated attitudes toward women and sexual nonconformity. We no longer pathologize unhappy wives or LGBT people, but such attitudes were the norm in Berne’s time.

#### Intellectual Context

Berne’s approach is influenced by Freud, yet leans substantially into humanistic psychology. Characterized by the Human Potential Movement, humanistic psychology focuses on self-awareness and our ability to develop in positive directions. This attitude is evident in Berne’s notion of autonomy, which is how he conceives of fulfilling your potential.

Berne borrows Freud’s way of diagnosing mental illnesses, though, and so inherits a pathology-focused attitude toward people and our minds. But he doesn’t completely follow Freud’s footsteps. **Where Freud focused on dreams and interpretation of the unconscious, Berne studied people’s behaviors in social settings**. Where Freud did one-on-one therapy, Berne engaged in group therapy as early as World War II, when he was an Army psychiatrist.

Despite gaining mainstream popularity, Berne struggled to gain acceptance from the psychoanalytic community. Some consider T.A. a pseudoscience, since his taxonomy of games references the categories he theorized more than empirical evidence.

Modern T.A allows practitioners to integrate tools from their favored methods. A transactional analyst might use techniques from relational therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy, in addition to Berne’s ideas. This happens within the basic context of T.A.’s “contract”: The therapist and patient enter into agreement as rational adults, and they take responsibility for what may happen.

Over the years, T.A. adherents have developed script analysis, which focuses on changing unhelpful beliefs, out of Berne’s work on the “life script.” Trained practitioners use script analysis in couples therapy, family counseling, and some educational and business settings. Research also shows that script analysis is effective at reducing conflict and increasing satisfaction in intimate relationships, and can help people cope with chronic illnesses. Another study has shown that transactional analysis is a more effective long-term approach than psychoanalysis.

#### The Book’s Impact

A major bestseller at the time of release, _Games People Play_ has been called one of the “first self-help books.” It’s sold over five million copies since its first publication and continues to sell in countries around the world. T.A. enjoyed this cultural buzz for a number of years but struggled to gain acceptance from the academic community.

T.A. has since split off into numerous subschools that emphasize different techniques and aspects of Berne’s original theory. Some of these, like the reparenting school, have undermined T.A.'s credibility, while others show promise (redecision therapy, integrative T.A.)

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

At release, _Games People Play_ was hugely successful. In 1965, it drew a favorable review from the author Kurt Vonnegut, who called it “a brilliant, amusing, and clear catalog of the psychological theatricals that human beings play over and over again.” Today the book remains well-received, though not without its fair share of criticism.

Many agree that the book delivers what it advertises—an insightful way to look at human relationships. It’s praised for delivering “aha” moments and for helping people to see their own games. Some credit Berne for translating opaque psychological terms into plainer language, and so opening the door for regular people to better understand their minds.

**A main criticism is that Berne was prejudiced, particularly in his attitudes toward women and LGBT people.** Sexism in psychiatry has been around for a long time, and many believe Berne’s work reflects that. Readers should keep in mind that Berne’s biases may color his interpretations of the behavior of women and the LGBT community. A number of his game descriptions use overtly biased language like “frigid woman” and “perversion” (in reference to homosexuality), and outdated gender roles feature prominently.

Despite these weaknesses, **many of his intuitions about social behavior cast a revealing light on how we relate, and the notion of “games” is now common speech.** A core part of T.A.—the idea that beliefs influence our behaviors—is a core feature of modern self-help. So it’s valuable to visit this early instance of popular self-help, both to get a sense of where the ideas came from and how they’ve since changed.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_Games People Play_ is dense, yet the flow of ideas is broadly coherent. In places, the author makes logical leaps that are difficult to follow—he goes from A to C and skims over B—but the connections are there to be found. Berne also indulges in tangents that tend to interrupt the logic or replace clear explanations outright.

Berne’s writing meanders between a dense, academic tone and casual, direct prose. _Games People Play_ was written for clinicians, so technical language features throughout. Some terms are clearly defined. Others, you never get a clear look at.

However, Berne offers a detailed, original theory and some practical methods in a compact package. Research supports a number of his main points, while other points lean on his interpretations and intuitions. Berne mentions some experiments that were in progress, and this makes the arguments feel more credible—as does his acknowledgment that Transactional Analysis was far from finalized at the time of writing.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

The book lays out Berne’s theory, shows how it applies to simple social interactions, describes and catalogs games, and concludes with a section on growing beyond games. The introduction is somewhat dense, introducing many key ideas that the book returns to later.

Each of these parts is less internally coherent, though. It often isn’t clear why the author sequenced the chunks of theory as he did—ideas jump around within chapters, which can be difficult to follow. He also describes the games with varied levels of detail, so some feel far clearer than others.

### Our Approach in This Guide

The author wrote _Games People Play_ for clinicians, but modern readers will still gain a useful framework through which to view social interaction, as well as some solid practical advice.

Note that this book is less a work of pop psychology and more a theoretical exposition that builds up to a clinical handbook. For this reason, we’ve taken the essence of the ideas and reframed them from a clinical presentation to one applicable for personal development. Our omissions include chapter 15, where Berne illustrates the principles of chapters 16 and 17 (covered); and chapter 18, which diverges from the book’s main argument with a tangent on the fate of humanity.

We’ve connected the logical gaps Berne left and reordered the ideas to develop more clearly from A to B to C. We also update the author’s outdated examples. Psychiatric theory and practice have changed plenty since Berne’s time, so our commentary explores how his work relates to what came earlier and what’s developed since 1964. We also focus on the strengths and weaknesses of his ideas—in places the author shows prescience, and elsewhere he seems a product of his time.
