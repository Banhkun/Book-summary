## Part Two: Life in Hampton Roads

Virginia’s Hampton Roads region, where the Langley lab was located, was a wartime boomtown, bustling with economic activity and new migrants from all over the world participating in the American war effort. There were new black regiments, legions of female and African-American civilian workers, as well as German, Japanese, and Italian POWs. Between 1940 and 1942, the region’s civilian population grew from 393,000 to 575,000. On top of that, the number of military personnel stationed in the area’s bases grew tenfold, from 15,000 to 150,000. By 1945, half the adults in Southern Virginia would be working for the federal government. This influx of new people from all over the country and the world radically reshaped the small southern town’s cultural and economic life.

### A Segregated City

As progressive and forward-looking as Hampton Roads may have seemed at first glance to someone like Dorothy Vaughan,**it was still a segregated city of the American South at the height of the Jim Crow era**. Black people and white people had separate entrances to get on buses, and blacks were expected to give up their seats to whites if the white section was filled. African-Americans who were caught sitting in white sections could be fined, arrested, or even dragged off the bus and beaten by police. These practices even extended to black soldiers in uniform. Indeed, segregation was powerfully entrenched in the nation’s historical experience and was an unmistakable feature of life wherever one travelled, especially in the South.

The injustice seemed all the more perverse during World War Two. **Black Americans were being asked to fight and die to defeat genocidal Nazis in Europe, yet were simultaneously being told to accept a brutal and violent system of repression at home**. The irony wasn’t lost on many. Black scholars like Altona Trent Johns noted the distressing similarities between the German treatment of Jews and southern whites’ treatment of their black fellow citizens, a theme that was echoed all throughout black civil society—in churches, the press, sororities and fraternities, and civic organizations. The question was clear: _What are we fighting for?**Victory in the war overseas had to be matched by victory over white supremacy at home.**_

#### Newsome Park

The new black economic migrants to the region, like Dorothy, settled in a neighborhood called Newsome Park. The community was built during the Depression, a subdivision designed and built “for blacks, by blacks.” It became a focal point of the black community in Hampton Roads, attracting residents from all different occupations and income levels.

Because legal segregation prohibited so many of Newsome Park’s residents from full participation in Virginia’s economy and society, the community (like many other black communities throughout the South) became economically and culturally self-sufficient. Newsome Park featured its own community center with a full kitchen and banquet space, basketball and tennis courts, and a baseball diamond. The shopping center was home to a bustling grocery store, drugstore, barbershop, and even a TV repair shop.

In short, **Newsome Park featured all the amenities that the upwardly mobile young black families who’d moved to Virginia needed to keep their morale high and find new sources of community in a new town.** As the new black migrants came and settled, they saw that their children became fast friends with the children of the other families who’d recently made their way to Virginia.

#### Colored Computing

When Dorothy Vaughan arrived at Langley, the bus dropped her off at the West Area of the campus, the space that had been reserved for the new black, female computers (the East Area was set aside for their white counterparts). She found that her new colleagues shared her background in the world of black colleges, alumni associations, and churches. Despite the prejudices and limited opportunities that existed at the time even for _white_ women, these black women had all landed jobs at the world’s premier aeronautical research institution.

White women (former East Area Computers) oversaw the West Computers, parceling out tasks to the various section heads, who in turn subdivided the work among the women in their section of the computing pool. What the women of West Computing were usually working on was a portion of a larger task, some quick piece of calculation that an engineer required for a bigger project.

Langley was a place where colleagues worked closely with one another (often _literally_ close, thanks to the wartime hiring spree) and clerks and computers might rub shoulders with top aeronautics researchers. Yet, **because of the color of their skin, the West Area Computers were largely excluded from this collegial atmosphere**. Although Executive Order 8802 had mandated fair employment in the defense industry, Langley’s location in the Commonwealth of Virginia forced it to comply with that state’s segregation statutes.

This was symbolized most hurtfully by the **sign on the table where they sat at the back of the cafeteria that read, “COLORED COMPUTERS.”** Although they were ostensibly professionals on par with their colleagues at Langley, they were still treated as something less than equal.

#### The Sign Comes Down

Seeing this sign every day was deeply insulting and offensive for the West Computers. One day, a West Computer named Miriam Mann could take it no more. She walked over to the sign, removed it, and stuffed it into her purse.

This prompted a mini struggle for equal treatment within Langley. The sign was back up a few days later, prompting Miriam to take it down once again. This back-and-forth played out over the course of weeks, but Miriam and her fellow computers were determined to take a stand against this small, but potent symbol of oppression. Her husband warned her that she might lose her job over this act of defiance, but Miriam knew that this was a battle that _needed_ to be fought.

Eventually, she won. One day, the sign went into Miriam’s purse and no one ever bothered to replace it. **This was a powerful victory, one that helped to convince her fellow women of West Computing that the laboratory was _theirs_ as well**. Dorothy, Miriam, and the other black computers had become more than colleagues—they had become a tight-knit band, an army in its own right that was prepared to fight and win the war for equality at home.

### “NACA Nuts”

**Miriam’s rebellion was taking place in a much wider context. For the first time, cracks were beginning to show in Jim Crow’s armor**. Although the process was slow, the new migrants to Hampton Roads were helping to transform the racial politics of the region. Many of the incoming white NACA engineers were from New England and other, more liberal parts of the country. To them, the southern system of apartheid seemed strange at best, immoral and unjust at worst.

The local southern whites were often highly suspicious of the new government employees that had come into their communities during the war years. **They castigated the newcomers as Californians, Yankees, and New York Jews** , or “NACA nuts,” oddballs who were well-read, spoke with strange accents, and had condescending attitudes.

Some white Langley employees began openly defying southern segregationist practices and even local laws. Margery Hannah, who oversaw West Computing, made a point of inviting some of her black employees to social gatherings at her home. Robert Jones, a brilliant aeronautics engineer, went even further. One day, he saw white police officers harassing a black man and getting ready to beat him up. Jones shouted at them to leave the man alone, which landed _Jones_ in jail for a night.

**These were not minor acts of disobedience. In the context of the Jim Crow South, these were extraordinary displays of rebellion**. Fundamentally, the new white Langley employees were pragmatists. While it would be overly simplistic to say that they were all uniformly egalitarian on the racial issue, they fundamentally cared more about their colleagues’ competence and professionalism than they did about their skin color. In their passionate and mission-focused work, they developed a rapport with their black colleagues. This would prove crucial to breaking down the barriers at the laboratory.

### A New Opportunity for Education

**Despite the oppression of legal segregation, Dorothy Vaughan and her colleagues knew that working at Langley was an extraordinary opportunity.** Even an entry-level job there was better than the best engineering graduate program in the world. Langley had an interest in turning even its female computers into junior engineers who could contribute more to the war effort. The laboratory organized crash courses in engineering physics and aerodynamics, as well as laboratory sessions run by brilliant instructors. Dorothy leapt at the opportunity to pursue her passion for mathematics and enrich her mind.

Through these courses, Dorothy learned how planes actually managed to fly through the air and discovered the process by which engineers tested new models of aircraft. The planes were tested in a wind tunnel, in which powerful wooden turbines blasted air over the prototype in an effort to mimic the conditions of flight. In her courses, Dorothy had to master the concept of the Reynolds number, a quantity that enabled engineers to gauge how close the wind tunnel experiments came to replicating actual flight.

She saw that the physics which underpinned each model’s design could be tweaked and refined to suit different purposes for the war effort. Fighter planes, cargo planes, reconnaissance planes, and bombers all required different designs. During the peak years of the war, every American military plane in production was based on the research and recommendations coming out of NACA—and Dorothy had a front-row seat to it all.
