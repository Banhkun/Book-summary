## Part Four: The Space Age Dawns

**Dorothy Vaughan was a tireless advocate for the computers who worked under her**. After hearing how well Katherine was performing in the Flight Research Division, she presented the head of the division with an ultimatum: either give Katherine the raise and permanent position in the division she deserved, or return her to West Computing. The division chief, the formidable and intimidating Henry Pearson, acceded to Dorothy’s pressure: **Katherine was given a salary increase and a permanent job in his Maneuver Loads Branch in 1953.**

This group was working on the aerodynamics of airplanes as they moved in and out of steady, stable flight—a key subject area of research in the Cold War 1950s. It was a very masculine, testosterone-fueled workplace, one which didn’t seem outwardly hospitable to a female computer. But Katherine held her own and impressed the engineers with her insatiable intellectual curiosity and her obvious passion for the work. What she relished most of all was the intelligence of her colleagues—she respected their intellectual capacity, and they respected hers right back. **They stopped seeing her as the “black computer” and saw her simply as “Katherine.”**

On one of her first assignments, Katherine had to conduct research into why a propeller plane had fallen out of the sky for seemingly no reason. She pored over the numbers, calculating the airspeed, acceleration, altitude, and other data points from the flight in an attempt to unlock the mystery of this crash. Through her data analysis, the engineers determined that the propeller plane had crossed the flight path of a jet and had gotten caught in its wake vortex (similar to how, on water, the wake created by a large ship can overwhelm and capsize a small boat). This discovery led to changes in air traffic regulations, mandating minimum times and distances between flight paths. Katherine’s work had made a powerful and direct impact on the real world.

### Tragedy Strikes

Katherine was enjoying professional success and career fulfillment on a level which she’d never dreamed of before she came to Langley. The Gobles were upwardly mobile and solidly middle class. They decided to take that next step toward the achievement of the American Dream—homeownership.

But tragedy struck for Katherine and her daughters. In 1956, Jimmy Goble died, after having fallen sick the year before. It was an incalculable loss to the family. But Katherine knew that she could not let her daughters sink into despair over the death of their father. She had promised Jimmy that she would always do everything she could to keep the girls on the path to achievement, and she refused to let them deviate from it.

After setting aside a period of mourning, Katherine sent her daughters back to school and instructed the principal not to show them any special treatment. She was determined that they go to college and she needed them to be prepared, seeing their success as the fulfillment of the legacy of her and Jimmy’s ancestors, who had all pushed their children toward greater and greater heights. There could be no going backwards.

### Mastering the Machine

**By the mid-1950s, NACA was beginning to introduce mechanical computers into its laboratory spaces**. Companies like Bell Telephone Laboratories and IBM were supplying the government with the first generation of mechanical data-processing machines (though they weren’t yet digital, but analogue; their output came in the form of paper punch cards). They weren’t totally reliable and still produced lots of errors that needed to be corrected by the female mathematicians, but they could process data at a speed that was impossible for humans to match—and, critically, they could be left to run overnight after the staff had gone home.

The female mathematicians’ jobs weren’t immediately placed in jeopardy, but the most astute among them, like Katherine, could certainly see the writing on the wall—that mastering these powerful machines would be essential to future success at Langley.

In addition to mastering the machines in the laboratory, Katherine and her peers would need to master another machine, one that dominated the social, economic, and political order of the South—the machine of Jim Crow. It would need to be smashed, defeated, and consigned to the ash heap of history if African-Americans were ever to advance and be seen as equals. This was all happening at a critical time for race relations in America.

**The year 1954 saw the Supreme Court hand down the landmark _Brown v. Board of Education_ decision**, which declared segregated public schools unconstitutional. In the years that followed, there would be violence, as white mobs all across the South attempted to forcibly prevent black students from attending formerly all-white schools—most famously in Little Rock, Arkansas, where President Eisenhower had to send in federal troops to protect the black students who had enrolled in the local high school.

In Virginia, the powerful Senator Harry Byrd used all the influence of his political machine to stop integration, including by establishing whites-only “segregation academies,” schools that, because of their nominally private status, were able to circumvent _Brown v. Board of Education_(though Byrd and his Dixiecrat allies still managed to divert taxpayer dollars to such schools). In the fall of 1958, the governor of Virginia took the extraordinary step of shutting down the schools altogether in the few districts that had attempted to comply with the _Brown_ decision. The state apparently preferred to deprive _all_ children of public education rather than have black and white children attend school together.

**The injustice of segregation was obvious to all of the West Computers, but so was its absurdity and inefficiency**. When Mary Jackson attended Hampton High School for engineering classes at Kazimierz Czarnecki’s urging (for which she had to get a special dispensation from the City of Hampton to attend the all-white program), she saw that the school from which she had been barred was run-down and dilapidated, little better than the black schools. In fact, all throughout the South, districts maintained parallel failing schools that needlessly duplicated resources and disadvantaged both black _and_ white children. Why, thought Mary, wouldn’t they just combine resources to deliver a better education for _all_ students?

### Sputnik

**On October 5, 1957, the Soviet Union successfully launched the _Sputnik_ satellite into orbit, **inaugurating the space race era of the Cold War and sparking a major panic among both American policymakers and the general public. All across the US, people with shortwave radios tuned in to hear the tiny satellite’s telltale “beep beep” and organized observation parties to watch _Sputnik_ as it travelled through space.

It was a deeply humbling moment for the West: the Russians had beaten the Americans into space. Had American technology fallen behind that of the Soviets? And if so, what did that mean for the future security of the self-styled “free world?” Many feared that the Soviet Union’s ability to launch the satellite proved that they must be in possession of a vast arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of raining destruction down upon American cities.

Once again, **the urgency of the Cold War brought the absurdity of segregation to light**. If _Sputnik_ represented a true national crisis, then why were black Americans being denied the opportunity to fully serve their country? The US was leaving untapped the intellectual resources of a large part of its population, in service of a ridiculous and morally indefensible commitment to racial apartheid (while also handing the Soviet Union a major propaganda talking point). While Americans were devoting their energies to keeping black children off high school and college campuses, the Soviets were working vigorously to make sure that _all_ their children received the best possible education. In fact, one-third of Soviet engineering undergraduates were female.

### NACA Becomes NASA

All of this created great pressure on NACA to design and test satellites that would be capable of making it to space. This was no easy feat, as any such craft would need to first break through the sound barrier, escape Earth’s gravitational pull, and settle into a speed (18,000 MPH) that would enable it to lock into a low orbit around the planet, all while withstanding levels of heat that could reach up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

NACA’s destiny as the powerhouse of America’s Space Race was hardly assured at this time. There were competing agencies within the federal government that might have conceivably taken the mantle of space leadership from NACA and Langley, including the US Air Force, the US Naval Research Observatory, and the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. But NACA, with its wealth of engineering talent, was selected as the home for all of America’s space research and operations—and Langley would be its nerve center. In October 1958, all competing operations were placed under NACA’s purview. **With the expanded mission came a new name for the agency: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA.**

History began playing out right in front of Katherine Goble. Her Flight Research Division worked closely with an engineering group called the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD), which specialized in rocketry. With the new emphasis on space, PARD’s and Flight Research’s engineers came to the fore. This represented Katherine’s wildest dreams come true—an opportunity to leap into the intellectual (and literal) unknown, to be involved with something completely untried and untested in the course of human history. She would be part of the effort to put human beings into outer space.

#### The End of West Computing

The expanded mission and scope of NASA wrought major changes for the agency, transforming it into a high-profile bureaucracy with twice as many employees as it had before. It also signalled the end of an era for West Computing. **Skill specialization was now the key to success at NASA** : there was simply less of a need for a centralized pool like West Computing. Many of the original West Computers had already moved out of the pool, being assigned to mission-focused projects and divisions elsewhere at the laboratory. By the time NASA shuttered the West Area Computers Unit in 1958, only nine remained, including Dorothy Vaughan.

The end of the unit represented the end of an era, the disbanding of a band of sisters who had made great strides in smashing the color barrier in the United States. For the rest of their lives, the former West Computers would remember their experiences and tell their stories with the quiet dignity that was so characteristic of women of this generation. **They didn’t see themselves as heroes—they were simply doing their jobs.**

In subsequent years, Dorothy would reinvent herself as an early computer programmer, mastering the IBM 704. She performed the vital task of translating engineers’ data and entering it into the computer in its FORTRAN language. Dorothy’s work at Langley had helped her fulfill many of her ambitions. Her children were off to college, and she had bought a home of her own. And she had shepherded so many of her “girls” onto fulfilling careers of their own. But this was a bittersweet moment for Dorothy. As she passed the torch to a new generation of black women, she also recognized that she would be taking a back seat. Her days as a manager were over. At NASA, she would be just one of the girls again.
