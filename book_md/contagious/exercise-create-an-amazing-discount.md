## Exercise: Create an Amazing Discount

One of the ways to give your product or service practical value is to create and apply an amazing discount. In this exercise, learn how to ensure that your discount is amazing.

* * *

Think of a product that you’ve created (or want to create). What price would you usually sell this product for? If you were asked to devise a discount for this product, what saving would you consider applying?

“Amazing” discounts must be big enough to impress customers (for instance, 50% off as opposed to 5% off). Likewise, they must follow the Rule of 100, which states that if a product’s original price is under $100, a percentage-based discount will appear more attractive to customers. Meanwhile, if it’s above $100, a numerical discount will impress customers more. Does your discount fit both of these criteria? If not, how could you amend it so that it does?

People are more likely to share information about discounts that are somehow limited in their availability. How would you limit the availability of your discount? (For instance, could you make your discount “members only”? Could you make your discount available for a short time only?)

For your discount to be effective at generating word of mouth, it needs to be publicly visible. How might you add visibility to your discount? (For instance, could you put posters up in your store advertising the discount? Could you send your customers an email informing them of the discount?)
