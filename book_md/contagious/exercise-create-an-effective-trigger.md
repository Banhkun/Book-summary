## Exercise: Create an Effective Trigger

Learn how to create an effective trigger for your product or idea.

* * *

Think of a product you’ve created (or one that you enjoy using). Brainstorm five to ten possible triggers for this product. (Try to make sure that these triggers haven’t been used by other companies before. Likewise, try to make them relevant to your target audience’s local environment.)

Now, it’s time to narrow down these possible triggers. Which three or four triggers do you believe are likely to activate the most frequently, and why?

Out of these three or four frequently activating triggers, which one do you think will have the most long-term relevance? Why is this trigger unlikely to fade out of public view?

Which of your remaining triggers is most likely to activate close to the site of your desired behavior, and why? (“The site of your desired behavior” may be the place where people can buy your product, or a place where people can talk about it.)
