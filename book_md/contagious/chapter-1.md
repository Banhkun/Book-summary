## Chapter 1: Give People Social Currency

The first attribute of contagious ideas and products is that they **give people social currency**. The theory of social currency is based on the idea that everything you talk about affects how people see you and impacts your level of social influence. For example, if you only talk about boring things, people will think you’re boring. They won’t want to talk to you anymore, meaning your social influence will decrease. However, if you talk about interesting, witty, or unusual things, people will think you’re fun to be around. They’ll want to spend time with you, and your social influence will increase.

Because what people say has such a big impact on their public image, they’re inclined to choose their topics of conversation carefully. **They’re only willing to talk about things that they think will add to their social currency** , not deplete it. For this reason, if you want information about your product or idea to disseminate through word of mouth, make sure that discussing it gives people social currency rather than taking it away.

You can make your product or idea a source of social currency by implementing three principles:

  1. Make it remarkable.
  2. Apply game mechanics.
  3. Use scarcity and exclusivity.



### Making Things Remarkable

The first way to make your product or idea a source of social currency is to **make it remarkable** —somehow interesting or innovative enough to get people talking. Berger’s research has shown that people love talking about remarkable things—for example, improbable or interesting facts and innovative products—because doing so makes _them_ seem remarkable.

Berger’s research has also demonstrated that people tend to exaggerate the remarkability of what they’re talking about just to make themselves seem even more remarkable. For example, someone might frame an innovative product that helps them to chop a vegetable in less than ten seconds as a five-second chopping sensation. Therefore, if you can get people talking about your remarkable product, they’ll probably make it seem even better than it actually is. This will only help in your mission to generate word of mouth.

#### How Can You Make Your Product Seem Remarkable?

You can make a product or idea seem remarkable by **using your marketing materials to emphasize the thing that makes it interesting or notable**. Clearly tell the consumer what makes your product so special. For instance, can your product do something that was previously thought to be impossible? Does it break and improve upon an expected or accepted pattern? If so, make this a key element of your marketing strategy.

Take the example of Blendtec blenders. These products seem ordinary enough. They’re just blenders, right? Well, not quite. Blendtec products became remarkable when it emerged they were strong enough to blend items as tough as golf balls. No other blender had done that before.

Another example of this principle is JetBlue, a popular budget airline. Most low-cost airlines have small seats, very few snacks, and no in-flight entertainment. JetBlue flights are remarkable because they break all of these conventions—so people talk about and recommend them.

A more unusual way to make your product remarkable is to **add an element of mystery or controversy to its marketing**. Give it a mysterious provenance, or make it challenge social convention somehow. People love talking about things that raise questions or trigger outrage.

A famous example of this is the marketing around the movie The Blair Witch Project. The movie was initially marketed as “found footage”—the real recordings of three filmmakers who’d gone missing, possibly at the hands of a witch. People constantly discussed and questioned whether the footage was real or not, contributing to the film’s popularity.

### Applying Game Mechanics

The second way to harness the power of social currency is by **applying game mechanics to your product or service**. Game mechanics are the elements of a game that measure accomplishment—for example, points systems, leaderboards, and in-game trophies. When people meet these mechanics’ requirements and “win” the game, they get the sense that they’ve achieved something.

This achievement becomes a form of social currency. The winner knows that telling people they’ve “won” at something will make them appear impressive, so they brag about their achievement whenever they can. In the process, they share information about the thing that gave them their sense of accomplishment. They inadvertently promote the product or service that made them feel good. In other words, they spread word of mouth about it.

For example, if a friend mentions to you that they came top of the leaderboard in a certain online game, they’re also going to tell you the game’s name and what it involves. They’re going to spread word of mouth about the product without even realizing they’re doing it.

#### How Can You Apply Game Mechanics?

To apply game mechanics to your product or service and generate word of mouth, find a way to replicate the sense of achievement that people feel when they win a game. One way to do this is to **introduce a reward system for using your product or service**. If the customer uses your product or service enough, they advance to the next tier of the system and unlock a reward. This gives them a sense of achievement, and a feeling of high status: two things they’ll go on to brag about while also handily mentioning your company.

For example, airlines have “gamified” air travel by introducing frequent flier reward programs. The more a person flies with the company, the more “air miles” they collect, and the higher up the rewards hierarchy they advance. This is an achievement they’re bound to share with friends.

Another way to apply game mechanics is to**run contests for your customers**. This is particularly effective if you make your contest have multiple winners who can all brag about their achievement and spread the word about your company. Even better, run a contest with a voting process. That way, all of the entrants will work hard to gain votes by telling everyone they know about the contest, again generating discussion about your company.

One brand that successfully generated word of mouth through contests is Burberry. The brand once ran a competition in which customers submitted a photo of themselves or a loved one wearing the famous Burberry trench coat. The best photos would be posted on Burberry’s website. In the wake of the contest, the brand’s sales increased by 50% and its website got millions of views from all over the world. Berger believes that this success was due to the word of mouth generated by the contest’s entrants and winners.

To make game mechanics even more effective at generating word of mouth, **make it very easy for people to share their achievements with others**. For instance, once someone has achieved a certain membership tier, send them a physical membership card that they can easily show off to their friends and family.

### Using Scarcity and Exclusivity

The final way to use social currency to your advantage is to **use scarcity and exclusivity to make your product or service desirable**.

“Scarcity” is all about controlling the perception of your product’s availability. It involves making people think that they’ll struggle to get hold of whatever you’re selling. You can do this by:

  * Limiting how many units of the product you actually make and publicizing these limits 
  * Telling customers that the product is expected to sell out quickly
  * Adding time restrictions on when people can access the product or service—for instance, only open your business during certain times of the day, or only make a product available for a short time



“Exclusivity” also relates to availability, but in a slightly different way. It’s about creating the perception that only a select few people have access to your product or service. A simple way of doing this is to make the product or service more expensive. That way, only richer people can afford it.

However, a much more effective method of generating exclusivity is making information about and access to your product hard to come by. For example, you could make your product or service “members only,” or only let people access it if they’ve been recommended by a current member.

Another option is to not traditionally promote your product or service that much. This will limit the amount of public information about it and make it seem like a “secret.” Knowledge of this secret product or service will then become something “exclusive.” (However, it probably won’t remain secret for long. Humans are notoriously bad at keeping secrets.)

Note that you don’t want to make the existence of your product or idea _completely_ secret. You won’t generate word of mouth if absolutely nobody knows about the thing you’re offering. You merely want to present the illusion of secrecy—something you can do by _limiting_ the amount of public information about it, not releasing no information whatsoever.

Both of these suggestions may seem counterintuitive compared to the usual marketing advice of making your business as visible as possible. However, they can have a powerful effect when trying to generate word of mouth due to the benefits of scarcity and exclusivity.

#### The Benefits of Scarcity and Exclusivity

Making your product or service appear scarce and exclusive will benefit you in two ways. First, **it will make customers want to purchase your product or service** and do so _right now_. Consumers tend to believe that if a product or service is hard to get hold of, it must be good and therefore worth buying. After all, there must be a reason why it’s constantly sold out. Perhaps it’s unique, or particularly high-quality. They decide that they must purchase this popular product or service as soon as possible so they don’t miss out when it inevitably sells out again.

Second, making a product or service scarce and exclusive **gives social currency to the people who do manage to get hold of it.** It makes them seem like “insiders,” special individuals who were somehow able to access something that’s out of reach to a lot of people. These people know their “insider” status will make them look good, so they brag about it to their loved ones. Their loved ones may then decide _they_ want the “insider status” that comes with using the product or service, too. They’ll be driven to buy it and will inevitably brag to others about doing so. This continues the cycle of social currency and word of mouth.

(Shortform note: To learn more about how the principle of scarcity influences your customers’ buying decisions, read our summary of Robert Cialdini’s Influence.)

#### Example: SmartBargains and Rue La La

SmartBargains was a website that sold discounted designer items such as clothes and homeware. At first, it saw a lot of success. However, by 2007, it was struggling. People weren’t as excited about the brand anymore and it was losing customers.

In 2008, SmartBargains’ CEO decided to set up a new website called Rue La La. Rue La La sold exactly the same products as SmartBargains. However, its mode of operation was slightly different. The goods were sold during “flash sales” that only lasted for a day or two. This created an impression of scarcity. To access the sales, customers had to be invited by an existing user of the site. This generated a sense of exclusivity.

Rue La La became extremely successful because of this approach. Gaining access to its products became a form of social currency. This meant that its members bragged about their use of the site, spreading the word about it to their friends and family and increasing the site’s customer base.
