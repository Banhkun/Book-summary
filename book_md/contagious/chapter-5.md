## Chapter 5: Provide Practical Value

The fifth attribute of contagious products or ideas is that they **provide practical value** —they’re useful in some way. People love gathering practical information that will make their lives easier. Most commonly, they like to collect information that will help them to complete tasks more quickly and easily, or information that will help them to save money.

Crucially, **people also love sharing this information with other people**. They do so because they want to help the people they care about. Therefore, if you make your product or service a source of practical value, people will talk about it because they’ll want to share its value with others. In short, you’ll generate word of mouth.

There are two ways to add practical value to your product or idea:

  1. Create an amazing discount and apply it to your product. This will capitalize on people’s love of sharing money-saving tips.
  2. Provide useful information to your customers once they’ve bought your product. For example, give them practical advice on a topic relevant to your product or service. Do so in an easy-to-share format like an email or a magazine so your customers can pass this information on to their loved ones.



### Create an Amazing Discount

The first way you can give your product or service practical value is to **apply an amazing discount**. Make your product appealing and shareable by making it a money-saver.

This discount can’t just be an “okay” saving that doesn’t really stand out. If it is, people will take advantage of the deal themselves, but probably won’t tell others about it. For a discount to be worthy of sharing, it needs to be truly amazing.

But what makes a discount “amazing”? In general, amazing discounts usually have four principles:

  1. They represent a big saving.
  2. Their availability is limited: for instance, the discount is short-term, or only for certain customers.
  3. They follow the Rule of 100.
  4. They’re obvious: they’re well-advertised and easy to find out about.



#### Make Your Discount Big

For a discount to be amazing, it has to be big. For instance, a 5% discount will be perceived as an _okay_ deal, not an amazing one. It doesn’t knock _that_ much off the original price, so it’s not that attractive. A 50% discount, however, is a pretty big saving and is therefore more likely to impress customers.

Customers are more likely to share information about a big discount for two reasons. First, **a big discount is more helpful than a small one.** To many people, sharing information about a 5% discount doesn’t seem worth it. It’s not going to save their loved ones much money, so what’s the point in telling them about it? However, sharing information about a 50% discount is incredibly helpful—it’ll help the person’s loved ones make a huge saving. Therefore, this larger discount is more likely to be shared.

Second, **big discounts are remarkable**. They’re surprising, impressive, and exciting—and therefore worthy of remark. As you learned in Chapter 1, people love to talk about remarkable things because they’re a source of social currency. They’re going to share information about your remarkable deal because they know doing so will make them look good.

##### Provide a Reference Point

When placing a big discount on a product, remember that **people judge how good a deal is using the item’s original price as a reference point.** They like to know the precise monetary difference between the item’s original price and its new price.

Because of this, simply stating that your product has a big discount—for instance, putting a label on the product saying “50% off”—might not be enough to entice customers. To get them truly excited about the deal, show how much more they _could_ have paid, not just what they _will_ pay. You can do this by making sure you **clearly display your product’s original price next to its sale price**. This gives customers the reference point they need to determine whether your deal is good or not.

##### Diminishing Sensitivity

Another reason why keeping your discounts big is important is **the principle of diminishing sensitivity**. This principle states that the exact same monetary discount can seem good or bad depending on its proportional relationship to the original price of the discounted item.

Take the example of a $10 discount. If the original price of the product was small—say, $35—this discount will seem like a good deal because proportionally, it knocks off a big chunk of the price. However, if this same $10 discount is applied to a product that cost $3500 originally, it’s not going to seem like a good deal. Proportionally, this is barely a discount at all.

The moral of this principle is that **you can’t just place the same monetary discount on every product**. For example, don’t apply a blanket “$10 off” discount to all of your items. While this deal might work for cheaper products, it’ll seem like a bad deal on more expensive ones. Instead, keep your discount large in proportion to your product’s original price. If you don’t, people won’t be impressed by the deal, and they won’t share it.

If you approach the process of devising a deal with the mindset that your deal needs to be big, you’ll naturally avoid this issue. You won’t even contemplate putting a small monetary discount on an expensive product.

#### Limit Availability

The second way to make your discount amazing is to **ensure it isn’t too readily available**. For example, don’t run a constant discount on a particular product. If you do, people will start to see the item’s lower price as the norm and not as a great deal. The deal will no longer seem special.

Instead, find a way to make your discount scarce or exclusive. For instance, you could make it available for a limited time only, or a “members only” deal. Another option is to add a quantity limit per customer for the discounted item, so that their ability to purchase it is curbed.

Adding scarcity or exclusivity to a deal will make it look more valuable—like a special opportunity that can’t be missed. People tend to think that a deal must be really good if a store limits access to it. For instance, customers might think that a store has added a quantity limit to a discounted item because the discount’s popularity has led to the product almost selling out. They may decide that if the discount is that popular, it must be good.

When people believe that deals are valuable in this way, they’re more likely to tell others about them. Likewise, as you’ve already learned, making something seem scarce or exclusive increases its social currency. This also makes people more likely to talk about it.

#### Apply the Rule of 100

The third attribute of amazing discounts is that **they follow the Rule of 100**. If you apply this rule when creating your discount, you can maximize its attractiveness and increase the likelihood that it’ll be shared.

The Rule of 100 is based on research that investigated whether percentage-based discounts (for instance, 50% off) or numerical discounts (for instance, $50 off) are more effective. The answer to this question depends on whether the item’s original price was above or below $100.

If the price was originally below $100, percentage discounts are more impressive. This is because when lower prices are involved, a percentage discount seems much higher than a numerical one. For example, imagine a hat was originally $10 but has a 25% discount applied. This discount seems pretty big—a quarter off! However, in numerical terms, it’s only a $2.50 discount—not a huge amount of money. Therefore, this deal seems much better if you frame it as a percentage, not a numerical discount.

If a product’s price was originally above $100, the reverse is true. A numerical discount will seem higher than a percentage discount, thus making the former more attractive to customers. For example, a 10% discount on a $5000 product is equivalent to $500 off. A $500 discount seems much higher than a 10% discount, even when the two have the same value in reality.

#### Make the Discount Obvious

The final attribute of amazing discounts is that **they’re obvious and easy to observe**. As you learned in Chapter 4, things need to be publicly visible if people are going to share information about them. Discounts are no exception to this.

The majority of discounts are stated quite obviously. Stores put stickers on items to indicate to customers that they’re on sale. They display huge posters highlighting their best deals.

However, sometimes stores make the mistake of hiding the value of their discounts. A major example of this is store loyalty cards: cards on which people accrue points if they spend enough at the shop. They can then cash in these points to get discounted goods.

These cards do have practical value. They can save customers a lot of money. However, it’s not easy to share that value with other people. Most people only find out how many points they accrue when it’s printed on their receipt, and they’re unlikely to show their receipts to other people. Therefore, the word about these cards never gets out.

A better approach to publicizing the value of store cards might be ringing a bell when people use their card to get a discount of a certain size—for instance, $25 or over. Or when a customer arrives at the checkout, they could be greeted by a screen that tells them how much customers have saved today using their loyalty cards. These actions will show customers the practical value of the cards. They’ll be more inclined to get a card and tell other people about them, too.

### Provide Useful Information

In addition to creating an amazing discount, you can add practical value to your product or service by **finding a way to provide useful information to your customers.** Once they’ve engaged with your product or service, send them advice or practical tips that will make their life easier in some way. For example, if you’re a financial services company, send your customers a newsletter with money-saving tips. If you sell groceries, include a free healthy eating advice pamphlet with every purchase.

When your customers receive this information, they’ll pass it on to friends or family members who they think would benefit from it. In the process of doing so, **they’ll inform other people that your company exists**. They’ll spread word of mouth about your business.

#### Maximizing Information’s Sharing Potential

People are inundated with information every day. They probably receive multiple email newsletters, read dozens of articles and blogs, and get offered many free pamphlets. In this information-rich landscape, it’s easy for your offering to get lost in the crowd. **You must make sure that your method of sharing information stands out** —that people choose to absorb and share your practical tips, not those sent to them by your competitors and other businesses. Your information must be as engaging and shareable as possible.

One way to make your information shareable is to**package it in a concise and accessible way**. People respond better to short, snappy text, not something that’s going to take them a long time to comb through. Don’t send your customers a three-page essay filled to the brim with useful information. They won’t read it all, and if they don’t read it, they won’t share it. Even if they _do_ battle through your wall of text, they’re not going to pass it on. They’ll be too worried about boring people and losing social currency.

Instead, limit the information you share to three or four simple yet engaging points. For example, send customers your four most effective money-saving tips, not every money-saving tip ever to exist. Likewise, make sure you make these points clear and streamlined. Don’t embed them in lots of exposition. People won’t take the time to comb through fluffy text to find the point of what you’ve sent them. They’ll quickly get bored and move on before they’ve had a chance to absorb and share your information.

The second way to make your information shareable is to **ensure that it’s relevant to your target audience**. Your customers aren’t going to read or share information if it doesn’t have any relevance to them or their loved ones. For example, if you’re a financial services company with a predominantly US-based clientele, there’s no point sending your customers information about the best bank accounts currently available in Germany. This information is very unlikely to be useful to your target audience or anyone they know. Keep your advice US-centric.

The final way to ensure that people share your information is to **make it targeted, specific, and likely to appeal only to a set group of people.** For example, don’t send out a newsletter that contains financial tips that anyone could implement. Send out targeted advice, such as tips specifically for people who are buying their first house.

This might seem counterintuitive. Surely information that’s relevant to lots of people will be shared more widely? However, Berger argues that just because someone _can_ share the information with everyone they know doesn’t mean they _will_. In fact, he suggests people may be more inclined to share information that reminds them of just one other person. Because the information seems to be so uniquely suited to this individual, the customer feels like they just _have_ to share it with them.

For instance, imagine you decide to target your financial services newsletter towards first-time buyers. When your customers receive the email, they’ll immediately think of any first-time buyers in their social circle. They’ll forward the newsletter to these people because it would seem silly not to. The information is incredibly useful to the first-time buyers and perfectly matches their situation.
