## Exercise: Tell a Shareable Story

Learn how to market a product by telling a shareable story.

* * *

Think of a product that you’ve created (or want to create). How and why did you first decide to create this product? Outline its “origin story” below.

Now, think about your product’s benefits and unique selling point. Tell a story that incorporates one or both of these factors. (For instance, tell the tale of how using your product changed someone’s life, or how someone discovered that your product was totally different from everything else on the market.)

Do you feel confident that either (or both) of these stories could form part of a successful marketing plan? Why or why not? (Remember: successful stories make the product an integral part of the narrative, and may also incorporate the principles of social currency, emotions, and practical value.)
