## Introduction

_The Richest Man in Babylon_ by George S. Clason is based on a series of financial advice pamphlets Clason wrote in the 1920s, which were distributed by banks and insurance companies. He compiled them into a book in 1926, which is considered a classic. It presents timeless principles for managing your money in the form of “Seven Cures for a Lean Purse” (how to generate wealth) and “Five Laws of Gold” (how to preserve and grow wealth). The simple principles are illustrated with a series of parables set thousands of years ago in the wealthy city of Babylon, where the basic ideas of finance got their start.

Clason’s message is that **if you work hard, save, live within your means, and invest wisely, you can become wealthy**. He’s credited by some with being the first person to articulate the principle, “Pay yourself first.” With a few modern-day caveats, the principles remain valuable today.

The financial principles are delivered by Arkad, the richest man in Babylon, who teaches the secrets of wealth to local citizens who want to learn how to stop struggling financially and become rich. (Shortform note: The parables are told in language patterned after that of the King James version of the Bible, with lots of “thys,” “thous,” “saiths,” and “thinkeths.”)

According to Clason, the reason you should manage your money wisely is two-fold: Prospering financially helps not only you, but also society. The prosperity of the nation depends on the wealth of its individuals. So personal prosperity is in essence patriotic. Babylon was the wealthiest city of its era because its citizens were the most prosperous.

A word about success: **Success is what you accomplish through your own efforts and abilities**. It requires effective preparation, based on wisdom and understanding. If you desire financial success—to obtain money, keep money, and grow your money—following the principles will get you there, even if you’re struggling with debt.

(Shortform note: To make the message of the book clearer, we have reorganized the material to present Clason’s principles of money management first, followed by parables showing how people apply the principles at different points in history to illustrate their timelessness.)
