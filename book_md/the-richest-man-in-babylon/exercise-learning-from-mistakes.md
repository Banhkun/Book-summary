## Exercise: Learning From Mistakes

The character Nomasir initially failed to follow the “laws of gold” and ended up losing money his father had given him. But he learned from his mistakes, started over, and eventually succeeded.

* * *

Have you ever made a financial mistake and lost money? What was your mistake? Did it violate one of the principles or laws of this book? How?

What did you do about your mistake? What impact has it had on how you have managed your money since then?

What would your advice be to someone facing a similar situation?
