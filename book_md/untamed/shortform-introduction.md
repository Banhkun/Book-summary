## Shortform Introduction

In _Untamed,_ speaker, author,__ and activist Glennon Doyle explores how she freed herself from the strictures of society and embraced her true identity by rejecting the expectations and limitations society imposes on women. Her book is an intimate memoir—telling her personal story of addiction and rehab, falling in love with a woman, leaving her marriage, and rebuilding her family—and a call to action. Doyle wants her readers to use her story as a framework to examine their lives and deconstruct societal expectations, thereby liberating themselves from the metaphorical captivity that limits their potential.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: The Dial Press, New York 2020

Doyle also published a supplemental book to _Untamed_ in 2021 __ entitled _Untamed: The Journal_ , which contains guided exercises and reflection questions that help readers apply the principles of _Untamed_ to their lives.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

_Untamed_ came out in early 2020 and achieved extreme popularity during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. For many, quarantine felt like a type of cage in which they felt trapped, physically and mentally. Doyle’s message of captivity and freedom resonated with many readers, especially women, who felt trapped in traditional gender roles as they were forced to take on more household duties and childcare during the pandemic.

#### Intellectual Context

_Untamed,_ like many memoirs, offers snapshots of events from Doyle’s life organized around a main theme, with the aim of sharing her experiences and communicating essential realizations about how to live as a woman. This combination of personal experience and self-help inspiration is present in many books of the genre, such as Elizabeth Gilbert’s memoir _Eat, Pray, Love_. Gilbert is good friends with Doyle; they have inspired each other’s work.

Although _Untamed_ shares many similarities with more traditional memoirs such as _Eat, Pray, Love_ , Doyle mentions in an interview that she wanted Untamed to “feel wild” and not be similar to any other memoir or self-help book. She said she wrote the book in a burst of creative inspiration and wants the reader to feel swept away by its propulsive energy. As a result, _Untamed_ exists in its own category as a combination of memoir, self-help, and expressive artistic statement.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Untamed_ rose to #1 on the _New York Times_ bestsellers list in 2020 and has sold over two million copies since its publication. Doyle’s celebrity was a factor in the book’s impact—many people were interested in her romantic life, divorce, and re-marriage to a woman. They were eager to dive into the details via her book.

The popularity of Doyle and the book's success prompted J.J. Abrams to purchase the production rights to _Untamed_. A television series based on the book (starring Sarah Paulson as Glennon Doyle) is in development.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

This book appeals to many because of its honesty and readability. In online reviews, readers say that they feel connected to Doyle’s narrative and honesty and see their experiences mirrored in Doyle’s life.

Doyle also has a casual writing style, often using a funny, irreverent, and engaging tone that makes her experiences relatable. Many of her fans read the book several times because they found it so insightful and entertaining.

However, some reviewers took issue with Doyle’s overall tone in the book, which they felt was somewhat self-congratulatory. Others didn’t like the structure and felt the book read like a series of disconnected blog posts. Many also expected a more straightforward memoir of Doyle’s relationship with her wife and didn’t like the non-linear way she presented her story.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The chapters of _Untamed_ are similar to a blog post format: a personal narrative or reflection, a realization inspired by this reflection, and words of wisdom that you can apply to your life.

Doyle’s chapters have these qualities and contain extended metaphors to explain her ideas, lessons, and themes. The extended metaphors help connect the reader to the book's themes by providing a central image. For example, Doyle begins _Untamed_ by sharing a life experience (seeing a cheetah) and uses this image as a way of explaining an idea (women oppressed by society’s messages) to teach a lesson (women must break free of their cages).

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

This book has three parts, each divided into short chapters. The first part introduces Doyle’s concept of captivity and her argument for escaping. The second part introduces her central themes—reexamining her life, being free from society’s expectations, and finding pathways to liberate herself. The third part of the book explores these themes through personal experiences. Many of these experiences involve her intimate relationships and her interactions with her children.

Doyle doesn't tell her story in chronological order, instead visiting a new theme or personal experience in every chapter. This particular organization can make it difficult to connect her experiences directly to the central themes she introduces in the first section.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Our guide focuses on what Doyle identifies as the four pathways that free you from a state of metaphorical captivity. We connect each pathway with Doyle’s journey and explore how she has deconstructed her prior beliefs and rebuilt a new life on her terms.

  * The first pathway (embracing your emotions) touches on Doyle’s experiences with alcohol addiction and rehab. 
  * The second pathway (embracing your intuition) explores Doyle’s experiences during a crisis in her first marriage. 
  * The third pathway (embracing your imagination) explores Doyle’s love story and remarriage. 
  * The fourth pathway (deconstructing your beliefs) examines the experiences that led Doyle to deconstruct her beliefs. 



Doyle's central concepts that we’ll see in this guide—feminism, empowerment, and reconstructing your life—are well-explored by other thinkers. We've therefore extended her ideas with complementary actionables, different perspectives, and supporting research.
