## 1-Page Summary

In _Untamed,_ speaker, author,__ and activist Glennon Doyle explores how she freed herself from the strictures of society and embraced her true identity by rejecting the expectations and limitations society imposes on women. Her book is an intimate memoir—telling her personal story of addiction and rehab, falling in love with a woman, leaving her marriage, and rebuilding her family—and a call to action. Doyle wants her readers to use her story as a framework to examine their lives and deconstruct societal expectations, thereby liberating themselves from the metaphorical captivity that limits their potential.

### Introduction: Captivity and the Pathways to Freedom

For much of her life, Glennon Doyle has felt like a wild animal in captivity—conditioned not to feel, think, or trust herself. To be free from this captivity, **Doyle had to learn how to break society’s rules, upend cultural expectations, and rebuild her life based on her emotion, intuition, and imagination.**

#### Doyle’s Inspiration: The Cheetah

Doyle’s inspiration for the book came when she took a trip to the zoo with her family. She observed a majestic female cheetah tamed by her keepers and trained to chase a stuffed animal around her pen. Doyle identified**** with the cheetah: She’d been held in “captivity,” trained by society to chase the “stuffed animals” of domesticity and conformity rather than pursue her instincts and intuition.

Considering the parallels between the cheetah’s experience and her own, Doyle realized that captivity is the universal experience of women—their primal instincts have been intentionally suppressed and devalued by society. **To regain their freedom, she says, women must rediscover the wildness within them.**

> **Comparisons Between Doyle’s “Wildness” and the Wild Woman Archetype**
> 
> Doyle’s discussion of women’s inherent “wildness” and their need to return to their primal state is not necessarily new—Jungian analyst and storyteller Clarissa Pinkola Estés claims these concepts are as old as civilization. Estés explores the historical and cultural background of these ideas in _The Women Who Run With Wolves._
> 
> Estés analyzes myths and fairy tales to reveal common themes and characters that serve as mythological archetypes in stories throughout the human experience. In these stories, the “wild woman” is a commonly-explored figure who resists civilization and lives in touch with nature and her soul. She often lives on the fringes of society, is not bound by its rules, and speaks the truth. Estés says that reading about these figures can help women recognize these qualities in themselves and remember their primal nature.

##### Received Cultural Messages

As a child, Doyle was creative, impulsive, and intuitive. As she entered adolescence, however, Doyle started receiving and internalizing damaging cultural messages about what women should be: pleasing and agreeable, self-sacrificing, and attractive to men—all while repressing their emotions and desires and deferring to others’ opinions.

Doyle abandoned her unconstrained childhood self to conform to these expectations and began bottling up her emotions, distrusting her intuition, and dismissing her imagination—this messaging took away her freedom and put her in the cage of society's expectations.

> **Why Social Messaging Disproportionately Affects Girls**
> 
> Doyle describes how she was susceptible to the messages of her culture and internalized them at an early age. One of the reasons Doyle was so affected by this messaging is that humans place a high value on social acceptance and are therefore constantly observing the behaviors of others to guide their behavior.
> 
> In _Influence_ , Robert Cialdini describes “The Social Proof Principle,” which states that when people are unsure of how to behave, they base their behavior on the behaviors of others in the group. Social proofs can be a way to cope with insecurity and pursue social acceptance.
> 
> Adolescent girls can be particularly susceptible to social proofs because they are more sensitive to rejection or social disapproval than boys. As a result, manufactured social proofs—social proofs deliberately created to manipulate behavior—disproportionately affect girls. A pervasive example of manufactured social proofs are the messages in advertising that aim to convince girls that they are not good enough. These kinds of manufactured social proofs can have long-lasting negative consequences, including anxiety, depression, and insecurity—all of which Doyle has struggled with throughout her life.

#### Pathways Out of Captivity

After her experience with the cheetah helped her reflect on her life in captivity, Doyle identified the "pathways" that had allowed her to break free and live a wild, undomesticated life. Doyle introduces **four pathways to help you rediscover your wildness.**

  * **Pathway #1: Embracing Emotion** —numbing your emotions has stopped you from being able to express your feelings. This pathway encourages you to embrace and express your emotions to be fully human. 
  * **Pathway #2: Embracing Your Intuition** —the tendency to look to others for validation has diminished your ability to tap into your intuition. By following this pathway, you can learn to explore your intuition through quiet reflection.
  * **Pathway #3: Embracing Your Imagination** —the social message that you must accept your current reality and be grateful for your life has diminished your ability to imagine a new reality. Embracing your imagination will help you create a better, more vibrant life.
  * **Pathway #4: Embracing Deconstruction and Reconstruction** —your ability to deconstruct your existing beliefs and assumptions and rebuild a new life for yourself has been taken away by society’s interest in maintaining the status quo. This pathway helps you deconstruct your old ways of thinking so you can rebuild your life around emotion, inner knowledge, and imagination.



As we explore these pathways, we’ll also tell Doyle’s life story in parallel, revealing how she’s traveled these pathways in her own life and navigated her way toward the vibrant, liberated life she lives now.

> **Women’s Liberation: From the ‘60s to Today**
> 
> Doyle’s pathways to freedom shares many similarities with the ideas that developed during the women’s rights movement in the 1960s and 70s. Betty Friedan was a feminist leader during this period focused on women’s liberation.
> 
> In the early 60s, Friedan experienced a sense of dissatisfaction and purposelessness as a homemaker raising children—an experience similar to Doyle’s captivity. She realized many women shared her experiences of being confined to the home and feeling unfulfilled, so she sought to find ways to liberate women like herself. Friedan realized acknowledging their shared experiences was an important first step toward progress and action. She therefore wrote _The Feminine Mystique, _which explored this shared female experience __ and exposed the cultural forces that kept women oppressed. In her book, Friedan suggests concrete courses of action, such as rethinking what it means to be a woman and breaking free of social restrictions by pursuing educational and career opportunities.
> 
> Friedan’s ideas about liberation are more focused on direct actions women can take toward liberation, while Doyle focuses more on examining and reinventing your mindset. Still, both Friedan and Doyle agree that rethinking what it means to be a woman is necessary to make progress and pursue fulfillment.

### Pathway #1: Embracing Emotion

Doyle’s captivity—like most women’s—started as a young girl. As a child, Doyle was very emotional. As Doyle entered young adulthood, she received the message from society and the people in her life that **strong emotions were undesirable—** she was supposed to be agreeable and well-behaved. Unable to express her emotions or cope with the heartache, pain, anxiety, and depression she experienced as a young woman, **Doyle self-medicated with food, drugs, and alcohol.**

> **Further-Reaching Effects of Numbing Your Emotions**
> 
> In attempting to numb her negative emotions, Doyle numbed _all_ of her emotions—which likely made her ability to cope with negative emotions even worse. In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown explains why numbing your negative emotions often can backfire in this way.
> 
> Brown says that your ability to recall positive experiences helps you build _resilience_ —you can get through negative situations by remembering that they won’t last, and you can have happy times. However, when you numb _all_ your emotions to avoid the negative ones, you block yourself from experiencing positive emotions—limiting your ability to draw on positive emotional experiences in times of crisis.

#### Embracing Emotion Means _Growing_

When she became pregnant with her first child, Doyle entered rehab. In rehab, she began to feel her emotions again and realized that she could experience them _all_ , even the painful ones, and survive. (Shortform note: In giving up her coping mechanisms, Doyle was able to clearly see her resilience—a common, and uplifting, experience for people in addiction recovery. In _We Are The Luckiest, _Laura McKowen writes that she feels _lucky_ to have struggled with addiction because recovery allowed her to know what she was capable of.)

She realized that she could **use painful emotions to grow and evolve—to become truly alive.** Doyle defines being “alive” as constantly evolving into a more authentic and fully-formed version of yourself. She believes your emotions will provide all the instructions you need to guide you on your journey**—** and the most challenging emotions are often the most instructive.

(Shortform note: Doyle says that negative emotions can be the most instructive, but in _Positivity_ , author Barbara Fredrickson argues that good emotions do a much better job at broadening your mind and teaching you important truths. Positive emotions raise dopamine levels in your brain—prompting creativity and openness to new experiences. Embrace _all_ your emotions, good and bad, for a well-rounded learning experience.)

#### Embracing Emotion in Daily Life

Now we’ll consider how to embrace your emotions in your daily life so that you can fully immerse yourself in this mindset. Doyle encourages two practices:.

  * **Do not avoid, distract or numb yourself from strong emotions.** Approach these feelings with excitement and curiosity. 
  * **Stay with your feelings, and allow them to teach you something new.** Embracing emotions enables you to feel more deeply and experience life more fully. Feeling everything is part of being fully human. 



> **Practical Steps for Allowing and Embracing Your Emotions**
> 
> Doyle advocates embracing emotion, but she doesn’t specify how you might go about doing this. In _Welcoming the Unwelcome_ , Pema Chödrön describes a helpful sequence to follow when you experience difficult emotions.
> 
>   * Investigate the emotions within you: Identifying each one will help you acknowledge each emotion and learn how it affects you.
> 
>   * Embrace the emotions by showing affection and openness to them: Greet each one with affection (for example, “hello, sadness” or “hello, loneliness”). By not expressing fear towards your emotions, you can understand them better and learn not to avoid them.
> 
>   * Interrupt the story that you might be telling about these emotions: Reflect on how you have treated them in the past and identify the narratives you have created about them. Then, create new narratives about your feelings.
> 
>   * Stay with the emotions: Tell yourself that you will stay with your emotions for longer than you might be comfortable with. Being willing to stay with difficult emotions will help you learn not to run away from them.
> 
>   * Use emotions to connect with others: Think about and empathize with others who may be having the same feelings.
> 
> 


### Pathway #2: Embracing Intuition

Doyle’s second pathway towards freedom is **embracing your intuition, or being guided by a deep sense of inner truth.**

Doyle observes that **women are conditioned to please and seek approval from others** —as a result, they don’t often trust their instincts and search externally for advice and validation. She wanted to find a way to connect with herself deeply to make decisions that were based on her inner wisdom and intuition rather than the opinions of outside sources.

Having landed on the right practice, Doyle no longer feels she has to consult others for advice or validation. **Her intuition frees her from being controlled by society’s expectations and empowers her to make her own choices.** When making a difficult decision, you can use Doyle’s method for tapping into your intuition:

  * Retreat to a quiet place where all you hear is your breath. 
  * Sink into your consciousness and become aware of a deeper sense of yourself. 
  * Connect and commune with this version of yourself. 
  * Ask a question in this mental space and see if you sense a gentle push towards the next step to take. 
  * Sit and reflect on this new knowledge and insight. 



This practice will get you in touch with your intuition, allowing you to make your own choices, confident that your decisions come from a place of strength and inner knowledge.

> **Practical Steps for Successfully Accessing Your Intuition**
> 
> It’s important to note that various practices can be useful in accessing your intuition—if Doyle’s process of connecting to a deeper sense of self feels a bit too ambiguous for you to replicate, you might try incorporating more concrete steps into your practice. In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield shares his approach to accessing intuition—similar to Doyle’s practice in some ways, but with several more relatable practices.
> 
> Canfield’s first recommendation is that you prepare your mind and body for meditation by sitting comfortably and practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing. He then recommends that you find a focal point and repeat a single word or phrase (such as “relax” or “I am love”). Repetition can clear your mind and help you focus. Doyle’s practice doesn’t emphasize meditation _preparation_ practices as Canfield does _—combining these practices with Doyle’s suggestion to sit_ in a darkened space may help you get into the deep, reflective mindset required for “sinking into” your inner self.
> 
> Canfield says that the next step is to shift into a mode in which you are more receptive to messages and intuition. This receptive mode is similar to Doyle’s deep meditative state in which she receives messages from her inner self, but has one significant difference: Rather than asking you to seek an inner voice, Canfield suggests you pay attention to your emotions and physical sensations. These tangible signals can tell you what your intuition is trying to say.

### Pathway #3: Embracing Your Imagination

Doyle’s newfound connection with her emotions and intuition laid the groundwork for her to fully, freely embrace her imagination when her life took an unexpected turn. While on a book tour, Doyle met and unexpectedly fell in love with soccer star Abby Wambach. She describes her experience meeting Abby as love at first sight. When Abby walked into the room, Doyle saw her future path emerging—although she had never met Abby, Doyle could clearly imagine a future as Abby’s partner**.**

(Shortform note: Studies have shown that the endorphins released when you fall in love—like when Doyle saw Abby—can increase imagination and creativity. However, you don’t have to _fall in love_ to similarly increase your capacity for imagination. Try opening yourself up to new endorphin-releasing experiences, such as traveling to a new place or trying your hand at art.)

#### Rewriting the Script

Since her life with Abby didn’t follow the script society had written for her, **Doyle had to write her own script, imagining the life she wanted and then making that a reality.**

From her experience of discovering happiness once she flipped the script, Doyle realized how important it is for women to rewrite their scripts—using their imaginations as a guide to direct their lives. Doyle suggests the following steps for rewriting your script:

  * Express your discontent. Be specific about what is wrong and what needs to change. 
  * Use your imagination to identify what you want. Ask yourself, “What is the best version of my life that I can imagine?”
  * Create a picture of it in your mind. 
  * Write down your desires and discuss them with loved ones.



> **Exploring the Steps of Rewriting Your Script**
> 
> Each step to rewriting your script is important and worth exploring in more depth. Doyle has expanded on the process in multiple podcasts, interviews, and speeches—here, we’ll explore her discussion of each step:
> 
>   * Expressing your discontent is a useful starting point because articulating what you are unhappy about and what needs to change challenges the idea that you should always be happy and grateful.
> 
>   * Asking yourself what you want is important because what you want often gets hidden beneath the expectations that others have for you.
> 
>   * Creating a clear picture of your desired future is a powerful technique because you may have never visualized the most beautiful version of your life—and therefore may not even be aware of what you really want.
> 
>   * Sharing your ideas with others can help you feel seen and acknowledged—which can further inspire you to take action.
> 
> 


### Pathway #4: Embracing Deconstruction

You’re now ready to examine areas of your life where emotion, intuition, and imagination are suppressed. By deconstructing those areas, you can let these powerful aspects of yourself shine. Deconstruction requires dismantling old beliefs and practices that you have inherited from your culture, giving you a clean slate upon which to reconstruct a new life that better reflects your current values and goals. (Shortform note: Deconstructing your beliefs not only allows you to create a new life that’s more aligned with your values but also allows you to more easily engage in change and creativity. In _Think Again_ , Adam Grant says that the crucial ability to rethink your beliefs allows you to develop new solutions and ideas for breaking free of old mindsets.)

#### Deconstructing Marriage, Motherhood, and Family Structure

In this section, we'll explore how Doyle deconstructed her beliefs and practices about marriage, motherhood, and family in creating her new life with Abby.

##### Original Beliefs

Doyle learned from her conditioning that the best way a woman can love the people in her life and her community is to selflessly serve others and put her desires last. **She tried to be a dutiful wife, a selfless mother, and maintain a traditional family structure.**

(Shortform note: You may not be ready—or willing—to completely reject this aspect of your selfless nature. In that case, you might take a slightly different approach: cultivating a balance between selflessness and self-care. By balancing your selflessness with rejuvenating self-care practices, you can both honor your needs and fuel yourself for the emotional work of caring for the people in your life.)

##### New Beliefs

**Marriage** : Doyle deconstructed her beliefs about what it meant to be in an intimate relationship. She abandoned the idea that she must be pleasing and performative—instead forming a new belief that she deserves pleasure in her intimate relationships. (Shortform note: While many women feel obligated to put their partner's needs before their own, rethinking these beliefs can lead to more fulfilling sexual experiences. One way to become more aware of your desires is to check in with yourself before being intimate with another person. A self-check-in can help you assess what you want and can help you express your desires.)

**Parenthood** : Doyle deconstructed her beliefs about what it meant to be a parent. She wanted to model happiness and fulfillment for them rather than self-sacrifice. (Shortform note: Many authors and researchers agree that seeing happy adults provides important benefits for children. In _Modelling Happiness_ , Reen Rose says that when children see adults being curious, pursuing new ideas, and engaging in enjoyable activities, they witness both what it looks like to be happy and learn skills (such as resiliency, bravery, and confidence). These skills will help children to pursue their happiness as they mature.)

**Family Structure** : She deconstructed her beliefs about family structure. She realized that family structure can diverge from a nuclear family and still provide love, support, and stability. (Shortform note: Doyle’s assumption that the nuclear family should be maintained at all costs likely comes from societal messaging that this family structure is “best”—but studies show that many believe that _any_ family that provides love, protection, and support is "best." A larger societal trend towards accepting a wide range of family arrangements mirrors Doyle’s experiences. Research shows that an increasing percentage of the American population accepts and supports non-traditional family structures.)

#### Deconstructing Religion

Doyle deconstructed her ideas about religion on her path out of captivity. After a negative experience at a conservative church, she decided that she no longer wanted to be part of a faith tradition that forced her to check her critical thinking and intuition at the door or defer to the judgment of powerful men.

> **Women and Religious Deconstruction**
> 
> During her early church experience, Doyle saw how her viewpoints were easily ignored and disregarded by powerful men. Many women have spoken out against injustice in their congregations after having similar experiences.
> 
> Two notable women who have written extensively about religious deconstruction are authors Sarah Bessey (_Out of Sorts_) and Rachel Held Evans (_Searching for Sunday)_ point out how patriarchal power structures within the church discourage open dialogue and debate and promote conservative political ideologies. Their work explores the difficulty of leaving a faith community and the bravery required to deconstruct your faith—especially as doing so requires women to let go of a central support system.

#### Deconstructing Racist Beliefs

Doyle wanted to become more involved in the racial justice movement. She realized the first step was to educate herself about racism and explore her relationship with this issue.**** She learned about police brutality, the preschool-to-prison pipeline, and other issues facing the African American community. She began to see racism as a deep-rooted issue that poisons American society on all levels.

(Shortform note: Doyle may not have been aware of racism’s pervasiveness because much of it didn't fit her idea of “real” racism. In _How to Be an Anti-Racist_ , Ibram X. Kendi notes _two_ kinds of racism: overt and covert. Overt racism involves acts of aggression or violence—likely what Doyle was raised to believe was “real” racism. Through educating herself, she learned that covert racism—which involves institutionalized racist policies and practices throughout society—is “real” racism, too.)

Doyle realized that because she had grown up in a racist environment, racism also existed within her. She deconstructed her internalized beliefs by listening to the experiences of people of color and by being honest about her relationship with racism. (Shortform note: Doyle doesn’t mention which authors she read as she was becoming educated about these issues. If you’re looking for a place to get started, there are many reading lists online, such as this one put together by Ibram X. Kendi.)

### Conclusion: Reconstruction and Rebirth

The four pathways we have discussed helped free Doyle from captivity. As these four paths converged, they empowered Doyle to reconstruct her life to reflect her truest self in four ways:

  * **The Pathway of Embracing Emotion:** By feeling difficult emotions, she can face the future confidently, knowing that her difficult emotions will help her grow into the person she needs to become. Doyle built a new purpose based on empathy and activism. 
  * **The Pathway of Embracing Intuition:** By accessing her intuition, she can understand herself more deeply and feel secure when making difficult decisions. Doyle formed a new understanding of her inner self. 
  * **The Pathway of Embracing Imagination:** By envisioning and articulating her deepest desires for the future, she can rewrite her story so that these imaginings can become her reality. Doyle built a new marriage based on imagination. 
  * **The Pathway of Deconstruction:** By deconstructing prior beliefs, she can separate herself from social structures and institutions that do not reflect who she is and what she believes. Doyle built a new family, faith, and worldview based on consciousness rather than complacency. 



Doyle now lives according to her wildness—her primal self who had been there all along, waiting to be free. She has made a promise never again to abandon herself. She will practice self-love and always trust her instincts, and she calls on her readers to once again become wild women.

> **Doyle’s Continued Commitment to Her Pathways**
> 
> Doyle continues to embrace the pathways we have explored in this guide—she’s found concrete ways to live into each:
> 
>   * She has a post-it note on her mirror that reminds her to “feel it all” and embrace her emotions.
> 
>   * She continues to be guided by her intuition as she engages in activism through Together Rising and raises money for causes close to her heart.
> 
>   * Doyle lives the life she imagined for herself with Abby. Together they co-host the We Can Do Hard Things podcast, in which they are honest about their daily struggles and how they try to support each other on their respective journeys.
