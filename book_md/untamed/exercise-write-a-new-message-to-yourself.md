## Exercise: Write a New Message to Yourself

Doyle recommends that you write new messages about who you are and what you believe. In this exercise, you can identify the things you value most about yourself, your core beliefs, and the promises you can make to yourself going forward.

* * *

What do you like about yourself? How can you honor these qualities and treat yourself with respect?

What are your strongest beliefs? What are your core values?

What are some changes you need to make in your life? What are some promises that you can make to yourself?

Now, combine all of your ideas to write a new message to yourself. Use the following structure: “I am a ****_****. I believe in ****__****. I promise never again to ****_****. Going forward, I promise I will ****__****.”
