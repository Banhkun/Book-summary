## Exercise: Consider Your Virtues

Reflect on your virtuous qualities and actions and how they align with Aristotle’s ethics.

* * *

Describe a situation where you felt like you did the morally right thing. (For example, Frank threw a rope down a well to save a child trapped at the bottom.)

Did you feel “happiness” or a deep sense of satisfaction when you did the right thing in that situation? Do you still feel satisfied about it? Explain your answer.

Consider some of the worse alternatives you could have chosen in that situation. Do those alternatives have “too much” or “too little” of an otherwise virtuous quality? (For example, Frank could have had “too much” courage and jumped down into the well, trapping himself.)

Do you feel satisfied when you study philosophical works like the _Nicomachean Ethics_? Do you feel like reading philosophy makes you a better person? Explain your answer.
