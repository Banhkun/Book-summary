## Chapter 1: Developing a Definition of Trauma and PTSD

Trauma can stem from a one-time event or an ongoing experience. And each person who experiences trauma deals with it differently; two people who experience the same traumatic event may cope with it in entirely different ways—some people become irritable and have explosive rage, while others shut down emotionally or repress it entirely.

The range of symptoms, lack of uniformity, and occasionally the repression or denial of the traumatic event itself can make trauma difficult to identify and diagnose. As a result, there was no single diagnosis of the collective symptoms of trauma until just a few decades ago.

**Despite the range of causes, symptoms, and severity, all trauma sufferers have common neurological and physiological effects that last until effective treatment can heal both the mind and the body.**

(Shortform note: _Trauma_ is the umbrella term for the mental, emotional, neurological, and physical response to an intensely distressing or disturbing traumatic event. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the diagnosis most commonly associated with trauma, but as we’ll discuss, not every trauma survivor fits the definition of PTSD; other disorders that can result from traumatic experiences include Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), childhood trauma disorders, dissociative disorders, and adjustment disorders.)

### Identifying Trauma in War Veterans

Many of the early documented cases of trauma were in soldiers returning from combat in world wars I and II. But at the time there was no trauma diagnosis, so their physical tics, memory loss, panic attacks, and unpredictable rage were diagnosed as shell shock, war neuroses, or battle fatigue.

Early in Van der Kolk’s career, in the late 1970s, he worked as a staff psychiatrist at the Boston Veterans Administration Clinic. There he met a Vietnam veteran named Tom who, despite now having a beautiful family and successful law practice, was struggling with alcoholism, bouts of rage, and feelings of inner torment.

Tom constantly had nightmares of the ambush he experienced in Vietnam, during which everyone in his platoon was killed or wounded. Afraid of the nightmares, Tom would stay up most of the night drinking to dull his pain and memories. He was easily upset and worried about getting angry around his family because he had trouble controlling his actions when he was upset. The only things that seemed to bring Tom some sense of calm were speeding dangerously on his motorcycle and drinking heavily.

Tom’s story made the author wonder how and why **people who experienced trauma remain seemingly trapped in the past, constantly reliving the traumatic event.**

_The Traumatic Neuroses of War_ , which psychiatrist Abram Kardiner published in 1941, offered some insight on Tom in its description of “traumatic neuroses” that cause a chronic hypervigilance to threat. The book explained that traumatic neuroses—which today we’d call PTSD—have a physiological basis, meaning that **the symptoms of trauma come from the body’s response to the original trauma. In other words, trauma isn’t just in sufferers’ heads** —**it also leaves its mark on their bodies.** We’ll explore this more in later sections.

### Diagnosing PTSD

**When van der Kolk met Tom, the symptoms of PTSD were still described and diagnosed separately—as depression, mood disorders, alcoholism, substance abuse, and schizophrenia.** In 1980 a group of Vietnam veterans and psychoanalysts lobbied the American Psychiatric Association to create a diagnosis called posttraumatic stress disorder.

PTSD is defined as the result of a horrendous event involving death or serious injury—or the threat of either—to the patient or someone else, causing intense feelings of fear and helplessness. PTSD covers a cluster of symptoms, including:

  * Flashbacks
  * Nightmares
  * avoidance of people, places, or thoughts connected to the trauma
  * Hyperarousal, including hypervigilance, insomnia, and irritability



Once the diagnosis was created, this opened the door for new research, understanding, and approaches to treatment.

Soon after the diagnosis was created, van der Kolk started working with female patients who had been sexually abused as children and noticed that they had many symptoms in common with the veterans, such as nightmares and flashbacks, intense rage, periods of emotional collapse, and difficulty maintaining meaningful relationships.

He realized that **trauma could be caused by much more than battlefield tragedies. Violent crimes, rape, and abuse could bring on many of the same symptoms of PTSD visible in veterans.**

### PTSD Isn’t a One-Size-Fits-All Diagnosis

Trauma doesn’t look the same on everyone: The type of trauma and age at which you experience it both impact the effects. For example, the trauma symptoms that child abuse victims exhibit are vastly different from those of people who experience trauma as adults. **Psychiatrists can’t fully understand patients’ mental and emotional disorders unless they understand the myriad ways different types of trauma affect the mind, brain, and body.**

One study compared the symptoms of three groups of traumatized people: People who experienced childhood physical or sexual abuse by caregivers, recent domestic violence victims, and recent natural disaster survivors. Researchers saw a clear difference among the three groups, especially between survivors of child abuse and natural disasters, which are on opposite sides of the spectrum (considering age during the trauma, time elapsed since the trauma, and the intentional versus random causes of trauma). Those who were abused as children had a range of symptoms that the natural disaster survivors largely didn’t have, including trouble concentrating, self-loathing, difficulty with intimate relationships, self-destructive habits, large gaps in their memories, and an array of medical problems.

Child abuse survivors largely don’t fit the definition of PTSD, and there have been multiple proposals to create diagnoses that describe non-PTSD trauma victims. However, those attempts failed, leaving those patients to receive inaccurate diagnoses and inadequate treatments.

### Flawed Diagnoses Hurt Patients

Because psychiatry deals with the complex human mind, diagnoses and treatments can’t be as precise as other branches of medicine that deal with strictly biological and physiological systems.

The American Psychiatric Association’s _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM) was the first uniform system for psychiatric diagnoses, and it remains the so-called bible of psychiatry. The DSM is the basis for insurance claims, research funding, and academic programs. It’s regularly revised and republished, but many psychiatrists and mental health organizations still oppose the diagnostic approach of the DSM, saying the diagnoses define disorders by their symptoms instead of their root causes.

To better understand how this approach is flawed, think of it in terms of medicine: Before the late 1800s, doctors diagnosed illnesses based on _symptoms_ like fevers and pustules. But after the discovery of bacteria, the medical field shifted to target the _bacteria that caused the symptoms_ instead. **Many different ailments can produce the same symptoms—** anything from dehydration to pneumonia could cause a fever—**so a symptoms-oriented approach is too vague to lead you to the root issue.**

It’s not just about finding the right label; the diagnosis determines the treatment (for example, you wouldn’t treat pneumonia simply with fluids).

Furthermore, looking solely at biological and genetic sources of mental disorders gives an incomplete and inaccurate view. **Social relationships and environments are a critical aspect of human psychology, so the psychiatrists must take those factors into account when diagnosing and treating patients.** Dysfunctional social relationships are not only the consequence but also the cause of many mental disorders.
