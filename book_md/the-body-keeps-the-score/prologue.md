## Prologue: Trauma Haunts Many People for Life

We tend to think of trauma in its most extreme forms, such as PTSD in veterans, rape victims, and survivors of tragedies like 9/11. But nearly everyone is likely to either suffer from trauma or know someone who does—whether from a tragedy or accident, domestic violence, childhood abuse, or witnessing violence as a child.

Regardless of how many years or decades have passed since the traumatic event(s), your brain and body continue to feel the effects.**Trauma rewires the brain to cause people to be hypervigilant to threats and repeat the same mistakes, seemingly compulsively.**

In this summary, we’ll explore different causes of trauma, the ways in which it affects the brain and body, how developments in trauma and brain research have impacted treatment approaches, and what forms of treatment are available and recommended now.

### Shortform Intro

Trauma has become one of those broad psychological terms that is often thrown around but seldom truly understood; even in the field of psychiatry, as this summary will explore, it’s been a nebulous term with a wide range of manifestations.

In _The Body Keeps the Score,_ Van der Kolk explores how the understanding and treatment of trauma has evolved using historical information, case studies, and his own experience witnessing these changes through the course of his career and his own research.

There are no clear-cut answers about trauma or the best ways to treat it. Different schools of thought in the psychiatric field have different approaches to treating trauma; some doctors rely heavily on medications, while others endorse various forms of talk therapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy. Naturally, this book includes the author’s views about effective approaches and treatments, which will conflict with some practitioners’ opinions.
