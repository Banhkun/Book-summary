## Chapter 6: Traumatized People Disconnect From Their Physical Sensations

Recognizing the physical sensations in your body—as basic as feeling cold or hungry—is at the core of your sense of self: **How can you know what you enjoy, need, or want if you don’t understand how you feel on the most basic level?**

Before you develop language or consciousness, your physical awareness begins in the womb—feeling your mother’s movements and hearing the whooshing of fluids flowing around you. As you get older, physical sensations continue to provide information about your internal condition and your environment. Effectively reading sensory cues is essential to staying safe and healthy.

**Many trauma survivors suffer major disconnection from their bodies, which makes it impossible for them to feel fully alive, take care of their bodies and minds, and effectively engage with other people.**

Some survivors lose feeling in whole areas of their bodies, and can’t even determine what kind of object they’re holding in their palm by touch alone. Some survivors of chronic childhood trauma are so disconnected from their bodies that they can’t even recognize themselves in the mirror.

### Sensory Unawareness in the Brain

Researchers asked people to think about nothing—just focus on their breathing—while scanning their brains. Non-trauma sufferers had activation in the areas of the brain that give you the physical sense of where you are, register the physical sensations throughout your body, communicate your physical sensations to your emotional centers, integrate your sensory perceptions, and coordinate your thoughts and emotions. Together, all these brain functions create self-awareness and consciousness.

By contrast, trauma survivors who showed that their brain activity reflected their lack of sensory awareness. The survivors’ brains showed only a mild activation in the area that gives you your basic orientation in space; **the only thing trauma survivors’ brains registered was a general sense of where they were—but not how their body felt laying in the imaging machine, or how the cool air and the smell of the room made them feel.**

During a traumatic event, victims learn to cut off the connection between physical sensations, such as abuse, and emotional reactions, such as fear. The trouble is that this response continues long after the event is over, and inhibits survivors from experiencing physical sensations and their accompanying emotions—both positive and negative—in everyday life. Unable to register warmth, arousal, hunger, or pain, trauma survivors end up feeling numb.

### Not Understanding Physical Sensations Makes Trauma Survivors Feel Out of Control

_Agency_ is the feeling of being in control of your life—knowing where you are (literally and figuratively), that you’re in control of your actions, and that you can affect your circumstances.

Trauma sufferers tend to lose their sense of agency when they’re disconnected from their physical sensations: If they can’t register what they’re feeling, then they can’t figure out why they’re feeling that way, and they can’t do anything about it. For example, **if you can’t recognize that your body is tense, then you can’t use that clue to intuit that you’re feeling stressed, and you can’t do anything to manage that stress.** By the same token, you can’t interpret or act on what you need to take care of yourself—both physically and emotionally—and it’s nearly impossible to find a sense of purpose or direction in life.

The inability to identify emotions is called alexithymia; in Greek, this literally means having no words for feelings. Not only do people with alexithymia fail to recognize their own emotions, but they can’t read others’ emotions, either. Researchers found that when they showed pictures of angry faces, people with alexithymia couldn’t figure out what the people in the pictures were feeling.

Trauma survivors can’t even trust their bodies to provide accurate information, because they’re wired to be hypervigilant and hyperreactive to perceived threats. In response, **survivors may reject and suppress physical sensations, ultimately leaving them feeling confused by and out of control of what’s going on inside themselves.**

Another problem is that these suppressed needs don’t simply go away—the body finds other ways of expressing them to demand your attention: Many trauma survivors develop psychosomatic issues (physical ailments that have no physical cause) such as migraines, neck and back pain, fibromyalgia, asthma, digestive issues, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue.

#### Dissociation in Child Abuse Survivors

Many child abuse victims dissociate as a means of surviving their traumas: The experience of being raped or beaten is too much to bear psychologically, so they detach their minds from their bodies so they don’t have to experience the abuse. Even in cases of emotional abuse, children learn to block out the hostility or neglect as if they’re unaffected, even while internally they’re in a physical state of high alert.

Dissociation causes the abuse victims to deny certain feelings and sensations, and over time they lose sight of what’s real and what’s not. When you’re not in tune with yourself physically and emotionally, you begin to not feel _real_ ; **if you don’t know how you feel, you lose your sense of who you are.**

Often children can’t tolerate acknowledging their abuse, so they suppress their feelings. Consequently, they don’t understand that the fear, rage, or emotional shutdowns they experience in the aftermath are related to the abuse. Instead, they redirect those feelings toward themselves and become depressed, self-hating, and self-harming. Until they learn to associate those feelings with the acknowledgement of their abuse, they can’t work through them or begin healing their trauma.

#### Trauma Survivors Must Reconnect With Their Bodies

**In order to regain control of their bodies and minds to finally move past trauma, sufferers must learn to read and respond to their physical sensations.** They must first become aware of their sensations, then work on identifying them and learn to respond to what their bodies are telling them.

Effective treatments include mindfulness practices that increase survivors’ awareness of their bodies. These treatments aim to help trauma sufferers:

  * Tune into to the sensory perceptions that they learned to block during trauma
  * Learn to embrace those sensations instead of suppressing them
  * Gain a sense of completing the acts of self-preservation that were immobilized from doing during their traumatic events



We’ll explore these in further depth in later sections.
