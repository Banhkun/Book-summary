## Chapter 4: Understanding Trauma Through Brain Anatomy

Your brain’s primary function is to ensure your survival. This entails:

  * Signaling when your body needs essentials such as food, water, rest, shelter, safety, and sex. 
  * Interpreting the world around you to point you in the right direction to find and satisfy those essential needs. 
  * Creating the energy and initiating the actions to achieve those tasks. 
  * Warning you of dangers and opportunities you may encounter as you pursue those tasks.
  * Adapting to act and respond to changing circumstances along the way. 



Your brain has three parts that work together to achieve its primary functions.

  1. The reptilian brain
  2. The limbic system, or the mammalian brain
  3. The neocortex 



Trauma alters the balance between these three parts, ramping up activity in some areas and weakening others. As we’ll see, trauma causes the more primitive parts of your brain to be overactive, while hindering the parts responsible for empathy, creativity, and abstract thought—which are critical to thriving in a community and in everyday life.

### The Reptilian Brain

The reptilian brain is the most primitive part of your brain and develops while you’re in the womb. It’s responsible for the things babies can do: breathe, eat, sleep, wake, cry, feel temperature, sense hunger, feel pain, urinate, and defecate.

**As basic as the primitive brain’s functions are, they can often be impacted by psychological issues such as trauma—resulting in sleep problems, loss of appetite, digestion issues, and sensitivities to touch and arousal.**

### The Limbic System

The next part of the brain that develops—mostly in the first six years of life—is the limbic system, also called the mammalian brain. This part of the brain houses emotions, watches for danger, detects joy or fear, decides what’s important for survival, and manages how you navigate complex social networks.

This area of the brain is largely shaped by your experiences. For example, **if most of your childhood experiences make you feel safe and loved, your brain will be conditioned to feel safe to play, explore, and cooperate. However, if you’re constantly scared and feel unwanted, your brain will operate in fear and feelings of abandonment,** and continue to operate this way into adulthood.

#### The Emotional Brain

The reptilian brain and the limbic system together comprise the emotional brain, which is responsible for your well-being. Your emotional brain looks out for danger and opportunity, alerting you with hormones that fire off physical sensations (e.g. when you feel your chest tighten in response to panic) to get you to react immediately.

**The emotional brain works quickly and fairly simply so that you can react as soon as possible in case of immediate threats** ; it interprets information in a general way, and may jump to conclusions based on the rough perception of threat. For instance, your emotional brain makes you jump back at the sight of a snake … before your rational brain realizes that it’s actually just a rope.

The emotional brain jump-starts your preprogrammed reactions, like the fight-or-flight response, which get your body in motion before you have time to think or plan. This can be a life-saving reflex when you need a quick reaction, but it can also cause issues when your emotional brain misjudges a threat—and **trauma alters the emotional brain’s ability to accurately and effectively perceive threats, so trauma survivors go through life constantly jumping in response to non-threats.**

### The Neocortex

The neocortex is your rational brain, and it’s the last area of the brain to develop, between the ages of 2 and 7. The neocortex is mostly made up of the frontal lobes, which manage language, abstract thought, imagination, creativity, empathy, and the ability to plan the future and reflect on the past.

The frontal lobes house mirror neurons, which allow you to pick up on other people’s actions, emotions, and intentions. On the plus side, mirror neurons give you the tools necessary for empathy. On the down side, they also make you sensitive to other people’s negativity and vulnerable to getting sucked into another person’s anger or depression; **trauma survivors almost always have issues with not feeling seen or considered by others—not receiving empathy—** so effective treatment must teach trauma sufferers to feel safe mirroring and being mirrored by others, while also resisting being overly vulnerable to other people’s negativity. (We’ll explore this more in later chapters.)

Trauma hinders many aspects of the neocortex, which is vital for healthy interpersonal relationships, long-term planning, and resilience (imagination makes hope possible).

### The Balance Between Your Emotional Brain and Rational Brain

As shown in the example of being afraid of a snake, only to realize that it’s a rope, the different parts of your brain must work together to help you successfully navigate the world.

As you go through your day, your thalamus is the part of your brain in the limbic system that takes all the sensory information—the sights, sounds, and smells around you—and puts it together into a fully-formed perception of what you’re experiencing. The thalamus filters information into what’s relevant and what’s not, making it vital for concentration and learning.

Under normal circumstances, the thalamus passes information to two places:

1\. The amygdala, in the emotional brain, which quickly determines whether the information qualifies as a threat. **Think of the amygdala as a smoke detector—it’s quick to react, but can sometimes confuse some burnt toast for a full-blown fire.**

As explained earlier, if the amygdala deems something to be a threat, it triggers the stress-hormone system and autonomic nervous system (ANS) to release stress hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline. This raises your heart rate, blood pressure, and rate of breathing to get your body ready for fight or flight.

2\. The frontal lobes (your rational brain)—specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)—where the information reaches your conscious awareness. **The MPFC acts as the watchtower, where logic can weigh in and let you know to calm down if that snake is, in fact, just a rope.**

It takes slightly longer (we’re talking milliseconds) for information to reach the MPFC, so your body will react first and think later. If the MPFC determines that there is, in fact, no real threat, it stops the stress hormones and preprogrammed response that the amygdala triggered.

During trauma the thalamus shuts down, which is why survivors remember traumatic events as fragmented sensations—which are triggered in flashbacks—instead of linear stories. After the event, the thalamus can’t effectively filter between important and irrelevant information, so trauma sufferers are constantly on sensory overload; to cope, they tend to try developing tunnel vision and block out the excess information, but in the process, they tend to also filter out pleasure and joy.

**Additionally, trauma sufferers don’t have a healthy balance between the amygdala, which can be hypersensitive and hyperreactive, and the MPFC, which can be too weak to temper the amygdala, so they easily go into panic mode for unnecessary reasons.** Aside from living in constant stress, and suffering the physical damage that results, this makes it difficult to maintain relationships with other people if you can’t effectively gauge whether their intentions are good or threatening.
