## Chapter 2: The Mental and Emotional Scars of Trauma

The effects of trauma are three-pronged: the mind (mental and emotional), the brain (brain wave frequencies and neurological reactions), and the body. First, we’ll explore how trauma impacts the mind.

### Isolation and Shame

**One of the lasting impacts of trauma is an inability to develop intimate relationships with others: After experiencing such suffering at the hands of another person, how can you trust anyone again?**

Additionally, how can anyone possibly understand how you feel, with the exception of other trauma survivors? These two questions cause many trauma survivors to be extremely isolated.

What’s more, many trauma survivors feel paralyzing shame about their own behavior during a traumatic episode. In some cases, the survivor may have lashed out in response to the trauma and subsequently feels shame about it; for instance, the day after Tom’s platoon was ambushed in Vietnam, he killed children and raped women in a nearby village in a vengeful rage. The shame of his actions later haunted him mercilessly.

In other cases, trauma survivors feel shame about their behavior—regardless of any rational reality of whether they could’ve acted any differently. This is often the case with children who submit to their abusers. **Many trauma survivors are even more haunted by shame at what they did or didn’t do during the traumatic event—** whether they were scared, dependent, enraged, or excited—**than by the atrocity of their abusers’ actions.**

### Flashbacks Alter Perception

One of the most assaulting symptoms of trauma is flashbacks, when survivors relive fragments of the traumatic experience. Flashbacks are even worse than the traumatic event itself, because **while the traumatic event had a definitive beginning, middle, and end, the flashbacks can come at any time and you never know how long they’ll last.**

Traumatic experiences are so overwhelming that the mind breaks them up into fragments of sights, sounds, sensations, emotions, and thoughts (we’ll discuss this more in a later section). Consequently, long after the trauma is over, seemingly ordinary things can trigger flashbacks—a particular smell, a word or phrase, a physical position, or an image that is somehow associated with the traumatic event.

**Ordinary stimuli suddenly take on a new meaning because they’re associated with the trauma, and are thus perceived as a threat.** You may look at a man walking down the street as simply that, but a rape survivor can see the same man and perceive him as a would-be attacker.

### Trauma Inhibits Imagination

Trauma inhibits the imagination in one of two ways: First, trauma can cause victims to superimpose images of their trauma on neutral stimuli.

For example, in a study of trauma survivors, 21 veterans took a Rorschach test. Also known as the ink blot test, subjects look at a nondescript ink blot and describe what they see in it, as if they’re finding animals and other images in the shapes of clouds. Rorschach tests indicate how you create a mental image and association from meaningless stimuli.

About three-quarters of the veterans saw gory and brutal wartime images in the ink blots—like disemboweled or decapitated comrades and fatally burned children—whereas non-traumatized people typically see benign things like butterflies or people. **Seeing traumatic images in ordinary things makes it difficult or impossible to accurately interpret day-to-day situations.**

Second, trauma can cause victims to basically freeze or suppress their imaginations. For example, the other veterans saw absolutely nothing in the ink blots, which was even more alarming to the researchers because it indicated that traumatized people can lose the ability to let their minds imagine.

**Both groups of veterans had stopped allowing their minds to create new meaning, either by replaying old traumatic images or by seeing blanks.** Imagination is vital to quality of life, because it allows you to envision the future, come up with new possibilities, and ultimately have hope.

### Emotional Numbness and Fixation

Flashbacks are so intense that trauma sufferers try to avoid them at all costs; they may compulsively go to the gym and push themselves to the brink as a distraction, take drugs or drink alcohol to dull the memories, or put themselves in dangerous situations so they can feel some sense of control over chaos.

But despite their efforts, trauma survivors can never escape flashbacks until they’ve healed from their trauma, and the more they experience flashbacks, the more they remain fixated and stuck in that event; **the more they’re stuck in the past, the less able they are able to experience the present, and they tend to go through life feeling numb and simply going through the motions.**

As a result, trauma survivors often feel more alive and engaged when they are describing or somehow reenacting their trauma—as in when veterans share combat stories, or when abuse survivors end up in similarly abusive relationships.

Freud called this “the compulsion to repeat.” He believed that trauma survivors engage in these reenactments in an unconscious attempt to gain control over a situation that haunts them, in (unconscious) hopes of eventually reaching a resolution. However, there is no evidence to back up Freud’s theory, and in fact, **repetition—even in therapy—leads to pain, self-hatred, and continued fixation on the trauma.**

#### Addiction to Trauma

Your body can adapt to and become dependent upon all different kinds of stimuli—whether it’s immediately pleasurable, like a recreational drug, or something that’s initially uncomfortable or scary, like marathon running or parachute jumping. When the body adapts it establishes a new chemical balance.

When that substance or experience is not available, your body becomes chemically imbalanced and you feel the pain of withdrawal. **Over time, people become more motivated by the avoidance of withdrawal rather than the pleasure of the experience itself.**

University of Pennsylvania researcher Richard Solomon theorizes that people can become addicted to endorphins, the chemicals secreted in your brain in times of stress (e.g. during traumatic events). This could explain why **trauma survivors seek out stressful situations: It relieves the anxiety and boredom—essentially withdrawal from the stress—they feel in day-to-day life.**

### Learned Helplessness

There are two ways people respond to a traumatic event: with effective action or immobilization.

Effective action involves two aspects:

  1. The ability to take an active role in trying to escape the trauma. 
  2. Reaching the end of the traumatic experience and getting the opportunity to calm down in a safe place, allowing your brain to make sense of the event.



Immobilization, on the other hand, is the inability to escape, protect yourself, or process the event—whether you are physically held down during abuse, stuck in a car during an accident, or in a war zone with nowhere to escape the violence. People who are immobilized remain stuck in a state of shock and helplessness, and they’re unable to move on after the event.

**After suffering inescapable trauma, many trauma survivors develop learned helplessness—a feeling of chronic helplessness—and give up trying to escape or improve their circumstances in any situation**. They remain immobilized. Trauma has curbed their fight-or-flight instinct, and instead of risking the unknown, they remain in the familiar fear.

An experiment by Steven Maier of the University of Colorado and Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania showed this effect in dogs: The researchers administered electric shocks to dogs who were stuck in locked cages. Then they opened the cages and administered more shocks to these dogs, as well as to a control group of dogs who hadn’t been shocked previously. The dogs who hadn’t been locked in cages ran away as soon as they were shocked, but the dogs who had been trapped made no effort to escape—they simply lay there, afraid and defecating.

The traumatized dogs also had abnormally high levels of stress hormones. Again, there is a parallel with trauma survivors; **when traumatized people face a perceived threat, their stress hormones spike disproportionately and take more time to return to a baseline level long after the threat has passed.** Even among trauma survivors who don’t consciously or outwardly react to a perceived threat, their bodies still react by sounding the alarm to release stress hormones—and elevated stress levels cause people to suffer attention and memory problems, agitation, and sleep issues, and leads to long-term health problems.

Maier and Seligman found that **the only way to reverse the effect for the dogs was to repeatedly drag them out of their cages to give them the physical experience of escaping the shocks**. This experiment begs the question: Do traumatized people need a physical experience to overcome their trauma and give them a feeling of control? We’ll explore that in later chapters.
