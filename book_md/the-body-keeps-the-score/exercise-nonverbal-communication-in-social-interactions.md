## Exercise: Nonverbal Communication in Social Interactions

As a baby, your interactions with your caregivers help you develop the ability to read people’s moods and emotions through their nonverbal cues, including body posture, tone of voice, and eye contact. Your ability to do this is critical in social interactions throughout your life.

* * *

Think of a recent conversation you had with someone who you knew was upset simply by reading their body language. What could you discern through their facial expressions, tone of voice, posture, and other nonverbal clues?

How did you feel before that conversation compared to after the conversation? How did your perception of the other person’s mood impact your own mood?

Think of how you use this skill of intuition in group settings, such as a family dinner or work meeting. Describe a situation when a group’s effectiveness or difficulty reading each other’s emotions impacted the group’s ability to communicate, work together, or accomplish a task.

Just as trauma causes victims to view others as threatening and struggle to make eye contact, describe a couple ways that your own experiences impact the way you interact with others. (e.g. Perhaps you assume people are upset when they’re in a quiet mood because you’ve had a close relationship with someone who shut down or went silent when they were angry.)
