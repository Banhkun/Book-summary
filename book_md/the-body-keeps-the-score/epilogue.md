## Epilogue: Invest in Prevention

Awareness of trauma and its effects is steadily increasing, as more research is published and more treatments become available. However, there is much room for change in the way our society addresses and prevents trauma.

**Unemployment, poverty, struggling schools, inadequate housing, social isolation, and relatively easy access to firearms all create fertile grounds for trauma—** and still, we see cuts to food stamps, opposition to universal healthcare and stricter gun laws, high rates of incarceration, and an overdependence on medications.

Schools are a natural place to make improvements in order to help address and prevent the next generation of trauma. The author recommends several changes that can help children who are exposed to trauma at home and in their communities.

  * Don’t cut music and art classes, physical education, recess, dance, theater, and other creative outlets that are engaging and often therapeutic. 
  * Give everyone access to high-quality daycare and preschools that teach children the foundations of self-regulation, interpersonal relationships, persistence, and concentration. 
  * Give teachers and school employees training on how to recognize and work with traumatized students.
  * Instead of reprimanding or punishing students for outbursts, create a safe environment where they can calm down, explain what upset them, and explore possible solutions. 
  * Make emotional intelligence part of the curriculum: Teach students how to be self-aware, recognize and identify their emotions, communicate their thoughts and feelings to others, and read others’ emotions through body language.
