## Chapter 9: Medication Revolutionized Mental Disorders

Throughout history, available technology dictated the understanding and treatment of mental and emotional issues. Before the Enlightenment, mental illness and emotional issues were attributed to God, demons, sin, magic, and witchcraft. In the 19th Century, scientists began viewing behavior as a result of people’s adaptation to the complex world around them.

In the early 1950s, French scientists discovered a chemical compound that could make psychiatric patients less agitated and delusional. **This introduced the brain-disease model of viewing mental problems as “disorders” that could be treated with drugs to adjust brain chemistry.**

The brain-disease model and growth of pharmacology changed the field of psychiatry in several ways.

  * Mental problems were not approached as a nebulous issue in the emotional mind, but as a measurable abnormality in brain chemicals that could be corrected with drugs. 
  * Doctors had another tool besides talk therapy. 
  * Drug sales created income for doctors and profits for pharmaceutical companies. 
  * Grants from pharmaceutical companies funded studies and laboratories. 



However, **the availability of drugs has become a substitution for therapy in many instances, and has allowed patients to treat their symptoms without addressing the root problems.** Reliance on medication also prevents patients from feeling empowered in their own healing, and instead places the power in the hands of the prescribing doctors and insurance companies.

Pharmacology has become the mainstream form of psychiatric medicine. The profitability of medications deters medical journals from publishing studies on non-drug treatments for mental health issues, and many such studies struggle to get funding in the first place. As a result, many patients never consider or get the chance to explore other means of healing.

### Shortcomings of the Brain-Disease Model

The brain-disease model behind pharmacology ignores four fundamental truths.

  1. Reconnecting with people and communities is vital to healing. 
  2. Communication gives patients the power to change themselves by talking about their experiences and finding common meaning with others. 
  3. People have power over their physiology through activities such as breathing and moving. 
  4. People can change their social conditions to create safe spaces where they can thrive. 



Ignoring these truths means depriving people of the power to heal themselves and regain control over their minds, bodies, and experiences. **Reliance on pharmacology makes people patients, at the hands of someone else’s power to heal them, instead of participants in their own healing process, which connects them with their sense of self.**

### Medications Used to Treat Trauma Survivors

Medications are widely used to treat symptoms of trauma, which can make it easier to control your emotions and behavior. However, **drugs are most effective when incorporated with other forms of treatment because they can also dampen positive feelings and they don’t help you learn how to self-regulate.**

Each family of drugs has different pros and cons.

**Psychoactive drugs—** including LSD and MDMA (ecstasy)—have been used to tame patients’ emotional reactions in this process. MDMA raises your self-awareness while decreasing fear, defensiveness, and numbing; this combination made it a great fit for trauma patients. Several studies using MDMA to aid in trauma sufferers’ psychotherapy had positive short- and long-term results, but it must be used carefully and in tandem with therapy.

**Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)** —including Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor, and Paxil—make patients feel calmer and less overwhelmed, making life seem more manageable. These effects can help patients engage in therapy, but they can also go too far and make patients feel that their emotions are being blunted.

**Drugs that affect the autonomic nervous system** —such as propranolol and clonidine—block the effects of adrenaline, which fuels arousal and reactivity to stress, and helps reduce nightmares and insomnia. Since trauma survivors suffer from hyperarousal and high levels of stress hormones, this can help keep their rational brains engaged, rather than letting the emotional take over in response to trauma triggers; however, the author prefers patients use yoga and mindfulness to achieve these results.

**Benzodiazepines** —a type of tranquilizing drug that includes Klonopin, Valium, Ativan, and Xanax—calm you down and help quell worry, similar to alcohol. However, like alcohol, they also lower your inhibitions and may cause you to say things you wouldn’t say sober. Additionally, benzodiazepines are highly addictive, may impede patients’ ability to process their traumas, and can cause withdrawals that can worsen trauma symptoms.

**Anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers** —such as lithium and valproate—have some benefits, including easing hyperarousal. (Shortform note: The author doesn’t elaborate on the effects of this class of drug beyond this.)

**Second-generation antipsychotic drugs** —including Risperdal, Abilify, and Seroquel—block the dopamine system, which is responsible for arousal as well as motivation and rewards; while this can calm intense fear and anger, they also blunt your ability to feel pleasure. Furthermore, these drugs can cause weight gain, raise your risk of diabetes, and make you physically inert.
