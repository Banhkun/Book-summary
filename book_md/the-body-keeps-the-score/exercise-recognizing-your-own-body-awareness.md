## Exercise: Recognizing Your Own Body Awareness

Recognizing the physical sensations in your body—as basic as feeling cold or hungry—is at the core of your sense of self, but for most people it’s so natural that you probably don’t even think about it. Use this exercise to notice your body awareness.

* * *

Take a moment and focus on your body. Write all the sensations you notice—the feel of the chair against your back, your empty stomach growling, the smell of the room, the tension in your shoulders.

Notice your current emotional state. How are your physical sensations affecting your emotions?

Now let’s look at the reverse: Describe a recent instance when you noticed a physical sensation (e.g. tense muscles, headache, clenched jaw) that clued you into your emotional state.
