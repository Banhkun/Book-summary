## Chapter 3: Your Brain on Trauma: Flashbacks and Memories

The advent of brain-imaging technology in the early 1990s gave scientists new insight into the way brains process information, memories, sensations, and emotions. With these tools, researchers learned that trauma leaves an imprint on the mind, brain, and body that has long-term effects on how you survive in the present. **Trauma not only changes how and what you think but also your _capacity_ to think. **

### Flashbacks Alter Brain Functions

In the face of trauma, part of your brain shuts down and causes you to lose your ability to articulate your feelings, your sense of time, your ability to make sense of your body’s sensations, and your ability to store that information. The emotional brain takes over, kicking up your emotional arousal, physiological reaction, and muscle activity. All this causes the trauma to be stored as fragments of sensory information—sounds, smells, sensations, and images—instead of a coherent narrative. This is the basis for flashbacks.

In one study, eight trauma survivors recreated scenes of their traumas—essentially triggering flashbacks—as they had their brains scanned to see the reactions. The researchers found that participants’ amygdalas (the cluster of brain cells that interprets sounds, images, and sensations to distinguish threats) activated in response to the flashback as if the danger was present in that moment; **no matter how many years have passed since the traumatic event actually occurred, trauma survivors’ brains continue to function as if they face a constant threat of danger.**

The amygdala rings the alarm of impending danger, and the body releases stress hormones and nerve impulses that make blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen intake rise in preparation for fight or flight. Trauma survivors are in a constant state of arousal and fight-or-flight, which causes physical issues and hampers their ability to function emotionally and socially.

#### Flashbacks Inhibit Speech

During the brain scan experiment, the researchers also found that **flashbacks cause the brain’s speech control center to go offline.** The brain’s response to flashbacks is similar to its response to a traumatic event, and as we’ll learn later, parts of the brain that coordinate speech and other social functions freeze during trauma in order to put more energy toward functions necessary for survival (e.g. fight or flight).

This part of the brain is called Broca’s area, and it’s key to articulating thoughts and feelings (Broca’s area is often affected in stroke victims). Additionally, trauma survivors’ difficulty with speech lasts beyond the confines of a flashback: Years after a traumatic event, survivors struggle to express what happened.

With time, most develop what the author calls a “cover story,” an outline of the basic events, but these cover stories fail to capture the depth of the experience.

#### Flashbacks Trigger Intense Emotions While Debilitating Logic

While speech is inhibited during flashbacks, another part of the brain called Brodmann’s area 19 was activated in participants’ brains during the flashbacks.

Under normal circumstances, Brodmann’s area 19 processes images as you see them in the world around you, immediately sending them to other areas of the brain to interpret the images’ meanings. However, in trauma survivors, Brodmann’s area 19 lights up during flashbacks, meaning that the brain responds to flashbacks as if the traumatic event is occurring in reality, not just in memory. As with the amygdala’s response, this indicates that **trauma survivors experience flashbacks as intensely as the actual traumatic event**.

In addition, the flashbacks activated the right hemisphere of participants’ brains while deactivating the left. As they pertain to memories, the right and left hemispheres of the brain operate very differently.

  * The right hemisphere is responsible for sensory memories, including sound, touch, and smell, as well as the emotions associated with them. 
  * The left hemisphere recalls facts and manages the language we use to put memories into words. Broca’s area is in the left hemisphere.



Activating the right hemisphere and shutting off the left means trauma survivors can’t put their feelings (right side) into words (left side). When the two hemispheres are disconnected, people can’t process experiences, grasp cause and effect, understand long-term consequences, or make plans for the future.

When a flashback is triggered, the right brain acts as if the traumatic event is occurring in the present, and the left is unable to provide the logic that it’s merely a reenactment of the past. **This leaves trauma survivors unable to process their traumatic experience and integrate it into the timeline of their lives, which is why the events feel ever-present—they can’t effectively put them into the past.**

### Traumatic Memories vs. Ordinary Memories

Just as the brain processes traumatic events differently than ordinary experiences, it stores the memories of those events differently as well. Traumatic memories and ordinary memories differ in several ways.

First, because traumatic memories don’t get integrated into your life timeline, they remain essentially frozen in time. This causes people to remember trauma much more accurately than regular memories; for example, one study found that WWII soldiers with PTSD had nearly perfect memories of their wartime traumas more than four decades later.

Second, events that cause a negative reaction such as stress, fear, or dislike—triggering the body to release adrenaline—are preserved best in your memory. **Up to a point, the more adrenaline your body secretes, the better you remember the event** (even if you don’t remember all the details, you’ll vividly recall how it made you feel). However, if the experience is overwhelmingly terrifying and inescapable, your body shuts down in response. This can lead to repressed memories, which we’ll discuss in the next section.

Third, traumatic memories are disorganized; they aren’t processed as a coherent narrative, with a beginning, middle, and end. Traumatic memories return in sensory fragments and, consequently, cause people to have physical reactions to traumatic memories.

Often traumatized people initially can’t bring themselves to talk to anyone about the event. Most experience flashbacks and, over time, are able to make some sense out of the spurts of sensory memories. Eventually, many survivors develop a so-called “cover story” that they can relay to others, which gets across the main facts of the story but doesn’t capture the intensity of the experience and leaves out enough detail to avoid triggering a flashback.

Talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy take the view that when survivors tell the story of their traumas, it eventually desensitizes them to the trauma. However, the author’s research disputes the fact that merely talking about the event is enough to lessen the severity of flashbacks, stress, and other post-traumatic symptoms. As we’ll learn later, trauma survivors need to learn to cope with the overwhelming emotions their memories bring and ultimately have to integrate the traumatic event into the timeline of their life in order to move past it.

#### Traumatic Memory Loss

When a traumatic experience is so terrifying that the victim shut down, she may not remember the event at all until a sensation associated with the trauma triggers memory fragments or flashbacks.

Despite some controversy around the validity of repressed memories—especially in legal cases, including some against priests accused of sexual abuse—memory loss has been well documented among traumatized people who’ve been through natural disasters, accidents, war, concentration camps, kidnapping, torture, and abuse. It’s most common in childhood sexual abuse survivors, and it tends to be more severe if the abuse happened at a younger age and by someone the child knew.

**As long as memories are inaccessible, they remain well preserved, but the more you retrieve and retell a memory, the more it gets altered.** This is because your mind is programmed to make meaning out of things, so it shapes accessible memories to make sense according to your experiences.
