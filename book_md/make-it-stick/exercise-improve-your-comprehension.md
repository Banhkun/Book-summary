## Exercise: Improve Your Comprehension

Use this exercise to practice identifying rules and build structures.

* * *

What was the last article or nonfiction book (or summary) you read?

What was the main takeaway of the text?

Consider whether your takeaway could apply in a completely different context. If not, how could you boil it down to a more fundamental rule?

Describe an experience you had—before or since that experience—in which that rule could apply.
