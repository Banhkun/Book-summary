## Exercise: Maximize Your Intelligence

What’s important isn’t just what you know—it’s how you use it.

* * *

Think of a challenge you faced recently, and how you navigated it. Did your actions exhibit a growth mindset or a fixed mindset?

Think of a skill you’re trying to master. How can you alter your approach or schedule to make your practice more deliberate, which entails being solitary, goal-oriented, and pushing past your current ability?

What strategies do you normally use to remember things?
