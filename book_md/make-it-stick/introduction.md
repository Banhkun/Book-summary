## Introduction

Learning is a lifelong process of building knowledge, experiences, and skills, and then storing them in your memory to apply to problems you encounter. But as natural as it may seem, **you have to learn _how_ to learn.**

Most people hold false beliefs about learning that lead students to study ineffectively and teachers to teach ineffectively. These methods include:

  * Rereading a text multiple times 
  * Drilling the same skill over and over
  * Presenting information in an easily digestible way
  * Designing lessons that match students’ learning styles



**The most effective strategies for deep comprehension and long-term retention are actually counterintuitive to the logic behind the most common methods.** That’s why this book teaches you how to learn and study based on data about how your brain comprehends and retains information.

The book’s principles and prescriptions draw from a vast number of research studies. Two of the authors, cognitive scientists Henry Roediger and Mark McDaniel, collaborated with other researchers on a 10-year study about how to apply cognitive psychology to improve learning practices, and a number of their findings are included in the book.

We’ll explore principles and strategies to become a more effective learner. The principles include:

  1. When learning is hard, it sticks with you. 
  2. Making and learning from mistakes are necessary aspects of the learning process. 
  3. You’re not a good judge of how well you’re absorbing a lesson, or how well you know something you learned previously. 
  4. Students don’t learn any better when the lesson matches their preferred learning styles.
  5. Your intelligence is not predetermined. 



The strategies you’ll learn include:

  1. **Creating Mental Models** : Group interrelated concepts or skills into one fluid skillset
  2. **Retrieval Practice** : Recalling information from memory
  3. **Generative Learning** : Trying to solve a problem before you’re given the solution, even if you do it wrong 
  4. **Spaced Practice** : Spacing out your study and practice sessions
  5. **Interleaving** :**** Mixing your studying among multiple related subjects 
  6. **Varied Practice** : Practicing a skill in different contexts
