## Exercise: How Do You Learn?

What are you doing right—and wrong—when you learn and study a new skill?

* * *

Imagine you’re in class and the teacher assigns a chapter of reading. How do you approach that text to maximize your learning? (For instance, do you read the text multiple times? Attempt to memorize key facts?)

The next day, the teacher lectures on the material from the chapter. What do you do? (For example, do you write down every word? Simply listen and absorb the information?)

Describe a situation when you diligently performed your go-to study methods and still fell short on the test.

To what did you attribute that underperformance?
