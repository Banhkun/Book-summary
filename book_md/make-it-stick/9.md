## 9: Put These Strategies Into Practice

Now that you understand the principles of effective learning, let’s look at how to apply them to your life.

### Suggestions For Learners

Think of your intelligence as a work in progress and remember that you’re constantly learning.

Take an active approach to your learning. Reading this summary is a good first step. Follow up with these strategies:

  * Pause regularly to ask yourself questions about the material you’re learning. These questions may include: 
    * What are the main concepts? 
    * How would I explain these to someone else?
    * What concepts and information am I encountering for the first time?
    * What connections can I draw to my existing knowledge?
  * **Think of a metaphor or image that demonstrates the principle you’re learning** (for example, thinking of how the movement of a bowling ball illustrates a law of physics). 
  * Engage with your reading by anticipating what the main concepts will be and trying to define them before you’ve found the definition in the text. As you read, see if you were right. 
  * Similarly, **try to solve math and science problems before you learn the formula**. Once you learn the formula, go back and see how close you were. 
  * As you study, create questions to quiz yourself later. 
  * Schedule time to regularly spend a few minutes quizzing yourself on new and past material, interleaving multiple subjects. Check your answers and review the topics of the questions you get wrong. 



To get the most out of a conference or professional development training, use these strategies:

  * Using a copy of the schedule or presentation materials, test yourself about the main concepts. 
  * Schedule monthly emails to yourself with questions about the material to continue regular self-testing.



### Suggestions for Teachers

Teachers play an important role in teaching their students how to learn and designing instruction that incorporates effective learning and studying strategies.

First, help your students understand the principles of effective learning, including:

  * Desirable difficulties are important for deep understanding and long-term retention
  * The only way to achieve mastery is to consistently reach beyond your current ability level
  * Failures are not only inevitable but also provide invaluable learning opportunities



Second, incorporate desirable difficulties in your teaching by:

  * Using the principles of spacing, interleaving, and variation in the way you present information
  * **Giving frequent, low-stakes quizzes and being transparent about the quiz schedule**. Students generally react and perform better when they know when to expect quizzes, and the anticipation doesn’t reduce the quizzes’ effectiveness. 
  * Incorporating past lessons and material in quizzes and exercises
  * Providing study aids that use retrieval practice, elaboration, and generation—such as practice tests, reflection writing exercises, short answer retrieval exercises, and problems assigned before a lesson is reviewed in class
  * **Explaining the methods to students, and acknowledging the initial frustrations that these can cause to prevent students from getting discouraged and distrusting the strategies**



Additionally, consider using some of these strategies to integrate the principles of effective learning:

  * **Bloom’s Taxonomy Answer Keys** : For each test, create an answer key that includes multiple answers for every question—an answer for each level of Bloom’s taxonomy of learning. Bloom’s taxonomy describes the different levels of comprehension: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, creating (creating may not be relevant for many test questions). When students get their tests back, provide the answer key and ask them to consider at what level they answered each question and how they can reach a higher level. For example, did they merely recall the three branches of government (remember)? Did they explain how the branches interact through checks and balances (understand)? Did they illustrate how the three branches work to pass a piece of legislation (apply)?
  * **Free Recall** : At the end of class, students spend 10 minutes writing everything they remember from the day’s lessons. Even if they feel stuck after just a couple minutes, they must spend the entire 10 minutes trying to recall anything they can. After 10 minutes, they revisit their notes from the day, check that what they’ve recalled is correct, and—most importantly—see what they’ve forgotten. Then they know they must study the information they forgot. 
  * **High-Structure Class Design** : Create a high-structure class, which includes daily and weekly retrieval exercises that are low-stakes but still count toward students’ grades. 
  * **Learning Paragraphs** : At the end of the week, students write a paragraph answering a question that reflects on something from that week—it may be about a main concept from the material, or how the student would improve her performance on the next test. 
  * **Role Playing** : For practice skills, have students role play, which allows them to use generative learning, get feedback, and reflect on how they could improve their approach. 
  * **Small Groups** : Students work in small groups during class to answer a high-level conceptual question the teacher poses. After a while, one student from each group explains her group’s answer to the rest of the class, and the class critiques the group’s conclusions. 
  * **Summary Sheets** : At the start of each week, students turn in a summary sheet of the previous week’s lessons, preferably through illustrations (if the subject allows) with notations pointing out key concepts. 
  * **Testing Groups** : Replace study groups with testing groups. Without referring to their textbooks, students gather in groups to discuss questions they’re struggling with and collaborate to find the answers. Each student typically knows different aspects of the answer, and together they can piece together the entire concept.
