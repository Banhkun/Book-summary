## Exercise: Become More Emotionally Intelligent in Social Interactions

Understand yourself better to have stronger social interactions and experiment with some of the authors’ tactics to improve the quality of your interactions.

* * *

Think about a recent interpersonal interaction that you felt didn’t go well. Describe in detail what about the interaction was unsuccessful: Perhaps the other person didn’t react to some news in the way you expected, or maybe you found yourself raising your voice in anger.

Now reflect on why you personally had that particular interpretation of the interaction. Think about who you are, how you see the world, and how you were brought up to answer the question: What about me led to the outcome or my perceived outcome of the interaction? For example, if you were expecting your friend to be excited by a story you told about your dog, perhaps that’s because you tend to think people are interested in the same things as you. Or if you raised your voice, maybe that’s because you learned from your father that the only way to make yourself understood is to yell.

Now that you understand yourself a little better, note some different ways you can approach social situations that let you avoid another negative outcome. You might stay away from topics only you are avidly interested in and ask your friend for news from their life, instead. Or you might pause before raising your voice and ask yourself if there’s a more effective way to communicate.

Finally, consider some of the tactics the authors suggest to become more emotionally intelligent in all your interactions: being warm and vulnerable, teasing, giving others the benefit of the doubt, and seeing the positive side of others’ difficult qualities. Pick one tactic you’ll experiment with and write down when and how you’ll use it in an upcoming interaction.
