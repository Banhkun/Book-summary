## Part 2: The Simplicity of God’s Plan for You

When you become love, you acknowledge one very simple truth—we are all _with_ each other in God’s kingdom. That one word “with” is the key to everything. People often feel like fancy prayers or long monologues to God are required to reach him. They’re not. **God doesn’t care how dressed-up your language is; what He cares about is how much love you have in your heart and how you show it.**

God built a kingdom for all of us to live in, and his desire is for us to build kingdoms within His. Instead, many of us build castles out of the aspects of our lives. Your career, family, friends, and possessions make up the blueprints for your castle. Once you build it, others tell you what a great castle you have, but a castle is not a kingdom. Castles are isolated and protected to keep people out, whereas kingdoms are vast and open to everyone. Kingdoms are created when people come together.

Because kingdoms are open to all people, there will be some you don’t identify with or get. It’s how you treat those people that shows the strength of your faith and love. **God knows you won’t always know what to do or how to act, but He showers you with love anyway. You need to do the same for others.** You may not understand what others are doing all the time or where they’re coming from in their opinions, but you can still show them love. But you can’t show them love from a turret atop a castle. You must meet them with grace on the ground.

When you see someone trying to build a kingdom by engaging with different types of people, you know that person is becoming love. Their love shines down on everyone equally as respect and deference. They approach people with an open mind and seek to learn from them. Living like God means understanding that we are all _with_ each other, regardless of circumstances.

**Your only mission in life is to love the people in front of you. When there’s no agenda to your love, it takes on great power.** When you become love, you exhibit the embodiment of God and pull people into your kingdom. And within that kingdom built for everyone, you find heaven.

### Thirty Seconds of Love Is Better Than No Love at All

It’s easy to believe in Jesus and commit to following His example, but it’s much harder to actually live according to His example. A one-time proclamation of devotion to love like Jesus loves is ambitious and commendable, but sticking with it is often as ineffective as sticking to a New Year’s-resolution diet. You may do well for a few weeks or months, but eventually, you burn out. **Try loving people for 30 seconds at a time to make sticking to it manageable.**

When someone in front of you annoys you or makes you uncomfortable, commit to loving them for the next 30 seconds. When you reach 30 seconds, commit to loving them for 30 more seconds. Commit to living like Jesus for 30 seconds at a time so you are always present in your commitment.

You can use this tactic for all of Jesus's commandments. You might agree with all of them, but trying to obey them all every day without fail is hard. Your pride gets in the way, and you can be overwhelmed by all the ways you’re required to change and grow at once. These feelings will eventually combine into frustration and resentment, and you won’t feel like continuing. Instead, commit to growing and changing 30 seconds at a time.

#### Lessons From Two Miles High

Bob learned the significance of 30 seconds of focused commitment after he learned how to skydive. His son Adam was an avid skydiver and was doing solo dives on the weekends. Each weekend, Bob watched from the ground as his son free-fell the equivalent of twenty 100-story skyscrapers before deploying his parachute. Bob enjoyed watching his son, but he wanted to do more than observe. He wanted to be _with_ his son, so he took skydiving lessons.

When you’re hurtling through the sky at 140 mph, you have approximately 30 seconds to remember your training and deploy your parachute. You have to take the lessons the instructors have preached during your training and obey them faithfully. If you can do that, you’ll land softly on the ground. But if you can’t, things will go terribly awry.

Most of what Bob learned in skydiving class was what to do when things went wrong. He was told to look up after the parachute deploys to make sure all of the hundreds of strings attached were straight. If just one string was over the top of the parachute, the chute wouldn’t work properly. It would still billow and look good, but it wouldn’t catch the air in the right way, and you would land hard. If you notice a string out of place, you have to cut the entire parachute off and pull the emergency chute. Bob realized the correlation between this instruction and faith.

You’ve likely moved through life believing you’re following Jesus's example with a few strings over the top of your faith. Your actions looked good, but they weren’t helping you move through the world correctly, and you likely landed hard many times.

Cutting your adulterated faith away and starting over feels as daunting as cutting away a perfectly good parachute as you fall toward the ground. But Jesus wants you to become a new version of yourself, one that is love. **If there are aspects of your life impeding this ability, you need to cut all of them away and start renewed.** Do this each day to ensure you are becoming the best version of yourself and the most complete version of Jesus's love. It only takes 30 seconds to remember Jesus's lessons and follow them faithfully. If you can do this, you will always land the way you’re supposed to.

### Catch People When They Fall

One final lesson Bob took from skydiving was what happens when the worst-case scenario occurs—neither parachute works. When this happens, you have 45 seconds before you slam into the ground. It’s not the initial impact that will kill you. The initial impact is what breaks your bones, but your body bounces. The second time you hit the ground is what kills you, as your broken bones damage your organs.

This second hit is often what damages your life and those of others when you fail or mess up. **You’ve suffered hard falls before, whether in your personal life or your faith, but one mistake isn’t what ruins you or kills your faith.** It’s what happens after that matters. After you fall and bounce, if you aren’t caught, the second blow is the fatal one. Maybe the people you thought would catch you didn’t, so your mistakes become irreparable, and your life suffers immensely.

You become love by catching people on the bounce to keep them from the fatal blow. **When people mess up or fail in some way, don’t turn from them. Run to them, and reach out with love.** Go be _with_ them, not just near them. Your job is not to shame them or try to lecture them about how not to fall or fail. Your job is simply to be there with your arms open like God and trust that He has given you what you need to catch them.

### You Can’t Fake Your Way to Love

**You become love only when you stop pretending you have everything figured out.** We all fake it in life at one point or another. We believe we are who we want to be because we’ve declared it so and are good posers. And there’s no shame in posing. You likely aren’t doing it to harm anyone or mislead people. You probably truly believe you have changed and are where you’re supposed to be in life.

When you try to change your life, you make grand statements about what you will do. You repeat over and over again that you will start living in accordance with the word of God. You speak words of affirmation to bolster your success. You take the parts of you that aren’t in line with who you want to be and flip them so you can be someone new. You believe these actions are enough and move forward pretending to be something you’re not. It’s not your fault. You truly want to be that person, but you’re just not truly _there_ yet. And **when you’re not truly _there_ with your faith, you can’t become love because God isn’t fooled by your posing**.

An example of the detriments of this posing can be found in the Bible story of Ananias and Sapphira. The couple owned land and decided to sell it and give the money away to help the people in their community. They told everyone what they were doing over and over again, and when the time came, they sold the land and gave the money to a man named Peter. Peter asked if they’d given all the money, and Ananias confirmed that they had. But that wasn’t true. He’d kept a little of it for him and his wife. At that moment, Ananias and Sapphira dropped dead.

The lesson in this story isn’t to fear God’s wrath if you lie. The story doesn’t say why they dropped dead, but one could argue that God saw Ananias pretending to be someone he wasn’t and refused to let it happen. For Ananias’s part, he likely wasn’t trying to be shady. He and his wife probably really wanted to be the type of people who would give everything they had away to help others. And the amount of money they kept was probably small enough to not truly harm this intention. They’d carried that hope and stated their intentions enough that they may have actually believed they’d fulfilled their word. But they hadn’t, and they suffered for it.

**It’s easy to hope to be a better person and to extend that hope to the betterment of other’s lives, but hope is not the same as action.** When you rely on hope, you believe you’re actually becoming a better person without doing anything. But every time you pose as this person, your actions are inauthentic. You likely won’t be struck down by God, but you will continue to face challenges to truly becoming love because God knows who you are and that you’re not truly _with_ Him yet.

God will continue to present you with opportunities to drop the act and be real about who you are and what you do. He wants you to succeed in becoming the person He made you to be and finds joy in your honest attempts, even if you stumble at times. But you can’t truly become who you’re meant to be if you’re not honest about who currently are. **When you’re dishonest with yourself and God, you will never be able to reach the best version of yourself God has in store for you.** Stop pretending and acknowledge that you’re trying to become love and are still figuring it out. God will continue to provide everything you need to eventually get there.

### God Doesn’t Keep Score, and Neither Should You

When you become love, you stop collecting examples of the ways in which you’ve shown love. You realize that showing love is not a path to God’s good graces but a means to please God and serve him faithfully.**** But too often, people keep track of their good deeds. They mark a point on their scorecards to prove to Jesus that they’re living with grace, and they believe that a certain number of points will equate to receiving more love from Jesus. **Jesus's grace is not something to be won or purchased with points. Becoming love means you stop making love about you and make it about Jesus.**

Bob uses the example of a pizza parlor, ala Showbiz Pizza, where you can win tickets for playing games, to demonstrate this point. He and his children collected tickets for years, and when he went to turn them in, he was sure a great reward waited for them. Instead, when he turned in almost a thousand tickets, he received a pencil with no eraser. The tickets, which seemed so valuable, were actually worthless.

When you collect your good deeds as leverage for Jesus's love, you make your actions about nothing more than receiving validation. You are not confident in God’s love for you and seek to earn it by proving your love through various accomplishments. But God does not want a series of accomplishments, He wants you to become love in your hearts.

Boasting about your accomplishments is also not becoming love. You are, again, seeking external validation for how good you are, and this makes everything you do about you, not love for the sake of love. You don’t need to attach words like “ministry” or “charity” to your actions. Don’t attach any words to them. **See your behavior as an extension of the love God has blessed you with. Give your love to everyone without conditions and without making it about you.** God has created a world full of love, and your only task is to become the embodiment of that in the unique way He's granted you.

#### You Don’t Need a Stage to Do God’s Work

We tend to believe that we are only validated when others witness our behavior. We perform on the stage of life to audiences of those around us. When we do, we pay more attention to how big our stage is than how big our actions are. When you become love, you don’t need applause or validation for the things you do because you know just doing beautiful things is enough.

Additionally, sometimes you choose the wrong stage for important conversations or actions. **If you’re always searching for the perfect platform by which to express your faith, you will likely never find it.** The perfect platform is the world God made. It’s around you all the time.

You become love when you surround yourself with words and habits that exhibit love, forgiveness, benevolence, and generosity.**** You allow the communication of positivity to become a daily practice regardless of where you are or who’s around. And the more you practice communicating love, the more it becomes an inherent part of who you are. You don’t have to wait for a stage or a performance, you just live as love.

Humans are hardwired for memorization. With practice and repetition, you take in the details of certain behavior and create a sort of muscle memory for it. Living like Jesus is the same. **Each time you intentionally choose to live as love, you sketch that feeling and behavior into your mental fabric.** After a while, you don’t even realize you’re doing these things. You don’t have to worry about trying to remember how to be loving. Your muscle memory takes over, and your actions become automatic. When that happens, you’ve become love.

The great thing about stepping down from the stage and ceasing individual performances is that you stop feeling like a failure if you mess up. In front of an audience, the pressure to be perfect is high. If you screw up, you feel ashamed and embarrassed. But in God’s world, you can miss a step or play the wrong note, and no one will be the wiser. You don’t have to hang your head because the next moment and next day are open to try again. God doesn’t expect you to be perfect, and you shouldn’t either. He just wants you to move in the direction of becoming love, and only through practice and removing the pressure of perfection will you be able to allow for mistakes that help you grow and improve.

**When you understand that messing up and trying again is part of becoming love, you also find it easier to allow others the same freedom.** People will mess up or play the wrong note, but that doesn’t mean you can’t learn something from these people or their mistakes. Stay _with_ those people and give them space to try again. Become love by helping others if they need it, but don’t try to show them what to do. Being with others is enough to show them grace and help them experience the depth of your faith, which can help them see the depth of their own.
