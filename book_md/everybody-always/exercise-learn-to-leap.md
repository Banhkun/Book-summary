## Exercise: Learn to Leap

It’s not always possible to know how to make your desires a reality, and things don’t always go the way you want them to. But remembering to have faith can help you feel less afraid of taking chances.

* * *

What is one recent moment where something you expected to happen didn’t?

Describe your reaction. What emotions did you experience? What actions did you take?

Do you feel differently about that experience now than you did then? In what way?

What is something you want to do now but are scared of? Why are you scared?

What are some certainties that you can put your faith in to help you feel less afraid of taking this risk?
