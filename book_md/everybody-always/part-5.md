## Part 5: Living Like God

As you’ve learned, if you want to live a life that fulfills your purpose to God, you must love your enemies. Of all the ways God wants us to become love, you may find this one to be the most difficult. Your enemies are likely cruel and selfish. They may be arrogant or do terrible things to others. But **Jesus doesn’t turn his back on anyone. There is nothing you can do that will make Jesus stop loving you, and the same is true for your enemies.** God is the epitome of perfection, and part of that perfection is His continued love for hard-to-love people. Therefore, if you want to become love, you must strive for this same type of perfection.

You probably think the idea of being perfect is as far-fetched as pigs flying. No one is perfect, right? You might do your best to be nice to people and only say bad things behind their backs. You may have the ability to forgive people who’ve harmed you, at least superficially. You perform these actions because you think they make you a better person, but when your heart is not fully open and benevolent, you aren’t truly changing. If you can’t learn to love your enemies, you will always fall shy of becoming the best version of yourself. **The question you need to ask yourself is whether you simply believe in Jesus or desire to be like Jesus.** Perfection only comes when your love has no limits.

#### Courage in the Face of the Enemy

Bob finally got his day in court with a Ugandan witch doctor. A man named Kabi, the head of the witch doctors in that particular region, kidnapped an 8-year-old boy and mutilated him. He left the boy for dead, but the boy survived.

Bob thought he’d have to look for a long time for a judge willing to preside over a trial against a witch doctor, but he found one within a week. This judge knew the risks and had a certain amount of fear, but he wanted to see justice against a witch doctor for the first time. He knew being brave for the greater good was more important than being safe. He chose love over fear.

During the first-ever witch doctor trial, the young boy stood in the courtroom and pointed to Kabi as the man who tried to kill him. This may seem like a small thing, but Kabi was a walking ghost, and his eyes showed pure evil. He was scary to the adults in the room, but the boy, who had the most right to be afraid, acted courageously. The verdict of guilty came in, and news of the first imprisonment of a witch doctor spread through the nation.

There would be ripple effects. Others might see that it was possible to get justice for their children. More judges might be willing to preside over these types of cases. The wheels of justice were turning, and it was all due to an 8-year-old’s bravery.

Bob struggled with loving Kabi. Kabi was definitely his enemy and a terrible person, but simply writing him off in that way felt wrong. He knew Jesus wanted him to love Kabi, but that also felt wrong. Still, he saw that in trying to love Kabi, he would be getting closer to living like Jesus. He was afraid of those feelings, but he knew there was nothing to fear if he became love. And he decided if a small boy can be courageous enough to change his country, he could be brave enough to love his enemy.

### If You Let Him, God Will Blow Your Mind

You may not always understand the things that happen to you or that happen in the world, but understanding is not your purpose. You don’t have to have all the answers to see the power of God’s love. **If you stop seeking explanations and certainties and allow God’s love to work in your life, you will witness amazing miracles.** God uses the unthinkable to show you just how powerful His love is. And when you see this power at work, you will know that unthinkable things are possible for you when you become love.

Bob felt his faith and love grow bigger because of two ensuing unthinkable things that happened regarding the little boy in Uganda. One day, he received a phone call from a surgeon in Los Angeles named Randy. This man was one of a few specialized surgeons capable of performing miracles. He’d recently reattached a man’s severed hand and given the man full functioning again. Randy had heard about the Ugandan boy and wanted to help. Not only was he offering to help fix the boy’s mutilated body parts, he would do it for free.

Bob flew to Uganda and became the boy’s legal guardian. He took the boy from the Ugandan bush to the airport and watched the wonder in the boy’s eyes seeing his first airplane. During their layover in London, Bob received an email. Somehow, word of the boy’s situation had reached the White House, and President Obama wanted to meet him. Two days earlier, the boy had been in the bush. Now, he was the invited guest of the president of the United States.

When Bob and the boy arrived at the hospital in Los Angeles, Bob leaned down and whispered something in his ear before he was wheeled into surgery. He told the boy to be not afraid. Eight hours later, the boy was in the recovery room. The surgery had been a success.

Bob could never have expected this turn of events, but he understood that **God doesn’t just work in mysterious ways. He works in ways that blow our minds**. Bob took this demonstration of the extent of God’s power and decided that if he wanted to experience more of this greatness, he had to risk more of his faith.

#### An Unlikely Duo

A little while later, Bob was back in Uganda. He went to the prison where Kabi was living on death row and asked to visit him. This was the last place Bob ever expected to be, but he knew it was the only place he was supposed to be if he wanted to become love. When Kabi entered the room, he immediately said how sorry he was for what he’d done to the boy. He explained how he’d been raised by a witch doctor and had become consumed by his teachings. He knew he would never be free again, but he wanted forgiveness before he died.

Bob didn’t know if forgiveness was possible for this monster. But he felt an energy move through him that reminded him that Jesus accepted everyone, even those who’d done wrong. That day, Bob opened himself up and talked with Kabi about Jesus. He told Kabi what he was learning about becoming love and the role of forgiveness in that process. Kabi was interested in finding his own path under Jesus. He was having his “come to Jesus” moment, and in witnessing this transformation, Bob was too.

Bob continued to meet with Kabi. As they continued to talk, he saw that they were not so different after all. Yes, they were not the same type of person, but they struggled in similar ways trying to become the men they were meant to be. They decided to hold a sermon for the 3,000 prisoners on death row, and Kabi delivered it, albeit a rough version of Jesus's teachings.

After the sermon, men came forward to be washed of their sins. Kabi took a water bottle and baptized all of them while Bob watched. Bob understood that the men saw a miracle in front of them. They knew who Kabi was, and they knew that Bob had been the one to put Kabi away. To see the two men standing side by side was proof of God’s love, and they were moved to believe.

Bob was also affected by the scenario. If Kabi could make this massive change in his life, then anyone could, even him. He realized **the way we understand our faith and God’s teachings is not what’s important. Our understanding doesn’t have to be perfect for us to become perfect like God**. At the end of the afternoon at the prison, Kabi told Bob he forgave him. Bob was stunned both by the action and implication, but he was also in awe. Kabi realized that to be _with_ God, he had to love like God, which meant loving his enemies. Bob looked at him and no longer saw that monster. He saw someone becoming God by becoming love.

### Who Are You Becoming?

To continue your journey in becoming love, two important questions to ask yourself are, “Who am I becoming, and where do I want to go?” The answer you seek may or may not be an actual location, but the purpose of going to wherever you want to go should satisfy the answer to the first question—love. **When you get to where you want to go, the person you find there will be a version of you growing closer to God.**

Don’t limit your responses to places you believe you can get to easily. Really think about who you need to become to grow more in your faith. Even if the emotional state or physical location seems hard and impossible to arrive at, set your intention to get there. God is your tour guide on your journey to love, and when God is your guide, you know you can always trust the path He leads you down.

If it’s a difficult path, you might stumble along the way. Don’t worry about it. Focusing too much on where you step hinders your ability to see what’s happening around you. Commit to following God through the difficult terrain of your life without caution. If you stumble, you’ll fall into God. He will help you regain your balance and continue moving forward. The unsteady path is the only way to grow in your faith. If faith were like a scooter ride down a sidewalk, your journey would be quick and easy. You wouldn’t need to grow because there would be no obstacles to overcome.

You, like everyone else, likely believe that action equals progress, which is not wholly wrong. Approving of Jesus's message is not the same as living the way Jesus lived. But sometimes **becoming love means slowing down so you make sure you’re always following Jesus, not dragging Him behind you**. Be patient with the process and your progress. It doesn’t matter how fast you get there. Your growth in your faith does not have an endpoint. Your task is to continue to be led by God’s love and eventually be able to stumble less often.

You can also be a guide for others along their journeys. Ask the people around you where they want to go and who they want to become, and then help them get there. They don’t need to be reminded of their past problems of failings. They need you to show them a path full of hope and love and help them see how far they’ve come every now and then.

#### The Face of Justice in Uganda

The situation with the young boy and Kabi changed Bob’s world dramatically. He was now guardian of the boy and had taken him to hike Mount Kilimanjaro for his 10th birthday. It was a difficult trip, and the climb to the top was harsh and taxing. But Bob just kept following the path the guide led them up, and they eventually made it to the summit. The young boy didn’t quite make it to the top, but Bob pinned medals on him and told him how brave he was and how far he’d come.

In the bush, Bob also started meeting with the local witch doctors. Over time, he’s met with hundreds of them. He tells them what the consequences of their actions are now. If they continue to hurt children, they will go away for the rest of their lives. Then, when the scare tactic is over, he washes their feet. Bob hates feet, but he washes them for two reasons. **First, you must commit to helping your enemies, not just tolerating them, if you want to truly love them. Second, becoming love means making big changes in your own life.**

After performing the foot-washing ritual with these witch doctors, Bob asked them what they needed. They said they wanted to learn how to read and write. Shortly after, Bob started a school for the witch doctors. People who once hurt and killed children were now learning like children. Some people think he’s crazy for doing this, but he knows that you will often be thought crazy when you’re becoming love. The difference is that when you live _with_ God, you no longer care about anything but finding those who need your help and love.

The progress the witch doctors have made in the school is nothing short of remarkable. They graduate with their certificates and see the world in a different way because of the love and education they’ve received. One night, Bob received a call in San Diego from two of his witch doctor-alumni about a new witch doctor in town who’d kidnapped a child. They knew where he was and wondered if they should do something. Four hours later, they called back to say they’d rescued the child and taken him back home. Before, they were the ones kidnapping children. Now, they saw the world through the lens of love because they’d seen God’s love with their own eyes. **You never know how love is going to change people or yourself. You only find out after you commit to loving everybody always.**

### What Now?

**If you want to become love, you must let go of the person you’ve been up until now.** What bothers you in the world? Who have you been avoiding? What have you been doing to play it safe with people? Stop all that now and reach out to someone you’re afraid of or don’t understand. Call them or send them a message, and give them love.

This process won’t be easy. You will be humbled. You will be uncomfortable. You will receive backlash or pushback from the people you’re trying to love and others in your life. Acknowledge the difficulties and keep moving forward. Believe in your guide and be not afraid. You will grow beyond your wildest imagination and you will get closer to God.

Practice your love daily. Stop being a spectator and become a player. When you stop stumbling as much, look around you to see how far you’ve come. Show others how far they’ve come. Then, look at yourself and marvel at who you’ve become. You won’t see your old self anymore. All you’ll see is love.
