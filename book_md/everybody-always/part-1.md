## Part 1: Fulfill Your Purpose in Life by Loving Everyone Like Jesus Loves You

How do you know who you are as a person? What aspects of your life make up your identity? Maybe it’s your job, the people you surround yourself with, or a certificate or ID. But these things don’t encapsulate the true essence of you. **According to Jesus, your identity is based on your ability to love and how you show that love to others.** Love is not a thing you seek. It’s something you transform into. And if you only love the people who are easy to love, you’re not fully completing your transformation.

If you want to become love, you must learn to love difficult people, or those you don’t agree with or who make you uncomfortable. You must love everyone without judgment. That doesn’t mean you have to blindly trust and embrace everyone. God granted you the power to discern who brings goodness to your life and who brings toxicity. As part of your gifts from God, it’s okay to differentiate between the two types of people. But God also gave you the power to forgive, understand, and be benevolent. You can be discerning without being demeaning.

It’s not easy to love people you don’t like or are uncomfortable with. When you meet or interact with a difficult person, you likely put up walls to protect yourself. It’s a natural inclination, but it’s not the example Jesus set for you. Loving everyone is easy for Jesus, but you complicate it by believing that you will lose something if you show love to those you oppose, whether it’s security, higher ground, or pride. But to truly walk the path God set out for you, you must overcome your fear. **God’s path for you is designed to fill your heart with love and allow you to spread it like bees spread pollen**.

(Shortform note: Bob Goff organized _Everybody, Always_ into short chapters for each principle, but many of the chapters overlap in content. Therefore, we’ve organized the chapters into smaller sections within five thematic parts for coherency.)

### Find Yourself by Finding Jesus

You’re not likely to meet Jesus as Himself in the living world. But you interact with Jesus every day because Jesus is inside everyone. God made everyone in His image. **When you love only the people who are easy to love, you’re only acquainting yourself with part of Jesus.** If you want to know Jesus fully, love everyone always.

Jesus advised people to “love thy enemies.” The word “enemies” is not being used literally. You likely don’t have many true enemies, but you do know people who you disagree with or who live different lives than you, maybe even lifestyles you don’t believe in. Those are the people you should love because that is how you truly come to know who you are.

When you start to learn about who you are, you might be scared to look at your weaknesses or areas for growth. You may become lost for a minute as you try to piece yourself together. You don’t need to be ashamed if this happens to you. God isn’t judging you for taking the journey to discover who you are under His love. He doesn’t withhold his love because you’re questioning yours. **God knows who you are, and He wants you to discover it. He is with you along the journey and provides guidance for you to find the missing pieces.** He knows where the journey ends and wants you to get there so you can become the version of yourself He created you to be.

What stops most of us from taking that journey is our desire to feel confident and validated. We express this through our opinions, which we often force onto others. But you can’t change people by fighting with them, and being right is not the same as showing love. When your love becomes a bridge to close the gap between you and another, not only do you help those around you, but you also find yourself.

God gave you the gift of love because love is your main function. **You were made to love others, and it’s an ongoing occupation, not a momentary burst of character found when you decide to live like Jesus.** You must push past your comfort zone and reexamine what you believe love means. Love takes work, patience, and modesty, and these actions are harder to fulfill the more disagreeable you find someone. But you must give love to your fullest capacity to live your true life as Jesus intended. To become love, love people as Jesus loves you: unconditionally and always.

### Approach Life Like a Child

Faith is not an easy thing to maintain all the time, but you can simplify the process by approaching life like a child. Jesus told His disciples that they needed to become childlike to make it to the kingdom of God. He was not saying they should become childish. Rather, He meant they shouldn’t fear the unknown. Children are curious by nature and more open to discovering new things in the world than adults are. **When you approach your faith with the curiosity of a child, your fears will dissipate.**

Put your trust in God with childlike wonder, and you will be able to move forward with love when things become difficult. When you love instead of fear, you can handle the negative events in your life with grace and courage and accept them as part of the path God has set before you. These feelings will pass from you into others and infect them with a similar childlike faith.

#### The Power of Childlike Faith

Bob Goff uses the example of his relationship with his neighbor Carol to illustrate the power of childlike faith. He and his wife, Maria, were compulsive movers. They lived in six different houses the first 10 years after they were married. But they finally found a place they loved and could settle down in, and this house just happened to be across the street from their current home. When they started interviewing potential buyers for their old home, they were really interviewing potential neighbors.

After many interviews, Bob and his family decided to sell to Carol, a 50-something widow. Carol became like a member of Bob’s family. His kids often played with her and shared their accomplishments with her. Carol, in turn, fed them cookies and looked after them like they were her own.

Because Carol was alone, Bob had a habit of calling to check on her every week. On one of these calls, Carol told him she’d been diagnosed with cancer. Bob was sad and scared, and he could tell she felt the same. Without giving it a second thought, Bob left his home and returned a bit later with walkie-talkies. He gave one to Carol and kept the other for himself.

The walkie-talkies became their new and only form of communication. They felt like kids talking through two cans and a string from different tree houses. **They felt silly, which helped them feel childlike, and that feeling helped Carol feel less afraid.**

Carol’s cancer fight wasn’t easy, and she often ended up in the emergency room. On one occasion, she was taken in for emergency surgery. Bob snuck into the recovery ward with his walkie-talkies and asked the nurse to put one next to Carol’s bed. He slipped into the other bed in the room and pulled back the curtain. Then, he started calling her name over the walkie-talkie. It was a silly and bizarre thing to do in a hospital, but it made Carol laugh so hard, she cried. That laughter removed her fear and helped her keep her faith.

### See the Beauty in Your Neighbors

Love your neighbors like you love yourself. To show yourself love is to love God because you are the embodiment of God’s love, but so is everyone else. You can’t truly love God unless you love all of God, meaning each person who embodies Him.

**There is no secret code to solve the riddle of how to love others. Your mission is to find a way to love everyone without fear regardless of who they are.** That’s why Jesus asked you to love your neighbors first and foremost because when you learn to overcome the most difficult love hurdles first, your ability to love everyone else grows stronger.

Your neighbors are not merely the people who live next to you. Every person in the world is your neighbor, and you are theirs. They are the store clerk, the mayor, the homeless man on the corner, the mail person, the sexworker, and the local butcher. You have something in common with all of them—you are all part of God’s neighborhood.

It’s not possible to meet and know every living person, but it _is_ possible to love each person you come into contact with. You just have to do it. Start by viewing life as a place for joy, and love becomes the subsequent benefit. In a world full of joy, anger and pride take a backseat to love. In this world, you don’t have to try to control what others think or do, and you **stop seeing people as problems and start seeing them as opportunities to grow closer to God. You love people like God when you open yourself up to learning from them.**

#### The Power of Neighbors

Carol’s cancer battle raged on and weakened her body. After years of struggling and treatment, the doctor’s told Carol there was nothing more they could do. She was going to die. Bob sat with her in the hospital and reminisced about life. One of the memories they talked about was the annual New Year’s Day parade Bob and his family held in their neighborhood. They started the parade as a way to show their love and appreciation for the people around them. The first year, eight people attended. Twenty-two years later, more than 400 people participated in the short parade down their street.

Carol was too sick to walk the parade route the year before, so Bob had put her in the sidecar of his motorcycle and drove her up and down the street. Everyone knew what Carol was fighting and showered her with attention. She was the hit of the parade. That day in the hospital, Carol told Bob she was going to miss the parades. Bob prayed she would see at least one more.

Carol held on for one more year. When the morning of the parade came, she couldn’t get out of bed. Bob’s children carried her to her living room window to watch the parade pass by. When the parade reached her house, instead of walking by, the route turned onto her front lawn.

Nearly 500 people walked across the yard to the window to say goodbye. Some made funny faces, some bounced balloons off the glass, and some blew kisses. Carol cried and blew each of them kisses back. They were all neighbors that day. They showed Carol love, and she showed it back to them. When she died a few days later, she was wrapped in the spirit of God’s love delivered through her neighbors.

### Give People a Chance to Grow, Not a Chance to Fail

You like to make your own decisions. When someone tells you what to do, you may feel manipulated and resist them. But when someone tells you who you are, you likely try to live up to that image. The same is true for others. **Show people who they are, and they will be inspired to become those people.**

The problem when we try to direct others’ expectations for their lives is that the result is often inauthentic. For instance, if someone says you need to earn a college degree or have children or get a certain job, you might listen if you respect and love the person. You may even follow through, but your heart's not in it because the decision isn’t yours. You become merely a compliant actor, not an active participant in your life.

Your faith is a lot like your behavior. People will tell you what you should believe, how you should behave, or what you need to do in the name of God. They say you shouldn’t indulge in sinful behavior, watch certain films, or read certain books. They insist that you devote yourself to charitable acts and spread God’s word to everyone you see. They tell you to prove your faith in God by praying daily and showing sinners the way to salvation. But **if you follow others’ rules regarding your relationship with God, your faith is no longer real faith**.

Real faith is forever. False faith is temporary. Real faith acknowledges that God knows who you are and will provide situations and guidance to help you become that person. He did this many times in the Bible. God helped Moses see that he was a leader, and that’s what Moses became. He showed Noah that he was a sailor, and Noah became a sailor. God will help you find your path to become who you are, and when you commit to your faith and begin to live like God, you must do the same for others.**** You only need to point people in the right direction by telling them who they are, not how to become that person. **Give people faith by helping them see who they can be, and God will do the rest.**

#### Shame Removes Love

When people try to control your life, shame is a significant ensuing consequence. You feel shame when you don’t live up to others’ expectations, and that shame becomes a massive wrench in your ability to love.

Shame forces your words down and makes you turn away from people you love out of pride or embarrassment. You may fear their disappointment or wrath, so you run from them and lose the connection with them, maybe forever. You feel like you can’t communicate with that person anymore or that they no longer love you.

**You must not let shame keep you from people you love or from loving people.** You must seek out those people and recreate your rhythm with them. Everyone desires forgiveness and acceptance, and they may also feel ashamed about what’s transpired between you. If you communicate with people you’re in a difficult place with, you can celebrate your reunion, rather than despair in your downfall.

The easiest way to avoid shame is by living your life, not the life others set out for you. And the opposite is true. **Don’t create a situation for someone else to feel shame because they don’t do what you tell them to or think they ought to do.** Remember, becoming love means helping people find who they are, not controlling their behavior. This is how God loves and how He wants you to love in His name.

And you never need to feel shame with God. He shares His hopes with you and shows you how to fulfill them. He loves your heart, not your actions. If you feel disconnected from God or believe you have not lived up to His expectations, don’t run from God. Run toward Him and celebrate your union with Him. He will continue to guide you, even through your missteps, because He is love. And He does this so you will learn how to do the same for others.
