## Exercise: Learn to Fill Your Bucket

Itâ€™s so easy to get caught up in our own lives, we forget that our lives affect the lives of others. But if we commit to becoming love, we will learn how to fill our buckets to become positive people for those around us.

What would you say your two biggest character flaws are? What evidence supports this belief?

What would you suspect the people close to you would say about what your character flaws are? What makes you believe this?

What could you put in your bucket to help you become love in the world? Name two things.

What would your behavior look like if your bucket was filled with those things? How would that change the way you interact with others?
