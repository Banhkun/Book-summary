## Exercise: Get Over Your Shame

When we mess up or do something to hurt another, we often feel ashamed. This shame makes us vulnerable and afraid to face others, but to stay within a place of love, we must find a way to reach out to those we fear.

* * *

What was the last thing you did that made you feel ashamed? Did you hurt someone, act immorally, or screw up something important?

How did you handle the situation after you felt ashamed? How did this reaction affect your life and relationships?

What steps could you take to remove your shame or mend the damage done by your actions?

In what ways would addressing your shame and ensuing personal consequences help your life and relationships moving forward?
