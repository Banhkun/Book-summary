## Exercise: Find Love for Difficult People

We all have people in our lives who make us angry or who we simply don’t like for one reason or another. It’s too easy to turn away from what we don’t like, so how can we start to turn toward people instead?

* * *

Think of someone who you’ve recently disagreed with or found frustrating or annoying. What are your thoughts concerning this person, and why do you feel this way?

Do you feel this person is worthy of your love? Why or why not?

What changes can you make to your perspective today to help you be able to give love to that person?

What might giving love to this person look like in your life?
