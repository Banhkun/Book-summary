## Exercise: Give What You Have to Give

It’s not always easy to know how to help others, especially if we feel ill-equipped for the challenge. But we all have something to offer that can be useful to others.

* * *

What are some ways in which you’ve helped others experiencing hardships recently?

What are some other ways you might be of service to others who need help?

What would you like to do to help others but believe you’re unable to do? Why do you believe this?

Do you believe you have limitations that keep you from accomplishing your goals? What are they?

How can you view those limitations in a different way and still move forward toward your goals?
