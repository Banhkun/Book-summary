## 1-Page Summary

In _Behold a Pale Horse_ , US navy veteran and UFOlogist Milton William Cooper lays out his belief, based on his own research and the writings of other conspiracists, that **the world is secretly ruled by a shadowy organization known as the Illuminati.** The Illuminati plan to establish a dystopian, authoritarian government known as the New World Order sometime in the 21st century. The book’s content is split between exposing the organization’s influence in every major government or religious institution in the world, and the attempts by the US government to conceal the presence of hostile aliens on Earth.

Cooper’s claims are based primarily on secret files he claims to have seen while posted to the Office of Naval Intelligence in the early 1970s. He purportedly handled documents revealing treaties with the aliens, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by a Secret Serviceman, plans to suspend the Constitution and establish a police state, and more. He also describes having personally encountered UFOs during his service on submarines and in Vietnam.

(Shortform note: While Cooper did serve in the Navy for several years, earning two combat medals in Vietnam, there’s no evidence that he ever worked for Naval Intelligence. Many of his fellow conspiracists questioned his reliability over the years since Cooper regularly contradicted his own stories and some of the documents he claims to have seen in the early ’70s did not exist at that time.)

Cooper left the Navy in the early 1970s due to his increasing disillusionment with the US military and government. He attempted to leak some of what he’d discovered to the press but was attacked by two men in black who ran his motorcycle off the road, resulting in the loss of his leg. In the 1980s, he began to speak out through anonymous online forums and eventually became a lecturer at various UFO conferences around the country. Published in 1991, _Behold a Pale Horse_ compiled his arguments and other source documents in order to reach a wider audience.

(Shortform note: Cooper’s relationship with the UFO community was tumultuous. Though Cooper was enormously popular as a lecturer in the ’80s, several prominent UFOlogists, such as _UFO Magazine_ ’s Don Ecker, dismissed him as a fraud and a plagiarist. Even friends eventually expressed doubt in his stories of persecution and fear of his notorious temper. By the time of his death in 2001, Cooper was remembered as being an “inveterate liar” as much as a heroic rebel.)

In the book, Cooper warns that the Illuminati can only be defeated by Americans standing up to their tyranny through armed resistance. He considers it his duty to “wake up” as many people as possible to the problem, and the book repeatedly exhorts the reader to do their own research, educate others, and organize themselves into militias or anti-government movements, preparing for the day when they’ll need to defend themselves against the New World Order.

(Shortform note: _Behold a Pale Horse_ would be Cooper’s most influential work, alongside his 1991-2001 radio show _Hour of the Time_. Today, he’s remembered more for these projects and his time in the patriot militia movement than his time in the UFO circuit, in part because he eventually dismissed UFOlogy as a “hoax” perpetrated by the Illuminati. _Behold a Pale Horse_ sold hundreds of thousands of copies and is still in print (Cooper once claimed that it was the most shoplifted book in America), while _Hour of the Time_ went on to influence a generation of right-wing radio hosts, most notably Alex Jones.)

_Behold a Pale Horse_ is a mix of primary source documents and long-form essays by Cooper and other (mostly anonymous) conspiracists. This guide organizes his evidence into three core topics: **the New World Order** discusses the Illuminati’s secret plan for world domination; **the Alien Conspiracy** discusses how and why the American government has concealed the presence of aliens on Earth; and in **how to fight back** , Cooper calls on American patriots to lead a popular resistance movement against Illuminati and authoritarian forces for the survival of humanity.

Alongside these discussions, we’ll consider the historical context of Cooper’s theories, how they’ve been challenged by scholars and politicians, and their influence on American culture since the book’s publication.

### The New World Order

The book is primarily focused on what Cooper calls the New World Order (NWO) conspiracy. He writes that since the dawn of civilization, a secret organization of self-styled intellectual elites called **the Illuminati has worked from the shadows to manipulate economies, governments, and religions for their own gain**. The Illuminati has members in every significant economic, political, and religious organization in the modern world, and ultimately intends to use its vast power to establish a global totalitarian socialist state.

> **The Antisemitic Origins of the NWO**
> 
> While Cooper played a role in popularizing the NWO theory, the idea didn’t originate with him. The belief in an all-powerful, global organization secretly planning world domination via manipulating economies and governments dates back to the 18th century. However, early theorists characterized said organization as specifically Jewish, a “cabal” of “internationalist Jewish bankers” plotting to disenfranchise non-Jewish whites and ultimately carry out an anti-Christian genocide. Belief in this theory provided justification for antisemitic government policies, including Russian pogroms in the Pale of Settlement and the Holocaust.
> 
> While Cooper never names the Illuminati or the world’s elites as being specifically Jewish, he repeats these theories wholesale and regularly cites known antisemites of his time. In addition, the first edition of _Behold a Pale Horse_ reprinted “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” in its appendix. Cooper claimed that this infamously antisemitic document actually referred to the Priory of Sion, a fraternal organization and secret branch of the Illuminati, and had only been edited to implicate Jewish businessmen. However, this failed to curb antisemitism among his fans, and later editions simply removed the Protocols.

#### A Secret Society Narrative of History

Cooper claims that among the first civilizations, a few people sequestered themselves into their own secret society and resolved to use their superior intelligence to control and exploit others. Their goal was the pursuit of knowledge and wealth, and to establish themselves as kings or even gods.**Every significant upheaval in human history since—wars, epidemics, economic crashes, and so on—is the result of their machinations** , using wealth and threats to direct leaders where they didn’t simply install their members in seats of power.

(Shortform note: While belief in a global conspiracy like the NWO might seem terrifying, scholars suggest that these theories are actually a kind of self-soothing anxiety response for believers. If all of history is the result of an evil organization’s plans, that means that nothing is ever truly random—and thus, any future disaster can be predicted and prepared for. Even believing in an all-powerful enemy like the Illuminati can be comforting, in that it provides a tangible enemy to fight against rather than having to deal with the moral complexities of international politics.)

While the true name of this group is the Illuminati or “illuminated ones,” Cooper claims that a number of secret or legendary societies throughout history were just the Illuminati under a different name, including the Knights Templar and the Freemasons. Any affiliation of these organizations with a specific faith or government, such as the Knights of Malta’s affiliation with the Catholic Church, were fronts to conceal their relentless pursuit of power and wealth across religious and political lines.

> **The Real Illuminati**
> 
> The Illuminati did exist at one point, as a Bavarian secret society formed in 1776 by canon-law professor Adam Wieshaupt. Basing his group on the Freemasons and the Jesuits, Wieshaupt envisioned the Illuminati as a place of discussion and political organizing around the Enlightenment ideals of reason, natural law, and secular government. However, the Illuminati operated for only a few years before infighting and persecution by the Bavarian government led to its collapse in 1787.
> 
> Conspiracy theories about the Illuminati first emerged at the turn of the 19th century, when they were accused of orchestrating the French Revolution to weaken the Church and profit off the dissolution of the monarchy. Despite a lack of evidence, this theory remained popular into the 20th century, and the Illuminati have since been blamed for everything from the Russian Revolution to World War I to the anti-colonialist movements of the 1960s. Thanks to Cooper and other authors promoting the NWO conspiracy theory in the 1990s, fear of the Illuminati continues to crop up in 21st-century conspiracy circles.

The Illuminati survives in the modern day through a number of disparate branches. Cooper argues that any internationalist or globally minded organization—such as the United Nations—is an arm of the Illuminati. Any apparent rivalries between organizations or their elite members, be they politicians or businessmen, are just for show. When the New World Order is established, they will all join together as the rulers of the human race.

> **America First Versus Globalism**
> 
> Cooper’s suspicion of international organizations like the UN is linked to an old 20th-century debate between isolationism and internationalism. Isolationists argue that countries should concern themselves mainly with domestic affairs and avoid getting involved in international trade or foreign wars, which might compromise their interests. In contrast, internationalists argue that cooperation among nations—including punishing countries that violate UN directives—is necessary to create a safer and more just world.
> 
> In the United States, the isolationist movement first arose as opposition to US involvement in the World Wars. Today, most politicians favor internationalism, and criticism of “globalism” (the pejorative term for internationalism, and possibly an antisemitic dog-whistle) is largely limited to members of the far right.

#### Goals

When the Illuminati feel that the time is right to move—Cooper doesn’t give an exact timeline, though he suggests it will likely take place in the early 21st century—**they will dissolve all of the world’s governments and form the New World Order, a single, centralized and socialist body** led by a council of the politicians and businessmen who already control the Earth’s natural resources and armies. All private property will be seized and the masses will be electronically tagged and tracked before being forced into detention and slave labor. Physical force and mind control will be used to suppress resistance.

(Shortform note: Cooper repeatedly refers to the NWO government as “socialist,” but it’s not clear from his description how that term fits—seizure of property from the masses for the benefit of the elite is not the same as socialization of property, and the NWO doesn’t seem to have any of the other characteristics of a socialist government, such as a strong welfare system and collective ownership of businesses. Cooper may simply be using the term to invoke a comparison to the USSR, which many of his fellow conspiracists saw as the absolute worst example of what a state could be.)

According to Cooper, **the Illuminati believe that their takeover is necessary for the survival of humanity** , as well as for future economic prosperity and scientific advancement. Most of humanity is too weak and unintelligent to be allowed to govern themselves, and the NWO will prioritize the lives of the most gifted while exploiting the rest for resource extraction. The source documents Cooper refers to call this disposable population “cattle.”

(Shortform note: Though Cooper criticizes the Illuminati’s eugenicist position that some people are simply born better than others, he used similar language against his own radio audience, denigrating the “sheep” who refused to accept his message. He may even have been the origin of the phrase “wake up sheeple,” though it’s now used more as a joke at the expense of conspiracists than a genuine exhortation.)

#### Methods

Cooper names several core tactics the Illuminati will use to establish and maintain their power, namely reducing people’s self-sufficiency and increasing their dependence on the federal government, disarmament, and undermining the democratic process.

##### Economic Shocks and Dependency

According to Cooper, the global economy is a massive system of social engineering run by the Illuminati. **Recessions and economic booms are deliberately triggered at random intervals to destabilize people’s lives**. Having lost their job, savings, or property, people become more trusting of “big government” initiatives supposedly designed to ease their suffering, such as tax hikes or the seizure of assets from corporations. In fact, these initiatives increase the government’s power and force people’s participation in welfare programs, which Cooper claims are used for surveillance, along with tax records, the census, and electronic payment systems like credit.

(Shortform note: Opposition to the “big government” initiatives Cooper describes is common among libertarians and center-right American political groups, who argue that free enterprise can regulate itself through recessions and government interference can only hurt businesses. Many also oppose welfare, less because they share Cooper’s belief about surveillance than because they argue that welfare encourages a parasitic relationship between citizens and government—over time, this relationship weakens both parties, depriving the system of its resources and the people of their self-sufficiency.)

Though completely insulating yourself against Illuminati-engineered economic shocks is impossible, Cooper **advises withdrawing from these systems of government surveillance and stockpiling as much concrete wealth (mainly in the form of precious metals, like gold and silver) as possible**. Though he argues that cash is safer than credit, he also feels that cash in America has been significantly devalued by the elimination of the gold and silver standards in the 19th and 20th centuries. When the government has total power to determine the worth of a dollar, the average person’s wealth is not fixed, and their savings can be made worthless through government intervention.

(Shortform note: Cooper’s advice to stockpile gold and silver draws mainly from the survivalist or prepper movement. Preppers collect large amounts of canned food, weapons, farm equipment, and so on in preparation for an apocalyptic scenario (what this scenario looks like varies among members) that will wipe out modern society and render paper money useless. In the post-apocalypse, people will trade for what they need with food, tools, fuel, or services. While precious metals are less obviously useful, they’ve remained valuable throughout history for their beauty and can be used to construct electronics and other machinery.)

##### Psychological Warfare

Beyond economic shocks, Cooper believes that the Illuminati **manipulate people through pop culture and the news.** These popular narratives encourage people to trust the Illuminati-led federal government, while those like Cooper who refuse participation in the system (by, as he advises, not paying taxes or providing the government with records, or by running their communities without government oversight) are depicted as backward, violent, or extremist.

> **Ruby Ridge and the Waco Massacre**
> 
> Cooper gives examples of this kind of manipulation in _Behold a Pale Horse_ , but the quintessential case for him and the patriot militia movement as a whole would be the coverage of the assaults on Ruby Ridge in 1992 and Waco in 1993, in which the FBI led sieges against communities of political and religious extremists who were suspected of stockpiling weapons. Ruby Ridge resulted in three deaths, including a 14-year-old boy, and over 70 people died at Waco after their compound caught on fire.
> 
> Though the FBI’s handling of these crises was widely condemned, most news outlets also reported on evidence that the Weavers of Ruby Ridge had been white supremacists, and the Branch Davidian religious sect of Waco may have sexually abused children. In contrast, Cooper and fellow conservative radio host Alex Jones argued that the sieges were evidence of an overbearing, fascistic federal government unjustly persecuting people for their decision to live outside mainstream society. They dismissed claims that the majority of the Branch Davidians had killed themselves, and Cooper called the siege “the second [failed] American Revolution.”

Cooper warns that once the NWO is established, these subtle forms of manipulation will be replaced with more direct ones, like implanting mind-control devices in people’s brains or giving them chemical injections to reduce their emotions and ability to think clearly.

(Shortform note: This idea may sound outlandish, but the US government has experimented with mind control via chemical engineering in the past. Most famously, the CIA program MKUltra tested the use of psychoactive drugs like LSD to force prisoners to be compliant, truthful, and obedient. Subjects were often dosed without their knowledge, and the program resulted in several deaths. While mind-control devices are generally only seen in Hollywood science-fiction dystopias, Cooper’s fears persist in the public suspicion of new technology like cell phones or the Covid-19 vaccine.)

##### Disarmament

Cooper is a passionate defender of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees the right of citizens to carry guns. Cooper argues that its purpose is to provide citizens recourse against government tyranny, and that the Founders were both asserting their right to carry weapons against the British and preparing for the possibility of a just democratic revolution against their government in the future.

> **Interpreting the Right to Carry Guns**
> 
> The question of how to interpret the Second Amendment—the right to keep and bear arms—is controversial in American politics, particularly when it comes to debates over how to prevent mass shootings and other incidents of gun violence. When it comes to the Founders’ intent, many historians agree with Cooper’s explanation, arguing that some Founders feared that the American government would become authoritarian and fought to give the states and the general citizenry tools to defend themselves, be it through rhetoric or through violence.
> 
> On the other hand, those in favor of gun control argue that guns in the Founders’ time were far less deadly than they are today, and so the Second Amendment alone isn’t enough to guide modern gun policy. They suggest that gun control legislation that restricts access to certain guns, forbids carrying weapons in public places, and requires a criminal background check to own a gun could justifiably make the US more safe without undermining the Second Amendment or leaving citizens helpless in the face of an armed, tyrannical government.

**Any attempt to limit people’s access to guns is therefore an attempt to weaken popular power.** Cooper decries anti-gun and gun registration laws as inherently authoritarian and accuses the Illuminati of further using the media to demonize guns through extensive coverage of violent crime and mass shootings. He suggests that the Illuminati may even stage some of these incidents in order to drum up support for anti-gun legislation.

(Shortform note: While Cooper mentions the possibility of staged shootings only in passing, this theory would gain popularity in the 2010s through Alex Jones. On his radio show and website _Infowars_ , Jones repeatedly claimed that terrorist attacks and mass shootings were “false flag” events staged by the government in order to manipulate Americans into supporting gun control legislation. In 2022, several families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre successfully sued him for damages after he accused them of being “crisis actors.”)

##### Undermining Democracy

Cooper argues that in addition to attacking the Bill of Rights, the Illuminati are attempting to undermine the “checks and balances” system laid out in the Constitution by increasingly **empowering the Executive branch at the expense of the Legislative branch**. Most presidents have been members of the Illuminati, and Cooper condemns the use of executive orders and presidential vetoes to bypass Congressional votes.

(Shortform note: Confusingly, Cooper praises the Constitution and the Founders even as he argues that the US government is controlled by the Illuminati. This apparent contradiction, in which America is both an ideal and hopelessly corrupt, is sometimes seen in the patriot militia movement as well—but patriots typically explain it away by arguing that the system was once perfect and has only gradually been infiltrated by authoritarians who want to deprive Americans of their rights. Cooper simply ignores the inconsistency, which has led some critics to call his work “incoherent.”)

Cooper also points to the expansion of the National Security Council’s powers under Nixon and the 1986 Iran-Contra affair as evidence that the White House has repeatedly gotten away with carrying out military or diplomatic actions against the wishes of voters. If the president has the power to declare war or a state of emergency without oversight, Cooper warns, he may one day use that power to install the NWO.

Ultimately, Cooper claims that the Illuminati already have all the pieces in place to establish the NWO. They’re simply waiting for the right moment to act.

> **Curbing the White House’s Ability to Wage War**
> 
> The Iran-Contra scandal was a secret arms deal orchestrated by the Reagan presidency, in which the White House sold weapons to Iran and used the profits to finance the Contras, a right-wing rebel group in Nicaragua that opposed the country’s Marxist government. This action violated both the embargo on trade with Iran and several Congressional bills banning the government from dealing with the Contras. Fourteen members of the administration were criminally charged, but this didn’t include Reagan or Vice President George H. W. Bush.
> 
> Cooper’s argument—that the White House shouldn’t be able to carry out military or diplomatic actions without first getting approval from Congress—is largely supported by both political parties and was the basis for the 1973 War Powers Act, passed in reaction to the revelation that the Nixon administration had secretly and illegally bombed Cambodia throughout the Vietnam War. While virtually every president since Nixon has been accused of violating it, none has faced serious consequences.

### The Alien Conspiracy

Beyond the machinations of the Illuminati, Cooper claims that another conspiracy is operating just under the surface of American society: the presence of aliens on Earth, kept secret for decades. According to Cooper, an alien race first made contact with Earth in the early 1950s and has maintained a formal relationship with the US government since the ’60s. Alien spacecraft regularly land on Earth and abduct people to this day, and the government has hidden this from the public as a way of maintaining social control.

In fact, **the aliens and the government are colluding to exploit the general population of Earth for their own gain** , though Cooper offers several competing theories for which poses the greater threat.

#### Timeline of Earth-Alien Contact

Cooper claims that contact was first made in the early 1950s, when over a dozen alien spacecraft landed or crashed in the American Southwest over a 10-year period. **Advanced technology and alien bodies were secretly recovered, while public sightings of UFOs were dismissed** as hoaxes. Information about these encounters was tightly controlled, limited to only a few officials within the government. Those who objected, like Secretary of Defense James Forrestal or, later, President Kennedy, were removed or assassinated.

(Shortform note: James Forrestal’s death in 1949, apparently from suicide after a severe depressive episode, has been the subject of conspiracy theories for decades. Cooper’s theory is a variation on the popular claim that Forrestal “knew too much” about alien sightings, but it’s also been speculated that he was murdered by the KGB for his virulent anti-communism or by the CIA for threatening to publish his uncensored diaries, which may have contained information embarrassing to the Truman administration.)

A number of government organizations, including the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council were founded with the express purpose of addressing the potential alien threat, though they were disguised as being general security or foreign affairs organizations. The most significant of these was Majestic Twelve (MJ-12), created by President Eisenhower to be the primary investigative force and go-between for the US government and the aliens.

Cooper claims that MJ-12 became a pawn of the Illuminati almost immediately through the leadership of prominent members like then-Vice President Nelson Rockefeller. The Illuminati encouraged a closer relationship with the aliens in order to gain access to their technology, at the expense of America’s security.

(Shortform note: The Rockefellers and other “dynastic fortunes” are often the subject of conspiracy theories, especially secret society theories, given their ability to dramatically influence international politics and the economy without “earning” their power through democratic elections. While suspicion of these families is sometimes motivated by a legitimate history of exploitation, it also tends to overlap with the antisemitic fear of Jewish wealth as being inherently threatening to non-Jewish society.)

According to Cooper, the US government signed a formal treaty with the aliens at Edwards Air Force Base in 1954. The treaty promised that **the government would keep the aliens’ presence on Earth a secret and allow them to abduct humans for study** , provided that the aliens would not harm the abductees, return them quickly, and provide MJ-12 with a full record of their activities. In exchange, the aliens agreed to help the government develop more advanced technology and to not establish a relationship with any other Earth government. They immediately began constructing joint underground bases throughout the American Southwest for building and testing weapons and aircraft.

(Shortform note: The treaty Cooper describes could explain the number of UFO sightings reported in the Southwest in the 1950s-’70s. On the other hand, skeptics argue that there were no aliens involved, and observers were seeing highly classified weapons testing carried out by the CIA and the Air Force—given the Southwest’s low population, it was a popular site for these sorts of activities. It’s even been suggested that the US government may have _encouraged the UFO narrative_ to deflect attention and keep the exact nature of these experiments secret.)

Within a year, however, the US government discovered through their espionage and the accounts of abductees that **the aliens were violating the treaty by mutilating human and animal abductees, conducting abductions in secret, and sharing their weapons with other countries** , such as the USSR. Because human weapons were no match for alien ones, MJ-12 resolved to maintain friendly relations as long as possible while preparing to fight back. This is the state of human-alien relations in the modern day.

(Shortform note: Stories about alien abduction first gained popularity in the 1960s, with the Barney and Betty Hill incident being one of the first to attract nationwide attention. These stories usually involve the victims being taken to a mysterious location by humanoid creatures to undergo invasive medical “testing,” only to wake up hours later with unexplainable gaps in their memory. Skeptics argue that most abductees are simply experiencing hallucinations or sleep paralysis and that any memories recovered under hypnosis are likely false and not to be taken seriously.)

#### The Year 2000 Disaster

Part of the reason the US has maintained a relationship with the aliens for so long is in the hopes of using their superior technology to bail the Earth out from an impending environmental disaster. According to Cooper, an investigation by the country’s top scientists in the late 1950s concluded that the planet was doomed. **By the year 2000, overpopulation and military tensions between nations would destroy every society through war, famine, and nuclear holocaust**. The only way for humanity to save itself would be to either dramatically reduce its population and rate of resource consumption, or to rely on the aliens for help. Though the government attempted to keep the impending threat a secret, it eventually became public knowledge with the publication of books like Paul Ehrlich’s _The Population Bomb_.

> **The Year 2000 and the Rapture**
> 
> _Behold a Pale Horse_ was published in 1991, and though the year 2000 has now passed without disaster, apocalyptic theories centered around the dawn of the new millennium were popular in the late ’80s and ’90s. Cooper’s choice of the date comes partly from mid-century scientific works like Ehlrich’s, which choose it as a convenient deadline around which to center their calls for change, but also from evangelical teachings about the rapture. Evangelicals predict that on some significant date (2000 having been one of many suggestions) all worthy Christians will ascend to Heaven, leaving sinners to face their extinction on a doomed, apocalyptic Earth.
> 
> While Cooper never describes his religious background in detail, he does call himself a Christian and refers to God and Jesus throughout _Behold a Pale Horse_. The influence of religious apocalyptic beliefs is also alluded to in the book’s title, _Behold a Pale Horse_ , which is a direct quote from the Book of Revelation in the Bible. Saint John witnesses the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding on differently colored horses, with the personification of Death riding on the last, “pale” horse.

Eisenhower commissioned the JASON Society of prominent scientists to develop options, and they generated three. The first was for humanity to devote itself to environmentalism and work toward peace among all nations, which was dismissed as unlikely to succeed. The second was to build underground facilities in which those chosen could retreat and survive following the apocalypse, while the rest on the surface died out. The third was to exploit alien technology by working with them in order to establish colonies in space, though again only for a select few.

(Shortform note: These second and third options have been popular premises for dystopian or post-apocalyptic science fiction since the mid-20th century. Such fiction is usually satirical, contrasting utopian visions of Earth’s future with the preventable-but-through-hubris destruction of the Earth and mass death of humanity. Two of the most famous examples include Stanley Kubrick’s _Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb_ and the video game series _Fallout._)

According to Cooper, both the US and the Soviet governments immediately began joint work on the second and third options, and with the aliens’ help they have already built functioning bases on the Moon and Mars. Cooper claims that popular representations of both planets as barren are a cover-up by NASA, and that the truth can be seen in the 1977 documentary _Alternative 3_ and George Leonard’s study of NASA photographs, _Someone Else Is on the Moon_.

(Shortform note: _Alternative 3_ was a mockumentary, intended to be aired as the April Fools’ Day edition of the English TV program Science Report. The film used fake interviews with astronauts and physicists to claim that the US and the USSR were working together to develop colonies on Mars and the Moon, where a select few would be able to escape after climate change destroyed the Earth. When the broadcast was delayed to mid-June, many viewers assumed that what they were watching was real, and some UFOlogists continue to insist that the program is legitimate and the TV studio’s denials are a government cover-up.)

Cooper also claims that **these governments are simultaneously working to reduce the Earth’s population as much as possible** through the promotion of birth control, importation of drugs and guns to vulnerable populations, forced sterilization, and man-made epidemics (he suggests HIV/AIDS as an example). He theorizes that while the world’s elites will escape underground or to the colonies, the remaining humans who survive these initiatives and the devastation of Earth will either be sold to the aliens for experimentation or used as slave labor.

> **Pandemics From a Lab?**
> 
> Cooper’s theory that AIDS was a man-made disease was one of the most controversial claims in the book, but it has believers to this day; in 2000, a South African health minister came under fire for distributing relevant pages from _Behold a Pale Horse_ to other government officials. In the 2020s, conspiracy theories surrounding Covid-19 similarly suggest that the disease was chemically engineered and released into vulnerable populations, either to try to eradicate them or as an act of biological warfare between nations.
> 
> Though there’s little evidence for these theories, they’re given legitimacy by the fact that the US government has conducted medical experiments on its people in the past. In addition, vulnerable populations do tend to die from diseases at greater rates, though this can be attributed to government indifference and prejudice limiting their access to money and health care rather than deliberate genocide.

#### A New World Order Hoax?

Cooper admits that many UFO-related documents and theories—including the original MJ-12 document—are confirmed hoaxes, and that his theories may sound outlandish to the reader. Ultimately, he suggests that **it’s possible that the presence of aliens on Earth is itself a hoax perpetrated by the US government and the Illuminati** , as part of their plan to establish the NWO.

(Shortform note: The MJ-12 document provided the foundation for a number of other conspiracy theories, but its authenticity was questioned almost as soon as it was discovered. Both the FBI and respected scientists like Carl Sagan dismissed it, and interest in the document faded after one of its originators, UFOlogist William L. Moore, claimed that he’d worked with the government to spread deliberate misinformation about UFOs.)

If this is the case, then all UFO sightings, abduction stories, and leaked documents are intended to convince the people that an existential alien threat could appear at any time. When the time is right, Cooper theorizes that the government will stage an alien attack, announce the presence of the threat, and use it to justify establishing total control over the people—depriving them of their weapons and material possessions, rounding people up into camps, and requiring total surveillance—and merging with the governments of foreign nations, all in the name of safety. This will pave the way for a formal declaration of the NWO.

(Shortform note: This theory was famous before Cooper, as it’s the ending to the influential ’80s comic book series _Watchmen_. World War III between the USSR and the US is averted when the superhero Ozymandias stages an alien attack on New York City, killing millions but ensuring cooperation between nations against this supposed new threat. Though most of the characters are horrified by this act, they agree to keep it secret for the sake of world peace.)

Evidence for this theory, according to Cooper, can be seen in the development of military national disaster contingency plans in the 1970s and ’80s, as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These programs provided for **the suspension of the Constitution and mass detention without cause in the case of a vaguely defined “national emergency.”** A supposed alien attack would have the benefit of uniting everyone in their fear of an outside threat, making them more likely to comply with a police state.

(Shortform note: Although the disaster contingency plans Cooper describes did exist, they’ve never been implemented. FEMA was developed to allow for a swift government response to natural disasters or foreign attacks, and since its creation, it’s been deployed mostly in response to hurricanes, snowstorms, and wildfires. There’s no evidence for the idea that FEMA plans or even has the capability to imprison Americans en masse.)

### How to Fight Back

Cooper warns that **the Illuminati’s plans can only be avoided by popular armed resistance from the American people**. Like the American revolutionaries of the 18th century, the people must rise up to defend their rights and preserve the Constitution, which Cooper calls the closest thing to a perfect political document ever produced. When the Illuminati declare the New World Order and begin rounding people up, true patriots must be prepared to resist.

> **The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing**
> 
> In the mid-1990s, Cooper would organize an informal militia, though its members were scattered across the US, communicated largely through the mail, and never took any violent action. Through his radio show, Cooper repeatedly pointed out instances of government corruption and called for listeners to make their displeasure known, either through votes, protest, or outright violence.
> 
> In some cases, Cooper’s calls to action had consequences he didn’t endorse. Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh explicitly named Cooper as one of his inspirations and timed the bombing—which killed over a hundred people—to coincide with the second anniversary of the deaths at Waco. Though Cooper reported on the bombing in depth, he refused to accept that he might have held some responsibility, arguing instead that the bombing was orchestrated by the government to demonize the patriot militia movement. Indeed, membership in the movement declined after the bombing, as there was greater police crackdown on what was now seen as the threat of further domestic terrorism.

While Cooper agrees with the Illuminati that the Earth is nearing a crisis point in international tensions, resource distribution, and the health of the climate, he rejects the belief that most of humanity is too unintelligent or weak to contribute. **All of these problems can be solved, he argues, through widespread application of American democratic ideals** , in which every person is guaranteed a voice and the right to “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Though these principles have not been applied in practice due to government corruption and Illuminati interference, Cooper believes that a second revolution and more direct involvement in government by the citizenry will realize the ideal America of the future.

(Shortform note: Cooper’s biographer Mark Jacobson has argued that Cooper’s calls to action reached not just right-wing populists but also more left-leaning Black activists. In the 1990s, _Behold a Pale Horse_ was widely read in prisons, sold in bookstores alongside works of anti-racist and anti-colonialist literature by authors like Ralph Ellison and Marimba Ani, and memorialized in hip-hop by the Wu Tang Clan, Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z, and dozens of other artists. Jacobson suggests that Cooper’s popularity with this community has ensured that his ideas about the Illuminati and the NWO will continue to spread among younger generations, long past the memory of Cooper himself.)
