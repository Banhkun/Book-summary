## Exercise: Analyze Your Dreams

Reflect on your dreams, serendipity, and the unconscious. Try to recall a recent dream. If you’re not able to remember a dream, keep a notebook next to your bed, and the next time you wake up from a dream, engage in the following process.

* * *

Quickly write down a basic summary of your dream, and underline specific aspects or details that stand out most to you.

Reflect on these aspects and details. Is there anything going on in your life that relates to them? How so?

What constructive “meaning” or “message” arises from the details (or dream overall)?

What actions can you take in your life as a result of these insights?
