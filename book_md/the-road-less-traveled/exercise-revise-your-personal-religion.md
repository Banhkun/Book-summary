## Exercise: Revise Your Personal Religion

Reflect on your beliefs and perception of the world.

* * *

What is one life lesson or truth about the world you learned from your family or community growing up (perhaps something like “people cannot be trusted” or “I need to make a lot of money to be happy”)?

Reflect on the truth or belief and try to identify when you first learned it. What was the reason for its conception? What positive purpose did it serve at that time?

What are the differences between your circumstances then and your circumstances now? What are some ways you might adjust the belief to better fit current circumstances?

What are some actions you can take to demonstrate any new adjustments (for example, if you’re upgrading the belief “people can’t be trusted” to “trust is earned,” you might try opening up about something you haven’t shared before to a friend who has demonstrated reliability or respect)?
