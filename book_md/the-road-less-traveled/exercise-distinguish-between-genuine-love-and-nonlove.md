## Exercise: Distinguish Between Genuine Love and Nonlove

Review the differences between nonlove and genuine love.

Nonlove:

  * Defines love as a feeling
  * Is motivated by the desire for comfort or control
  * Often considers the needs of one partner more than the other



Genuine love:

  * Defines love as an action
  * Is motivated by the desire to support the spiritual growth of the other person
  * Considers the needs and well being of both partners equally



Now read the following scenarios and see if you can identify which represents genuine love and which represents nonlove.

* * *

You and your partner have been together for three years. Typically, you work full-time, and they work part-time, spending the rest of their free time working on their creative ambitions. You suddenly develop an auto-immune disorder that makes it difficult for you to continue working at the level you normally do. Your partner offers to work full-time while you take time off to stabilize your health. What kind of love is this and why?

You are in your mid-30s with a busy job and usually visit your parents (who live out of state) quarterly, at their insistence. One day, you are offered a promotion at work, but it will require you to cut down on your visits this year. When you tell your parents, they become angry and encourage you to turn down the promotion so that you can continue to visit them. What kind of love does this represent and why?
