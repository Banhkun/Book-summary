## 1-Page Summary

According to psychotherapist M. Scott Peck, the purpose of life is spiritual evolution and, in the context of wellness, spiritual competence is the highest form of mental health. In _The Road Less Traveled,_ Peck teaches you how to face the inevitable challenges in your life, grow through hardship, and ultimately attain deeper self-knowledge.

First, we’ll look at common obstacles to self-knowledge and spiritual evolution. Then, we’ll explore the four factors that assist you in your journey: discipline, love, personal religion, and grace.

### What Hinders Spiritual Evolution?

There are two key obstacles to spiritual evolution.

#### #1: Laziness

Laziness impedes you from working through the problems that support your growth. Furthermore, if you don’t conquer laziness, you won’t conquer the other obstacles; if you _do_ conquer laziness, you know the others are conquerable, too.

#### #2: Fear of Power

When you spiritually evolve, you develop greater awareness of your actions and their impact. This makes decision-making more difficult, because being aware of the impact of your actions means understanding the pain and suffering you can cause. The more spiritual awareness you develop, the greater your uncertainty may become.

### What Supports Spiritual Evolution?

There are four factors that positively impact individual spiritual evolution.

#### Factor #1: Discipline

If you have strong discipline, you use willpower to work through the discomfort associated with problem-solving. The challenges of life require mastery of four components influenced by discipline.

##### #1: Delayed Gratification

We often procrastinate solving problems because the process is uncomfortable, and we are not willing to sit with discomfort even if doing so will result in an overall more positive result.

To develop strong discipline, you need to be willing to sit with the discomfort of the problem-solving process. When you immediately take care of painful or frustrating tasks, you enhance your experience of later, more enjoyable activities.

##### #2: Acceptance of Responsibility

Related to procrastination, people with poor discipline usually struggle with embracing responsibility. But If you try to make your problems the responsibility of others, they won’t get solved, and you will be the one who suffers. Avoiding responsibility can lead to one of two types of mental illness:

**Neuroticism:** Neurotics feel responsible for too much, leading them to avoid commitment, develop codependent relationships, and succumb to generalized anxiety.

**Character Disorder:** Character disordered people feel responsible for too little, leading them to blame others for their problems and stagnate their own growth.

Life is a series of choices, and the best way to develop a healthy sense of responsibility is to engage in rigorous self-examination while you make those choices. Observe yourself, and notice whether or not what you expect of yourself is realistic, and make adjustments where necessary. Alternatively, notice when you may be blaming others for a problem that is _your_ responsibility, and take responsibility for solving it.

##### #3: Committed Honesty

Seeing and engaging with the world through an honest lens is often painful, but when you have the discipline to do so, you are able to make choices that best support growth.

One obstacle to committed honesty is _transference_ : We inherit our perception of reality from our upbringing. As we grow, these perceptions become outdated, and this misalignment causes mental illness.

  * For example, Peck once had a patient named Stewart, who was a successful professional in his midlife who developed severe depression. There did not seem to be a specific trigger, but he had grown up in a dogmatically religious environment, and in adulthood had become an atheist. Stewart, through therapy, eventually realized that his upbringing had instilled in him a belief in a punishing God, whom he had rejected once leaving home. His attempts to reject the existence of God had only suppressed this underlying belief. 



You can overcome transference by evaluating your current values and beliefs and determining whether or not they are outdated. **You must deliberately replace outdated values and beliefs with ones that are consistent with who you are.**

  * For example, in Stewart’s case, he realized that his idea of God had actually come from his experience of his own parents. They had been ruthless in their punishments for any perceived transgressions, and consequently, Stewart grew up to believe in a world and God that was terrifying and dangerous, just like his parents. 



##### #4: Balancing

Balance is an aspect of discipline that allows you to take a measured approach to your life. Optimal balance looks like:

  * Understanding when to be truthful and when to withhold truth for the higher good.
  * Understanding what you are and are not truly responsible for in life.
  * Understanding when to delay gratification versus when to be in the present moment.



Balancing is critical because it keeps you from making extreme decisions. For example, when you’re angry, you might be inspired to do harm to another person when that isn’t the appropriate course of action to take. There will also be times when you’re angry because you’re genuinely under threat and you’ll need to take action to defend yourself. Balancing this choice is the job of your _flexible response system,_ which controls how you moderate the expression of your emotions. For most people suffering from mental illness, the flexible response system is out of balance. Therapy often seeks to correct this imbalance.

**Optimal balance (and indeed, optimal wellness) occurs when you find a middle ground between contrasting needs, objectives, or experiences.** This kind of balance requires you to give up certain needs, objectives, or experiences. For example, when you’re angry and choose not to lash out at the object of your anger, you are letting go of your need to “get even” or your perception of yourself as “under threat.”

#### Factor #2: Love

To master discipline, you need to harness the energy of genuine love. Genuine love occurs when you move beyond yourself to support your own spiritual growth or the spiritual growth of someone else.

There are five myths to understand to master genuine love.

##### Myth #1: Love Is a Feeling

We tend to believe love is a feeling because we’ve grown up on the idea of “falling in love.” However, what we think of as “falling in love” is actually a process called _cathexis_ , during which we identify something as an extension of ourselves and, because this creates a bond, invest our energy into it. We can cathect people, pets, or even objects.

Cathexis:

  * Doesn’t require an interest in supporting someone’s spiritual growth
  * Is feeling-based, and feelings change. For example, if you feel emotionally connected and sexually attracted to a coworker, these feelings may prompt you to cheat on your partner. 



Genuine love:

  * Is rooted in the willingness to support the spiritual growth of another
  * Is action-, not feeling-based. For example, if you genuinely love your spouse, you will remain faithful even when you are angry with them or tempted by other people.



##### Myth #2: Love Is Dependency

Dependency causes relationships to become parasitic, where the needs of one person are prioritized, which prevents spiritual growth. For example, say you’re primarily staying in a relationship with someone you don’t love because they pay your bills. Not only are you financially dependent on this person, but you’re unable to grow into your own competence, and the relationship is keeping you from finding a partner you truly love.

**The foundation of genuine love is the ability to make choices freely.** In this context, you are aware you can meet your needs on your own, but you wish to develop a mutually fulfilling partnership with someone anyway.

##### Myth #3: Love Is Self-Sacrifice

The idea that love requires self-sacrifice causes two potential problems:

  * We accept mistreatment because it reinforces that we are the “good guy” to our abuser’s “bad guy.”
  * We unconsciously use nurturing behavior to make someone else dependent on us. This allows us to be a “savior.”



In contrast, **the purpose of genuine love is self-replenishment.** Genuine love can be selfish or selfless as long as the motivation for your actions is your own spiritual growth or the spiritual growth of someone else.

##### Myth #4: Love Is Effortless

Many people believe that love shouldn’t require work, but spiritual growth and interrelational fulfillment cannot occur with this mindset.

**The only way to develop a genuinely loving relationship between yourself and another person is to extend yourself through deliberate effort.** This requires energy and attention. One of the key ways you can develop attention is to practice good listening.

##### Myth #5: Love Prioritizes Growth as a Couple

A common misconception about love is that we all have a soulmate, and when we find them, they are our “forever” relationship. This causes us to stay in unhappy or unfulfilling relationships out of a desire to preserve the myth. But when you value coupledom over being in a genuinely loving and fulfilling partnership, you impede your ability to build such a relationship, because neither partner is seen as a whole and separate individual.

**Genuine love honors the separateness of both individuals in a relationship and treats each person’s spiritual growth with equal importance.** In a genuinely loving relationship, the relationship is not the focal point, but a vehicle to serve the spiritual growth of the individuals within it.

##### Risks

As with every step on the journey to self-knowledge and spiritual growth, loving genuinely is not easy, and there are four significant risks involved:

  1. **Loss:** When you genuinely love, you risk abandonment or change. You may even lose aspects of yourself.
  2. **Independence:** Genuine self-love requires you to establish your identity as separate from those who raised you.
  3. **Commitment:** In any relationship, you need to be able to reasonably expect consistency in order for growth to take place. It’s always a risk to commit, as there is no guarantee that your commitment will yield positive results, and it’s a risk to trust the commitment of others, as there is no guarantee that others can be safely relied upon.
  4. **Confrontation:** Loving confrontation is a thoughtful act of redirection used only when doing so will support the spiritual growth of the person being confronted. Choosing not to confront when it would serve spiritual growth is to miss an opportunity to express genuine love. For example, if your partner is spending all their time smoking weed and it causes them to drop their commitments, it would be genuinely loving to confront them and point out that their weed use is negatively impacting their life.



#### Factor #3: Worldview (“Personal Religion”)

To grow in any area of your life, you need to understand the world and your place in it. This understanding makes up something called your _personal religion_. Your personal religion is most influenced by the environment of your upbringing, including your culture and the respective personal religions of your parents.

As you age, the religion of your upbringing typically begins to clash with your developing perception of the world. As you structure this perception, you may run into three core problems.

##### 1\. Limited Idea of Religion

There is a widespread misunderstanding that religion is about God and requires a belief in God. In reality, religion does not require God at all and is simply made up of your own personal beliefs about the nature of reality.

##### 2\. Transference

Most people don’t choose their first personal religion. Instead, it’s handed down to you by your caretakers. This means your perception of the world is initially a result of transference—your thoughts and behavior are based on someone else’s perception of reality. For example, if your caretakers see the world as a hostile place, so will you.

##### 3\. Contradictory Perspectives

No two people have the same perception of the world. We have a world full of contrasting perspectives, and yet we are forced to coexist. This causes conflict, usually as a result of blind spots where one person thinks their worldview is more correct than others’.

##### Solution: Continual Revision

It’s critical to develop your own perception of reality. Living by an inherited personal religion will cause you to do and say things that don’t feel authentic to you, and the dissonance will eventually lead to mental illness. To avoid this, spend time observing and revising your worldview to be sure it’s well-aligned with you. Question everything you believe, and maintain an openness to editing your understanding of reality. If you’ve never done this deliberately before, you may find that you need to first reject everything you think you believe.

For example, if you’ve had premarital sex, and you’re suffering because you think premarital sex is a sin that God will punish you for, you might start by asking yourself: “Who taught me this? Can it be proven? What evidence do I have that I will be punished?”

#### Factor #4: Grace

The final tool you are given on your growth journey is the availability of grace, a mysterious force supporting you to remain on your path to spiritual evolution. You need to work through your resistance to spiritual growth before you can access grace. There is one core obstacle to embracing spiritual growth.

##### Evil

Evil is the most extreme manifestation of laziness, characterized by the deliberate avoidance of growth and destruction of goodness. If genuine love is the willingness to _extend_ yourself to support the spiritual growth of yourself or others, evil is actively _narrowing_ yourself to avoid your own growth or positively impacting the growth of others. In other words, evilness is anti-love. The light in the world illuminates the pain evil is avoiding and evil is motivated by the desire to remain ignorant of this pain.

For example, the decision to cheat on your spouse because you’re unhappy in the relationship is a result of laziness. The decision to cheat on your spouse because you feel contempt towards them for how well they treat you and want to hurt them might be rooted in something closer to evil.

##### Solution: Grace

_Grace_ is a spiritual force that originates beyond you but moves through you or to you through others for the purpose of contributing to your spiritual growth. Instances of grace are characterized by:

  * Their positive impact on spiritual growth.
  * Their contribution to the resilience of the human spirit.
  * Frequent, universal occurrence.
  * Origins beyond the human mind or will.



##### Why Might We Resist Grace?

Many believe grace to be an expression of support from a genuinely loving God who wants us to grow. The suggestion is that this God wishes for us to spiritually evolve to the point of becoming God. We resist because if we don’t, we would have to take on the immense responsibility of being a God-like version of ourselves. This goal requires continual, intense effort, and accepting that we can become God puts us in confrontation with our greatest obstacle to God: laziness (or evil, when expressed to an extreme).

##### What Are the Results of Resisting Grace?

In short, mental illness. In order to evolve to full spiritual competence, you must live life in alignment with your soul. This requires an impeccable relationship with reality, which requires engaging in continual, rigorous evaluation of your worldview. If you avoid this, you will grow increasingly disconnected from reality, and your behavior will look increasingly erratic or peculiar to others.

##### How to Welcome Grace

To open your connection to grace, you need to understand how it shows up in your life. There are four indicators which, when examined, lend evidence to the existence of grace.

**Indicator #1: Resilience**

In the realm of both psychology and medicine, there are cases where, against all odds, patients retain resilience. For example, consider people who experience extreme abuse in childhood, yet go on to live happy and successful lives, or those who are in horrific car accidents, yet go on to make full recoveries. What can explain this? Evidence suggests that the secret ingredient in these types of circumstances is grace, supporting the human resistance system to recover and thrive.

**Indicator #2: Synchronicity or Serendipity**

Synchronistic events are events that occur outside the boundaries of natural law with impeccable and unexplainable timing or frequency. Serendipitous events are moments where positive occurrences arise unexpectedly and at times of great significance. For example, when a person is shot, but the bullet misses all vital organs, what can explain this? There is no natural law suggesting that the organs move to avoid the bullet, or one suggesting that the human body somehow influences the bullet to curve in such a way that it avoids the organs.

Events of synchronicity and serendipity are common, but many see them as coincidences and choose not to see a deeper meaning in them. This is a powerful indicator of grace, as moments of grace are only meaningful to those who are open to them.

**Indicator #3: The Unconscious**

5% of the human brain is conscious, while the remaining 95% makes up the unconscious. The unconscious is a major vessel of grace, communicating important insights to us through dreams, idle thoughts, word vomit, and symptoms of illness (both mental and physical). These occurrences can bestow any of the following benefits:

  * Support you to deepen your understanding of yourself or others
  * Provide guidance for challenges in your life
  * Communicate a “yes” or “no” about decisions you’ve been struggling with or conclusions you’ve had difficulty coming to
  * Help you identify next steps when you’re in periods of stagnancy 



**The greatest indicator of a message from the unconscious is it being unexpected or unwanted.** Traditional psychologists (like Freud) thought the unconscious was bad because its insights often reveal neuroses. Modern psychologists (like Jung) have evolved to view the unconscious as the “unfiltered truth” of the human psyche, providing deep wisdom for meaningful growth. In this context, again, symptoms of mental illness revealed through the unconscious (obsessive thoughts, irritability, anxiety, and so on) seem to be manifestations of grace, alerting you to the state of your soul for the purpose of redirection.

**Indicator #4: Evolution**

The miracle of evolution may be the greatest indicator of grace there is. The law of thermodynamics shows us that the flow of growth in the universe is always rushing downstream. Rather than expanding, it is narrowing. Over time, energy becomes less complex and more disordered. Eventually, this process will reach its conclusion, with higher complexity no longer possible. This is known as _entropy_. The downward flow of growth is _the force of entropy_. Evolution is a process of expansion, where energy becomes more complex, with greater and greater states of differentiation. The upward force of evolution pushes against the downward force of entropy to evolve organisms to their highest state of differentiation (currently, human beings). From a spiritual standpoint, the process is identical. Human beings fight against the force of entropy (laziness) to evolve to the highest state of spiritual competence.

### What Is the End Goal of Spiritual Evolution?

A key aspect of spiritual competence is awareness, and evil is the greatest expression of ignorance, awareness’s opposite. This suggests spiritual evolution and the evolution of consciousness are the same journey. If the term “conscious” means “to know with,” consider that the unconscious is the source of ultimate knowledge, and full consciousness is to bring that knowledge into conscious awareness. Further, the source of unconscious knowledge is God. This suggests the unconscious is a vehicle of grace, something not “of us” that nonetheless moves through us. The process of bringing the unconscious to the surface to be integrated into the conscious is to know God within us and bring God into conscious action through us.

**The primary goal of spiritual evolution is to integrate human consciousness with God-consciousness.** We engage in growth to develop awareness and spiritual competency, which allows God to influence our actions for the betterment of humanity. The mysterious force of grace moves through us to help others experience consciousness as well.
