## Exercise: Apply Zarathustra’s Teachings

We discussed Zarathustra’s concept of virtue. In this exercise, you’ll think about how you could practice Zarathustra’s virtues in your own life.

* * *

Zarathustra says different people have different virtues, which he defines as your unique strengths and passions. What do you see as your greatest strengths and passions right now?

Zarathustra encourages you to cultivate your unique virtues. What could you do this week to further develop at least one of the virtues you listed above?

Zarathustra teaches that you should live life joyfully and deliberately pursue happiness. What is one thing you could do this week that would make you happy?

Zarathustra teaches you to be happy, but also to endure discomfort, and even seek it out, because enduring discomfort makes you stronger. Think of the last time you endured discomfort, either physically (like having to be outside in inclement weather) or emotionally (like being in a situation that pushed you outside of your comfort zone). What was the situation? In what ways might it have made you stronger?
