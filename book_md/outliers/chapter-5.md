## Chapter 5: Opportunities Hidden in Hardships

So far, we’ve looked at the opportunities provided by privilege and good fortune. But **_difficult_ circumstances can also bring unexpected opportunities. **

In this chapter, Gladwell illustrates this point by examining the life of Joe Flom, a lawyer who grew up in poverty during the Great Depression. As we’ll discuss, because of his early hardships, Flom grew up to become a partner at one of the largest and most powerful law firms in the world—Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom.

Although Gladwell frames Flom as an outlier, he clarifies that Flom is representative of an inordinate number of highly successful lawyers who had the same hidden opportunities that we’ll explore in this chapter: being Jewish, being the child of garment workers, and being born in the 1930s. As we’ll see, these circumstances and their consequences encapsulate many of the principles from previous chapters, such as accumulative advantage, the importance of upbringing, and the necessity of thousands of hours of practice to master a skill.

Let’s look at the hidden opportunities in this rags-to-riches story.

### Hidden Opportunity #1: Being Jewish

Gladwell writes that **when Flom entered the job market, he faced discrimination for being Jewish.** This discrimination limited not only which law firms would hire him, but also the type of law he could practice.

In the 1940s and ‘50s, elite law firms were particular about the lawyers they hired and the clients they worked with: They preferred people who were Nordic, clean-cut, well-connected, and born to a respectable family. As a result, Flom could only find work at less-distinguished law firms.

Gladwell explains that the elite firms handled the taxes and legal work of issuing stocks and bonds for big corporations. They didn’t take on litigation cases (lawsuits) because they were considered low-class and sleazy. Lawsuits were also uncommon at the time—major corporations didn’t sue each other and there weren’t many hostile corporate takeovers.

Again, Jewish lawyers like Flom were left to take on the undistinguished work of litigation and “proxy fights,” the legal side of a hostile takeover, when one investor or company tries to take over another company without its consent. **Although this was a disadvantage initially, Gladwell says that it forced Jewish lawyers to develop a unique skill set that led to their eventual success**.

In the 1970s, a combination of economic and legal changes led investors to become more aggressive, and corporate takeovers increased dramatically—and the legal work associated with them became less taboo. Suddenly, everyone needed litigation lawyers, and Jewish lawyers had already accumulated their 10,000 hours of litigation and proxy-fight practice. Flom became one of the few experts in a sought-after specialization.

Gladwell asserts that if Flom hadn’t faced discrimination for being Jewish, he wouldn’t have gained the expertise that made him, and other Jewish lawyers, so enormously successful.

> **For Most, Discrimination Is a Disadvantage—Not an Opportunity**
> 
> Although Gladwell argues that the hiring discrimination that Flom faced turned out to be an advantage in his career, workplace prejudice overwhelmingly harms its targets. Directly, it causes minority groups to have higher rates of unemployment and poverty than majority groups. In fact, unemployment rates have been twice as high among Black Americans as white Americans during all but seven years between 1962 and 2015. Additionally, in 2016, the poverty rate among working-age women was higher than the national average—and it was significantly higher among Black, Hispanic, and Native women.
> 
> Indirectly, workplace discrimination also negatively affects health. This is because economic stability—through consistent employment and wages—is one of five social determinants of health (SDOH), which are external factors that heavily impact individuals’ long-term health. The other four SDOH are the health and safety of a person’s neighborhood, their social and community support, and their access to high-quality education and health care; most or all of these remaining factors are also arguably impacted by a person’s ability to find and sustain well-paid jobs.
> 
> Workplace discrimination remains a persistent problem in the American workforce: A 2017 study examined how often a Black or Hispanic job applicant was called for an interview compared to a white applicant with identical qualifications. Researchers found that white applicants received 24% more callbacks than Hispanics and 36% more than Blacks. The study also revealed that, since 1990, this discrimination against Blacks has not changed, and it has improved negligibly among Hispanics.

#### Flom Also Benefited From the Discrimination _His Parents_ Faced

The second hidden opportunity that Gladwell notes came from the fact that Flom’s parents worked in the garment industry. We’ll discuss the details of that opportunity next, but it’s worth noting that **his parents worked in this industry because of anti-Semitic discrimination they had faced before immigrating to the US**

Gladwell explains that at the time Flom’s parents were living in Europe, Jews were forbidden to own land, so they lived in cities and worked in various trade professions, most commonly the garment trade. When they arrived in New York City in the 1890s, the garment trade was the largest industry in the city, and their specialized skill set was greatly needed. Again, because discrimination forced them to take jobs that others wouldn’t, they were in a position to be experts when the neglected skills became in-demand.

> **For Some Immigrants, Work Experience Was Irrelevant**
> 
> Amid the surge of US immigration in the 19th and early 20th centuries, some immigrants—like Flom’s parents—found work based on their experience and expertise, while other immigrants’ work was dictated by the region in which they settled and the changing needs of the labor market. As with the Jewish immigrants who flooded the garment industry, a wave of German immigrants brought their wheat farming expertise to the Midwest after the Russian government revoked privileges for German farmers settled in Russia.
> 
> At the same time, industrialization was changing America’s economy and labor market, shifting the center of industry from agriculture to factory work. Many immigrants from various countries settled in cities and found work in these factories, where they typically performed monotonous tasks for long hours in unsafe conditions. Similarly, labor shortages on the transcontinental railroad were filled with low-wage immigrant workers based on proximity, including Chinese immigrants in the West (where many had come for the Gold Rush) and Irish immigrants in the East (where millions settled near their ports of entry).

### Hidden Opportunity #2: Being the Child of Garment Workers

As garment workers, Flom’s parents were extremely poor. However, the nature of their work taught them three key lessons that they passed on to their son, which contributed to his success. Thus, Gladwell argues that **his parents’ trade was yet another unexpected opportunity for Joe Flom.**

Specifically, garment workers—and their children—benefited from three aspects of the industry: **autonomy, complexity, and the relationship between effort and reward.**

**1) Autonomy:** Unlike other trades, you could start a garment business fairly easily and independently. The overhead cost was relatively low—all you needed was a sewing machine, some fabric, and the ability to sew. Jewish garment workers highly valued this autonomy, and passed that on to their children.

(Shortform note: In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink emphasizes that autonomy is critical for enduring motivation, job satisfaction, high performance, and psychological health at work. Pink notes that autonomy isn’t about working _alone_ , but rather having the freedom to choose how you work—which tasks you tackle and how you approach them, the hours you work, and the team you assemble. Although Pink focuses on how employers give workers autonomy, the garment workers enjoyed this freedom because they didn’t have to work for an employer.)

**2) Complexity:** The entrepreneurial nature of the industry required that the worker be intimately involved in every aspect of the business, including manufacturing, negotiating, conducting market research, and understanding fashion trends. They passed their knowledge of the economy and how to negotiate with New Yorkers on to their children; many, like Flom, used it to their advantage.

(Shortform note: Flom’s story shows an exception to our discussion in the last chapter about how children in middle- and upper-class families typically benefit from their parents’ negotiation and business skills. In Flom’s case, because of the particular industry his parents worked in, he had the opportunity to learn these skills _despite being poor_.)

**3) A relationship between effort and reward:** If garment workers stayed up late sewing more dresses, they’d make more money the next day. The correlation between increased effort and increased reward was clear and tangible. The harder and longer you work, the more money you’ll make. That instilled Flom with a belief in the value of hard work that helped him in his own career.

(Shortform note: This type of _contingent reward_ —similar to commissions for salespeople—is motivating in “algorithmic” tasks, such as assembly-line work or sewing dresses. However, research shows that contingent rewards are less effective in complex or creative “heuristic” work, such as innovating or solving novel problems.)

Furthermore, Gladwell writes that these three elements collectively made the work _meaningful_ , despite the long hours and difficult work. This taught garment workers and their children that **even hard work could be joyful if it had meaning**. Although, in many ways, Jewish immigrants were like many other immigrants—forced to work in poor conditions for little pay—Gladwell posits that the specific lessons listed above and the understanding of meaningful work gave Flom an advantage over other first-generation Americans at the time.

> **The Definition of Success**
> 
> On one hand, Gladwell argues that Flom learned skills and life lessons—like the importance of hard work—from his parents’ work experiences, and that those helped Flom to become _monetarily_ successful in his career. Additionally, Gladwell suggests that Flom’s parents had success because they found meaningful work. This brings into question Gladwell’s definition of success when framing an outlier as someone who’s especially successful.
> 
> Generally, Gladwell’s writing in _Outliers_ implies success through career achievements and financial gain. Based on this, we can assume that broader definitions of success—like mental and emotional well-being, or overall life satisfaction—may not adhere strictly to Gladwell’s argument about the necessity of external factors.

### Hidden Opportunity #3: Being Born During the Depression

Just as many uber-successful computer programmers were born at a key point in the 1950s, **many successful Jewish lawyers, like Flom, were born in an advantageous period—the 1930s.** Gladwell asserts that this is yet another example of how the timing of your life impacts your opportunities for success, which was covered in Chapter 2.

As we discussed, Jewish lawyers in Flom’s generation worked in litigation when that area of law was undesirable, which made them a fairly small, highly skilled group when demand for their work grew in the 1970s. Additionally, Gladwell writes that the 1930s produced a “demographic trough,” or small generation, due to the fact that many families couldn’t afford to have more children during the Depression.

Although being born during the Great Depression brought certain challenges, Gladwell argues that **being born in a demographic trough has its advantages.** Children of this generation benefited from small class sizes, they were instructed by excellent teachers who would have been professors if not for the Great Depression, university tuition was lower (presumably to attract more students), and employers were always looking to hire. Because his generation was small, Flom’s opportunities were more numerous and the competition for jobs less fierce.

> **The Silent Generation vs. the Baby Boomers**
> 
> Flom was part of the “Silent Generation,” born between 1928 and 1945, spanning the Great Depression and the beginning of World War II. In stark contrast to the small Silent Generation, its successor, the Baby Boomer Generation (1946-1964), was defined by its large size. Accordingly, while the Silent Generation benefited from smaller class sizes and plenty of job opportunities (which likely helped Flom’s admission to Harvard Law School, despite never graduating college), Boomers faced fiercer competition in college and in the workforce. One sociologist argues that those stressful conditions help explain why Baby Boomers have consistently reported being less happy than older _and_ younger generations.
> 
> On the other hand, in contrast to the Silent Generation’s relative invisibility amid national turmoil, the Boomer Generation’s size gave them outsize influence on American life. The population surge led to a building boom in housing and infrastructure, widespread migration from cities to the suburbs, and a rise in consumerism. Additionally, Boomers had a strong impact on national culture, especially with the rise of activism and counterculture during the 1960s and ‘70s.
