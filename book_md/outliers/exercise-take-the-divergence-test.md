## Exercise: Take the Divergence Test

Are you a divergent or convergent thinker?

* * *

Set a timer for two minutes. Answer the question: How many uses can you think of for a box?

Review your answers. Would you describe your responses as more characteristic of convergent thinking (conventional uses like “storing objects”), or divergent thinking (out-of-the-box ideas like “as a sled”)?

With this in mind, set a timer for two more minutes and write down as many additional uses as you can think of. Push yourself to be even more creative in your answers.

Describe a current project at work or problem in your life that more divergent thinking could help you address.
