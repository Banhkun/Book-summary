## 1-Page Summary

When we learn about someone who’s extremely successful—an outlier—we often want to know what that person is _like_. We assume that they must be exceptionally gifted, intelligent, or passionate, and that these personal qualities are the keys to their success. This is the basis of the idea of the self-made man (or woman), who has earned their success and is in control of their destiny.

However, in _Outliers_ , Gladwell argues that the self-made man is a myth. Instead, he says **success depends just as much on factors that lie beyond the individual and the individual’s control** , including where and when they were born, what kind of family they were born into, how they were parented, and how much money their family has.

(Shortform note: The myth of the self-made man is central to American culture. Around the time of America’s founding, Immanuel Kant promoted the idea that a person is “what he makes of himself,” as he and his fellow Enlightenment philosophers ushered in a growing secularism. Scholars suggest that when the nation’s founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence that people are entitled to the “pursuit of happiness,” they shifted from a Christian focus on reaching heaven to a secular emphasis on attaining earthly success through ambition and autonomy.)

Gladwell is a journalist; author of several best-selling books, including _The Tipping Point_ and _Blink_ ; co-founder of Pushkin Industries; and host of the podcast _Revisionist History_. By the time _Outliers_ was published in 2008, he’d garnered international fame and millions of fans for his accessible blend of storytelling and social science research. Seemingly in response to this acclaim, Gladwell dedicates the epilogue of the book to examining the unique circumstances that contributed to his own success.

Gladwell makes a case for the “nurture” side of the nature versus nurture debate—that environment and circumstance are at least as important as innate ability. His argument focuses on opportunities and culture. First, we’ll explore the _importance_ of opportunities and the _types_ of opportunities that significantly impact success. Then, we’ll examine how various cultures shape people’s behaviors and trajectories.

> **The Nature vs. Nurture Debate**
> 
> The book’s focus on “nurture” elaborates on a _New Yorker_ article in which Gladwell disputed the idea that a person’s intelligence is tied to their race—a controversial implication of the “nature” argument.
> 
> Specifically, the 1994 book _The Bell Curve_ asserts that genes primarily determine a person’s intelligence and that the intellectually elite naturally rise to power in the United States. This echoed statements by Nobel Prize-winning scientist James Watson, who co-discovered DNA, and by prominent psychologist Arthur Jensen, who concluded that racial differences in American children’s test scores were attributable to genetics rather than circumstances. These views drew fervent criticism for suggesting that Black Americans are intellectually inferior to whites.
> 
> However, in 2003, psychologist Eric Turkheimer revealed an important caveat to the nature argument: He concluded that DNA determines a person’s _potential_ , but that their environment determines whether they reach that potential. Gladwell builds on this principle in _Outliers_.

### Part 1: Opportunity Is Key to Success

In Part 1, Gladwell argues that **people can’t become successful without the _opportunity_ to become successful. **While a person’s individual attributes—like talent and work ethic—may determine their potential, external factors determine who has the opportunity to reach their potential and who faces roadblocks.

Furthermore, Gladwell writes that people who get opportunities _early in life_ have a huge advantage over those whose opportunities come later, because:

**1\. They create self-fulfilling prophecies.** Children who believe they’re talented or smart act as if they are, which leads them to actually develop the talent or intellect they believe they already possess. Likewise, children who believe they’re unremarkable tend to embody that identity.

(Shortform note: In _Mindset_ , psychologist Carol S. Dweck reveals a caveat to this: Children who are praised for _being smart_ tend to shy away from difficult tasks for fear of failure because they want to uphold their identity as a smart person. This reaction comes from a fixed mindset, a belief that innate abilities (like intelligence) are unchangeable. By contrast, children who are praised for _their effort_ develop a growth mindset, a belief that you can build upon your natural abilities by working hard and challenging yourself.)

**2\. They benefit from accumulative advantage** , meaning that early opportunities lead to more opportunities, creating a snowball effect of compounding advantages. By the same token, the Matthew effect also describes how small disadvantages tend to snowball into larger ones.

(Shortform note: Research shows that the concept of accumulative advantage—a principle called the Matthew Effect—applies to many areas of life, including education and wealth distribution. However, the reality is more complex than the model suggests; for example, if the rich got endlessly richer, and the poor endlessly poorer, then there would be more trillionaires and more people in hopelessly desperate conditions.)

Gladwell explores three types of opportunities that contribute to success:

  1. The opportunity of time (and timing)
  2. The opportunity of intelligence
  3. Opportunities hidden in hardships



#### Opportunity #1: Time (and Timing)

Gladwell argues that we often attribute success solely to talent and forget that the hours we put in matter just as much as, if not significantly more than, the natural gifts we start with. Talent gets your foot in the door, but practice becomes the determining factor in how successful you are.

Furthermore, Gladwell points out that **having the time to practice enough to master a skill is a luxury afforded only to the privileged.** He cites studies showing that most experts practiced for at least 10,000 hours to master their craft, which averages nearly 20 hours every week for 10 years. Not everyone has the same opportunity to dedicate so much time to focused practice.

> **The 10,000-Hour Debate**
> 
> K. Anders Ericsson, the psychologist who led the study from which Gladwell gleaned the 10,000-hour rule, has criticized Gladwell for misrepresenting his research findings. Ericsson argues in _Peak_ that Gladwell failed to specify that the type of practice is far more important than the amount—namely, mastery requires _deliberate_ practice, an intensely focused and effortful form of practice that constantly pushes the practitioner to stretch their abilities.

> In response, Gladwell has clarified that he wasn’t suggesting that 10,000 was a universal magic number (even though he writes in _Outliers_ that it’s “the magic number of greatness”). Instead, he seems to use the theory to reinforce the importance of time in achieving success, and that time is a privilege.

Gladwell writes that the opportunity to practice 10,000 hours typically emerges from two external factors:

1\. **Financial privilege** —Carving out 10,000 hours of practice in childhood requires your family’s emotional and _financial_ support. For instance, it’s difficult to devote time to practice if you have to work an after-school job to pay for your lessons or contribute to family expenses.

(Shortform note: In line with his argument about the compound effect of early advantages, Gladwell focuses on accumulating 10,000 hours of practice _in childhood_ , in order to achieve mastery by adulthood and, presumably, embark on a successful career. However, the link between time and privilege is also true for adults.)

> **Time Poverty Is Often Part of a Vicious Cycle of Poverty**
> 
> Research bears out that time poverty often goes hand-in-hand with income poverty. For example, if you are income-poor and your car breaks down, you can’t afford the repairs unless you clock extra hours at work—but you can’t put in those extra hours because you have to spend more time commuting by bus until your car is fixed.
> 
> Moreover, time and income poverty compound to create bandwidth poverty, when the pressing needs of the moment deplete your mental capacity for the long-term planning and self-control needed to address some of your time and money issues, creating a vicious cycle. To bring this back to Gladwell’s argument, even if you carved out some time to practice your skill, your bandwidth poverty would make it nearly impossible to put forth the intense focus required for meaningful deliberate practice.

2\. **The month of your birth** —According to the relative age effect (RAE), children have an advantage when they’re born during the early months of an age grouping, such as in school years and youth sports age classes. Gladwell argues that the January 1 cut-off date in Canadian hockey youth leagues helps explain why 40% of Canada’s elite hockey players are born in the first three months of the year.

(Shortform note: While numerous studies confirm that RAE impacts children’s physical ability, academic performance, and even popularity in school, researchers have also concluded that birth month is just one factor in a child’s success. A study of eighth-grade students highlighted that socioeconomic background and the quality of the school are important factors in their performance, noting that the effect of RAE on student achievement decreases the longer children are in school.)

3\. **The year of your birth** —Gladwell posits that your birth year may provide unique opportunities to practice. For example, several successful computer programmers, including Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, were born between 1952 and 1958, which meant that they came of age during the dawn of the personal computer in 1975.

(Shortform note: Contrary to Gladwell’s argument that these innovators’ success stemmed from the luck of being born at the right time, psychologist Richard Wiseman counters that “lucky” people actually make their own luck by exposing themselves to diverse people and experiences, trusting their instincts, being optimistic about their outlooks, and finding lessons and opportunities in failures.)

#### Opportunity #2: Intelligence

In addition to the opportunity of time, Gladwell argues that successful people have the opportunity of intelligence. But rather than the innate type of intelligence measured by IQ tests (analytical intelligence), he asserts that**extraordinary success in life is often the result of practical intelligence, or social savvy, which enables you to accurately read people and situations and adjust your response to get what you want.** Practical intelligence encompasses negotiation skills, the ability to self-advocate, and the conviction that you deserve to pursue what you want (Gladwell calls this a positive form of entitlement).

(Shortform note: Analytical and practical intelligence are two of three types identified in psychologist Robert Sternberg’s model of intelligence. The third type is creative intelligence, which entails thinking outside the box to come up with innovative solutions.)

Gladwell asserts that practical intelligence is cultivated through a parenting style that’s typical of middle- and upper-class families. He cites a study by sociologist Annette Lareau, who defined two distinct parenting philosophies that correlate with social class: **Middle- and upper-class parents take a hands-on approach, which Lareau dubs _concerted cultivation_. **These parents nurture their children’s interests, explain their decisions rather than making commands, expect their children to have opinions and negotiate, and model how to respectfully stand up to authority figures. As a result, children develop practical intelligence.

(Shortform note: Concerted cultivation has come to be categorized as a form of “intensive parenting,” which has evolved to encompass “helicopter parenting” (incessantly hovering over children), “snowplow parenting” (clearing obstacles from children’s path), and “drone parenting” (technology-assisted helicopter parenting). Paradoxically, in contrast to concerted cultivation, which pushes children to take an active role in their own self-advocacy, research shows that these more-intensive variants actually produce children who are _less_ competent, confident, mature, independent, and responsible than their peers.)

By contrast, Gladwell writes, Lareau asserts that **working-class parents take a hands-off approach, which she calls _accomplishment of natural growth_. **These parents consider their children’s interests to be facets of their personality rather than sources of potential talent, command rather than explain, discourage children from disagreeing with adults, and are passive around authority figures. As a result, children are typically more creative and independent, but less adept at negotiation and self-advocacy, which are key to outlier-level success in adulthood.

(Shortform note: Since Lareau published her findings, some aspects of the accomplishment of natural growth strategy—and their associated benefits—have declined in practice. First, some experts suggest that intensive parenting (closely related to concerted cultivation) is increasingly becoming the norm at _every_ socioeconomic level. Second, the broader availability of technology means that most children (especially low-income kids and teens) are spending more time in front of screens and less time outside, where they traditionally developed independence and creativity during unstructured play.)

#### Opportunity #3: Hardship

So far, we’ve looked at the opportunities provided by privilege and good fortune. But Gladwell argues that **_difficult_ circumstances can also bring unexpected opportunities. **He illustrates this point by examining the life of Joe Flom, a lawyer who grew up in poverty during the Great Depression to become a partner at one of the largest and most powerful law firms in the world.

Although Gladwell frames Flom as an outlier, he clarifies that Flom is representative of an inordinate number of highly successful lawyers who had the same hidden opportunities: being Jewish, the child of garment workers, and born in the 1930s.

##### Hidden Opportunity #1: Being Jewish

Gladwell writes that **when Flom entered the job market, he faced discrimination for being Jewish.** Not only was he excluded from elite firms, but also from the type of law they practiced: handling taxes and legal work for corporate stocks and bonds. Flom could only find work at less-distinguished firms doing litigation cases (lawsuits) and proxy fights, the legal side of a hostile takeover. This area of law was considered low-class, and it was not in high demand at the time.

However, in the 1970s, corporate takeovers increased dramatically. Suddenly, everyone needed litigation lawyers, and Jewish lawyers had already accumulated their 10,000 hours of litigation and proxy-fight practice. **Thanks to his initial disadvantage, Flom became one of the few experts in a sought-after specialization and achieved great success.**

(Shortform note: Although Gladwell argues that the hiring discrimination that Flom faced turned out to be an advantage in his career, workplace prejudice overwhelmingly harms its targets. Directly, it causes minority groups to have higher rates of unemployment and poverty than majority groups. Indirectly, workplace discrimination and economic instability also negatively affect health.)

##### Hidden Opportunity #2: Being the Child of Garment Workers

Flom’s parents worked in the garment industry, working long hours in poor conditions for little pay. However, Gladwell argues that the work had three components that not only provided lessons that they taught their children but also made the work _meaningful_ , which showed their children that **even difficult work could be joyful if it had meaning.** Those three components were:

**1\. Autonomy** —Unlike other trades, you could start a garment business fairly easily and independently. The overhead cost was relatively low—all you needed was a sewing machine, some fabric, and the ability to sew. Jewish garment workers highly valued this autonomy.

(Shortform note: In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink emphasizes that autonomy is critical for enduring motivation, job satisfaction, high performance, and psychological health at work.)

**2\. Complexity** —Garment workers had to learn every aspect of the industry, from manufacturing to market research. They passed their business knowledge on to their children.

(Shortform note: Flom’s story is an exception to Gladwell’s argument that middle- and upper-class children typically benefit from their parents’ business skills. Because of the particular industry his parents worked in, Flom learned these skills _despite being poor_.)

**3\. A relationship between effort and reward** —If garment workers stayed up late sewing more dresses, they’d make more money the next day. The correlation between increased effort and increased reward was clear and tangible, instilling Flom with a belief in the value of hard work.

(Shortform note: This type of _contingent reward_ —similar to commissions for salespeople—is motivating in “algorithmic” tasks, such as assembly-line work or sewing dresses. However, research shows that contingent rewards are less effective in complex or creative “heuristic” work, such as innovating or solving novel problems.)

##### Hidden Opportunity #3: Being Born During the Depression

Flom was born in the 1930s, which was a “demographic trough,” or small generation, due to the fact that many families couldn’t afford to have more children during the Depression. Although being a child in the Great Depression brought certain challenges, Gladwell writes that **being born in a demographic trough has its advantages.** Children of this generation benefited from small class sizes, excellent teachers who would have been professors if not for the Great Depression, low university tuition (presumably to attract more students), and little competition for jobs.

(Shortform note: Flom’s generation, the Silent Generation, was one of the smallest in the US, with about 50 million births. In stark contrast, about 75 million babies were born in the years that followed, during the Baby Boomer Generation. On one hand, Boomers faced fiercer competition in college and in the workforce, which one sociologist argues has made Boomers consistently less happy than other generations. On the other hand, because of the generation’s size, Boomers had a strong impact on national culture, especially with the rise of activism and counterculture during the 1960s and ‘70s.)

### Part 2: The Influence of Our Cultural Legacy

In addition to the opportunities you have during your own lifetime, Gladwell posits that **the culture of your ancestors (even the aspects you no longer practice or ascribe to) influence your present-day behaviors** in ways that impact your trajectory. In Part 2, Gladwell explores how such cultural legacies promote or impede our success by examining three distinct cultures:

  1. The culture of honor 
  2. The culture of deference 
  3. The culture of diligence



Each example shows that, to be successful, **it matters where you’re from—not only geographically but also culturally.**

#### Culture #1: Honor

The first culture Gladwell describes is what sociologists call the **culture of honor, in which your self-worth is based on your reputation.** In this culture, you’re more likely to fight someone who challenges you and, therefore, jeopardizes your reputation. These cultural norms impact how you respond in certain situations, which can affect your life trajectory.

Gladwell explains that honor cultures developed out of herding lifestyles: Animals can be stolen, so herders had to demonstrate aggression and strength to protect themselves and their livelihoods. People who descend from herdsmen tend to carry on these cultural norms, even if they aren’t herders.

As an example, Gladwell cites evidence that in the American South, murders occur more frequently than in the rest of the country and tend to involve two people who know each other and are involved in a personal conflict (presumably involving honor, respect, or reputation). He points out that many southerners are descendants of immigrants from rocky, harsh terrains in Scotland, England, and Ireland, where the culture of honor is fierce.

> **The Culture of Honor Protects Status**
> 
> The culture of honor is also prevalent in urban, low-income neighborhoods—but not necessarily because residents are descended from herders. Instead, experts say that this culture developed in response to stigmatization based on factors like income, social class, race, and education. Stigma takes a toll on people’s psychological safety, and thus they can develop hyper-vigilant responses (often including violence) to threats to their honor and sense of worth.
> 
> Social stigma may also be a factor in the rise of a culture of honor among herders, who generally occupied a lower, poorer class within society. Some experts argue that herders’ aggression was intended not only to protect their livelihoods but also to defend their status.

#### Culture #2: Deference

The second type of culture that Gladwell examines is the culture of deference, or cultures with a higher Power Distance Index (PDI), which measures how hierarchical a country is and how its citizens value authority. **In high PDI countries, employees are often afraid to express disagreement with managers, power in organizations is not equally distributed, and people in power hold special privileges.**

(Shortform note: In the US, a relatively low PDI country, successful business people are often those who challenge authority—both directly and figuratively, in terms of challenging the status quo.)

Gladwell explains that people in high PDI cultures use mitigated speech to avoid making direct statements to their superiors as a show of deference. For example, “Let’s turn right” is mitigated speech because it’s phrased as a suggestion; in contrast, “Turn right” is not mitigated speech because it’s a command.

(Shortform note: Gladwell notes that communication in high PDI cultures is _receiver-oriented_ , meaning that it’s the listener’s responsibility to interpret a message. In _The Culture Map_ , Erin Meyer describes this as a feature of high-context cultures, where people communicate not just through words, but also through shared cultural understanding, etiquette, and norms. By contrast, in low-context (or _transmitter-oriented_) cultures, it’s the speaker’s responsibility to explicitly state all relevant information.)

Gladwell points out that **a high PDI can be problematic—even dangerous—when mitigated speech downplays the importance and urgency of a message in serious situations.** As an example, he highlights Korean Air’s high rate of plane crashes between 1988 and 1998, largely because copilots and crew members used mitigated speech instead of pointing out dangers or disagreeing with pilots in emergency situations.

However, Gladwell describes how the airline turned this around by acknowledging the influence of the culture of deference and making English the language of their flight communications. In the Korean language, there are six levels of conversational address of varying degrees of intimacy and deference, and copilots used more deferential levels of address when speaking to the captain. English removed this obstacle, allowing copilots to speak to their superiors in a direct way without feeling disrespectful. In essence, this gave flight crew members permission to adopt a new culture, if only for the time they were in the air.

(Shortform note: Even before making the cultural shift in flight communications, Korean Air took another dramatic step and brought in foreigners to advise on flight safety and hold senior staff positions—a decision that ran counter to a cultural tendency toward self-reliance.)

With this example, Gladwell argues that **your culture is not your destiny** , and that being aware of your cultural limitations is the first step to overcoming them.

(Shortform note: Whereas Korean Air had to acknowledge the limitations of its _internal_ culture of deference, international companies have to understand the _differences_ between their internal culture and the cultures of the countries into which they expand. In _No Rules Rules_ , Reed Hastings describes how Netflix accommodated employees from high PDI cultures by adapting its approach to candid feedback, a pillar of the company’s culture. Hastings created opportunities for formal feedback, which was more comfortable than delivering impromptu feedback, and employees from low PDI cultures learned to somewhat mitigate their speech when giving feedback to colleagues from high PDI cultures.)

#### Culture #3: Diligence

The third culture Gladwell explores is the culture of diligence and hard work that’s prominent in many Asian countries. Whereas the culture of honor stems from herding ancestors, he asserts that **a culture of diligence is a legacy of rice farming.**

Gladwell explains that rice farmers historically possessed neither the money nor the space for big plots and machinery, so they depended on their skills and long, hard hours (averaging 3,000 hours per year). This differs from Western farming, which typically involves larger plots of land, large equipment, and long stretches of idleness during the winter (averaging 1,200 working hours per year).

Furthermore, like the garment workers we discussed earlier, rice farmers saw **the clear relationship between increased effort and increased wealth** because landlords often allowed them to keep or sell whatever they produced above what was required as rent. This also cultivated their diligence.

(Shortform note: In addition to diligence, some theorize that rice farming also fosters a culture of cooperation that persists among their non-farming descendants. Earlier in the book, Gladwell describes this correlation among farmers more generally, contrasting agriculture’s culture of cooperation with herding’s culture of honor. It’s reasonable to extend that logic and assume that farming rice, which requires elaborate irrigation systems that demand more coordination than other crops, would create a higher level of cultural cooperation.)

Gladwell posits that this culture of diligence partially explains why Asian students score in the 98th percentile in math on international comparison tests. He writes that students who excel at math are those who have the diligence to spend a lot of time figuring out how to solve a problem.

(Shortform note: Experts offer several other possible explanations for Asian students’ high performance in math. One is that Chinese teachers use the traditional “chalk-and-talk” approach, in which they instruct while students listen. While schools in many English-speaking countries have moved toward more collaborative and student-led learning, research shows that students benefit more from teachers’ explicit instruction and problem intervention in chalk-and-talk classrooms. Another hypothesis is that Confucian values that are prominent in Asian cultures emphasize effort and practice, which seems to overlap with Gladwell’s culture of diligence.)

### Conclusion

Gladwell writes that **understanding the external factors that influence success allows us to create circumstances that give more people opportunities to use and develop their gifts.** Such changes could create a world where outliers—the extraordinarily successful—cease to be outliers at all.

(Shortform note: The business world is increasingly taking concrete steps to provide more equal opportunities to diverse job candidates and employees. Their strategies include training recruiters and hiring managers to pull from diverse candidate pools, training employees and managers to spot and report discrimination, pairing underrepresented employees with mentors, and ensuring that the board of directors is diverse.)
