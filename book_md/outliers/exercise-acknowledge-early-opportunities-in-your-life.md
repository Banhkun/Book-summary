## Exercise: Acknowledge Early Opportunities in Your Life

Think about the role of accumulative advantage and self-fulfilling prophecy in your own life.

* * *

Describe one opportunity or disadvantage that you had early in your life or career. For instance, maybe you had a particularly supportive coach, or you had to cope with instability in your home life.

Describe one thing that happened as a result of that opportunity or disadvantage.

Describe one thing that _that_ thing led to.

How else could you have reached the last point above, if not through the initial opportunity or disadvantage and subsequent event?
