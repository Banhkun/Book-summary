## Exercise: Clock Your 10,000 Hours

How can you achieve your 10,000 hours for mastery?

* * *

Think of a skill or craft that you wish to master. How much time would you estimate you’ve already spent _deliberately_ practicing that skill?

Subtract the number of hours you’ve dedicated to deliberate practice from 10,000. (Although 10,000 hours isn’t an exact number for mastery, this will give you a baseline goal.) How long do you think it will realistically take to accrue that many hours of additional practice?

Identify one or two of the biggest obstacles that lie in the way of achieving your 10,000 hours of deliberate practice. How might you reduce these barriers?

Since deliberate practice is goal-oriented, write one goal or benchmark you can start working toward now.
