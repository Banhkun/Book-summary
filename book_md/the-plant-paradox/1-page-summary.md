## 1-Page Summary

From keto to paleo, countless people are looking for solutions to their weight and health issues, trying diet after diet with no success, and wondering, “What am I doing wrong?”

Besides dropping a jean size, there are serious health consequences of your eating and exercise habits—including food intolerances, headaches, digestive issues, joint pain, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes. Meanwhile, our culture perpetuates healthy food myths, and, according to the author, many commonly blamed culprits (e.g. fast food, sugary drinks, and general laziness) are not the main problems.

It turns out that the smallest things can cause the biggest problems; **lectins, a type of plant protein, are toxins that wreak havoc on your internal health, causing weight gain, inflammation, and other physical issues.**

The Plant Paradox Program (PPP) is based on the premise that **the key to your health is less about what you _add_ to your diet and more about what you _remove_** —namely, lectins and other so-called “disruptors,” which are in certain foods, chemicals, and medicines. These tiny culprits are at the cause of the biggest health problems we face, from obesity to cancer to Parkinson’s.

The paradox of the Plant Paradox is that certain fruits and vegetables contain lots of health-harming lectins that you must avoid, but much of the diet relies on eating other, lectin-free vegetables. The PPP consists mainly of certain vegetables, pastured meats, wild-caught seafood, few fruits, tree nuts, and specific oils and dairy products.

(Shortform note: Health organizations including the Mayo Clinic and the Harvard School of Public Health acknowledge the harmful effects of active lectins, but they add that people generally don’t eat enough to cause major health issues and that most lectin-containing foods have health benefits that far outweigh the negative effects of the lectins.)

### Lectins: Plant’s Defense Mechanism

Lectins are large proteins contained in the seeds, grains, skins, rinds, and leaves of most plants, as well as in the meat, milk, and eggs of grain- and soy-fed chickens, cows, pigs, and seafood.

Just as animals developed defenses against their predators (e.g. skunks spray their attackers and gazelles outrun many predators), **plants developed their own methods of protecting their offspring—their seeds—to ensure their species carry on.** One method is to produce toxins—including lectins—that poison, paralyze, or disorient predators or make the plant difficult to digest.

While lectins may be powerful enough to knock out bugs, humans have a size advantage—but that doesn’t mean we’re immune. Our massive number of cells simply means that **you might not see the damaging effects until lectins have compounded for years**.

Lectins contribute to health problems including weight gain, inflammation, joint pain, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases.

#### How Lectins Affect You

Lectins have several harmful effects in your body.

  1. Lectins can create gaps in your intestinal wall barrier.
  2. **Lectins that breach your intestinal wall trigger an attack from your immune system, causing inflammation**.
  3. Lectins—sometimes called “sticky proteins”—bind to sugar molecules in your body and interrupt the communication between cells.
  4. Lectins mimic certain hormones, fooling the body into taking unnecessary actions like storing fat and attacking certain cells. 
  5. Lectins help viruses and bacteria attach to their intended targets, so that people who are particularly sensitive to lectins are more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections. 



Humans have developed a four-pronged protection from plants’ toxins, including lectins.

  1. Your saliva and the mucus in your nose contain sugars, which lectins naturally bind to. Those sugars are meant to trap the lectins before they reach your digestive system. 
  2. Your stomach acid also digests certain—but not all—lectin proteins. 
  3. **The natural bacteria in your mouth and gut help consume lectins before they can interfere with your cells and create gaps in your intestinal wall barrier.**
  4. An additional layer of mucus that lines your intestines acts as a final line of defense to trap lectins and prevent them from interfering with your intestinal wall. 



Although this system is designed to protect us from the harmful effects of lectins, **if we consume too many lectins, they can overwhelm our natural defenses.**

### The Human Diet Is Overloaded With Lectins

For millennia, humans’ immune systems have adapted to their changing diet, but **relatively recently, humans’ diets have changed drastically and exposed our gut bacteria to new compounds that it hasn’t yet evolved to tolerate.**

There are four factors that brought about this major change.

  1. The Agricultural Revolution not only introduced grain and beans into the human diet for the first time, but it also made them the primary food source; this was a shift from a diet of mainly leaves, tubers (like sweet potatoes), and some animal fat and proteins.
  2. A mutation in Northern European cows caused them to produce a different kind of protein in their milk, called casein A-1; during digestion, casein A-1 turns into a protein similar to lectin that causes your immune system to attack your pancreas.
  3. When Europeans landed in the Americas, they brought foreign food from the New World back with them that people in Europe, Asia, and Africa had never before been exposed to and, thus, hadn’t adapted to tolerate. These included
     * The nightshade family, including tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers
     * The bean family, including peanuts and cashews
     * Grains
     * Pseudo-grains, including quinoa 
     * The squash family, including pumpkins, acorn, squash, and zucchini
     * Chia and some other seeds
  4. The rise of processed food and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has introduced a whole new array of lectins that our bodies haven’t adapted to tolerate. At the same time, humans are being exposed to chemicals that destroy certain gut bacteria that would’ve otherwise helped us process some of these lectins. As a result, **we’re less able to process lectins at the same time we’re consuming them more heavily than ever before.**



### Protect Your Gut Bugs

You have about five pounds’ worth of microbes—bacteria, protozoa, fungi, molds, viruses, and worms—in your intestines, on your skin, and in the air around you, collectively making up your holobiome. **Microbes live and feed on you, but your well-being also depends on them.**

The microbes in your gut have several functions:

  * Break down and digest food
  * Help you absorb food’s energy and nutrients
  * Alert your immune system to invaders
  * Prevent objects (like lectins) from breaching your intestinal wall to get into your bloodstream, organs, and other areas of your body
  * Communicate with your brain and body to control your hormones, appetite, cravings, and other functions 



There are good and bad microbes: Good microbes want to keep you healthy because not only do you need them for your well-being, but they also need you. On the other hand, **bad microbes hijack the communication between your gut and your brain and drive you to crave sugars, fats, and unhealthy foods that nourish them but harm your health.** Good microbes help to break down lectins, but when they’re weakened or wiped out, bad microbes can take over and let lectins run rampant.

### Avoid Disruptors

There are seven major disruptors that alter your holobiome, throw off your body’s internal clock, and make you more susceptible to lectins:

  1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as Augmentin, Cipro, and Amoxil
  2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including Advil, Motrin, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naprosyn, Mobic, Celebrex, and aspirin
  3. Stomach-acid blockers, such as Pepcid AC and Zantac
  4. Artificial sweeteners, such as Splenda, Sweet’n Low, and Equal
  5. Endocrine disruptors (chemicals in a range of products from processed foods to cosmetics to mouthwash)
  6. Roundup weedkiller 
  7. Blue light in electronics 



### Why _Not_ Being On The PPP Is Making You Fat And Sick

Lectins break through your gut wall and into other areas of your body. Your immune system recognizes the lectins as foreign invaders and attacks. In order **to fight the war on lectins, your body needs its soldiers—white blood cells—to be well fed, so it diverts calories from your muscles and brain and stores them as fat (fuel) for your white blood cells.**

Additionally, your body makes you hungrier so you’ll ingest more calories to fuel the battle. Your body stores the fat near the battlefront to make it easily accessible to the white blood cells (in other words, belly fat is a sign of a battle happening in your gut).**** So being overweight is a sign that a battle is going on inside your body.

Lectins also masquerade as certain hormones, in some cases instructing your cells to continually store fat.

Lectins’ fattening effects were beneficial to our ancestors because gaining weight gave them a better chance of surviving winter, when food was scarce. But in today’s context, lectins and their fattening effects are no longer helpful but harmful.

Additionally, human genes are designed to help you live long enough to have offspring to propagate the species, and then die off so that the next generation has enough food and resources to do the same (again, this adaptation is less relevant for humans today). The grain-and-dairy diet does just that, fattening you up and then bringing on diseases that prevent a long, healthy life.

There are countless diets out there—including low carb, ketogenic, and low-fat/whole-grain diets—but most don’t address the root issue, which is that **the food that you eat and products you use trigger biological responses in your body that make you fat or unhealthy.** Additionally, many diets focus on major short-term efforts that produce quick results but don’t change long-term habits, so you gain the weight right back.

### The Plant Paradox Program

The PPP is based on four rules:

  1. What you _don’t_ eat makes a bigger impact than what you _do_ eat. 
  2. Take care of your gut microbes and they’ll take care of you. 
  3. Your body processes fruit like candy. 
  4. You are what you eat—and what the thing you’re eating ate.



Unlike other diets, the PPP doesn’t ask you to count calories. Instead, **you can eat much more food—as long as it’s the _right_ foods—and lose weight.**

Here’s an overview of the PPP’s three phases.

#### Phase 1: Three-Day Cleanse

Phase 1 is an optional three-day cleanse designed to starve the bad bacteria and put your gut in the best condition for Phase 2. Think of it as weeding and preparing the soil before you plant new crops; **a damaged gut doesn’t reap all the benefits possible from good foods.**

The cleanse has three components:

  1. Foods to eat and avoid: Lectin-heavy foods like corn and grain are off-limits, as well as sugar, fruits, and dairy. You can eat organic vegetables such as asparagus, any from the cabbage family, and greens. You can have 8 ounces of protein a day—either pastured chicken, wild-caught fish, hemp tofu, or grain-free tempeh. Certain oils are approved (e.g. extra-virgin olive oil and coconut oil), and drinks are limited to water, coffee, and tea. 
  2. Laxative: You have the option of taking a laxative called Swiss Kriss, or something comparable, the night before the cleanse to clear things out and start with a clean slate to kick-start your results.
  3. Supplements: You can take optional supplements such as grapefruit seed extract, mushroom extracts, and berberine to help kill harmful gut bacteria, fungi, and molds more quickly. 



#### Phase 2: Six-Week Gut Repair

Phase 2 will be at least six weeks, which is how long it’ll take to cement your new eating habits and start to make significant progress on repairing your gut. After the six weeks, you can reintroduce certain lectin-containing food, or you can choose to continue in Phase 2 indefinitely.

**Expect the first two weeks to be tough as you change your habits and potentially even experience some withdrawal symptoms from the foods you’ve eliminated** ; you may have low energy, muscle cramps, headaches, and irritability. But by the end of two weeks, you’ll start to see results.

You’ll eliminate:

  * Whole grains
  * Beans and legumes
  * Peanuts and cashews
  * Dairy products from cows unless they’re from Southern Europe
  * Commercially raised meats
  * Many fruits and seeded vegetables
  * Oils made from lectin-containing foods, such as vegetable, corn, and peanut oil
  * Artificial sweeteners



You’ll eat:

  * Leafy greens, cruciferous, and other vegetables
  * Resistant starches (e.g. plantains and parsnips)
  * Nuts
  * Non-cow dairy (e.g. goat, sheep, buffalo)
  * Wild fish and grass-fed meat
  * Limited fruits, including berries, cherries, and plums
  * Certain oils, including perilla and walnut oil



You’ll also avoid disruptors like antibiotics and NSAIDs, and enhance your results with certain microbe-nourishing supplements.

#### Phase 3: Making The PPP Your Lifestyle

Once you’ve restored a healthy holobiome, you can reintroduce some lectin-containing foods in Phase 3—but if you’re particularly sensitive to lectins, you may not want to reintroduce them at all. **Phase 3 is meant to implement a lifestyle that you can maintain for the rest of your life.**

In Phase 3, you’ll:

  * Continue to eat all PPP-approved foods
  * Continue to avoid most off-limits foods
  * Reintroduce peeled and deseeded nightshade and squash vegetables, immature vegetables, pressure-cooked legumes, and Indian white basmati rice
  * Increase your ketogenic fats, which are in MCT oil and coconut oil
  * Eat less frequently and less food overall
  * Reduce your animal protein intake to 2 ounces (or fewer) per day 
  * Try five days of a calorie-restricted vegan fast per month, regular intermittent fasting, or stretching the time between your meals
  * Maintain your body’s internal clock by aiming to get an hour of daylight each day
  * Avoid blue light in the evenings



### The Ketogenic Plant Paradox Program

If you have cancer, diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, or other forms of dementia, you’ll benefit from the keto version of the PPP. These diseases are the result of your body’s inability to handle all the energy (food) you consume, so shifting the _kind_ of food you eat helps your body rebalance.

**The keto program cuts sugar intake (including sugar from animal protein) in order to reduce your insulin production while raising your fat intake** to help your body begin burning ketones—a special kind of fat—for energy instead of sugar. The fat intake will be from ketone-heavy sources like MCT oil, coconut oil, palm fruit oil, and ghee.

You’ll also

  * Limit animal protein to 2-4 ounces per day
  * Eliminate all fruits except avocados, unripe mangoes, unripe papayas, green bananas, and plantains
  * Eliminate all seeded vegetables except okra
  * Have a tablespoon of MCT oil or coconut oil every few hours when doing intermittent fasting or stretching the time between meals
