## Chapter 5: How Foods Affect Your Body

Whether you came to the Plant Paradox because you’re struggling with weight or with health issues, the two go hand in hand: Being overweight or underweight is a sign that a battle is going on inside your body.

Lectins and LPSs make your immune system wage war against foreign invaders; in order **to fight the war on lectins, your body needs its soldiers—white blood cells—to be well fed, so it diverts calories from your muscles and brain and stores it as fat (fuel) for your white blood cells.** Additionally, your body makes you hungrier so you’ll ingest more calories to fuel the battle.

The fat must be stored near the battlefront to make it easily accessible to the white blood cells, so if you store fat around your belly it’s a sign that the battle is happening in your gut, where lectins and LPSs are breaching your intestinal walls.

Lectins can also destroy the absorptive layer of your intestine, which is designed to take in sugars, fats, and proteins. If this layer gets too damaged, your body can’t absorb nutrients no matter how much you eat, making you skinny and undernourished.

In this chapter, we’ll look at:

  * How the grain-and-dairy diet helped our ancestors survive, but now it’s keeping us from thriving
  * Popular diet approaches and their fatal flaws



### Weight Gain: From Ancient Survival Method to Modern Killer

When humans were hunter-gatherers, their diets consisted of seasonal fruits, seasonal big game, fish and shellfish, and—after discovering how to use fire to cook food—tubers (e.g. sweet potatoes).

After the agricultural revolution, humans started getting many of their calories from grains, legumes, and dairy. The traditional assumption is that people made this shift because grains, legumes, and cheese could all be stored to eat later, allowing people to build a community in one place rather than roaming in constant pursuit of food.

However, until modern times, survival was contingent upon eating and storing sufficient calories for winter, so **the real reason that people switched to a grain-and-dairy diet could likely be because they realized that it promoted weight gain.**

Human genes are wired to help you survive long enough to produce offspring, and then to put your offspring in the best position to make more offspring; your body wants to help you store fat to survive long enough to have some kids, but also prevent you from living too long so that your kids (and their kids) don’t have to skimp on food to share with you. The grain-and-dairy diet does just that, fattening you up and then bringing on diseases that prevent a long, healthy life.

**Lectins were fine for our ancient ancestors, but in today’s context, they’re no longer helpful but harmful.**

#### Whole Grains Signal Your Body to Store Fat

As we talked about, the lectin WGA—which is found in whole grains—has a barcode that fools your body into thinking it’s insulin. To understand how this affects you, let’s look at what jobs insulin does, and what WGA does in its place.

When you eat sugar and the glucose enters your bloodstream, your body releases insulin in response. That insulin then fits into the docking port of three types of cells to give them each instructions on what to do with the sugar.

  1. In fat cells, the insulin instructs the cell to convert the glucose to fat and store it. 
  2. In muscle cells, the insulin helps the cell to absorb the glucose and use it as fuel. 
  3. In nerve cells (neurons), the insulin helps the cell to absorb the glucose and use it as fuel. 



After insulin has given its instructions to each cell, it leaves the docking port, so that the port is available for the next hormone to dock and give its unique instructions. However, lectins like WGA enter the docking ports and never leave, preventing the cells from getting the information they need from other hormones.

This is how WGA behaves when it mimics insulin.

  1. In fat cells, WGA also instructs the cell to convert glucose to fat—but **WGA never un-docks, so it’s constantly telling the cell to grab any sugar that passes by and convert it to fat for storage.** This would’ve helped our ancestors survive by maximizing the fat (and energy) they got from minimal calories, but it’s not necessary for modern humans. 
  2. In muscle cells, WGA simply hogs the docking port, preventing insulin from helping the cell absorb glucose. As a result, the glucose is sent off to another fat cell and the muscle gradually weakens without the necessary fuel. 
  3. In nerve cells and neurons, WGA also blocks insulin from helping the cells absorb sugar. The consequences to this are twofold: First, it makes your brain think you need more calories and prompts you to eat more (again, this would’ve been a benefit to our ancestors when winter rolled around). Second, it starves brain and nerve cells, contributing to dementia, Parkinson’s, and peripheral neuropathy. 



#### Resistant Starches: Alternative Carbs

There is a subset of starches called resistant starches—such as yams, taro, and plantains—that don’t have the fattening, disease-inducing effects of corn, rice, wheat, and other starches. Resistant starches don’t get broken down into glucose (blood sugar), but instead pass through the small intestine intact.

**Since resistant starches don’t become sugar, your body doesn’t release fat-storing insulin.** Furthermore, resistant starches nourish and increase the amount of good gut microbes, which has multiple benefits:

  * Helping digestion and nutrient absorption
  * Nurturing the mucous layer in your gut, which helps prevent lectins from breaching the intestinal wall



Resistant starches also help control weight gain by:

  * Reducing calorie intake when you substitute them for wheat flour and other carbs
  * Helping you feel full longer
  * Promoting fat burning and minimizing fat storage



### The Problem with Diets and Exercise

There are countless diets out there, including Atkins, South Beach, ketogenic, paleo, Mediterranean, raw food, Weight Watchers, and Zone, to name some. But most diets don’t address the root issue, which is that **the food that we eat and products we use trigger biological responses in your body that makes you fat or unhealthy.** Additionally, many diets focus on major short-term efforts that produce quick results but don’t change long-term habits, so you gain the weight right back.

When you know how foods and other products affect your body, you can make choices that keep your body happy, and your weight will naturally stabilize.

Many people also rely on exercise to shed pounds, but several studies show that exercise is not an effective way to _lose_ weight; rather, exercise is more effective at helping you _maintain_ your weight. Of course, exercise also has many other benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, blood pressure, balance, mood, energy, and sleep.

#### A Breakdown of Popular Diets

**Low carb** diets—such as Atkins, South Beach, and Paleo—encourage high protein intake and cut lectin-containing grains and legumes. This often makes them successful in the short term, but when dieters reintroduce the grains and legumes back into their diet in the maintenance phase of these programs, they typically gain the weight back. Even when dieters continue restricting their carbs, their weight loss typically plateaus.

**Ketogenic** diet is another low-carb diet, but this program also limits proteins and encourages dieters to get most of their calories from fats. A ketogenic diet is often successful for people with diabetes or other insulin resistance, as well as people with cancer, dementia, Parkinson’s, autoimmune diseases, and gut diseases. However, it’s more likely that the results come from eliminating many lectin-containing foods rather than eating fats. (There is a keto version of the PPP that we’ll explain in chapter 10.)

**Low-fat, whole-grain** diets—such as Ornish, Esselstyn, and T. Colin Campbell—incorporate lectins, so these diets don’t prevent the progression of coronary artery disease. (Shortform note: Read our summary of T. Colin Campbell’s The China Study here.) However, dieters do still tend to lose weight; this is likely attributable to four factors.

  1. While dieters still eat lectin-containing grains, they eliminate lectin-containing fats, including soy, peanut, cottonseed, sunflower, and canola, which are high in polyunsaturated omega-6 fats. 
  2. Dieters’ low fat intake impedes LPSs from getting through the gut wall via saturated fatty acids and causing inflammation. 
  3. Dieters are encouraged to eat whole unprocessed grains, as opposed to the ground-up grains that are common in most food products labeled “whole grain.” The ground-up grains are worse because the lectins have been released and because they contain the endocrine-disrupting preservative BHT. 
  4. Dieters focus on organic whole grains, which are less likely to have Roundup chemicals that kill the microbes, including those that help you process gluten. 



#### Red Meat Makes Your Body Attack Itself

Diets that are heavy in animal protein—particularly red meat—contribute to your aging and the development of heart disease and cancer.

To explain, let’s take a step back: Lectins bind with a specific sugar molecule called Neu5Ac, which is on your blood vessel lining and on cells on the intestinal wall. Humans (along with shellfish, mollusks, chickens, and elephants) produce Neu5Ac, making us vulnerable to lectins’ effects; most mammals produce another sugar molecule—Neu5Gc—that lectins don’t bind to, meaning those animals can eat grains and legumes without problems.

Cows, pigs, and sheep have Neu5Gc, so when you eat their meat your body looks at those sugar molecules as foreign and mounts an attack. However, Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac have very similar barcodes, so **while your immune system is waging war on the foreign molecules, it accidentally also attacks your own blood vessel lining**.

Additionally, cancer cells use Neu5Gc (the ones you get from eating red meat) in two ways: to attract blood vessels to grow toward them, encouraging tumor growth, and to hide from your immune system.
