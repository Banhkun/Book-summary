## Chapter 10: The Keto Version of PPP

The keto version of PPP is beneficial for people with cancer, diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and other forms of dementia because these diseases result from metabolic derangement, or your body’s inability to handle all the energy (food) you consume. Let’s explain.

All the cells in your body have mitochondria that are responsible for turning sugars and fats into the energy the cells need to function. Your body’s natural circadian rhythm—between day and night as well as summer and winter—create cycles of busy times (day and summer) and slower times (night and winter) for the mitochondria.

When your mitochondria are on night/winter mode, your body switches to using ketones for fuel instead of sugars; ketones are a special kind of fat that are much easier than sugar to convert to energy, so the mitochondria doesn’t have to work as hard. Think of it like a hybrid car, which runs on electrical energy when the gas is out.

However,**if you’re eating too much sugar and protein (which turns into sugar) consistently, your mitochondria are constantly in overdrive. After a while, they can’t keep up** and things start to go awry.

When you eat sugar or protein, your pancreas releases insulin to transport sugar to the mitochondria to become energy. If your mitochondria can’t keep up with all the sugar, they send it away and, as Plan B, the insulin takes the sugar to fat cells to turn it into fat to store for later.

Additionally, when your mitochondria is overloaded, your energy levels suffer and your brain feels starved of energy. With insufficient energy to function, your immune system is weakened, which allows harmful cells like cancer to move in and feast on the excess sugar.

### Ketones

To promote weight loss, you want your body to stop diverting extra sugar to fat cells and instead start burning that fat for energy. In order for the mitochondria to use the fat for energy, an enzyme called lipase has to turn fat into a ketone—but insulin blocks this enzyme from working, so **you can’t start burning fat until your insulin levels drop**.

To reduce your insulin levels, you have to start by cutting your sugar and protein consumption. However, most people on the standard American diet still have enough insulin in their systems to block lipase from working, so you’ll need some extra help: Plants create ketones that are present in certain foods, and **eating ketone-containing foods will kickstart your body into ketosis, so it starts to break down your fats into ketones and burning those for energy.**

Some sources of ketones include

  * MCT (medium-chain triglycerides) oil, which is 100% ketones
  * Solid coconut oil (solid below 70 degrees), which is 65% ketones
  * Red palm oil—or palm fruit oil—which is 50% ketones
  * Butyrate (found in butter, ghee, and goat butter), which 



Let’s look at how ketones can help your body ward off diseases.

#### Cancer

Unlike normal cells, cancer cells can’t generate energy from ketones; they get energy from fermenting sugar, just as yeast and bacteria do. Furthermore, they prefer fructose (the sugar in fruit) to glucose.

This is an inefficient way to get energy, meaning that cancer cells need way more sugar to grow than normal cells. In other words, **if you cut down on sugar, you can starve the cancer cells**. (Shortform note: Studies show that ketogenic diets—either alone or in conjunction with a calorie-restricted diet and/or other therapies—help suppress tumor growth in several types of cancer, including colon, lung, prostate, and pancreatic cancer).

By contrast, your brain and heart can thrive on ketones, so you’ll be doing the rest of your body no harm while you’re starving the cancer cells of sugar.

#### Diabetes and Kidney Problems

Unlike sugars from carbs and proteins, **ketones don’t need insulin to transport them to mitochondria so they can be converted to energy**. In other words, people with diabetes should up their fat (ketone) intake while reducing their carbs, sugars, and protein.

The same goes for people with kidney issues.

Kidneys have two main functions:

  1. Expel water from what you drink and eat
  2. Filter out the by-products of protein



If you have kidney problems, limit your protein and fruit in particular.

Think of food like fuel in your car: Protein is like diesel and gives off fumes when it burns, so the kidney has to filter out that waste. By contrast, ketones are like natural gas and burn clean, so your kidneys don’t have to work.

Fruit is harmful because most of the fructose goes to the liver, where it turns into triglycerides, which lead to heart disease, and uric acid, which increases blood pressure, damages your kidneys, and causes gout. Remember that humans used to only eat fruit during the few months of summer—for the purpose of fattening up for winter—which gave their bodies the rest of the year to recoup from the negative side effects.

### The Keto Plant Paradox Program

If you have any of the conditions caused by metabolic derangement then you should follow the keto version of the PPP. The main differences are

  * Cut the amount of animal protein from 8 to 2-4 ounces per day (cancer patients should cut all animal protein)
  * Eliminate all fruits except avocados, unripe mangoes, unripe papayas, green bananas, and plantains
  * Eliminate seeded vegetables (which are botanically fruits) except okra 
  * Make macadamias your main nut
  * Be sure extra dark chocolate is at least 90% cacao
  * Use foods like vegetables as a way to load up on approved fats (e.g. salad with lots of olive oil)
  * When you do intermittent fasting or wait long intervals between meals, have a tablespoon of MCT oil or coconut oil every few hours; every month or two, eliminate one dose of these in-between oil shots 



* * *

If you have cancer, memory problems, or neurological issues, stay on the keto version of the PPP for the rest of your life. On the other hand, if you used the keto version because of obesity, kidney issues, or diabetes, once your health improves you can switch to the regular version of PPP and start with Phase 2; however, if your health starts to decline after switching, go back to the keto version.
