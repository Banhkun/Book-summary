## Chapter 3: Protect Your Holobiome and It Will Protect You

You have about five pounds’ worth of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, molds, viruses, and worms in your intestines, on your skin, and in the air around you. Collectively all these critters—called microbes—make up your holobiome.

**Microbes live and feed on you, but your well-being is also dependent on them.** Most of your microbes live in your gastrointestinal (GI) tract—your gut; these make up your microbiome. These microbes have several critical jobs:

  * Break down and digest food, extracting the energy and distributing it to you in the form of fats
  * Act as a first response team for your immune system, detecting harmless or harmful proteins and bacteria
  * Absorb materials through food
  * Protect you from outside objects passing through your intestines
  * Communicate with your brain and control certain body functions



To understand why the microbes’ functions are so important, you must understand how the GI tract is designed to work.

### What’s Inside Your GI Tract Shouldn’t Escape to the Rest of Your Body

Think of your GI tract as a tunnel under a river: When you drive through the tunnel, you’re not _in_ the river, you’re just passing _through_ it. Similarly, food that passes through your intestines is not _in_ your body as much as it’s passing _through_ it.

Recall from chapter 1 that the intestinal wall is formed of tightly locked cells designed to prevent big molecules from passing through to the rest of your body. The microbes in your GI tract break down food into tiny molecules of amino acids, fatty acids, and sugar, which _should_ be the only things that pass through the intestinal wall.

However,**lectins and LPSs can breach the intestinal wall, prompting the immune system to attack.** Additionally, regular use of Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. Advil, Motrin, ibuprofen, Aleve, and aspirin) damages the protective mucus layer that lines the intestinal walls, making you even more susceptible to foreign objects breaking through the barrier and entering your body.

Although microbes help you survive and thrive when they’re in the intestine and doing their jobs, **if microbes escape through your breached intestinal wall into your body, they become another invader for your immune system to attack, wreaking havoc on your health.**

### Good and Bad Microbes

You and your microbes have a symbiotic relationship: You rely on them (whether or not you know it) and they rely on you. As such, it’s in your microbes’ best interest to keep you in good health; they’re in constant communication with your brain and body to control your hormones, appetite, cravings, and other functions.

But this balance can be disrupted.

If you kill your good microbes with certain foods and products—or starve them by _not_ eating certain foods—bad microbes can take over and harm your health. Bad microbes have no interest in keeping you healthy. They only want what benefits them; **bad microbes hijack the communication between your gut and your brain and drive you to crave sugars, fats, and unhealthy foods that nourish them but harm your health.** When we get into the details of the PPP later, you’ll see that the first step to recovery is getting rid of your bad microbes so the good ones can regain control.
