Removing from Favorites 

## Chapter 7: PPP Phase 1, The Cleanse

Phase 1 is a three-day cleanse, or modified fast, designed to starve the bad bacteria and put your gut in the best condition for Phase 2; think of it as weeding and preparing the soil before you plant new crops.

Phase 1 is optional—you can skip straight to eliminating and adding the right foods in Phase 2—but it will take a little longer to see results if you don’t start with the cleanse because **a damaged gut doesn’t reap all the benefits possible from good foods.** If you choose to do Phase 1, be sure to begin Phase 2 immediately after; otherwise, you’ll lose the positive effects of the cleanse.

By the end of the cleanse, you’ll:

  * Have a new balance of good and bad gut microbes (more good than bad) 
  * Lose a few pounds of mostly water weight
  * Reduce inflammation



The cleanse has three components:

  1. Foods to eat and avoid
  2. Laxative
  3. Supplements



### Component 1: Foods to Eat and Avoid

During the cleanse, these are the foods that are off-limits:

  * Canola
  * Corn 
  * Dairy 
  * Eggs
  * Farm animal meat (e.g. beef) 
  * Fruit
  * Grains or pseudo-grains
  * Nightshade plants 
  * Roots (e.g. beets, carrots, ginger)
  * Seeds
  * Soy
  * Sugar
  * Tubers (e.g. potatoes, jicama, and yams)



Now let’s look at what you _can_ eat.

Vegetables should be organic, in season, and grown locally and sustainably, if possible. They can be fresh or frozen, and you can have as much as you want, either cooked or raw.

  * Artichokes
  * Asparagus
  * Cabbages (e.g. bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kale, and mustard greens)
  * Celery
  * Greens (e.g. endive, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, and watercress)
  * Fennel
  * Fresh herbs (e.g. mint, parsley, basil, and cilantro)
  * Garlic
  * Ocean vegetables (e.g. kelp, seaweed, and nori)
  * Onions (including leeks and chives)
  * Radishes



(Shortform note: Some vegetables approved for the cleanse—such as onions, garlic, and artichokes—are considered root vegetables, despite the fact that roots are on the off-limits list.)

You can eat no more than 8 ounces of protein a day in two 4-ounce portions.

  * Hemp tofu
  * Pastured chicken
  * Tempeh without grains
  * Wild-caught fish (e.g. salmon, shellfish, mollusks)



Fats and oils:

  * Avocado oil
  * Coconut oil
  * Extra-virgin olive oil (cook at low heat, never high heat)
  * Flaxseed oil (not heated)
  * Hemp seed oil (not heated)
  * MCT oil (also called liquid coconut oil)
  * One whole Hass avocado per day
  * Perilla oil
  * Sesame seed oil
  * Walnut oil



You can have one or two snacks a day. They may be lettuce boats filled with guacamole, half an avocado seasoned with lemon juice, or one-quarter cup of approved nuts, including walnuts, pistachios, and macadamia nuts.

For condiments and seasonings, avoid any pre-packaged salad dressings and sauces. Instead, opt for:

  * Fresh lemon juice
  * Herbs
  * Mustard
  * Spices
  * Vinegar



You should start each day with a green smoothie; this smoothie combines spinach, romaine lettuce, avocado, mint, fresh lemon juice, and stevia extract, along with some water and ice. Your drink choices for the rest of the day are

  * 8 cups of water (tap, sparkling mineral, or still mineral) per day
  * Green, black, and herbal tea
  * Regular or decaf coffee



You can use stevia extract or Just Like Sugar to sweeten your tea and coffee.

Additionally, be sure to get at least eight hours of sleep and exercise regularly, outdoors if possible.

**During the cleanse, you may still crave off-limits foods while the bad microbes are still dying off.** If you find you’re still hungry, eat more of the approved vegetables; don’t eat more than the recommended amounts of guacamole, avocado, fish, or chicken. A few glasses of water may also ease your hunger.

### Component 2: Laxative

Component 2 is to take an herbal laxative called Swiss Kriss, or something comparable, the night before beginning the cleanse. This component is optional, but it serves the same purpose as beginning the PPP with the cleanse: **The laxative clears things out and starts with a clean slate to kick-start your results.**

The laxative contains anise seed, calendula flower, hibiscus, peach leaves, caraway seeds, peppermint oil, strawberry leaves, and the active ingredient senna, or sennosides. These ingredients get rid of the bad microbes.

### Component 3: Supplements

Component 3 is to take natural supplements to enhance the effects of your cleanse. This component is also optional, but can help kill harmful gut bacteria, fungi, and molds more quickly; this is strongly recommended if you have leaky gut, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or an autoimmune condition.

Helpful supplements include:

  * Grapefruit seed extract
  * Mushrooms or mushroom extracts
  * Oregon grape root extract (or berberine, the active ingredient)
  * Spices, including cloves, cinnamon, black pepper, and wormwood
