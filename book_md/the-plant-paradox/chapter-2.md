## Chapter 2: The Rise of Lectins and Their Effects

If humans have been eating plants for thousands of years, why are they just causing problems now?

In this chapter, we’ll look at the main factors that put a heavy lectin load in the human diet and how it affects our body’s natural functions to make us sick.

### Four Major Changes in the Human Diet

Your gut bacteria tell your immune system which compounds are safe to the body and which pose a threat. The gut bacteria and immune system continually learn what’s safe and what’s not as the human diet changes, and it’s been adapting this way for more than 80 million years.

But **relatively recently, humans’ diets have changed drastically and exposed our gut bacteria to new compounds that they don’t know what to do with.** That’s why humans are facing illnesses like obesity and type 2 diabetes—we’re simply maladapted to many of the foods we eat.

There are four factors that brought about this major change.

#### Factor #1: The Agricultural Revolution

About 10,000 years ago, the Agricultural Revolution ushered in the harvesting of grains and legumes (beans) to store and eat when needed—more convenient than fruit, which had to be eaten during a narrow window of ripeness. **Not only did the agricultural revolution introduce grain and beans into the human diet for the first time, but it also made them the primary food source.**

This was a shift from a diet of mainly leaves, tubers (like sweet potatoes), and some animal fat and proteins—and humans’ gut bacteria and immune systems still haven’t adapted. Although the Agricultural Revolution was critical for the survival and growth of civilization, it led to health problems such as diabetes, obesity, clogged arteries, and tooth decay.

#### Factor #2: Casein A-1 Cows

About 2,000 years ago, **a mutation in Northern European cows caused them to produce a different kind of protein in their milk that causes problems for people during digestion**. Previously cows had produced a protein called casein A-2, but these cows began producing casein A-1. During digestion, casein A-1 turns into a protein similar to lectin that causes your immune system to attack your pancreas.

Unfortunately, A-1 cows are the most common breed for producing milk. The good news is, A-2 dairy products are becoming increasingly available.

#### Factor #3: Foreign Food from the New World

About 500 years ago, when Europeans landed in the Americas, they brought foreign food from the New World back with them to Europe. **People in Europe, Asia, and Africa had never before been exposed to these New World foods, and 500 years isn’t enough for gut bacteria to adapt to them.**

These foods included:

  * The nightshade family, including tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers
  * The bean family, including peanuts and cashews
  * Grains
  * Pseudo-grains, including quinoa 
  * The squash family, including pumpkins, acorn, squash, and zucchini
  * Chia and some other seeds



#### Factor #4: Processed Food and Chemicals

In the past 50 years, the rise of processed food and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has introduced a whole new array of lectins that our bodies haven’t adapted to tolerate. Compared to the three factors we just discussed,**processed food has had the most dramatic impact on people’s health, because diets have changed so drastically at such a rapid pace** : Fast food, microwave meals, and other processed foods have become a major part of many people’s diets.

Additionally, humans are being exposed to more chemicals that destroy certain gut bacteria that would’ve otherwise helped us process some of these lectins. As a result, **we’re less able to process lectins at the same time we’re consuming them more heavily than ever before.**

These chemicals are found in:

  * Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Advil, Motrin, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naprosyn, Mobic, Celebrex, and aspirin
  * Antibiotics
  * Fertilizers
  * Herbicides
  * Food additives
  * Skin-care products
  * Air fresheners
  * Hand sanitizers 



Around the 1950s, hybrid produce that could withstand long-distance shipping became more prevalent, giving shoppers year-round access to fruits and vegetables. However, the hybrid plants hadn’t existed long enough to develop natural defenses against cold weather, weeds, and insects, so they had to be manipulated in two ways that are harmful to consumers’ health.

  1. Farmers rely on pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides to keep their crops alive and profitable. 
  2. **Scientists insert genes that make the hybrid plants produce more lectins in order to increase their resistance to bugs and pests.** This is one type of GMO. 



### Gluten: The Scapegoat of Lectins

Gluten—a form of lectin that is found in wheat, barley, rye, and oats—has gotten a lot of bad press in recent years. For people with celiac disease, avoiding gluten can be a matter of life and death. Some people who don’t suffer from celiac disease do still have gluten sensitivity, resulting in joint pain, inflammation, and brain fog.

#### The Dangers of Wheat

Of the four sources of gluten, wheat is the most prevalent in most people’s diets, and not only does it have addictive qualities, but it also promotes weight gain.

This means, contrary to what you’ve been taught, **_white_ bread and white rice are less fattening and easier on your digestive system than wheat bread and brown rice. **Skeptical? Consider this: The billions of people in Asia who eat rice as a staple in their diets eat white rice, and on the whole, they don’t suffer from epidemics of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes as commonly as Americans do.

Gluten is actually not the most harmful lectin in wheat—wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is. WGA is found in the bran (that’s what makes whole grain bread brown) and is smaller than most lectins, so it passes more easily through the intestinal wall. WGA tends to bond to joint cartilage, prompting an immune system attack on the joints, which results in inflammation and joint pain.

Furthermore, WGA has these following harmful effects:

  * Acts like insulin, causing weight gain and insulin resistance by pumping sugar into fat cells, where that sugar turns into fat
  * Blocks sugar from nourishing muscles, instead turning that sugar into fat
  * Impedes digestion of protein
  * Contributes to inflammation 
  * Reacts with other proteins, producing antibodies that prompt the immune system to attack healthy cells
  * Crosses the blood-brain barrier (the border between circulating blood and the brain), bringing whatever cells it’s bonded to, which causes neurological issues
  * Kills cells indiscriminately
  * Interferes with DNA replication 
  * Causes the arteries to harden with plaque (atherosclerosis)
  * Helps viruses enter the body
  * Promotes kidney inflammation (nephritis)



When people go gluten-free, they eliminate wheat, barley, rye, and oats from their diets, opting for alternatives like flours made from corn, buckwheat, quinoa, and other grains and pseudo-grains. Although they’re avoiding the lectins gluten and WGA, these **gluten-free foods are still full of other lectins, so while people think they’re sparing their guts, they’re still consuming gut-disrupting lectins.**

#### The Hidden Chemicals in Your Food

Besides WGA, there are other culprits in your bread that can cause problems that you may be mistakenly blaming on gluten.

**Transglutaminase** is a binding agent that has replaced yeast in many American commercial baked goods since 1950. Yeast ferments and naturally destroys lectins in wheat, reducing their harm on your gut; without yeast, you’re eating a lot more lectins.

Transglutaminase is also used to bind ground meat and seafood (like fake crab), and in gluten-free bread to make it fluffier. But**ironically, transglutaminase can _make_ you sensitive to gluten even if you’re not otherwise gluten-sensitive.** Additionally, transglutaminase can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause gluten ataxia, a condition similar to Parkinson’s.

**Butyl hydroxytoluene (BHT)** is a preservative used in processed foods that have whole grains to prevent them from becoming rancid. However, BHT is an endocrine disruptor that acts like estrogen (we’ll talk more about endocrine disruptors in chapter 4); **BHT can stimulate fat storage, contribute to early puberty in girls, and is even used in embalming fluid.**

### The Lectin Paradox

Now that we’ve outlined how harmful lectins can be, you may be surprised to learn that certain lectins, in moderation, actually have health _benefits_. This can be explained by the concept of hormesis—or “the dose makes the poison”—which says that compounds that are beneficial in moderation can be harmful in excess.

**In limited amounts, the toxins in lectins put a mild strain on your immune system and cells, which ultimately strengthens it.** (Shortform note: This is similar to the way vaccines work.) A widely varied diet has major health benefits by exposing you to smaller amounts of many different types of nutrients and lectins; our ancestors evolved as a traveling species, and thus ate a huge variety of plants through their travels.

Certain lectins teach your immune system to resist pneumonia and other viruses, while others curb the growth of the HIV virus. Still others can have healing properties, and some lectins may even have the potential to treat cancer (Shortform note: Research for this is ongoing).

It’s only when you have too many of the same lectins in your system that your body’s natural functions start to go awry.

### Your Body Uses Patterns to Keep You Healthy

Pattern matching is a computer science term for seeking patterns in sequences; when you start typing search terms into Google, it looks for patterns and makes search suggestions.

Your body uses pattern matching to determine which season it is: When you eat sweet foods, your body thinks it’s summer because that’s when fruit is ripe and in-season fruit used to be the only sweet food available to humans. **If your body thinks it’s summer, it knows it needs to store fat for the upcoming winter, and if it thinks it’s winter then it focuses on burning fat to survive.** Your food choice and lectin intake can confuse your body and disrupt this pattern.

Additionally, your body uses pattern matching to know when your immune system needs to attack a foreign invader to protect your health, but lectins cause unnecessary immune responses that lead to inflammation and disease.

#### Health Problems Arise When Patterns Are Similar

Your immune system uses two main types of receptors to keep your body in good working order.

  1. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) determine whether any protein that enters the body is harmless or harmful. Each protein has something like a barcode, and the TLRs scan this barcode to identify what the protein is and whether the immune system needs to attack. 
  2. G-protein coupled receptors (G-spotters) are the docking ports on cells (mentioned in chapter 1), which scan hormones, enzymes, and cytokines for instructions about what the cell is supposed to do. 



The immune system uses TLRs and G-spotters to look for patterns to determine which proteins are friend or foe, and it shares that information with the rest of the body so the defenses can react more quickly and effectively next time a threat enters the body. (Shortform note: This is how vaccines work: The small dose of a virus is enough to teach the body how to respond if it’s exposed again.)

However,**since lectins are designed to hurt plant predators, they have barcodes that look similar to harmful barcodes, so the body begins attacking itself.**

Additionally, the confusion can compound and cause even bigger problems. This is the chain of events that can lead to an autoimmune disease:

  1. Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are fragments of bacteria that your body mistakes for full-strength bacteria, so your immune system responds with a full-fledged attack, causing inflammation. 
  2. When your immune system detects lectins that look similar to the LPSs, it ups its attack, causing more inflammation. 
  3. The lectins also look similar to many of the proteins on your organs, nerves, and joints; your immune system sees these proteins and thinks they’re lectins. In an effort to defend your body from further harm, the immune system intensifies the attack even more, now against your own proteins.
