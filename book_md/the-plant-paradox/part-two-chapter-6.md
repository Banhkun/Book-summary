## Part Two | Chapter 6: The Plant Paradox Program

We’ve learned about how lectins harm your gut and send your immune system into attack mode and how disruptors damage your holobiome. The Plant Paradox Program is designed to counteract all this by eliminating lectins and disruptors and focusing on foods that nourish your good microbes to keep you at a healthy weight and keep diseases at bay.

The PPP is based on four rules.

  1. **What you _don’t_ eat makes a bigger impact than what you _do_ eat.** Of course, what you _do_ eat is still important, but the biggest results will come from eliminating lectin-heavy foods and allowing your gut to heal. 
  2. **Take care of your gut microbes and they’ll take care of you.** Your microbes are key to keeping you healthy; they help you digest and get nutrients from food, they assist your immune system, they help control hormones and appetite, and they keep bad microbes at bay. To allow them to do their jobs, you need to eliminate the antibiotics, antacids, NSAIDs, and processed foods that kill off your ecosystem of microbes. 
  3. **Your body processes fruit like candy.** Remember that any time your body detects sweetness (even if it’s fruit or sugar-free artificial sweeteners), it reacts the same way—by storing fat. There are only a few fruits that won’t have this effect: 
     * Unripe bananas
     * Unripe mangoes
     * Unripe papayas
     * Avocados
  4. **You are what you eat—and what the thing you’re eating ate.** In other words, when you eat meat, you’re also eating whatever that livestock was fed, and that’s often corn and soy. 



Unlike other diets, the PPP doesn’t ask you to count calories. Instead, the focus is on the type of food you’re eating; much of the PPP-approved foods have calories that will actually feed your microbes, so you won’t absorb all the calories you consume. That’s why **you can eat much more food—as long as it’s the _right_ foods—and lose weight.**

### The PPP: An Overview

The PPP consists of three phases, which we’ll explore more in-depth in the next few chapters. Here’s an overview:

**Phase 1: A three-day cleanse** wipes the slate clean by nourishing your good microbes and getting rid of your bad ones. This helps you to start healing your gut, but you must follow up immediately with Phase 2 to avoid backsliding.

**Phase 2: Eliminate or cut down on certain foods and eat more of others.**

Here are the foods you’ll cut down on or cut out entirely:

  * Eliminate major lectins, including grains, legumes, corn, and soybeans
  * Eliminate most saturated fats, including whole-grain foods
  * Eliminate sugars (including fruit) and artificial sweeteners
  * Eliminate industrial farm-raised and free-range poultry and livestock, as well as farm-raised fish
  * Eliminate crops sprayed with Roundup
  * Eliminate GMO foods
  * Avoid all endocrine-disrupting products
  * Reduce omega-6 fats



Here’s what you’ll eat:

  * All leafy greens
  * Certain vegetables
  * Tubers and other resistant starches
  * Omega-3 fats, including fish oil, perilla oil, flaxseed oil, avocado oil, walnut oil, olive oil, and macadamia nut oil
  * No more than 8 ounces of animal protein a day, typically from wild-caught fish and shellfish as well as eggs from pastured chickens
  * No more than 4 ounces of your daily protein should come from grass-fed or pasture-raised meat
  * A small serving of nuts, guacamole, or half a Hass avocado for a snack
  * Limited dairy products from specific cow breeds or from sheep, goats, and water buffalo



**Phase 3:** In this optional phase, you’ll **reduce your animal protein to just 2 to 4 ounces a day, and begin some form of fasting** —either a monthly vegan fast, intermittent fasting, or lengthening time between meals.

> **Avoiding Ubiquitous Corn**
> 
> When you start the PPP you’ll realize that corn is _everywhere_ : Fast food and processed food use corn oil, cornstarch, cornmeal, corn syrup, and other corn products—even meat contains corn from the animals’ feed.
> 
> What’s worse, most of the corn fed to livestock is a GMO called Bt corn. Bt corn has a gene for a powerful lectin that no one is immune to. This corn also contributes to osteopenia and osteoporosis in chickens; per rule number 4, that means you’re at a higher risk of these diseases, as well, when you eat the meat and eggs from those chickens.

#### The PPP for Vegetarians and Vegans

Vegetarians and vegans need alternative sources of protein and often rely heavily on beans and legumes. While these are generally off-limits because of their lectins, preparing them in **a pressure cooker actually destroys the lectins and makes beans and legumes PPP-approved** ; additionally, pressure-cooked beans are great nourishment for good microbes and improve memory and longevity.

The pressure cooker also makes other lectin-containing foods PPP-friendly, including

  * The nightshade family (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers) 
  * The squash family
  * Certain grains and pseudo-grains



#### Reducing Protein

Although it may seem daunting to limit your protein to 8 (and eventually 4) ounces a day, you don’t need as much protein as you probably think.

You only need .37 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight (1 kilogram equals 2.2 pounds). In other words, **a 150-pound person needs 25 grams of protein a day, and a 125-pound person only 21 grams.**

Furthermore, you’re already getting most of that protein from inside your own body: Your mucus and intestinal lining cells contain protein, so each day your body recycles and digests about 20 grams of protein without eating a single egg or piece of meat.

### Ditch the Excuses

The PPP isn’t just about losing weight, it’s about taking care of your body to live a long, healthy life.

These are some of the most common excuses for not trying the PPP—and the reasons they don’t hold water.

**Excuse 1: You’re already fit and active.** Although you may exercise regularly, eat foods you believe are healthy, and appear trim and fit, this is no guarantee that your insides are in great health; you can still be at risk for serious diseases down the road if you don’t take care of your gut and internal health.

**Excuse 2: You think you have to understand nutrition and metabolism.** It helps to understand the rationale behind the PPP, but when it comes down to it, all you need to know is which foods to eat and which to avoid.

**Excuse 3: You think you’re too old to make such significant changes in your life.** You’re never too old to make positive changes or to reap the benefits of those changes. About 90 percent of your cells renew every three months, and they’ll benefit from high-quality, nourishing food.
