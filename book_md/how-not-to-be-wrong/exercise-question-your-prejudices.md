## Exercise: Question Your Prejudices

O’Brien calls his book _How Not to Be Wrong_ , but it could just as easily be called “How Not to Be Prejudiced,” as most of what O’Brien says he was wrong about are his negative attitudes toward groups of people. It takes courage to acknowledge your own prejudices, but doing so can be the first step toward combating them—and getting to the root of why you feel the way you do.

* * *

Everyone has prejudices. However illogical or unfounded your opinions on a particular group of people may be, describe your thoughts and feelings about this group.

Using the questions O’Brien asks to get at the root of his negative feelings toward others, ask yourself: (1) What are you afraid of? (2) What are you _really_ angry about? (3) How would you feel if the roles were reversed? Before answering these questions, take a moment to consider how negative experiences in your childhood may be affecting the prejudices you hold in the present.

Do you believe that your childhood experiences shaped your feelings about this group? If yes, how so?
