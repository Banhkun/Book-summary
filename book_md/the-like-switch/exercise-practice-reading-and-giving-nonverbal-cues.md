## Exercise: Practice Reading and Giving Nonverbal Cues

You just learned all about the importance of nonverbal communication in forming friendships. Take a moment to practice interpreting and applying nonverbal cues in a hypothetical scenario.

* * *

Imagine you’re at a work-related party. You want to get to know a new hire in your department, but you haven’t had much chance to talk at work yet. You see her walk into the party, and you decide this is a good chance to try and get to know her a little. What are three nonverbal cues you could use to get her attention and show her that you’re interested in being her friend?

You got your coworker’s attention, and now you’re having a conversation. As she responds to your questions, she smiles, and she tilts her head to the side. What might these cues indicate about her willingness to be your friend?

You get onto the topic of your favorite places to eat in town, and you mention that you could never be a vegetarian. At this, she crosses her arms and leans back, breaking eye contact. Based on these cues, how does she feel about your statement?

You move on to a different conversation topic. She’s talking animatedly, and it’s obvious the subject interests her. What are two ways you could show that you’re interested in what she has to say?
