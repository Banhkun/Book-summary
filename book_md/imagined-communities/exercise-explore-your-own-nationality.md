## Exercise: Explore Your Own Nationality

Think about how you identify with your nationality.

* * *

Think about your nationality. How significant a role does it play in your personal identity?

Are there stereotypes or broad characteristics associated with your nationality? If so, do you feel that you embrace these or do you consciously attempt to downplay them? Describe your answer.

Would you be willing to make personal sacrifices for the good of your nation? Explain why or why not.
