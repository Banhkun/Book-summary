## Exercise: Prepare for Your Discussions With Customers

Prepare to talk to your customers and gain valuable insight into your business idea.

* * *

First, describe the customer segment you’d like to focus on. Ask yourself questions to narrow down your target demographic from a generic audience to specific subsets. (For example, ask yourself “Which customers would be most interested in my product?”)

Next, write down three learning objectives for your conversations with that customer segment. Then, write at least one interview question for each objective, following the three rules of the Mom Test. (For example, if your objective is to discover potential competitors, you could ask customers “What products have you used so far to solve your problem?”)

Finally, brainstorm how you could find customers to talk to. Consider a place you could go to find your ideal customer, an event you could hold to attract your customer segment, or any other way you can think of to get in conversation with potential customers. (For example, you could buy drinks for strangers at a local microbrewery, host a fun run, or try to start conversations with strangers on Twitter.) Write your top five ideas.
