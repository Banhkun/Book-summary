## Part 3-3: Alcohol and Transparency

The assumption of transparency is clearly a problem for trained police professionals attempting to make sense of a suspect and seasoned judges trying to read a defendant. But **the assumption of transparency also has devastating effects for young people across the nation**.

For example, approximately one in five American female college students has been a victim of sexual assault. Many of these cases follow a similar pattern:

  1. Two young people (often strangers) meet and have a conversation.
  2. At some point, a sexual encounter begins.
  3. One party feels violated by the encounter. 
  4. Later on, it is difficult to reconstruct how things escalated: Was there consent from both parties? If not, did one person actively ignore the other’s objection? Or did one person simply misunderstand the other’s sexual intentions? 



It has been established that it is nearly impossible to judge a person’s general intentions based on their behavior or expressions. So how can we expect young, immature people to judge a person’s _sexual_ intentions based on their behavior?

There are two major elements that contribute to this pattern of sexual assault among young people:

  1. **There are no hard and fast rules about what constitutes consent, so people are forced to make assumptions** : In a 2015 study, 1,000 college students were asked whether sexual activity when _both_ people have not clearly given consent should be considered sexual assault. Half of the students answered that they were unsure. What are the implications of the fact that half of all young people are _unsure_ whether consent needs to be clearly given in a sexual interaction? How can we expect young people to respect boundaries if there is no real consensus of what those boundaries are?
  2. **Alcohol makes it much more difficult to express yourself and to understand others, and young people are often drunk during these sexual encounters** : Alcohol puts the drinker into a transformative state of myopia in which only the short-term seems important and longer-term consequences are easy to ignore. Even more problematic, many young people drink to a state of “blackout.” (Myopia and blackout are discussed more fully below). 



**The misunderstanding of consent is essentially an assumption of transparency gone wrong, and alcohol only adds to the confusion.** Consent is something that two people must negotiate together, and it requires both people to be who they say they are and want what they say they want. When under the influence of alcohol, neither person is their true self and neither person can manage their short-term wants with the long-term consequences. (Shortform note: Gladwell doesn't address situations in which rape happens with true lack of consent, rather than when alcohol is involved.)

### Alcohol and Myopia

Alcohol induces myopia, a state in which the drinker’s mental and emotional field of vision becomes narrow. In other words, the drinker becomes short-sighted and his behavior and emotions are strongly affected by his immediate experience.

Myopia is a result of alcohol’s effects on the brain:

  * Alcohol reduces activity in the frontal lobe, which governs attention, motivation, and learning. Essentially, it makes the drinker dumber and less capable. 
  * Alcohol triggers the brain’s reward centers and increases feelings of euphoria. 
  * Alcohol enters the amygdala and makes the drinker less likely to feel threatened or afraid. 
  * Alcohol makes its way to the cerebellum, which governs coordination and balance. That is why drunk people often stagger and stumble. 



**The most crucial implication of the myopic state of intoxication is that the drinker’s understanding of self changes.** A person normally constructs his personality and character by managing the struggle between immediate experience and long-term consequences—that’s ethical decision making. But a drunk person no longer considers those long term consequences because the immediate experience takes sole focus. His normal character is broken down by myopia. Alcohol doesn’t disinhibit a person—it totally transforms a person.

> **Example of Myopia:**
> 
> People who think of alcohol as a disinhibitor might drink in an effort to forget all their troubles. And that might work (for a time) as long as the drinker is in a fun environment, like a football game with tons of excited fans. The myopic state of intoxication will make the football game (the immediate experience) the only thing in his field of vision. And his problems become crowded out.
> 
> However, if the drinker is in a quiet, solitary environment his problems will become even more overwhelming. He will become more depressed because there is nothing in his immediate experience to replace his painful emotions and thoughts.

### Blackouts

When a person drinks an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time, the hippocampus in the brain is affected. The hippocampus is responsible for memory, which is why excessive drinking often leads to a state of blackout. Blackout refers to a state in which some or all of your memories are lost.

**The first stage of a blackout:**

The hippocampus starts to be affected when the blood-alcohol level reaches approximately 0.08. The National Institute of Health’s leading blackout expert, Aaron White, says that there is no traceable logic to what gets remembered and what doesn’t when a drinker reaches the early state of blackout. For example, it is totally possible to forget being raped but remember getting in a taxi to go home.

**Total blackout:**

At a blood-alcohol level of approximately 0.15, the hippocampus shuts down entirely. At that point, all memories disappear completely and there is nothing to recall. Even in this state of total blackout, when the hippocampus is entirely shut down, it is possible for the drinker to continue to function like a “normal” drunk person. In fact, it can be impossible to tell when someone else has reached the point of blackout.

> **Example of Blackout:**
> 
> Alcohol researcher Donald Goodwin once gave ten men from St. Louis a bottle of bourbon in an effort to study the blackout state. After letting them drink for four straight hours, Goodwin suggested that the men might be hungry. He handed each man a frying pan, covered with a lid.
> 
> When the men took the lid off the pan, there were three dead mice inside. Goodwin thought that would be a highly memorable, even traumatic, experience. But the bourbon drinkers had completely forgotten the event within 30 minutes, and they didn’t regain the memory the next morning.

#### Blackouts and Sexual Assault

**In a state of blackout, all of the strategies people typically use to interact with strangers are dull—most notably the memory.** Memory is usually the first line of defense when talking to a stranger:

  * You talk to someone at a party for 30 minutes. Then you consider what the person said and did in order to make sense of that person. (This is already problematic because assuming transparency is often a mistake.)
  * You make a choice about that person, such as whether or not you are willing to give that person your number or go home with him. 



But if you can’t remember your interactions with a stranger, then you might make your choice very differently:

  * You talk to someone at a party for 30 minutes who doesn’t realize that you’re in a state of blackout. 
  * Maybe that person tries to touch you, but you stiffen up and reject the touch. 
  * Ten minutes later, that person comes back and tries to touch you again. Normally, you would immediately stiffen up. But the second time, because you’ve forgotten that this person already made you uncomfortable once, you react slightly differently. 
  * The stranger thinks that this different reaction is an indication that you are welcoming his touch the second time around. The stranger assumes you are transparent, when in reality you are simply not making choices the way you normally would. And if the stranger is drunk, too, his own perception of the interaction might be equally affected. 



Showing respect to another person requires managing your own desires with the desires of the other person. But in the blackout state, myopia transforms your brain so that you can only see your desires—the other person’s desires become crowded out. Essentially, **it is impossible to be yourself in a social interaction when you are blackout drunk.**

Women are at a much greater risk for blackouts, for physiological reasons. For a woman of average weight, for example, eight beers over four hours would put her at a blood-alcohol level of 0.173. She would be blacked out. But a man of average weight could drink the same amount and have a significantly lower blood-alcohol level of 0.15.

Other factors that increase the likelihood of blackouts among women:

  * Women are more likely to drink wine and liquor, which raise blood-alcohol levels faster than beer.
  * Women have lower levels of body water, which results in a higher blood-alcohol content.
  * Women are more likely to skip meals while drinking than men are. 



When a young woman is blacked out, she is particularly vulnerable. It is important to let young women know that they don’t need to drink as much as a man does. And it’s equally important to empower women to know that they drastically increase the chances of being taken advantage of when they are unable to be responsible for their own decision-making. Of course, sexual assault is always the predator’s fault. **Teaching women these principles is an effort to prevent more of them from becoming victims—never to blame the victim.**

Men are vulnerable when blacked out, too. It is important to teach young men that when they reach the myopic state, terrible things can happen. We need to teach young men that binge-drinking is not a harmless social activity—it drastically increases the odds of committing a violent or sexual crime. Of course, alcohol does not excuse the predator. **Teaching men these principles is an effort to prevent more perpetrators of sexual assault.**

### Brock Turner

On January 18, 2015, two graduate students witnessed a young man, Brock Turner, lying on top of a young woman (referred to here as Emily Doe) on the ground near a dumpster. The two men observed that Turner was thrusting on top and Emily was completely still underneath. Alarmed, they asked Turner what was going on. Turner turned and ran. The two men followed Turner and tackled him.

Emily Doe was lying near the dumpster, unconscious, with one breast revealed. Her skirt was around her waist and her underwear had been removed. She woke up in the hospital oblivious to what had happened. She was told that she had been the victim of sexual assault.

Most sexual assault cases rely on witnesses to help solidify the victim’s allegations. But in Brock Turner’s case, there were no available witnesses other than the two graduate students who tackled Turner. All of Emily’s friends at the party had gotten too drunk and had to leave. Turner’s friend was too drunk to even make it to the party. So Turner’s account was the only one heard in the case. By his account, Emily Doe had consented to their encounter by the dumpster.

But California law states that someone cannot be considered to have given consent if that person was unconscious or so intoxicated that they couldn’t adequately resist. This means that the person must’ve been _so_ intoxicated that they couldn’t make a reasonable judgment or make sense of their surroundings.

So really, **the case against Brock Turner would be determined by the degree of Emily Doe’s intoxication.** Was Doe a consensual partner in the sexual activity, or was she incapable of consent based on her level of drunkness?

#### How Intoxicated Was Emily Doe?

When she arrived at the party that night, Emily Doe was already drunk. She left a voicemail for her boyfriend just after midnight, in which she sounds incoherent. Her voice certainly didn’t sound like the voice of someone capable of making reasonable judgments. By the time of the incident, Emily Doe had a blood alcohol level of .249—nearly four times the legal limit. She has no memory of even meeting Brock Turner.

Brock Turner’s blood-alcohol level was twice the legal limit at the time of the incident—enough to be considered blackout. At trial, he claimed to remember everything that happened between him and Emily Doe that night. But on the night of his arrest, his memory wasn’t at all clear. When asked why he ran away from the scene, Turner said that he didn’t remember running or being tackled. He said, “I think I was kind of blacked out.”

So everything about the story that Turner told in his trial was made up—it was wishful thinking. It is impossible to know what actually happened that night because Brock Turner, Emily Doe, and almost everyone they knew at that party was in a state of blackout.

In the end, Brock Turner was convicted of three felonies associated with sexual assault and sentenced to six months in prison. For the rest of his life, he will be a registered sex offender.

You might wonder _how_ a seemingly harmless interaction on the dance floor ended in such a horrible crime. The answer is that **alcohol and assumption of transparency is a dangerous combination when interacting with a stranger.** Remember, drunk people are in a state of myopia in which their behavior is directly influenced by their environment. That night, Emily Doe and Brock Turner’s environment was a fraternity party dedicated to binge-drinking and sexual dancing. And both Emily Doe and Brock Turner were in a state of blackout, meaning that they were completely out of touch with the consequences of their actions.

### What Is the Solution?

The night that he met Emily Doe, Brock Turner had to make sense of a stranger’s sexual desires. He assumed that her behavior was transparent, which is an incredibly flawed system to begin with. But when both parties are young, immature, and drunk, it is impossible. That’s why there is such a prevalent pattern of sexual assault on college campuses._But how do we stop it?_

In a letter to Brock Turner, Emily Doe expressed that she wanted to see programs set up to raise awareness of sexual assault and teach men how to respect women to prevent sexual assault in the future.

In his own statement, Brock Turner said that he hoped to set up a program to speak out against the college culture of binge-drinking and sexual promiscuity to prevent sexual assault in the future.

But in reality, shouldn’t we hope for both? **It is important to teach young people how to respect each other _and_ how to drink less. The two problems are connected. **
