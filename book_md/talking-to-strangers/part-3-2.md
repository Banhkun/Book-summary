## Part 3-2: Transparency and Mismatching

The assumption of transparency is especially dangerous in interactions where one person is mismatched—when his outward demeanor is mismatched with his internal feelings and intentions.

### Mismatching and How It Works

Remember Tim Levine’s Trivia Experiment, in which participants were asked whether or not they cheated when Rachel left the room and then viewers were asked to determine which participants were lying about cheating on the test.

The experiment measures how accurate the viewer is at detecting the participant’s lie. In this experiment, Levine found that the viewer correctly detects a participant’s lie 54% of the time on average. That percentage is only slightly better than chance. _Why is that?_

One answer is Truth-Default Theory. But Levine felt as though there had to be another reason that people tend to mistake lies for the truth. In particular, Levine was perplexed by the pattern that most lies are not detected until after the fact. (For example, Scott Carmichael missed all the clues that Ana Montes was a Cuban spy in the moment. But later, Carmichael could recognize those red flags.) In an effort to explain this pattern, Levine returned to the tapes of his Trivia Experiment participants.

#### Participants: Sally and Nelly

Two of Levine’s participants were particularly interesting to study. We will call one Sally and one Nervous Nelly.

  * When asked if she cheated, **Sally** took a lot of pauses, started to blush, avoided eye contact, and appeared confused. Every viewer who watched Sally’s interview accurately identified that Sally was lying. 
  * When asked if she cheated, **Nervous Nelly** gave rambling answers, obsessively played with her hair, became defensive, and acted agitated. Every viewer who watched Nervous Nelly’s interview suspected that Nelly was lying. But Nelly was telling the _truth_. 



There were a lot of participants like Nelly and Sally, who got the same response from nearly every viewer. In fact, some participants were judged correctly by 80% of judges or more. And some participants were judged incorrectly by 80% of judges or more. _Why?_

Levine argues that **this is an example of a judge using demeanor as a clue to someone’s honesty—an example of the assumption of transparency.** These viewers were operating under the assumption that a liar in reality would behave like a liar on _Friends._

A person will be judged as honest if she is:

  * Well-spoken
  * Confident
  * Friendly/Engaging
  * Has a firm handshake 



A person will be judged as dishonest if she is:

  * Nervous
  * Fidgety
  * Inarticulate
  * Disengaged



The participants that were judged correctly 80% of the time were those whose internal state and external demeanor were _matching._ For example, Sally _matched_ —she was being dishonest and she was acting dishonestly. The participants who were judged incorrectly were _mismatched._ For example, Nervous Nelly _mismatched_ —she was being honest but her demeanor seemed stereotypically dishonest.

**In other words, the average person is only bad at detecting lies when the sender is mismatched.** Mismatching confuses the average person—it is at odds with the natural assumption of transparency. When a liar acts stereotypically honest or an honest person acts stereotypically dishonest, we don’t know how to make sense of it.

#### Law Enforcement Viewers

It makes sense that the average person might not be a professional when it comes to detecting lies. But what about law enforcement officials that _are_ supposed to be professionals at detecting lies, such as interrogators? Wouldn’t they be better judges than the average adult? To answer this question, Levine found interrogators with over 15 years of experience and asked them to watch the Trivia Experiment participant’s interviews.

##### The Results

  * On _matched_ participants (those who acted accordingly to their level of honesty), the interrogators were 100% accurate. The average adult would only be 70-75% accurate with the matched participants. 
  * On _mismatched_ truth-tellers (Nervous Nellies who tell the truth in a way that seems dishonest), the law enforcement officials were only 20% accurate. 
  * **On _mismatched_ liars (liars who act honest), the law enforcement officials were only 14% accurate.**



Law enforcement officials are just as bad or even worse at interpreting strangers with mismatched behavior than the average adult. This is distressing because these are the people charged with determining a stranger’s innocence or guilt.

You have to wonder if this is part of the reason there are so many cases of wrongful convictions (like Amanda Knox, discussed below) and unsuccessful bail decisions (like Patrick Walker). Mistakes like these might seem random, but Levine’s research proves that they aren’t random at all. **These mistakes are a result of the systematic discrimination against people who, often unknowingly, don’t conform to our ridiculous assumption of transparency.**

### Amanda Knox

On November 1, 2007, an American college student named Meredith Kercher was murdered in the small, Italian town of Perugia. Kercher’s body was found by her roommate, Amanda Knox. Knox called the police to the scene of the gruesome crime. Almost immediately, Amanda Knox was added to the list of subjects—she was ultimately convicted of murder and put in prison.

The arrest and conviction of Amanda Knox was a sensation in the media and tabloids. But it doesn’t __ make sense that Amanda Knox was implicated in the murder. There was no physical evidence that put Knox at the scene of the crime. Nor was there any motive that explained why she would have murdered her roommate. The police botched the investigation of evidence and DNA, and the prosecution relied on fantasy to make the case. But, somehow, eight years went by before the Italian Supreme Court declared Knox innocent.

There are plenty of articles and books that detail all of the mistakes made by the investigators and prosecutors in Amanda Knox’s case. But the simplest theory of what went wrong with Amanda Knox’s case is this: **the police expected Knox to be transparent and she wasn’t. Her case is an example of the consequences of assuming that the way a stranger looks is a reliable indicator of how she feels.**

#### Amanda Knox and Mismatching

Amanda Knox was innocent. But in the months following the crime, the way she acted made her _seem_ guilty. She was mismatched, like Nervous Nelly. The investigators on the case drew wild conclusions about Amanda’s role in Kercher’s murder based on the way she behaved.

Lead investigator Edgardo Giobbi said that he didn’t even need to rely on any other kinds of investigation because he had observed Knox’s guilt through her psychological and behavioral reactions to the murder. And the prosecutor on the case said that although the physical evidence collected had been very unclear, what _was_ clear was that Amanda’s behavior was irrational.

Amanda Knox (like most strangers) was a mystery to the people who didn’t know her closely. She was the kind of outcast kid in high school who sang in the hallways and pretended to be an elephant in front of her classmates. Like most misfits, Amanda Knox had learned to be herself even when the people around her couldn’t understand her. So, in the days following Meredith Kercher’s murder, Knox didn’t adjust her behavior to conform to peoples’ expectations.

Here are a few examples of how Amanda Knox behaved after Meredith Kercher’s murder:

  * The police told Amanda to put on protective booties before walking through the crime scene. She did so, and then struck a pose and said “ta-dah.” 
  * When Kercher’s friend Sophie attempted to hug Amanda and express sympathies, Knox just stood with her arms at her sides and remained expressionless.
  * When Kercher’s friend Natalie said, “I hope she didn’t suffer,” Amanda yelled, “She fucking bled to death!”
  * While most people were crying and speaking in hushed tones around Meredith Kercher’s family, Amanda Knox and her boyfriend were cuddling up with each other, kissing, and even laughing. 
  * In custody, Amanda did yoga and showed off her splits to the guard on duty. 



As Diane Sawyer would later say in an interview with Amanda Knox (after she had been declared innocent), that kind of behavior didn’t _look_ like grief to most people. Many people found Knox’s _demeanor_ to be cold and calculating.

**So Amanda Knox spent four years in prison**(and another four years waiting to be declared officially innocent)**for the crime of behaving unpredictably—for being mismatched.** But being weird is not a crime.
