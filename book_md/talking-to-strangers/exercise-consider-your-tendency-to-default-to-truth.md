## Exercise: Consider Your Tendency to Default to Truth

Psychologist Tim Levine says that the cost of _not_ defaulting to truth is the sacrifice of meaningful social interactions. But most people _will_ default to truth until they have enough doubts about a person to reach the trigger point.

* * *

Consider a time that you suspected a stranger was lying to you. What ultimately triggered you to doubt that personâ€™s honesty? How long did you harbor doubts about that person before you reached your trigger point?

Based on that memory, how sensitive do you think your trigger point is when dealing with strangers? In other words, are you a very trusting person who needs a lot of doubts before being triggered to suspicion or are you a skeptical person who reaches the trigger point quickly when dealing with strangers?

How do you think that your natural trigger point affects your social interactions with strangers? Have you ever lost out on the opportunity to make a meaningful connection because you made a hasty first impression?
