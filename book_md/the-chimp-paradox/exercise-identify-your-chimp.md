## Exercise: Identify Your Chimp

When you have an immediate emotional reaction, you can recognize it as your Chimp (your emotional brain) by asking yourself if you _want_ to feel this way.

* * *

Describe a recent situation in which you allowed your emotions to control your reaction to something that someone else said or did. How did their words or actions trigger you, and how did you respond?

How did you feel afterward? Did you get the result you wanted from your reaction? Why or why not?

How could you have managed your Chimp better to allow your Human (your rational brain) to stay in control?
