## Introduction

Each of us has a psychological Chimp inside our brains, primitively reacting to the world and prompting us to act emotionally, impetuously, and irresponsibly. If you’ve ever struggled to stay in control of your urges, succumbed to temptation, or sabotaged your own success, your Chimp has probably taken the reins for a bit. **Fortunately, our brains also have an inner Human who, when functioning properly, keeps our inner Chimp under control and allows us to interact with the world in a stable, positive, productive way.** In _The Chimp Paradox_ , psychiatrist Steve Peters outlines a mind management program that can help you manage your inner Chimp and lead you to happiness, success, and a sense of balance between your emotional and thinking selves.

To explore this program, we'll discuss seven areas that make up your overall psyche, determining how you view and interact with the world. Imagine each of these areas as a planet revolving around a central sun. When all the planets are in order, this metaphorical solar system represents your ideal state, in which your sun shines brightly and you're happy and well-adjusted.

The seven planets are:

  * Planet 1: Your psychological mind
  * Planet 2: Other people 
  * Planet 3: Communication
  * Planet 4: Your world
  * Planet 5: Health
  * Planet 6: Success
  * Planet 7: Happiness



These planets also have moons, which represent stabilizing influences on the planets. These influences are guiding forces, helping you gain control over each of these areas so that everything can operate smoothly and efficiently.

(Shortform note: We have organized our summary to follow the different “planets” that outline the author’s argument, instead of to follow the chapter numbers.)
