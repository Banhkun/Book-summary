## Exercise: Use Human Mode

If you speak to someone else using your Chimp (emotional side), they will most likely respond with their Chimp. Try to speak to other people from your Human (rational side) to their Human, and leave your Chimps out of the conversation.

* * *

Think of a recent argument that you had in which your Chimp drove your words or actions. When you addressed the other person with your Chimp, how did her Chimp respond?

How did your Chimp respond when her Chimp spoke to you? Were you able to prevent it from doing so? Why or why not?

How could you have used your inner Human to better respond to the other personâ€™s Chimp when it addressed you?
