## Conclusion

When each of your planets is spinning smoothly, you’ll feel happy and content. To review and sum up the previous planets, this means:

  * Managing your Chimp
  * Nurturing your Human
  * Replacing negative Gremlins and Goblins in your Computer with positive Autopilots
  * Finding a supportive troop
  * Communicating and interacting effectively with others
  * Establishing a safe jungle for your Chimp
  * Dealing effectively with both acute and chronic stress 
  * Choosing realistic yet ambitious goals and working toward them
  * Keeping an eye on what makes you happy, and working toward feelings of confidence and security



Changes take time, so when you're working to straighten out your planets and align your psychological state, don’t get discouraged if progress is slower than you anticipated. You may be changing more than you realize—often, other people notice changes in you before you do.

Above all, remember that **you always have a choice in everything you do, and ultimately, it’s up to you which inner self rules your life: your Chimp or your Human.** Accept them both for what each can offer you, and work with—not against—each one’s instincts so that you can let them guide you to a happy, secure, balanced life.
