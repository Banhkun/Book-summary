## Exercise: Prepare for Acute Stress

By filling your Computer with positive Autopilots, you can prime it to override your Chimp’s negative reactions to sudden stress.

* * *

Think of a potential stressful situation, either at work or in your personal life. Think of how you would expect yourself to normally react. (For example, imagine someone cuts in line at the supermarket. Would you typically react with a harsh response? Or would you say nothing because of a Gremlin or Goblin that tells you you’re not worth as much as they are?)

Think of how you _could_ respond to the stressful situation in a way that controls your Chimp but still allows your Human to stand up for yourself. How can you be assertive but not aggressive? (In the above example, what could you say to the line-cutter to make it clear that her behavior isn't acceptable, without letting your Chimp speak?)
