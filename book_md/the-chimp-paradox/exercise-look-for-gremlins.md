## Exercise: Look for Gremlins

A Gremlin is an unhelpful habit or belief. It’s possible to relearn or remove Gremlins from your Computer (your repository of habits of thoughts and beliefs) by replacing them with Autopilots (positive thoughts). A common Gremlin is _unrealistic expectations_ , though which you set yourself up for disappointment with unachievable standards.

* * *

Describe a time in either your professional or personal life when you held unrealistic expectations for someone else and were subsequently disappointed. (For example, did you expect a coworker to complete a project faster or better than she’d promised? Or expect a loved one to do something without being told?)

What were some more realistic expectations you could have programmed into your Computer that might have prevented you from feeling negative emotions when the other person didn’t live up to your standards?
