## Shortform Introduction

We use the terms “blacks,” “whites,” “white elites,” and “felons” as shorthand to represent different groups, the way the author does in the book. These are not meant to be dismissive labels.

There are potentially controversial arguments around the intent and degree of conscious/subconscious bias. As in all of our summaries, we primarily communicate the author’s points and label our own notes separately.

Nearly every nonfiction book - whether about management, diet, sociology - cherry-picks the strongest data to confirm the main point, without addressing contradictory data. The truth is always more complicated than what any single viewpoint espouses, and if you strive for rationality and truth, then you’d benefit from compiling a variety of viewpoints and data.
