## 1-Page Summary

### Important prison statistics

In 30 years, the US penal population increased from 300k to 2MM, with drug convictions accounting for the majority of increase. The US rate of incarceration is 750 per 100,000 people, vs 161 in the US in 1972 and 93 in Germany today.

Black people make up 13% of the US population, but 40% of the US incarcerated population. A third of black men will have served time in prison, based on 2001 rates.

Since 1980, the growth in number of arrests for black Americans has been concentrated in drug crimes - arrests for property and violent crimes have decreased.

Drug offenses make up 46% of inmates in federal prisons and 16% in state prisons.

  * Alexander argues these underestimate the impact of drug laws - drug offenses receive half the sentence length as violent crime, so they flow out of prison more quickly. Drug crimes account for 31% of total federal and state prison admissions, but these have grown over time.



One might think racial differences in drug prison admissions are due to differences in crime rates, but within drug crime, this isn’t true. Blacks are no more likely than whites to sell and consume drugs (albeit according to survey data). Despite this, blacks are searched and arrested at higher rates and receive more severe punishment for the same crime.

### The War on Drugs

The war on drugs and incarceration is the latest instantiation of centuries-old racial discrimination against black people.

It avoids the overt racism of the slavery and Jim Crow methods by using terms like “tough on crime,” but it began in conscious racial motivation.

Starting in the 60s with Barry Goldwater and rising with Nixon, there was deliberate maneuvering by politicians to subtly exploit the vulnerabilities of Southern whites, who were concerned with the Civil Rights campaign.

  * Said Nixon’s chief of staff: “you have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks. The key is to devise a system that recognized this while not appearing to.”



Like slavery and Jim Crow before it, the New Jim Crow was instituted by appealing to the vulnerability and racism of lower-class whites, who felt threatened economically and socially by black progress, and who want to ensure they’re never at the bottom of the American social ladder. (Shortform note: protecting social status seems to be a basic human instinct.)

What began with a political agenda rapidly proliferated to many stakeholders, all incentivized to maximize the war on drugs and mass incarceration without being consciously racially biased. This includes:

  * Law enforcement, who receive federal grants for drug arrests
  * The media, which sensationalizes drug crime for views and has stereotyped black people as mainly responsible for drug crime
  * Politicians who appeal to scared constituents and one-up each other on being tough on crime (including Clinton and Obama)
  * Private prisons (which account for 8% of inmates)



No stakeholder has necessarily seen the big picture of the institution they supported; they were merely safeguarding their own interests and participating in the zeitgeist.

To be clear, Alexander is **not** accusing law enforcement and other stakeholders of explicit and conscious racism. Rather, the system has created a public consensus image of criminals as being black males, and people cannot acting along subconscious biases.

### The New Jim Crow

Here is how the New Jim Crow works:

  * Use the War on Drugs to **arrest large numbers of black men**. Promote this through 1) strong financial incentives to stakeholders and 2) legal protection of discretion in law enforcement and prosecution.
    * Generally, as long as racial discrimination is not explicitly stated, actions biased by race are allowable. 
    * Legal protections: race is allowed to be a factor in stopping vehicles as long as it’s not the _sole_ factor; probable cause is sufficient to justify stop and searches, regardless of intent of the officer; lawyers can strike jurors on arbitrary peremptory challenges as long as it’s not explicitly racist.
    * In essence, black men are _made_ criminals at higher rates than white men, despite not having significantly higher rates of drug crime.
  * **Hand down disproportionately harsh sentences to black men** , and limit effective legal representation for them.
    * As one example, before 2010, 5g of crack cocaine (associated with black people) and 500g of powder cocaine (associated with white people) earned the same 5-year minimum sentence - a literal 1:100 ratio. Analysis of risk of arrest.
  * **Impose sanctions on ex-criminals outside of prison** \- like removing access to public housing, welfare, job opportunities, and the right to vote. 
    * This prevents reintegration, encourages recidivism, and may actively promote crime.



As a result, **black people are pushed into the system and kept within it**. They are arrested more frequently, handed heavy sentences, then discriminated against when they leave prison.

In turn, their children are heavily disadvantaged as a result and similarly forced into the system; and **so the cycle perpetuates**.

Insidiously, because the current system does not have explicit racial bias, it’s assumed to be colorblind. Exceptional black achievers like President Obama and Oprah imply that a racial caste no longer exists. This causes a consensus that criminals _choose_ a life of crime and are not being systematically discriminated against. Furthermore, there has been historical black support for the war on drugs.

Alexander argues that ending the New Jim Crow requires **broad public consensus** that the war on drugs has produced a racial caste and must be dismantled entirely. She doesn’t offer how technically do achieve it, but she does argue that solitary battles like affirmative action will not win the war.
