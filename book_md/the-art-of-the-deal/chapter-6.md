## Chapter 6: Remaking a Classic—The Commodore Hotel

Through Trump’s relationship with Palmieri, he found out about another project: the Commodore Hotel, at 42nd Street and Park Avenue.

For years, the hotel’s books had been in the red and it had defaulted on its property taxes. Additionally, the building and area around it were dilapidated, with many nearby buildings in foreclosure. All of this created a prime opportunity to get a great price.

At the same time, the hotel’s location next to Grand Central Station assured Trump that the value would only rise. A steady stream of professionals passed by the hotel every day, creating plenty of opportunity for business. It was a case of buying good and making it better: **If Trump could give the hotel a facelift, the location would ensure success.**

### Prepare for the Worst: Trump Assembled Several Pieces for the Deal

Despite the premium location, Trump recognized that **the project carried a lot of risk with the city still on the verge of bankruptcy. If he fell short, he could lose a lot of time, money, and credibility within the real estate community.**

Trump’s deal with Penn Central gave him an exclusive purchase option contingent on him paying $250,000 and securing financing, a hotel operator, and an unprecedented tax abatement from the city.

It was a tricky situation: He needed the hotel partner and a guaranteed tax abatement in order to convince the banks to finance. He needed all three to get the deal. But without the deal, it’d be difficult to convince a hotel operator to come on board.

In the meantime, **he didn’t want to lose the deal but also didn’t want to risk losing $250,000 before he knew he could get all the pieces together.** He stalled on the payment while he worked on getting everything in place.

### Appearances Matter: Trump Made an Impressive Presentation

**Trump needed a proposal that would inspire confidence among the banks and the city, so the first thing he did was work with an architect to create a design.**

Trump felt that the Commodore’s dark, outdated appearance was hurting its potential. He wanted to make the building look contemporary by covering the brick exterior with either bronze or glass.

When he and the architect had settled on the design, **Trump told the architect to make the drawings look more expensive than they were.** With his proposals as with his buildings, Trump is convinced that an impressive presentation makes an invaluable impression.

### Know Your Target Audience: Trump Chose a Hotel Operator

While looking for a hotel partner to run the Commodore, **Trump considered what would give him the best chance of success given the kind of business and clientele he envisioned** :

  * An established hotel operator could handle the large 1,400-room hotel. 
  * A national hotel chain had the benefits of being well known, having a proven track record of successful management, and having a large reservation system. 
  * The company had to have a prestigious enough reputation (Ramada Inn and Holiday Inns didn’t cut it). 



Trump leaned toward Hyatt, first because its hotels fit the modern, polished design he envisioned for the Commodore. Second, Hyatt held a lot of conventions, which made perfect sense for the location across the street from Grand Central.

Finally, Hyatt didn’t have any major hotels in New York City, as Hilton and Sheraton did. Trump knew he could use this as leverage to convince Hyatt’s executives that it was in their best interest to jump at the Commodore.

Trump was able to select the most effective hotel operator because he knew the Commodore’s assets, he could anticipate the type of clients it would draw, and he was familiar with the various hotel companies’ businesses. He also used this knowledge to make a convincing pitch to the Hyatt.

Trump made a deal with Hyatt to buy, renovate, and operate the Commodore with him—contingent on getting financing and the tax abatement.

### Have a Bargaining Chip: Trump Pitched the Project as an Economic Boost

Trump used the city’s poor economic condition as leverage on several fronts:

  * He convinced Palmieri that no other developer would risk buying such a run-down hotel in a dilapidated neighborhood with the city’s economic struggles.
  * He pushed the banks by saying it was their moral obligation to help the city by financing a project that would create jobs and improve the surrounding neighborhood. 
  * He told the city that granting the tax abatement would allow him to move forward on the project, which would create thousands of jobs and provide a boost to the area.



Although Trump hadn’t yet secured financing when he approached the city—in fact, he needed the tax abatement in order to get financing—he asked for an unprecedented abatement. His logic was that even if they offered less it’d still be enough.

**The city was eager for development, and Trump emphasized that the Commodore’s renovation and success were essential to kickstarting revitalization in the Grand Central neighborhood.** He agreed on a tentative deal and waited for the Board of Estimate to give final approval.

Trump wanted to tip the scales in his favor, so a week before the Board of Estimate’s decision, he encouraged Palmieri to go public with the Commodore’s financial struggles. Palmieri announced that the Commodore had lost money that year and its losses were projected to be even worse the following year, so the hotel would soon be permanently closed.

Adding to the pressure, newspapers ran stories about how the Commodore’s closing was pushing tenants out, putting hundreds of employees out of work, and hurting neighboring businesses.

Despite opposition and a competing bid, the Board of Estimate ultimately approved the 40-year tax abatement by unanimous decision.

### Prepare for Worst: Trump Ensured Long-Term Security

The tax abatement helped Trump secure financing, and the project was soon underway. But **as Trump closed the deal with the bank, he saw an opportunity to build in more long-term security for himself: He included an exclusive covenant** , a clause that required Trump’s permission for Hyatt to build any competing hotels in New York City.

Trump knew Hyatt would be against this clause, so when he was alone with the bank executive he underscored that the bank was making a big investment, and it could be jeopardized if Hyatt quickly put up another hotel nearby. The bank executive then demanded that Hyatt include the clause and gave the company an hour deadline to agree.

The head of Hyatt was out of the country, so while Hyatt’s representatives tried to reach him for approval, Trump took it upon himself to draft the clause. By the end of the hour, the Hyatt executives had signed the clause, and **now Trump and his heirs own the right to approve or deny construction of any future Hyatts in New York City.**

* * *

The Commodore reopened as the Grand Hyatt in September 1980 and immediately turned millions of dollars in annual profits. The economy turned around soon after, and room prices skyrocketed.

(Shortform note: Trump’s unprecedented tax abatement reportedly cost New York City more than $410 million in foregone revenue over 40 years. Additionally, the Grand Hyatt is set to be demolished and replaced with brand-new hotel rooms as well as office space.)
