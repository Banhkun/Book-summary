## Chapter 8: Trump’s First Casino—Trump Plaza

Trump realized that no success he could achieve in hotels would compare with the profits a casino could bring in. So he visited Atlantic City.

At the time, New Jersey was preparing to vote on whether to legalize gaming in Atlantic City. Before the initiative had even passed, Atlantic City real estate values shot up.

### Prepare for the Worst: Trump Didn’t Bet on an Unsure Thing

**Trump wasn’t willing to risk buying property in Atlantic City while the prices were hot and legalized gambling wasn’t a sure thing.** If the gaming initiative failed, he’d lose his entire investment.

If the initiative did pass, Trump preferred to pay more with that certainty—and he figured the cost would still be a drop in the bucket compared to his inevitable casino profits.

The referendum ultimately passed, but prices rose so high that Trump decided to continue holding out for a good deal. After about three years, he heard about a Boardwalk property that might be for sale.

### Their Loss is Your Win: Trump Bought a Challenging Property During Hard Times

By the time Trump considered buying, several factors caused the casino construction rush to cool off:

  * Other casino projects had hit major obstacles, including building delays and rejected gaming licenses
  * An FBI sting had revealed corruption among Atlantic City politicians and the state Casino Control Commission
  * It appeared that gaming in Atlantic City might turn out to be more seasonal than expected, and that there might only be enough business to support a few casinos



In Trump’s view, **Atlantic City’s struggles could help him secure a great deal.**

Others had already attempted to develop the boardwalk site Trump was eyeing, so he’d have to deal with:

  * Multiple parcels with different owners, including investment groups and families who owned homes on the land
  * Disputes over purchase options
  * Lawsuits about past agreements for multiple landowners to jointly lease or sell the land



Real estate professionals advised him to avoid such a convoluted project, but again, he felt **the property’s issues would help him secure a better deal.**

### Have a Bargaining Chip: Trump Convinced Landowners to Sell to Him

Trump needed to get all the landowners on the boardwalk site to sell so that he could build the casino-hotel he envisioned.

With Trump Tower on his resume, he played off his credibility: Trump assured the owners that he could give them a fair offer and that he’d finish the project. Given the property’s issues, **Trump also leveraged the fact that the owners might not get any other offers because no developer wanted to take on this project.**

After a long negotiation, Trump secured all the pieces of the Boardwalk site.

### Prepare for the Worst: Trump Spent a Little Time to Avoid Losing a Lot of Money

Trump decided to get his gaming license before starting construction because he knew the licensing process was lengthy and unpredictable.

**Many casinos had started construction while they applied for their gaming license, only to lose money when their gaming applications were delayed or denied.** Trump didn’t go this route because he wanted to avoid:

  * Risking millions in construction costs
  * Having his hands tied—with so much money on the line—if the Casino Control Commission gave him contingencies for licensing approval 



### Have a Bargaining Chip: Trump Was Willing to Walk Away

The fact that casino construction had stalled in Atlantic City worked in Trump’s favor, since state officials would be eager to have a successful casino up and running. However, that was still no guarantee that Trump’s gaming application would be approved, or that he’d get the decision anytime soon (it was a notoriously slow process).

Trump met with New Jersey’s attorney general and pointed out that he’d already invested millions in the Boardwalk site and made it clear that, while Trump was excited by the prospect of building in Atlantic City, he was prepared to walk away. Specifically, Trump told the attorney general **he refused to start building until his license was approved, and he wasn’t willing to wait more than six months for the decision**.

The attorney general couldn’t guarantee approval, but he assured Trump his gaming application would be processed within six months. True to his word, Trump received a decision nearly six months later—and he’d been approved.

### Appearances Matter: Trump Created a Spectacle to Close the Deal

Now that Trump was in business, he needed an experienced casino operator.

Michael Rose, the chairman of Holiday Inns, had heard about Trump’s project and reached out and proposed they form a partnership. Trump didn’t want to appear desperate, so he told Rose that he didn’t need a casino operator, but that he was willing to hear Rose out.

Rose said he was impressed by Trump’s reputation for finishing projects on time and within budget, and **Rose was especially impressed that the project was already under construction.**

Trump and Rose agreed on a 50/50 partnership, plus Holiday Inns would contribute $50 million toward construction, reimburse Trump’s investment up to that point, and guarantee Trump against any operating losses for five years. But the deal was subject to the board’s approval.

The board decided to hold its next meeting in Atlantic City so that the members could see the site before making their decision. The problem was that construction wasn’t as far along as Rose thought, so **Trump told his construction supervisor to get every piece of heavy machinery he could onto the site and in action for the board’s visit** , even if they were just digging dirt from one spot and moving it to another.

When the board visited the construction site, it looked like the workers were doing an unbelievable amount of work. The optics impressed the board members so much that they approved the deal.

### Keep Costs Low: Trump Used Money-Saving Strategies

While many other projects in Atlantic City went past deadline and over budget, Trump planned to finish under budget and ahead of schedule.

Three factors helped Trump save money:

  * **He used “value engineering,”** reassessing the plans to find things that could be tweaked to save money. For example, putting the air conditioning cooling tower on a lower section of the roof saved money by making it possible to start electrical work months earlier than planned.
  * **He created complete and thorough construction plans** before building, leaving no room for unexpected costs.
  * **He pushed contractors for lower prices** , leveraging the dearth of construction work in Atlantic City.



Trump opened Harrah’s at Trump Plaza in time for Memorial Day weekend, making it the first Atlantic City casino-hotel to finish under budget and by its deadline.

### Have a Good Product: Trump Hired the Best

After some time, Trump and Holiday Inns disagreed about how to manage the business, so Trump bought out Holiday Inns. He renamed the facility Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and hired a new general manager.

Everyone Trump asked had recommended Stephen Hyde, the executive vice president and chief operating officer at the Golden Nugget. Hyde had an impressive resume in the casino industry and had the right personality for the job.

Trump poached not only Hyde, but he also poached Hyde’s best former employees. **In order to maximize his businesses’ successes, Trump always aims to hire the best.**

When looking for managers to run his buildings, Trump’s strategy is to:

  * Find out your competitors’ top-performing managers 
  * Offer the managers more money 
  * Offer them performance-based bonuses and other incentives



The facility brought in about $35 million gross operating profit in 1985 during its first year, under Holiday Inns’ management, and was projected to reach $38 million in 1986. Trump’s management took over in May of 1986 and finished the year with a gross operating profit of $58 million, far exceeding the projection.

### Have a Backup Plan: Trump Considered Taking Over Holiday Inns

The success at Trump Plaza made Trump consider which other companies that owned casinos he could buy. Holiday Inns owned another casino in Atlantic City and two in Nevada, and Trump’s dispute and buyout made the company a natural target

Just two months after he’d bought Holiday Inns’ out of Trump Plaza, Trump started buying stock in the company—so much stock that within the first month he owned almost 5 percent of the company. **Trump could do two things, and he considered them both good options** :

  1. Keep the stock as an investment 
  2. Take over the company 



When people started to notice that Trump was buying so many shares of Holiday Inns, its stock prices rose. Within a couple of months, they reached a price that inspired Trump to sell; although he decided to forgo the option of a takeover, he made a multi-million dollar profit in the end—ironically, it was almost enough to cover what he’d paid to buy them out.
