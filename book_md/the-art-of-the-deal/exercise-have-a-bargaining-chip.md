## Exercise: Have a Bargaining Chip

Knowing how to leverage a situation will help you get what you want in negotiations.

* * *

Describe a recent negotiation in which you were in the weaker negotiating position.

Think about the other party’s perspective and desires. How could you have reframed things to give you more negotiating power?

In your current negotiation, what is the big sticking point between you and the other party?

What is one thing that you could reframe to make the other person feel she’ll benefit by giving you what you want?
