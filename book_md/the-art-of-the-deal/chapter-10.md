## Chapter 10: Fierce Opposition Forces an Alternative Plan—Central Park South

In 1981, Trump had the chance to buy two adjoining buildings on the southern tip of Central Park, a few blocks from Carnegie Hall and Columbus Circle. The buildings were:

  1. 100 Central Park South, a 14-story rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartment building, which hardly earned enough to break even on operating costs
  2. Barbizon-Plaza, a 39-story mid-priced hotel that brought in moderate profits



Despite the premium location, Trump was able to negotiate a good price because:

  * The buildings both earned just modest profits and needed improvements 
  * Trump had no competing bidders because the buildings hadn’t been listed on the open market yet 
  * Money wasn’t the owners’ main motivation for selling



### Have a Backup Plan: Trump Entered the Project with a Few Options in Mind

After he bought the properties, Trump had a few options for what he could do with the properties.

First, despite how little the buildings were earning, Trump was confident the location was so desirable that **he could turn around and sell the properties for a profit even if he didn’t build anything**.

Second, **Trump could do relatively minor renovations on the Barbizon-Plaza hotel, raise room prices, and raise rents for the stores on the building’s first floor.** For the rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments at 100 Central Park South, he could simply wait until tenants moved or died and then list their apartments for market rates, which would be much higher than what the tenants were currently paying.

Third, **Trump could demolish both buildings and replace them with a luxury condominium building**. This was his first choice because he felt it would bring the biggest profits, but he faced two issues:

  1. The Barbizon-Plaza’s height would make demolition expensive and challenging. However, Trump felt profits would ultimately exceed the cost. 
  2. It’s extremely difficult to get tenants out of rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments, especially in such a desirable location. This proved to be the biggest obstacle in this project. 



Given the challenges to his plan, it was critical that he had alternatives in mind.

### Trump’s Actions Fueled the Tenants’ Case

Trump hired an outside company to offer tenants help relocating, but he underestimated how hard the tenants would fight to protect their low rents and desirable apartments. They formed a tenants’ association and hired lawyers.

Trump continued to provide essential services such as heat and hot water, but he cut down on other expenses: He got rid of the doormen’s uniforms to save on dry cleaning, put low-wattage bulbs in the hallways to save on electricity, and stopped allowing tenants to use a telephone in the lobby for free.

(Shortform note: Legal documents claim that Trump, in fact, cut heat and hot water, among other things.)

However, **the tenants claimed these changes—along with the relocation offers—constituted harassment and sued Trump.**

Some of Trump’s actions inadvertently strengthened the tenants’ case:

  * Trump filed to evict tenants who were significantly behind on rent or were using their rent-controlled apartments as a secondary residence (the law requires it to be a primary home). Although Trump’s actions were legally sound, it played into the perception of him as an aggressive, harassing landlord. 
  * Trump filed several eviction cases that proved invalid because of errors and missing information. 
  * Trump boarded up the windows of vacant apartments; again, this was a legal and standard practice to prevent damage and break-ins, but it was perceived as an aggressive tactic for such a visible building in a prestigious neighborhood. 
  * Trump considered allowing homeless people to live in the building’s vacant apartments until it was time for demolition. His intentions were to help with New York’s worsening homeless problem as well as to aggravate the tenants. The idea never came to fruition because Trump got blasted for it in the media, city officials opposed it, and his lawyers advised him against it. 



### Know When to Fold: The Tenant Battle Forced Trump to Change Plans

Trump refused to settle and fought the lawsuit, despite the cost of legal bills. But **given the ongoing battle, Trump decided to build only on the Barbizon-Plaza site and simply rent out apartments at 100 Central Park South as they became available** ; once vacant, he could rent the units at market rate. New York real estate values had risen dramatically since Trump bought the properties, so he stood to earn a lot of money on the market-rate rents.

The state supreme court ruled against the tenants, and an appellate court agreed. Trump ultimately stopped pursuing evictions and renewed the tenants’ leases—he even forgave three months’ rent for every tenant in the suit in exchange for receiving back rent from tenants who’d been refusing to pay.

#### Trump Reworked the Barbizon-Plaza’s Renovation Plans

Since coming up with his initial plans for the properties, **architectural trends had moved away from the sleek skyscrapers Trump favored to older, classic styles—** so Trump modified his plans for Barbizon-Plaza accordingly. He still intended to demolish and rebuild, but when he learned that zoning laws would require the new building to be much smaller than the original, Trump opted to gut and renovate the existing structure.

The only major change Trump had to make to the Barbizon building was to enlarge the windows, to make it fitting for luxury apartments. **Ultimately, the project not only maintained the prized original architectural details, but it also cost less than half the price of rebuilding.**

### Trump Closed One Hotel and Bought Another

While Trump was working on these two properties, he’d also made multiple offers on the hotel for sale directly across the street from his site.

The owners of the St. Moritz Hotel refused Trump’s offers for being too low, but every other buyer they worked with ended up falling through. Eventually, they worked out a deal with Trump.

Soon after Trump bought the St. Moritz, he closed the Barbizon-Plaza for renovations. The **St. Moritz was the closest comparable hotel, so he captured the profits when the Barbizon clients inevitably went across the street to stay at the St. Moritz.**

* * *

Trump projected a profit of over $100 million, and he credits the fact that the tenants’ battle forced him to change his plans. Because Trump had backup plans and rolled with the punches, he pivoted to a project that cost less and brought in more profits than his initial plan.
