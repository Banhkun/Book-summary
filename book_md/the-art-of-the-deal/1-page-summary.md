## 1-Page Summary

In the 1980s, Donald Trump was among the most well-known real estate moguls in New York City. A born-and-raised New Yorker, Trump went from building subsidized housing with his father in Queens and Brooklyn to constructing multimillion-dollar luxury apartments in Manhattan.

_The Art of the Deal_ is Trump’s autobiography of his early life and career. **Trump writes about the family and childhood that formed him, the professional experiences that taught him, and the deals that made him notorious.**

### Trump’s Family and Formative Years

Trump was aggressive from a young age; when he began creating trouble as a teenager, his father sent him to the New York Military Academy. There, Trump learned the discipline to channel his aggression into work.

Whenever Trump was home during school breaks, he worked with his father, who had a business building and managing low- and middle-income housing. **Trump’s father, Fred Trump, was tough, driven, and a shrewd businessman. Donald learned from watching his father’s tactics** :

  * Fred demanded contractors work quickly and produce quality work.
  * Fred pushed contractors to work for lower rates for the promise of steady work and reliable pay.
  * Fred refused to let anyone overcharge him because he knew what every supply and service cost.



Fred had a successful business, but he had to work hard and keep costs down in order to make a profit. **Donald would follow his father’s example, but he had his sights on luxury buildings and bigger profits.**

After high school, Donald enrolled in Fordham University and later transferred to Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he earned his degree. After graduating from college, Donald joined Fred’s business full time.

### Guiding Business Principles

Trump lists 11 principles that have guided him through his business decisions, and you see them manifest in many of the stories in the book. (Shortform note: In addition, we’ve included a few more principles that are recurring themes in the stories of his deals.)

  1. **Aim High** : Dream big and don’t be afraid of making lofty goals. In order to think—and achieve—big, you need total focus. 
  2. **Prepare for the Worst** : No matter how good it seems, any deal can fall through. If you act conservatively and prepare for the worst-case scenario, you’ll protect yourself against loss or failure. 
  3. **Have a Backup Plan** : Even if a deal doesn’t fall through, conditions can change. Have a plan B, plan C, and even plan D—and be flexible and agile enough to pivot to any of them. 
  4. **Know Your Target Audience** : Whenever you create or market anything, know who you’re targeting, what they want, and how they think. 
  5. **Have a Bargaining Chip** : Figure out something you can leverage to put yourself in a position of strength in any deal. Sometimes that entails reframing a deal to make it seem like you’re doing the other person a favor. 
  6. **Buy Good and Make It Better** : Instead of spending top dollar on high quality, be shrewd and look out for low costs and high potential. If you see the potential, you can make it more appealing through strategic marketing, and this will increase its value. 
  7. **Promote** : It doesn’t matter how good your product is if no one knows about it, so promote with enthusiasm and bravado. Even bad press can be leveraged into valuable attention. 
  8. **Fight If You Think You’re Right** : If you stand up for what you believe in—even if it means offending some people—you give yourself a chance of winning. And if you lose, you can feel confident you did all you could. 
  9. **Have a Good Product** : All the promotion in the world will eventually fall flat if you don’t have a high-quality product to hold it up. A strong product is the difference between appealing marketing and real success.
  10. **Keep Costs Low** : Spend money when it adds value, but don’t spend more than you have to. Even small cost savings can add up. 
  11. **Enjoy the Ride** : Money motivates, but if you’re not enjoying what you’re doing, why do it? 
  12. **Their Loss Is Your Win** : Capitalize on bad situations. When other people face challenges, it can create leverage to help you get a great deal. 
  13. **Appearances Matter** : Don’t underestimate the power of a polished presentation, and don’t overlook the details. 
  14. **Know When to Fold** : Sometimes the best business decision is to sell or opt out of a deal. 



We’ll see these principles play out in the following stories.

### Trump’s First Deal: Cincinnati Apartments

Trump was still in college when he made his first big deal: An apartment complex called Swifton Village in Cincinnati. **Trump bought Swifton with his father, and they scored a great deal because Swifton was foreclosed, two-thirds of the apartments were vacant, and the property was in deteriorating condition.**

They discovered that tenants were damaging the property and sometimes refusing to pay rent. The Trumps determined that raising rents would bring in more desirable tenants and reduce problems, so they spent about $800,000 on improvements, including:

  * Adding window shutters
  * Replacing aluminum apartment front doors with white colonial doors
  * Painting the hallways



**Although many improvements were fairly minor, they had a big impact on the look and feel of the complex.** By the following year, Swifton had no vacancies.

#### Selling Swifton

After several years, Trump heard that the area around Swifton Village was getting dangerous. **Seeing a downward trend, Trump decided to sell.**

The Trumps made a deal with Prudent Real Estate Investment Trust. They added two unusual clauses to the contract so that Prudent couldn’t walk away from the deal or lower the agreed-upon price. By the end, Prudent bought Swifton for $12 million—$6 million more than the Trumps paid for it.

### Trump’s First NYC Deal: 34th Street Convention Center

Trump’s first deal in New York City was 100 acres of riverfront land in Manhattan.

**Real estate development in NYC had dropped off dramatically, which created the opportunity for Trump to get a great deal on the property.** However, he was still a young, unproven developer.

The landowning entity was bankrupt and needed the cash from selling its assets, which worked in Trump’s favor. Additionally, Trump emphasized how undesirable the neighborhood was and how difficult development would be on the site. Ultimately, he got the deal he sought plus a second riverfront property on West 34th Street.

#### Pitching a Convention Center

Trump planned to build middle-income housing on the land, but poor economic conditions made him turn to plan B: building a convention center on the 34th Street site.

**When critics rallied against his proposal, Trump capitalized on the resulting media attention and used the opportunity to promote his project.**

Ultimately, city officials decided to buy the 34th Street site but to take on the project themselves instead of letting Trump lead it. Trump earned more than $800,000 in broker’s commission.

Trump let his purchase option on the other riverfront site expire so that he could focus on other projects.

### Remaking a Classic: The Commodore Hotel

Trump’s next major project was the Commodore Hotel, a failing, dilapidated hotel surrounded by many foreclosed buildings, which created perfect conditions to get a great deal. The hotel was also in a prime location next to Grand Central Station, so it had huge potential. **If Trump could give the hotel a facelift, the location would ensure success.**

Trump got an exclusive purchase option for the property, contingent upon him paying $250,000 and securing financing, a hotel operator, and an unprecedented tax abatement from the city.

Hyatt agreed to be the hotel operator, contingent on financing and the tax abatement.

#### Trump Used the Bad Economy as a Bargaining Chip

**When he approached the bank for financing and the city for approval on his tax abatement, Trump leveraged the city’s poor economic condition.**

First, Trump told the banks that it was their moral obligation to help the city by financing the project because the development would create jobs and improve the surrounding neighborhood.

Then, Trump told the city that the renovation was essential to revitalizing the Grand Central neighborhood. Additionally, Trump encouraged the Commodore’s seller to publicly announce that the hotel was losing so much money that soon it would permanently close.

The pressure convinced the city to approve the tax abatement. The Commodore opened as the Grand Hyatt in September 1980 and immediately turned millions of dollars in annual profits.

### A Juggling Act: Trump Tower

At the same time that the convention center proposal and the Commodore renovation were in the works, Trump eyed a building at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue.

Since Trump hadn’t completed any projects yet, the building’s owners refused to sell. **Trump kept in contact, and when the company later faced financial issues, Trump got the deal.**

#### Assembling All the Pieces

But in order to construct the building he envisioned—which would become Trump Tower—Trump still needed:

  * Financing
  * The underlying land below the building
  * The air rights above the building
  * The land behind the building
  * Zoning approval to build a skyscraper



**Trump found a negotiating angle for each piece** :

  * He gave the bankers options: When they were apprehensive about his proposal for an office building with retail—which entailed moderate costs but also moderate profits—he offered an alternative that gave the bankers more confidence to approve financing. 
  * Trump convinced the owners of the underlying land that partnering and contributing the land would earn them much higher profits than merely collecting rent on its lease. 
  * **Trump convinced Tiffany, which owned the air rights, that selling those rights to Trump would allow him to construct a building worthy of standing next to the high-end jewelry store.**
  * Trump leveraged a clause in his air rights contract, which gave him the option to buy a parcel of land behind his building, to convince that parcel’s owner to extend the lease on the land to a term that was long enough to allow Trump to build.
  * Trump got the city to approve zoning for his building because he’d offered the site’s previous occupant, the luxury store Bonwit Teller, retail space in his building, so zoning approvals would mean keeping the highly desirable store in New York. 



#### Trump Invested in Luxury

With all the pieces in place, Trump set out to build Trump Tower, a skyscraper with luxury apartments, high-end retail, and a jaw-dropping atrium.

He invested in features like an 80-foot, $2 million indoor waterfall. **Trump designed and marketed the apartments to wealthy tenants who valued luxury and exclusivity.**

Trump faced criticism for building the towering skyscraper. However, the backlash brought more attention to the project and he saw an uptick in apartment sales as a result.

In addition to staggering profits, Trump Tower gave Trump credibility as a developer, which would be invaluable in his future deals

### Trump’s First Casino: Trump Plaza

Trump realized that casino profits could far exceed hotels, so he looked to Atlantic City.

New Jersey was preparing to vote on legalized gambling, and real estate values shot up in anticipation. However, Trump was hesitant to buy in such a hot market before legalization was certain; in fact, **even after gambling was legalized, Trump held out for a few years before he found a good deal on a boardwalk property**.

When Trump was finally ready to buy, the casino construction rush had calmed. The property he was considering had several issues, including multiple owners and existing agreements; these factors would make development complicated, but they also helped him leverage a better deal.

#### Getting the Casino Up and Running

After Trump bought and straightened out issues with the land, he needed to address logistics for operating the casino, which would be named Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.

First, Trump needed a gaming license. To save time, many casinos started construction and applied for their gaming license at the same time, but lost money when their applications were delayed or denied. By contrast, **Trump decided to spend the time securing the gaming license first to avoid risking millions in construction costs.**

Second, Trump needed a casino operator. He brokered a 50/50 partnership with Holiday Inns, pending the board’s approval. Trump orchestrated a spectacle on the construction site for the board’s visit—with every piece of machinery he could get on the site doing mostly aimless tasks—and **the optics impressed the board enough to approve the deal.**

The facility brought in about $35 million gross operating profit in 1985 during its first year. Trump bought out Holiday Inns and installed new management during the second year, and finished 1986 with a gross operating profit of $58 million.

### Trump’s Second Casino: Trump Castle

After his first Atlantic City project, **Trump considered buying Hilton’s Atlantic City casino-hotel, which was denied a gaming license just 12 weeks before its grand opening.**

Hilton planned to file for another hearing, but Trump told the company that he’d be interested in buying if anything changed. Eventually, Hilton accepted his offer and sold for $320 million.

Trump renamed the facility Trump Castle, which grossed $226 million in its first year.

### Fierce Opposition Forces an Alternative Plan: Central Park South

In 1981, Trump bought a mid-priced hotel and an adjoining rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartment building in a premium location on the edge of Central Park.

Both buildings brought in meager profits, especially considering their location and potential. Trump planned to demolish both buildings and replace them with luxury condos. However, **Trump faced fierce opposition from tenants wanting to protect their rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments, which were worth several times what the renters paid.**

Trump took various measures to encourage the tenants to leave, but they formed a tenants’ association, hired lawyers, and sued for harassment. Trump fought and won the suit. Despite the ill will, Trump renewed the tenants’ leases.

Meanwhile, **Trump needed to switch to plan B: He did construction only on the hotel site and left the apartment building intact.** Architectural trends were moving toward classic styles, so instead of rebuilding the hotel from scratch, he added luxury features while maintaining the original architectural details. The project ended up costing less than half the price of rebuilding.

Circumstances had caused the projects to stray far from Trump’s original plans. But **because Trump had backup plans and rolled with the punches, he pivoted to a project that cost less and brought in more profits than his initial plan.**

### Trump’s Gamble: United States Football League

In a departure from real estate, Trump took a chance on the United States Football league (USFL) and bought a team called the New Jersey Generals. The league was struggling, but Trump was confident he could help resolve the league’s two major challenges.

First, **the USFL needed top-quality players, competition, and marketing to draw fans, press, and money.** Trump and other USFL team owners poached several star NFL players and focused on recruiting promising college players; Trump signed Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie, whose first game more than doubled the prior season’s average broadcast ratings.

Second, the USFL was a spring league, but Trump didn’t think spring football would draw fans or broadcasting contracts. Eventually the team owners agreed to move the season to the fall.

However, when the USFL announced its move, talks with CBS and NBC about broadcast contracts suddenly stalled. **Trump assumed the NFL pressured the networks not to create competition by airing the USFL in the fall, so he and the other owners filed an antitrust case against the NFL.**

The USFL won the case, but was awarded only one dollar in damages—instead of the $1.32 billion it sought. (Shortform note: Jurors found the NFL guilty of just one of the nine charges, and they awarded such a small amount because they determined that the NFL’s actions did virtually no damage to the USFL.)

The USFL team owners appealed the ruling and suspended the league’s season in the meantime.

### Trump Finished What NYC Couldn’t: Wollman Ice Skating Rink

In 1980, New York City officials began renovating Wollman Ice Skating Rink, which they projected would take two-and-a-half years and cost $2 million. Six years and nearly $13 million later, the officials announced they were starting over and projected two more years until completion.

Frustrated by the project’s mishandling, Trump offered twice to take over the project. The city initially refused, but **criticism from the media pressured NYC officials to make a deal with Trump, who committed to finish Wollman Rink’s renovation in merely six months**.

He planned thoroughly, acted decisively, and consulted experts to avoid delays and cost overruns. **Trump finished the project in four months—two months ahead of schedule—and more than $750,000 under budget.**

### A Second Chance: West Side Rail Yards

Six years after Trump’s purchase option for the West Side rail yards expired, he bought the site for about $95 million.

**As Trump created his plans, he tailored it to the site’s strengths** —the views of the Hudson River and the cityscape—**and the area’s needs** —basic shopping. But in order to get the zoning approvals, Trump had to convince city officials that NYC would also benefit from his plans.

Trump learned that NBC was considering a move from its headquarters at Rockefeller Center to New Jersey. **Trump courted NBC to move to his site, and he used his plan to convince the city that approving his zoning and tax abatement could keep the network in New York.**

However, in the end, Trump couldn’t get the zoning approvals he wanted and decided to wait to move forward on the project.

Trump details opportunities, curveballs, and strategic maneuvering in his accounts of these deals. Through them all, several primary principles guide him in his ascension from rookie real estate developer to well-known mogul.
