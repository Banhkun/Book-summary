## Chapter 5: Trump’s First NYC Deal—34th Street Convention Center

Trump always aimed to work on projects in Manhattan, but in the early years of his career, he couldn’t afford any properties that he felt were worth their prices. Until he could do business in Manhattan, he decided he could at least live there, so he got a small apartment on the Upper East Side.

Coming home to Manhattan every day—though he was still working in Brooklyn—gave him a new perspective and different access to Manhattan life and business. Through persistence, he became a member of Le Club, an exclusive club whose membership included many successful business people. Trump considered his outings at Le Club both social and professional, as he rubbed elbows with people he’d later do business with.

Trump soon went after his first deal in Manhattan—and it was a massive one.

### Their Loss Is Your Win: Trump Bought in a Down Market

In 1973, New York City’s real estate development began to drop off dramatically for several reasons:

  * The city’s debt was so high that people started fearing the city would go bankrupt. 
  * The federal government stopped giving out housing subsidies, which had been a big source of building funding in New York. 
  * Interest rates rose for the first time in years.
  * Inflation also rose, which greatly affected construction costs. 



Perpetually finding opportunity in others’ struggles, **Trump saw the silver lining of this downturn: He could get properties at low prices, and he trusted that New York would always be desirable enough that real estate values would inevitably rise.**

Specifically, Trump eyed 100 acres of abandoned rail yard from 59th Street to 72nd Street along the Hudson River. The Penn Central Railroad, which owned the land, was bankrupt and selling off assets. Trump put in an offer for the rail yard.

### Buy Good and Make It Better: Trump Saw the Property’s Potential

When Penn Central was selling the land, the area was full of welfare hotels and drug dealers. Still, Trump couldn’t resist the lure of undeveloped riverfront property—plus, much of it was still near Central Park and desirable residential areas.

**Trump was confident that developing the area would revive the neighborhood**. Attracting a different kind of traffic through the area would inevitably lower crime and other issues and allow the land to live up to its full potential.

### Have a Bargaining Chip: Trump Convinced Penn Central to Sell to Him

Trump was just 27 years old and didn’t have any construction projects on his resume—besides those he watched his father lead. However, he had the gumption to make a move on the ambitious project, and that drive is what he emphasized to Victor Palmieri, the man Penn Central had hired to sell off the railroad’s assets.

In addition, **Trump framed the deal as if he was doing Penn Central Railroad a favor** :

  * He underscored that the West Side neighborhood was undesirable and that the city was in poor financial shape. 
  * He talked about how difficult it’d be to get zoning approvals for such a large undeveloped property. 



Ultimately, Palmieri accepted Trump’s bid and even offered him a second property, the rail yards on West 34th Street. Trump got options to buy both sites for $62 million with no money down.

### Promote: Trump Built Credibility

**The 60th Street Yards and West 34th Street site were major projects for an unproven young developer, so Trump used promotion to create a bigger image of himself.**

First, he began calling his company the Trump Organization. His logic was that the word “organization” added gravitas to inflate the perception of his experience and ability.

Second, Trump flaunted his connection with politicians, including NYC Mayor Abraham Beame. Trump’s father knew Beame because he belonged to the same Democratic club, but the connection ultimately did nothing to help Trump get approval for his project plans.

(Shortform note: A 1979 Village Voice article contradicts this, reporting that Trump got this deal because of his political pull, particularly with Mayor Beame.)

Third, Palmieri helped promote Trump’s drive and enthusiasm in the media. Trump had gotten Palmieri to believe in him, and **Palmieri’s backing helped Trump gain credibility.**

### Have a Backup Plan: Trump Pivoted From Plan A to Plan B

Trump initially planned to build middle-income housing on the two rail yard sites. However, in 1975, New York City’s economy got even worse and the city pulled financing from nearly all new housing construction. In addition, the state stopped financing low- and middle-income housing for five years.

**Trump turned to plan B: He proposed building a convention center on the West 34th Street site**.

But he faced some obstacles:

  * The city had already invested millions in studying the viability of building a convention center on another site, at 44th Street. 
  * Soon after the city froze financing on new housing, it also suspended development on the 44th Street site—and instead began considering a site in Battery Park City on the southern tip of Manhattan. 



### Promote: Trump Capitalized on Criticism

Trump needed to convince the city that 34th Street was the best location for the new convention center, and his tactic was to bring as much attention as possible to himself and his plan.

Trump called a news conference and made a few key points to frame the issue:

  * He underscored the importance of building a convention center, despite the fact that many were skeptical that it was worth the investment at a time when the city was struggling financially. Trump said that a new convention center would revitalize the city’s image and economy. 
  * He talked about the other sites’ flaws and, by contrast, how perfect the West 34th Street site was. 



**When critics rallied against Trump’s proposal, it created more media attention for Trump and gave him the opportunity to promote his site’s assets.**

### NYC Chose Trump’s Site But Not Trump’s Oversight

Ultimately, Trump’s persistence outlasted his opposition. When the next administration took office under Mayor Ed Koch, it chose to move forward with the 34th Street site.

However, **the city and state decided to buy the site and take on the construction project themselves** . The $12 million sale earned Trump more than $800,000 in broker’s commission, per the deal he’d made with Penn Central.

Trump asked multiple times to build the convention center—at one point even offering to cover any overruns if the project cost more than $200 million—but the city turned him down each time.

Adding insult to injury, Trump felt the city mishandled the project:

  * The architect created a complicated, expensive design that was prone to cost overruns. 
  * The city decided to postpone building a parking garage until later, despite Trump’s insistence that parking was paramount for a convention center. At the time of publication, there was still no parking garage. 
  * The design put the entrance on the east side of the building, creating a view of Eleventh Avenue, instead of taking advantage of the riverfront views on the west side. 
  * The project ultimately ran over by four years and $250 million, plus carrying costs. 



### Know When to Fold: Trump Released 60th Street

Even considering all the time, energy, and money Trump put into 34th Street, he faced even more challenges developing the 60th Street site, which had been his initial interest.

His plan was still to create housing on that site, but he struggled with zoning approvals and financing while the city was still in bad economic shape. Making little progress, **Trump let his purchase option expire in 1979 so that he could focus his resources on other projects.**

Years later, he’d get another chance at the site; more on that in Chapter 13.
