## Part 6: The Final Lesson—Be Your Own Hero

You will struggle in life. There is no getting around it. But how you approach this struggle is what will separate you from those who will suffer eternally. **Everything you must endure in life is part of the grand plan to draw you closer to your true self and your unique gifts and give you the direction you need to move forward as the brilliant hero you are.** You will be presented with doorways of opportunity that will swing wide open for you to walk through and discover your deepest power and purest good nature. You just have to be willing to walk through to make it to the other side of tragedy or injustice.

Nelson Mandela said that true freedom is not achieved simply by removing the things that hold you down, but by engaging with the world in a way that honors others’ freedom. The darkness you experience in your life can either bind you to the shadows or lead you to the light. Every legendary producer had to endure great suffering to reach their pinnacle. They were able to achieve great feats because they leveraged the great pains of their lives to reinforce their strength and inspire their souls.

There are seven virtues that live within each hero, and **these virtues live inside you if you are willing to see them: 1) bravery, 2) forgiveness, 3) integrity, 4) understanding, 5) sincerity, 6) politeness, and 7) humility.** You must aspire to live with these virtues at the forefront of your life to truly become a leader capable of impacting the world.

#### Following Your Heroic Path

Today, make the decision to remove the shackles of your life so you can walk freely. Let go of past grievances, shame, blame, anger, hate, and apathy. Commit to rising at 5 a.m. to anchor your body, mind, and soul in the pursuit of greatness without any darkness clouding your heart. Allow your genius to reveal itself to you and develop it through discipline. **Use the Victory Hour and the other rituals of the 5 AM Club to deepen your spirit and give you the type of character that can infect the world with good.** Exemplify strength by being steadfast in your endeavors. Exemplify courage by showing up each day to win the battle for your exceptional future. Exemplify grace by spreading love to everyone you meet. This is how you build a legacy and become a legend.

Most people only dabble in legendary status. They reflect on their lives and their accomplishments in small bursts before the rest of the world swoops in and steals their focus with distractions. They think about how they live among others and what their impact will be between notifications and social media posts. These people will not be remembered as heroes.

Building your legacy must be a lifelong, focused effort. You need to actually reshape your life to live for something greater than yourself. **You must demand more than mediocrity from your efforts and use your energy to produce great works that will leave a mark on the world.** This is what being a hero in your own life and the lives of others means.

Don’t wait to become great when you have the time. Make the choice to commit to your transformational path, and open your heart to the immense possibilities that live inside you. Doubt, fear, and disappointment will be part of your journey, but you do not have to give them power. Stop focusing on them, and they will have no bearing on your decisions or actions. Celebrate every part of your majesty and all the miracles the world has to offer. Become a force of good in your life so you can be a force of good for the world. It all starts at 5 a.m. every morning.
