## Part 5: The Pendulum of Success—Productivity and Recovery

Reaching a mastery level of creativity and productivity requires sustainability over the long term. Maximum ceaseless effort can lead to burnout. If you put your head down and just go, go, go without ever taking the time to recuperate, you’ll wear down your stamina, motivation, and creative juices. Think of this principle as the 60-minute on, 10-minute off ritual supersized. **You must make time to recharge your energy sources, your mental capacity, and your creative spirit.** If you don’t, you’ll run straight into a brick wall and collapse.

### The Importance of Rest

Talent and desire are not enough to reach the pinnacle of your productive output. Success requires time for your ideas to grow, your work to take shape, and your results to have an impact. The only way you can accomplish these feats is by ensuring your four empires are operating at full capacity and you are able to approach your work with fresh vitality and endurance.

There are two significant ways that taking periods of rest support your capacity for peak performance. These are best understood through the lens of an athlete:

An athlete who overtrains without cool-down moments runs the risk of injury. They push their bodies to get stronger and faster, but the overexertion causes them to blow out a knee. The damage to the muscle tissue or tendons is so severe, they aren’t able to play again. If they had taken time to recover between workouts, they would have:

  * Avoided injury and been able to continue their career
  * Allowed the muscles to recover and grow stronger, increasing their potential



This second point is important to understand. **Periods of rest not only ensure that you don’t damage the assets required for you to perform your work but also allow your assets time to strengthen as a result of your intense training.** This process of strengthening during rest is called “supercompensation,” and it describes the way that growth happens during moments of respite.

#### How Supercompensation Works

Our society is built on the foundation that success comes from hard work. To accomplish more, you must work more. But science does not support this philosophy. **Research shows that your skills actually sharpen and grow stronger when you’re not working.** Think again of the athlete—they stretch their muscles to their limits during intense periods of training, but one or two days of rest allows the muscle to repair into a more durable and elevated tool.

Your mind needs time to recalibrate based on the training and productivity you’ve put it through so it can take all of that information and effort and reshape it into a stronger and more capable machine. When you return to work, your brain will be stronger than it was before, and your baseline of achievement will be elevated.

**You have 5 assets at your disposal when it comes to your work: 1) mental focus, 2) physical endurance, 3) motivation and willpower, 4) natural gifts, and 5) productivity time.** You must protect these assets so you are always able to work at a peak performance level when you sit down to create. When these assets have time to recalibrate and fortify, they lead to extraordinary capacities for creative output and productivity.

As you know, these assets are strongest in the morning, which is why you push to exploit them during those valuable first hours. But as your cognitive capacity wanes over the course of a day, you become less productive and able to make good choices. This is true when we turn our attention from a day to a week. Your willpower and cognitive power are greatest at the beginning of the week and exhausted toward the end. Just like your evening ritual is important to recharge your batteries for another productive Victory Hour, days off are important to recharge for another week of intense focus and creation.****

**High achievement is not a straight line of activity but a pendulum clicking back and forth between cycles of excellence and cycles of deep restoration.** You must shape your life to swing completely in the direction of passionate, unrelenting focus and effort and then swing back to times of inactivity and peaceful enjoyment of life. You may believe that doing nothing equals a lack of motivation or a waste of time, but doing nothing is required to develop higher levels of performance and increased energetic output.

### How to Find the Balance

To accomplish the most, be committed to your work. The tennis legend Billie Jean King suggested that pressure was a sign of greatness. You only feel pressure and stress when you’re striving for something big and important. If you were striving for mediocrity, the level of pressure would be low.

Recognize that pressure and stress are symbols of high achievement and lean into them.**** Push forward and keep producing at a high level, even when you feel like quitting. **The times you are least motivated to work are when you can grow the most.** When you actively push your willpower and discipline to the limit, they will grow stronger when you stop to rest. This strength creates a new foundation for the rest of your life.

So what does a cycle of deep restoration look like? The key to restoration is self-care. You must take care of yourself to perform your best work, and the precursor to self-care is self-love. Self-love is the internal expression of loving your external life. Finding the joy in life and having fun are essential for a life well-lived. Success without joy is not true success. There is a magic in life available to anyone willing to seek it, and you seek it by following your heart.

#### The Keys to Cultivating Joy

Taking time off and lounging begrudgingly is not a representation of joy. **You must use your cycle of restoration to fill your heart with goodness and your body with wonder and light because these things repair the strained and torn muscles of endurance and motivation.**

The following are some ways to bring more joy into your life:

  * **Use words wisely.** Words have power, and what you say becomes what you believe. If you’re always complaining about what you lack or injustices, you’re manifesting insufficiency and injustice in your life. Use your words to craft the life you want. Talk about your dreams, the endless possibilities available in life, the hope you have for a better future, and the love you have for yourself and those around you. 
  * **Take two device-free days a week.** Allow your brain to replenish its stores of creativity by removing distractions completely. 
  * **Take two days off of work a week.** Venture into beautiful territory. Go camping, stay at a spa, visit the ocean, find a relaxing environment and read for enjoyment, visit friends, or take long walks in the wilderness. 
  * **Take a week off each quarter.** Make time to travel and explore different environments. 
  * **Pursue hobbies**. Learn to knit, paint, play an instrument, cook, ski, or mountain bike. Finding something else you love to do will continue your joy when you step away from your work. 
  * **Visit art galleries.** Surround yourself with masterful work, and sit quietly to hear the whispers of geniuses. 
  * **Let go of the past.** Grievances, regret, and concerns about the future are hindrances to your ability to be present in the moment. 
  * **Surround yourself with positive and loving people.**



The key to restoration is finding your version of Heaven on Earth. Heaven is not a location but a state of mind. You can’t think your way to Nirvana; you must feel your way toward it. **Your instincts are smarter than your intelligence, and if you can shut down your work brain and open your heart, you’ll be led to the things you enjoy.** When you submerge yourself in your heart’s delights, you open a frequency to your spiritual energy.

Take time to find the magic of life so your Mindset, Heartset, Healthset, and Soulset can become infused with the love they need to amplify. You will be brought closer to the pure nature of your character that was readily available as a child before fear and worry clouded your sense of wonder. There is so much beauty in the world that can uplift and inspire you if you’re willing to move through it with curiosity and vision.

### 11 Mottos to Help Navigate a Joyful Life

There is great power in the universe, and you can tap into it anytime you want by trusting your heart, staying positive, and pursuing activities that reflect the kind of life you want to live. The following mottos will help you keep your focus on creating a beautiful life.

**Motto 1: Find Magic in the Universe by Finding Magic in Yourself**

The most important relationship you have in this world is with yourself. When you look in the mirror, you must love the person reflected back. How you love yourself equals the amount of love you have to share with the world. Approach your internal relationship like you would a relationship with a loved one. **Find isolated time to be with yourself so you can explore your soul and become aware of your most special traits.** Sit peacefully with your heart to discover your passions. Quiet your mind so your true beliefs rise above those influenced by the external world. When you create a space to understand yourself better, you receive valuable insights about your unique genius that will transform your life and work.

**Motto 2: Value Experiences over Possessions**

You’ve been told by society that the amount of money you make, the kind of car you drive, and the size of your home are all indications of success. Your status at work has become what defines your identity. Seeking these fortunes has replaced your childlike desire for fun and adventure with a focus on acquiring material things. But possessions don’t equal happiness. Seek out activities that make you laugh, touch your heart, or blow your mind. Be playful in your life and develop a hunger for miraculous experiences. Collect joy like you collect paychecks. Happiness is the only currency that counts at the end of your life.

**Motto 3: Be Willing to Fail**

If you don’t experience failure from time to time, it means you’re playing life so safe that you never take a chance. And you cannot succeed to your full potential if you don’t take chances. Fear of rejection, humiliation, or self-loathing keeps you from putting everything on the line to achieve something unbelievable. This is because you believe failure is a sign of weakness. You must stop tamping down the power of your gifts and possibilities because you’re afraid to fail. Failure breeds growth, and being willing to fail breeds courage. **Say yes to opportunities that scare you so you can rise above your limitations and soar to great heights.**

**Motto 4: Be the Architect of Your Life**

Satisfaction with your life is a slippery slope. You might tell yourself to be happy with what you have so you can feign satisfaction for a life unlived to its full potential, but complacency is the enemy of growth. When you rationalize your dreams away and ignore the power you have to create beautiful things that impact the world, you build a mediocre future. But you have four tools in your toolbox that help you create the life you want if you’re willing to start the process of building it: your thoughts, feelings, language, and actions. Use your thoughts to envision your goals and what it feels like to accomplish them. Use your feelings to show gratitude for what you have and all the good that awaits in your future. Speak only about hope, strength, and abundance. And behave in the manner that aligns with your most hopeful version of yourself. Use the gifts you have now to build a truly satisfying life.

**Motto 5: Remove Toxic People From Your Life**

Negative people are like leeches who drain your life force. Scientists call this leeching “emotional contagion,” which describes the influence that bad energy has on your environment. Many people have experienced so much drama in their lives, they feel most comfortable when their world is in turmoil. You may know them as drama queens or kings. But you are on a journey of self-love and immense personal growth and discovery. If you surround yourself with people who only exist in the dark, you will become swallowed up by their shadows. Treat everyone with kindness and take the high road when someone tries to bring you low. And do what you can to engage with positive people, for their emotions are the ones you want to rub off on you.

**Motto 6: Live With Abundance to Create Abundance**

Money is one of the biggest stressors in life, and a fear of lack drives many people to hold onto money with an iron fist. But money is meant to flow like electrical currents, and to allow that current to flow into your life, you must continue the flow in the other direction. **Be generous with money to let the universe know you have enough to share, and you will receive even more.** Tip waiters, drivers, attendants, and housekeepers well. Give money to charitable organizations. Lavish your friends and family with gifts or financial support. Show gratitude for what you currently have and what you’re able to do with it. You only live in scarcity if you believe in scarcity. You don’t need to go into debt, but you must remove your conditioning that money is finite. Create positive expectancy about money, wherein you believe that it will always come to you when you need it, even if you don’t know from where, to attract abundance into your life.

**Motto 7: Prioritize Physical Health**

If you focus on maintaining good health, you reduce the need to waste valuable time trying to recover from poor health. That time can be put toward your creative output and joy fulfillment, and you will be able to engage with those endeavors longer. Many people don’t realize what poor shape they’re in because a low state of health is their baseline. But when you reach a high level of fitness, you begin to realize just how unfit you were before. Regulate your sleep cycles, eat nutritious foods, elevate your heart rate, and sweat to encourage positive chemical reactions in your brain. Your extraordinary vitality will set you above the competition.

**Motto 8: Never Settle for Good Enough**

Human nature is highly adaptable. You have the ability to adapt to changes in circumstances and move forward with your new normal. The problem with this new normal is that the novelty soon wears off and your achievement becomes just another aspect of life. You reason that it’s good enough and become complacent. To avoid this conundrum, **focus on growth rather than accomplishment**. Never settle for a better plateau. Seek to continue climbing to the highest peak available. Keep your standards high and your efforts focused on reaching beyond your current limits. This doesn’t mean being dissatisfied, but rather increasing your strengths and powers.

**Motto 9: Give Love Away Like Your Life Depends On It**

Love generates love. You were put on this earth to take the love you have and share it with the world. Never miss an opportunity to show someone love, and tell the people in your life how much you love them. As you expand your capacity to love, you expand your capacity to experience love, which leads to joy. Write letters to your friends or “thank you” notes to people who’ve supported your life. Show more interest in the lives of others than in professing your own value. **Each person you meet has the ability to bring something fresh and amazing to your life, and you can unlock those gifts through the sharing of love.**

**Motto 10: Seek Peace Within, Not Without**

As stated, Heaven is not a location to be found but a state of mind to be captured. Your personal Heaven lies within your Mindset, Heartset, Healthset, and Soulset. Cultivate a better relationship with yourself. You are the only one who knows what you’re made of, and you discover who that is when you find inner peace and joy. Everything that has happened to you has been to get you to this point. Reflect on the journey and find gratitude for the lessons and insights it's brought to your life. Within that landscape is the secret to who you are and where you’re going. Open yourself up to growth and experience Heaven.

**Motto 11: Live Each Day Like It’s Your Last**

None of us is guaranteed a tomorrow. Accidents, illness, and tragedy happen every day, and missed opportunities become set in stone. Each second you’re alive is a blessing. Don’t waste it worrying about the future or planning to be happy. You can’t wait for great things to happen to allow yourself to feel pleasure and joy with your life. **Embrace your mortality so you appreciate each moment you are alive.** Share the love you have in your heart now, take risks, and create space to be unreasonable. Celebrate the small victories and soak up the majesty of the world and your life with each breath you’re still able to breathe.
