## Part 2: The Foundations of Integrity, Commitment, and Excellence

There are five maxims underlying the 5 AM Club that can help guide your journey to excellence.

**1\. One hour of tranquility leads to a lifetime of achievement.** Great achievers know how to shut down the distractions in their lives to allow their creative spirit to thrive. When you take an hour each morning to exist in peaceful isolation, you lay the bricks for a productive day, which lays the bricks for a productive life.

**2.** **There is no power in excuses.** You can rationalize your way out of any behavior—it’s unfamiliar, uncomfortable, or too extreme. If these excuses keep you from being open to change, then you’re validating them. Waking up early may not be familiar, comfortable, or normal, but that doesn’t mean it won’t be one day. **Small adjustments on a daily basis are all that is needed to create real growth and change in your life.**

**3\. Without struggle, there will be no glory.** The trajectory of change moves from difficult to chaos to beauty. Everything that now comes naturally to you was awkward and hard in the beginning. Getting up early will challenge you, but persisting through the difficult moments will make it routine, and you will rise shining bright with the sun.

**4\. Being extraordinary means being different.** The 5 AM Club is an elite group not because of their status, but because there are so few people willing to commit to becoming excellent. Only 5% of people are willing to push out of their comfort zones to focus on mastering their craft. The other 95% will ridicule your behavior and call you eccentric. If you’ve reached the level of eccentricity, you’re well on your way to achieving your highest level of greatness.

**5\. There is only one direction that leads to greatness.** Starting this morning routine will hurt, and challenging yourself to dive deep into your personal power will scare you. You’ll want to quit and retreat back to safety. But clarity and mastery only happen when you do the work to attain them. **The only direction to the excellence you want is forward. Be relentless, even when you have lost all hope of victory.**

### The Difference Between Mediocrity and Greatness

The above maxims separate the weak from the strong and serious from the dilettantes. Many people talk a good game but don’t walk their talk. They tout dreams and ambitions and regale you with ideas about how they will achieve greatness, but they don’t do the work required to achieve their goals. **They move through each day like a robot, doing the same things and hoping for new results because they’re too afraid to pursue new actions that lead to new results.**

The 95% of people content to live mediocre lives seek validation from the external world. Their egos run the show, and when they lose their status or the admiration of the outside world, they lose themselves and power. In contrast, the 5% seeking mastery realize that real strength comes from tapping into your true nature and exploring your inherent gifts. When you take responsibility for your growth, you gain courage, awareness, integrity, and willpower.

A butterfly must shed its caterpillar skin before it can fly. **You, too, must shed your old life to begin the process of forming a new fulfilling life.**

The first day you choose to implement the 5 a.m. morning ritual, you create a shift in your world. As that shift leads to more adjustments in perspective and productivity, your confidence and dedication will grow and wash away your fears. You will stumble during this growth period, but **a defeat for your ego is a victory for your soul**. You can use these hits to your ego as markers for your success along your journey.

You don’t need much to be an influential person. Your days should be spent pursuing your creative power and vision of excellence, not material items that have no bearing on who you are as a person. Pursuits of integrity over selfishness give you the power to contribute meaningfully to the world.

You can have this amazing life by making one change to elevate your days. **When you make waking early your keystone habit, you start each day in peace.** You’ll feel more centered because your mind is more focused and your heart more at ease. The pathway this habit creates opens your power source wide so you can achieve “flow,” or a heightened mental perception that encourages uninterrupted high-quality processing. You will tap into a deeper well in your psyche and see how much more you have at your disposal to achieve. And when you reach this flow state, your old patterns reshape into a new path for ultimate success.

### The Basic 3-Step Model of the 5 AM Club

A 3-step success formula encompasses the foundational model of the 5 AM Club. This formula focuses on granularity—attention to a precise level of detail—which is required to master your craft and excel. Exceptional performers in art, industry, and life understand that the work they put into the world reflects back onto them. Their characters are represented in the value of the work they do, and they refuse to show anything but the utmost respect for their work or themselves.

**If you want to be a great achiever, you need to go beyond the superficial level of your work.** Too often, the path of least resistance is enough to get by, but you aren’t someone looking to get by. You want to achieve greatness, which means you need to be thoughtful in your work and consider every detail as a significant detail. Keep your standards high and accept nothing less than perfection. Focus on one piece of work to show it the respect it deserves. One great piece of work is worth a million mediocre pieces. You must aim for this level of greatness daily and do what it takes to follow through.

#### The 3-Step Formula

This formula is at the foundation of every lesson you will take from the practices of the 5 AM Club.

  * **First, educate yourself**. When you learn, you become more aware of ideas and opportunities. This information helps you further your personal and professional development by allowing you to make more-informed decisions about your craft. 
  * **Second, implement your knowledge.** Your better decisions lead to more practical implementation of your knowledge into your work. 
  * **Third, improve your results.** As you work more efficiently and effectively, you get better results. Greater results lead to greater success in your field and a larger impact on society. 



The 95% of average achievers will call your process obsessive or outlandish, and they wouldn’t be wrong. **You must approach your craft with unwavering commitment and a zeal for refinement to attain the “GCA,” or _gargantuan competitive advantage_.** Your refusal to compromise on perfection is what leads to high-level achievement. When you approach your work on this granular level, you can see the details that elevate your work. This level of detail is so important because it only takes one tiny error or overlooked factor to turn something amazing into a disaster.

Remember, education leads to high awareness, which leads to better choices about the work, which leads to better implementation of your efforts, which leads to better outcomes. Have pride in your process and determination so you can have pride in your work. **Small incremental successes daily build to a triumphant life, and how you manage that first hour is the most important aspect of preparing yourself to successfully move through the formula.**

### The Victory Hour and the Four Power Arenas

Before you can use the Victory Hour successfully, you must understand the elements underlying it: Strength Capitalization, Brain Training, Internal Enhancement, and Positive Accumulation.

**Mastering these four arenas is important because they help bring you closer to who you truly are and the necessary actions that bring out your inner genius daily.** Mastering your life means making space for gratitude, courage, and commitment in your morning routine. You can use the Victory Hour to increase your energy, peace of mind, and significance in your actions.

#### Focus 1: Strength Building

As you’ve learned, what separates the successful from the mediocre is a steadfast determination to take the gifts you have and maximize their benefit. This maximization happens during the Victory Hour, when you have an opportunity to learn about your strengths and what is required for you to cultivate them to a high standard.

This dedicated time is the antithesis of how many of us live. We’re used to rushing during the day, feeling like there’s never enough time to complete everything we want to do or need to do to feel successful. Your life becomes controlled by time, not you, and peace and joy are always just out of reach. But when you wake early and commit to dedicated and disciplined practice, you gain an advantage over your time and actions, essentially making your own luck by accentuating what is possible over what is known.

**Research suggests that your perception of your potential dictates your behavior and results.** If you believe you’re not capable of achieving greatness, you won’t ever achieve it because you likely won’t put forth the effort to try. Why study, train, and work hard to succeed if there is a cap to what you’re able to accomplish?

You have the potential to become great in whatever you set your mind to. You have a unique gift you were born to excel at, and you have an inherent drive to reach your full potential that, when allowed to flourish, can motivate you to strive for greatness. Regardless of whether you want to be a professional athlete, a CEO, or a baker, you can use the Victory Hour to examine your potential and shorten the distance between reality and your perception of reality.

When you bring awareness to your life, you start to see the lessons presented to you to help you grow. Until you recognize the steps along the path laid out before you, you will not progress from your current life. **You must start searching for the right solutions, rather than the easy ones, to uplift your life.**

You must approach your life with a childlike wonder, respect, and confidence so you can clearly see your path and begin to make intentional steps down it. This intention is the definition of strength capitalization.

#### Focus 2: Brain Training

You have two areas of your brain battling for your attention daily. The first is called the “Ancient Brain,” which is the lower-functioning portion of the brain that encompasses the limbic system. This part of the brain is hardwired to identify threats in your environment and try to thwart them.

The Ancient Brain triggers chemical processes that ramp up your fear and activates your fight or flight reflex. **You feel stressed or anxious, even when there is no immediate threat in your environment.**

The other part of the brain is the prefrontal cortex, or the “Mastery Brain.” Some scientists refer to this part of the brain as the _high mind_ because it is responsible for cognitive reasoning and analysis. Your creativity, productivity, and foresight live within this part of the brain.

When you start the process of growth, the Ancient Brain kicks in. It recognizes that your comfort zone is being challenged and warns you against the invading dangers. This sensation creates self-sabotage, wherein you actively destroy the work and processes of growth and achievement. You may turn to distractions or allow negative thoughts to take over and keep you from attempting to become more.

Your task is to become aware of the tactics of the Ancient Brain so you can acknowledge them for what they are and ignore them. **The only way to tap into your unique genius is by venturing into the unknown parts of yourself where strength, courage, and creativity reside.** You must turn to the Mastery Brain, and you must do this by refocusing your life on only what is important to your achievement of those goals.

You have a finite capacity for thought each day that gets used with each new activity you give your attention to. The more things you turn your attention to, the more diminished your capacity for thought becomes. And when you start your day without intention, you’re essentially walking into the world like a magnet, ready to attract whatever distraction comes your way. You’ll have no mental capacity left by the end of it to give to internal reflection and growth.

The solitude and peacefulness of the Victory Hour provides the space for you to sit with your fears and confront them, rather than let them run your life. When the world is quiet and devoid of distractions, you are able to hear your inner voice and open yourself up to your strength and talent.**** Silence and tranquility activate your brain to produce the neurotransmitter dopamine, which sends pleasure signals to your nervous system, and serotonin, which improves mood. These chemical processes create the flow state mentioned previously.

Victory loves resiliency. Challenges are what help you grow. **To win the battle of the two minds, discover your courage and hold tight to it when fear threatens to hinder your progress.** You must remove the distractions you turn to for safe harbor that dilute your creative potential. When you do this, you will find your true self along the path of discovery and mastery and begin to lead an authentic life, one where your full potential is celebrated.

#### Focus 3: Personal Growth

The quality of your internal awareness dictates the quality of your life. Nothing happens in the external world that isn’t a mirror image of what’s happening internally. **There are four internal structures, or _empires_ , that can create an environment ripe for growth when you intentionally consider and nurture them.** When you give these areas attention during the Victory Hour, you begin each day balanced and ready for peak performance. The four empires are Mindset, Heartset, Healthset, and Soulset.

**1\. Mindset**

You are likely familiar with the adage, “Mind over matter,” which means that positive thinking leads to positive outcomes. **You must have a strong Mindset about your potential to be able to take the necessary steps to achieve it.** But a powerful mind is only 25% of what is needed to own your creative and productive potential.

**2\. Heartset**

Your heart is an important part of your internal state because it is where emotions live. To win the war against distractions and apathy, you must clear out any emotions that hinder your growth. **Clear your heart of toxicity by letting go of pain, heartache, fear, rage, and jealousy and champion the positive emotions of love, forgiveness, gratitude, and inspiration.** Your heart must be at peace if you want to truly transform.

**3\. Healthset**

Your physical health is just as important as your spiritual health. Your goal for achieving your creative and productive potential is to create a life of meaning and impact, and you can’t do that if you’re dealing with poor health or prematurely aging. Focus on strengthening your body and defying age so your gifts can be celebrated and advanced for decades to come. When you use the Victory Hour to exercise and focus on strengthening your physical form, you’ll start each day with more energy and cognitive bandwidth. Exercise also promotes the release of serotonin, which helps reduce stress and anxiety.

**4\. Soulset**

You have a beautiful spirit inside of you that is pure and intuitive. **When you sit with your spirituality, you earn a greater capacity for insight, love, and benevolence** and can begin to shape a more positive philosophy for your place in the world. To do this, you need to use the solitude of the Victory Hour to reflect on life and be available to the messages your soul sends to you to give you spiritual direction.

Your power resides in the attendance to these empires each day. When they combine, they create a calm, undisturbed, and inspired internal environment in which you can truly begin to do the work to achieve your full potential.

#### Focus 4: Positive Accumulation

The most important aspect of the Victory Hour is the way it sets the stage for a productive day. Each day should be seen as a singular representation of your full life. **What you do today adds to the path that leads to your future.**

Think of it as a flight plan. You set a path from Los Angeles to New York and follow it to the destination. But a small shift in direction every half hour, such as a 1-inch adjustment to the right, will accumulate into a massive detour. You might end up in the Caribbean or Australia by the time your journey is over. These small adjustments in the four empires (Mindset, Heartset, Healthset, Soulset) each morning have the ability to disrupt your current life plan in the same way. All it takes is a 1% shift daily to lead to a new life over time.

These enhancements can also be external. Changing your morning routine, how you approach colleagues, what you choose to read, and how you spend your free time are all adjustments that accumulate into life-altering events. **Your task is to accumulate as many of these positive 1% shifts as you can to head down the path to fulfillment and growth.**

The reason practitioners of the 5 AM Club are so successful at achieving their goals and potential is because they are consistent in their efforts. You can adjust the morning routine to serve your week as you see fit, but realize that a part-time commitment will never lead to full-time results. Own each morning to allow your momentum to increase exponentially and create a beautiful and full life.

### Create Excellent Habits to Achieve Excellence

Good habits are the key to aligning your internal structure for success. Mastery does not happen overnight. You gain mastery through persistence in performing behaviors that tap into your power. This persistence is known as “grit,” or a state of resilience, willpower, and steadfast determination. **Grit is what separates those with ambitions and those with success.** Make persistence a habit, and you’ll discover parts of yourself you never knew existed.

#### The 5-3-1 Doctrine of Willpower

Making a substantial change in your life is difficult, and forming that change into a lasting habit is even harder. Follow the 5-3-1 doctrine to adopt the right mindset.

**The 5 Tenets of Successful Habits**

  * Willpower is not a predisposition, but a strength developed with persistence over time. 
  * Discipline is the reward for battles waged against your comfort zone daily. 
  * Recuperation is required to allow your willpower to recharge. 
  * Habits form when you follow four distinct steps (discussed below) daily without fail.
  * Discipline in one area of life leads to discipline as a lifestyle. 



**The 3 Principles of Disciplined People**

  * You can’t win the war if you don’t show up to fight daily. 
  * Your self-respect increases when you commit to finishing what you started. 
  * Your private determination becomes your public mode of operation. 



**The 1 Theory That Guides Greatness**

  * Always do what is right, rather than what is comfortable, and you will become a warrior.



You will endure setbacks, rejections, and ridicule from others when you make persistence a priority. You will be forced to sacrifice what is comfortable and familiar to reach greatness. **But** **you cannot transform if you don’t suffer, so you must accept that and remain loyal to your goals regardless of how hard the path becomes.**

#### Make Early Rising a Habit

You may feel absolutely certain that you are not the kind of person who can join the 5 AM Club. Waking early doesn’t fit your lifestyle, or you doubt your ability to stick with it. But you have the ability to join the 5 AM Club because you have the ability to rewire your brain for excellence.

Science has proven that the brain is capable of growing and forming new neural pathways even into adulthood. Your brain is like a muscle, and like your biceps, the more you train, the stronger it grows. When you work to create a new habit, you’re training your brain to rewire itself to make your actions automatic. **The more you push your willpower to overcome obstacles, the stronger your neural pathways become; eventually, they are formed so completely that they become ingrained.**

There are four phases of habit formation that, when worked through, signal the brain to ingrain new behavior: the trigger, the ritual, the reward, and the repetition.

  * The **_trigger_** is the thing that starts your behavior each day. To rise early, this is likely your alarm clock. 
  * The **_ritual_** is the behavior you want to create. To rise early, this ritual means getting out of bed as soon as the alarm sounds. Don’t allow yourself to linger in bed. Your action must be the same every day for it to become a habit. Forcing yourself to get up at the sound of the alarm strengthens your willpower. 
  * The **_reward_** is what positively reinforces your ritual. When you achieve your behavioral goal, give yourself a treat that brings joy to your life. You will begin to associate that joy with the ritual. 
  * The **_repetition_** phase is the most important of the four. You must be dedicated to moving through this process the same way every day to form a new pathway in your brain. Each day that you successfully follow through and get out of bed at 5 AM, you alter a part of yourself. Your strength, sense of self, and dedication will grow to such lengths that your ritual will no longer feel like a struggle. 



Your capacity for willpower is the strongest first thing in the morning. This is why the Victory Hour is so important. But your willpower has limits. Like muscle fatigue, your work to make the right choices each day creates mental and emotional fatigue. Take time to rest and allow your mind to recuperate so it can be strong again the next day.

You can also reduce the strain on your self-control by reducing the number of decisions you make daily. **Focus on important things, and remove distractions to ensure your mental energy is directed at what is useful, rather than what is wasteful.**

#### The 3 Stages of Mental Transformation

Once you start working through the four steps to form a new habit, you must stick with it for 66 days. This is the amount of time it takes for the brain to create a new, ingrained behavior. You will travel through three different stages along the way before your behavior becomes automatic: destruction, installation, and integration.

**Phase 1: Destruction**

True change is hard. You are essentially rewiring your brain to let go of familiar and standard patterns and create new patterns. Think of it as a death—the old you has to die for the new you to be born. You will require a high level of willpower to kill off the old you because the forces of that old life will do what they can to hold you down.

This stage will last for 22 days, during which time the gravity of your old life will hold your growth hostage. But **the more you wage war with your old self and succeed in implementing positive change, your ability to escape those clutches increases**. This is called “escape velocity,” and you build it by the momentum of your continual efforts to rise above your fears and discomfort to reach for something greater. Stay disciplined in your morning ritual, and you will make it over the first hurdle and move on to the next.

**Phase 2: Installation**

At this point, you’ve successfully fought your inner demons and destroyed your old way of living. You have a clean slate, and this is the moment when you start to rebuild. **The installation phase is challenging because the energy it takes your brain to fully connect the new pathway from neuron to neuron is considerable.** Your other faculties will begin to suffer as a result.

You’ll start to feel discombobulated, anxious, and out of control. The stress of experiencing this level of instability will make you want to give up even more than before. But continue forward because this high level of confusion and exhaustion is the consequence of positive changes happening inside.

This phase will last for another 22 days. Be patient and disciplined. Each day lays another one of the 22 bricks necessary to reach implementation. Stick to your ritual, and you will soon reap the benefit of all your suffering.

**Phase 3: Integration**

The light at the end of the tunnel begins on Day 1 of your final 22 days, or Day 45 of the process. Your neural pathway of your new behavior is almost completed. Your ability to wake up at 5 AM is easier now, and **as you continue the ritual over these final 22 days, you reinforce your new behavioral pathway**. And at the end of those days, you will have reached the point of automaticity. You no longer have to think about performing your ritual because it is now ingrained behavior.

Joining the 5 AM Club as a full member creates a new foundation for your life that allows you to continue growing to exponential levels. From this new foundation, you can build additional new habits. This is how masters build exceptional lives. They don’t stop with one great habit. They use their increased strength and discipline to continue growing.
