## Introduction: The Narrative of the 5 AM Club

In a dark room, a once strong and successful woman considered taking her life. She was in her 30s and had built a profitable company that was regarded as one of the best in its field. But recent events had taken her will to live. Investors and members of her board were trying to steal her company, and it was too much to bear.

While contemplating the end of her life, she noticed an invitation to a personal optimization conference her mother had given her. These sorts of mystical self-help programs were not the entrepreneur’s usual cup of tea, but she felt drawn toward it. Perhaps she needed a new perspective on her life. Changing her life seemed like a better option than ending it, so she decided to go.

### The Intersection of Four Lives

Thousands of people attended the personal optimization conference to hear the wise words of the sage, known as the Spellbinder. This man spoke about developing your true creative spirit and increasing your productivity to extraordinary levels. But as he spoke, he seemed to be losing strength. Without warning, the Spellbinder collapsed to the floor, and the conference hall was cleared out. (He later recovered.)

But three individuals were too shocked to leave. The entrepreneur found herself in the company of a heavy man with dreadlocks, who she learned was a painter. The artist had come to the conference to learn how to tap into his creative potential. He wanted to produce art that would make a mark on the world, and he needed to learn how to quiet the inner demons that thwarted his efforts.

There was another man who approached the entrepreneur and the artist, a homeless man. He was dirty and dressed in rags, but there was a spark in his eye the others couldn’t quite explain. He also wore a large expensive watch and spoke with authority. The homeless man was well-versed in the teachings of the Spellbinder. He spoke of using those teachings to build an immense fortune. Of course, the other two thought he was crazy, but they were intrigued when he offered to fly them on his private jet to an island to learn the lessons of the Spellbinder.

### A Trip Around the World and Journey to the Soul

The entrepreneur and artist learned that the homeless man was, in fact, a billionaire and titan of industry when a Rolls Royce picked them up and took them to a private jet. It turns out the billionaire often dressed like a vagrant to stay grounded in the reality of life.

Over the next several weeks, the entrepreneur and artist traveled with the billionaire to his private compound on the island of Mauritius off the coast of Africa, Rome, South America, and South Africa. **The billionaire told them about the magic of the 5 AM Club and said they could join if they committed to his teachings and opened themselves up to personal growth.**

Each day started at 5 AM, and the billionaire guided them in understanding the theoretical principles guiding the methods of the 5 AM Club. At first, both the entrepreneur and artist struggled to adjust to the early hours and take in the lessons. But over time, waking up got easier, and they started to notice a shift in the perceptions of themselves and life and gained more inner peace. They also started to fall in love and eventually got engaged.

Once the artist and entrepreneur had developed a stronger mindset, the billionaire taught them the methodology of owning your morning to own your life. The three of them become bonded in their journeys of self-discovery, so when the billionaire started to show signs of poor health, the couple became concerned. But sickness would not stop the billionaire from taking them to the end of their journey, which would include a wedding ceremony in South America.

Along the journey, the entrepreneur received threats from her competitors back home. At first, she was scared. But after gaining a new sense of strength and belief in her abilities, she felt more confident and spiritually grounded. Eventually, with the help of the billionaire, she was able to defeat her enemies.

Finally, at the end of the journey, the entrepreneur and the artist went home together to start their new lives as members of the 5 AM Club.

### A Bright Future

Five years later, they were still practicing the methods and living a more joyful life. The billionaire had succumbed to his ailments and died shortly after their trip ended, and he left the couple his compound on Mauritius.

The entrepreneur was able to let go of her doubt and fear and took her business to great heights. She became incredibly wealthy and successful and used her morning routine to train for marathons. She’d run four since their trip. The artist went back to his studio and released his inner demons. He started creating important work and was now a renowned painter. He also ran two marathons with his wife and became a vegan.

**The journey of the entrepreneur, artist, and billionaire is the same journey you will take emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually to tap into your creative and productive potential.** You will learn the principles and methodologies of the 5 AM Club and be able to reach similar success in your life by committing to your journey of transformation.
