## Shortform Introduction

Robin Sharma wrote _The 5 AM Club_ as part fictional narrative, part instructional guide for creating a quality morning routine and life. The narrative is used as an entertainment device to develop the principles and practices as behaviors of four fictional characters. In this summary, weâ€™ve focused primarily on the principles and practices required for you to form a more successful morning routine, better habits, and a more exceptional life filled with creative productivity.

The chapters of the book are reorganized into the following sections for focused benefit:

_Part 1_ advises on how to find your creative genius and create an existence that allows it to shine through.

_Part 2_ provides the guiding principles that underlie the steps involved in creating a successful morning routine.

_Part 3_ takes you through the steps of creating a positive morning routine.

_Part 4_ helps you optimize the rest of your day and life to maintain your productive progress.

_Part 5_ conveys the importance of recuperation and how to find the balance with productivity.

_Part 6_ provides final thoughts on how to leave a lasting impact on the world.
