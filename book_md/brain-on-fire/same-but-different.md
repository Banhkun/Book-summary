## Same But Different

Nevertheless, when she compares pictures of herself taken before and after her illness, she notices that something has changed; something in her eyes reveals something lost...or gained.

In her everyday life, she notes subtle, unidentifiable differences that indicate she’ll never be the same person she was before.

She now talks in her sleep. She has to live with the possibility of relapsing (20 percent of patients who have recovered from her illness experience a relapse; patients who did not have teratomas, like Susannah, experience a higher relapse rate). When colors seem too bright, she wonders whether she’s going crazy again. Some of these changes scare her.

Even fully recovered, Susannah can remember only the hallucinations she experienced during her illness; she can’t recall its day-to-day reality. **This strange discrepancy makes her wonder whether she can rely on her own mind.** Why does she continue to favor hallucinations over reality? Why do those particular hallucinations persist? How did they materialize in the first place?

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> **Hallucinations**
> 
> Hallucinations occur when the brain perceives a sensation that has no external source. Because hallucinations are self-generated, they are believable and remembered in vivid detail, a process termed the _generation effect_.
> 
> Mental illness is not the sole source of hallucinations. A 2010 study at Cambridge University found that injecting healthy student volunteers with the drug ketamine broke down their sense of reality. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptors in the brain, much like the autoantibodies in Susannah’s illness.
> 
> **Memories**
> 
> Our brains form memories when two different areas of the brain identify an experience as important enough to be remembered. The hippocampus gives the experience context. The amygdala associates the experience with an emotion. The higher the emotion, the more likely the experience will be preserved as a memory. When these areas are compromised by disease, a memory may not form.
> 
> Memories are often inaccurate. Each time our brain recalls a memory, it rewrites it, adding new, possibly fictitious, information. For instance, Susannah’s memory of an orange band on her wrist saying Flight Risk wasn’t real; in fact, she had a yellow band that said Fall Risk.
> 
> On the other hand, authentic memories can be triggered by our senses, like the sudden recognition of a recognizable smell, color, or image.

Memories rush back to Susannah, knocking her off balance. With each memory recovered, she wonders what others remain, knowing there are thousands she’ll never retrieve. **The other Susannah, the mad Susannah, calls out to her, saying, “Don’t forget me. Please.”** The new Susannah knows that no matter how many memories she regains, or how much research she does, many bits of her life have simply vanished. Still, she’s comforted by the fact that even though she was not conscious during her lost month, some part of her was present after all.

Two years after her release from the hospital, Susannah returns to NYU for a visit. Much to her disappointment, nothing looks familiar. Until she’s hit by a smell. And she sees the purple lady. They hug, and images flood Susannah’s mind: Stephen arriving with his nature DVDs. Her father feeding her. Her mother staring out the window.

In addition to writing _Brain on Fire_ , Susannah has shared her stories with universities, hospitals, and psychiatric institutions. She helped start the Autoimmune Encephalitis Alliance, a nonprofit foundation fostering research and awareness of the illness.

At one time, Susannah couldn’t answer yes to the question, “Would you take it all back if you could?” Today, she doesn’t regret her month of madness. Its darkness yielded too much light.
