## The Hallucinations Begin

**En route to interview John Walsh at the _Post_ the next day, Susannah feels the walls caving in, the posters contracting and expanding. **Her perspective narrows, like she’s looking through a viewfinder. She tells herself to breathe and somehow makes it to the office where she’s to interview Walsh.

Walsh starts speaking, but Susannah can’t understand what he’s saying. Disassociated from his words, Susannah laughs uproariously at things that aren’t funny. Annoyed, Walsh’s publicist cuts the interview short.

Pressuring herself to appear competent, Susannah walks Walsh to the elevators. Unable to maintain her balance, she keeps bumping into the walls on the way.

**The next day, Susannah has another hallucination on her way to work.** The garish colors on the Times Square billboards make the hairs on her neck stand up. A scrolling banner makes her want to vomit. She’s instantly hit by a migraine.

She stumbles into work and tells Angela about her strange experience in Times Square. Frightened, Angela suggests that Susannah see another doctor.

**Finally, Susannah acknowledges to herself that something is wrong with her.** She bursts into uncontrollable tears and runs to the bathroom to splash cold water on her face, but as she looks around the bathroom, the stalls suddenly look alien to her. Has she really ever used one before?

Susannah asks another colleague for advice, and the woman gives her an excellent piece of counsel: **Susannah should write down every symptom, no matter how small it is. Even the tiniest detail could turn out to be important.** Susannah returns to her desk, writes down the word “insomnia” and shouts, “Everything’s going to be great!”

Buoyantly happy for the moment, Susannah saunters over to Paul’s desk and invites him downstairs for a smoke. As she talks a mile a minute, Paul becomes increasingly concerned, convinced she’s on the verge of a breakdown. Excusing himself, he goes upstairs and tells Angela to call Susannah’s mom.

Susannah’s now by herself on the street. She feels wobbly. **She floats above the crowd, seeing the top of her own head.** The Wiccan librarian walks by and tells Susannah she’s just experiencing astral travel.

Susannah returns to the newsroom. To get a better idea of what’s going on, Angela invites Susannah to go to a nearby bar at a local hotel, where they can talk. En route to the bar, Susannah has a panic attack. She’s overcome by fear and begins to sob.

Finally, they reach the bar. The abstract patterns in the carpet merge and swirl in front of Susannah’s eyes. She tries to ignore it, but when Angela asks her what’s really going on, **Susannah finally admits that something is happening to her but she doesn’t know what it is.**

**That night marks a turning point.** Stephen pampers Susannah by cooking her an elaborate meal, but she uncharacteristically lies to him about going to the bar with Angela. Her thoughts run wild. She paces and chain-smokes. She gags over dinner. She’s consumed by the desire to escape. Though she hasn’t slept in three days, she can’t fall asleep. She tries watching a cooking show, then everything goes hazy.

And dark.

**Susannah has her first seizure.**

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Seizures take many forms. During a tonic-clonic seizure, the victim goes rigid, blacks out, shakes uncontrollably, and foams at the mouth. Susannah’s first seizure was tonic-clonic.
> 
> Other seizures, called partials, are more subtle, like bouts of staring, mental fogginess, or repetitive movements. All seizures indicate disturbance somewhere in the brain. Disturbance in the visual cortex produces hallucinations. Disturbance in the motor cortex produces zombielike movements.
> 
> While Susannah’s tonic-clonic seizure was instantly recognizable, she had been experiencing other types of seizures since the onset of her illness. Overstimulation of the areas responsible for memory and emotion produce _bouts of euphoria_ , like when she shouted that everything was going to be okay; _feelings of confusion at familiar scenes_ , like the alien bathroom stalls; and _sensitivity to light_ , like the garish colors in Times Square. Some patients report an _out-of-body experience_ , like the one Susannah experienced while smoking on the street.
> 
> Seizures can have many causes, such as a tumor, sleep deprivation, and alcohol withdrawal. In Susannah’s case, they indicated a problem at the molecular level in her brain. Untreated, seizures can lead to cognitive defects or death.
> 
> Susannah would go on to have many more seizures, but her first seizure marked a division between a period of time she could remember and a month-long stretch of oblivion that she would not be able to recover without the aid of hospital records, her friends, family, doctors, and video recordings made in the hospital.
> 
> Her first seizure also separated the onset of the disease, when Susannah was still “herself” in spite of her increasingly uncharacteristic behavior, from full-blown mental illness, when Susannah’s personality, memory, and identity were completely subsumed by her neurological condition.

### The Seizures Take Over

Susannah awakes in the emergency room, Stephen by her side. When she sees a homeless man vomiting a few feet away and a bloody man handcuffed to a gurney, surrounded by police officers, she demands to be moved to another room. The doctor agrees, and she’s filled with a triumphant sense of power. En route to her new room, she inexplicably screams that she’s going to sue the MRI technician for flirting with her. **Looking back, Susannah views this as the moment when her personality begins to evaporate as she succumbs to the disease.**

A young resident discharges Susannah from the hospital. They’ve already done a CT scan, blood test, and basic neurological exam, and they can do nothing more for her. Stephen objects, but the resident tells him that sometimes seizures happen once and never return. Nevertheless, he tells Susannah to see a neurologist the next day.

Alerted to Susannah’s seizure by Stephen, Susannah’s mom and stepdad pick up Susannah the following morning to bring her to their home in New Jersey, where they can look after her. Susannah’s stepdad, Allen, has a schizophrenic brother. **As Susannah’s condition deteriorates, Allen’s familiarity with mental illness will prove to be a huge asset.**

Settling into her mom’s home in New Jersey, Susannah tries to work on an article about a troupe of disabled dancers, but she’s unable to write. Desperate to tell her mom and Allen about this new breakdown in her abilities, Susannah wanders to the family room, where she has another hallucination and goes into a trance. Her mom and Allen make an appointment with Dr. Bailey for the following day.

Many of Susannah’s friends and coworkers call to express their concern. Although Susannah would normally accept the calls, the only one she takes now comes from a colleague whose mother is a psychiatrist. **Based on Susannah’s symptoms, the psychiatrist has suggested that Susannah has bipolar disorder and is having a manic episode**. **Once again, Susannah is thrilled to get a diagnosis, however dire it is.** Many famous people, like Beethoven, Mark Twain, and Winston Churchill, suffered from bipolar disorder, so Susannah feels like she’s in good company.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> The National Institute of Mental Health describes bipolar disorder as a disease that causes unusual shifts in mood; often develops during the late teens or early adulthood; and generates overly joyful and hopeless states—all of which described Susannah.

Dr. Bailey does another basic neurological exam and once again concludes that Susannah is “normal.” He asks Susannah how much she drinks, and she tells him she usually has two glasses of wine a night, adding that she believes she has bipolar disorder. He says it’s a possibility and refers her to a psychiatrist. Before they leave the office, Dr. Bailey tells Susannah’s mom that Susannah is working and partying too hard and not sleeping enough. Like Susannah, her mom is filled with relief. That the diagnosis isn’t serious is exactly what she wants to hear. Only later will Susannah learn that Bailey missed many important details, like where she was when she had her first seizure.
