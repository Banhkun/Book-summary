## Part One: Onset of the Disease

### Preface

Everything’s dark. Susannah regains consciousness to find herself lying in a bed, bound to the bedrails by a straitjacket. “Help!” she shouts and shoves against the straps.

The “Purple Lady,” an attendant with a Jamaican accent, tells Susannah she’s in the hospital, then releases her from the straitjacket. Susannah’s hands fly to her head. It’s covered by rows of wires. Susannah lowers her hands and squints at an orange plastic band on her wrist. It says Flight Risk.

### Uncharacteristic Behavior

At the height of the New York City bedbug scare in 2009, Susannah finds two red dots on her arm. She’s convinced she has bedbugs and demands that an exterminator schedule a costly spray, even though he finds no evidence of infestation.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Obsession with bugs, called Ekbom syndrome, can signal the onset of psychosis. It’s frequently undiagnosed because people with the condition are more likely to consult exterminators than mental health providers.

Even though she thinks she might have bedbugs, Susannah goes to work the following day at the _New York_ _Post_. Ever since she started her reporting job as a seventeen-year-old intern seven years earlier, Susannah has loved every second of it—keyboards clacking, news junkies high on adrenaline, rows of cubicles marked with Manhattan street signs. She’s intimidated by Steve, who was made head editor of the Sunday edition though he’s only in his thirties, and she finds comfort in Paul, an old-time newspaperman with a tendency to swear.

Today is Tuesday, the day reporters pitch their ideas for the Sunday paper. It’s such an important ritual that reporters work feverishly to deliver the best pitches they can. Susannah usually goes to the meeting with at least three well-developed ideas, but when the meeting is called today, she realizes it’s completely slipped her mind.

When it’s her turn to speak at the pitch meeting, Susannah starts to ramble on about a story she saw on a blog, desperately hoping for some real ideas to come. Steve interrupts her, saying, “Don’t come in unprepared again.” Paul’s face blazes with rage. Susannah leaves the meeting, furious at herself and bewildered by her own behavior. How had she let that happen? Her colleague Angela tells her not to worry; she’s a pro and shouldn’t take the lapse seriously.

Still, Susannah continues to brood about her bad performance. At home, she prepares for the exterminator by throwing out hundreds of _Post_ clips she’d written over the past seven years. **Much like her obsession with bedbugs and her bad performance at work that day, throwing out her beloved clips runs contrary to Susannah’s nature.**

After hours of throwing things out, she feels a terrible dread in the pit of her stomach. Her mind is pierced by a white-hot flash like a migraine, though she’s never had one before. She stumbles to bed, convincing herself she’s gotten the flu from a man who sneezed on her in the subway.

#### Susannah’s Paranoia Increases

A few days later, Susannah wakes up contentedly, the pitch meeting, the bedbugs, and the migraine all forgotten. She’s alone in her boyfriend’s bed; Stephen’s a musician, and he’s already at rehearsal.

Susannah and Stephen have only been dating for a short time, but their relationship is trusting and comfortable. Suddenly Susannah is hit by another thought that’s completely out of character—an overwhelming compulsion to read his emails. Without thinking about what she’s doing, she opens his computer and combs through his correspondence, not stopping until she finds old messages from his ex.

She tiptoes to his dresser to find other potential signs of betrayal. Suddenly she freezes, overwhelmed by a paranoid sense that he’s watching her via hidden cameras. Although the unfamiliar feeling frightens her, she keeps digging through his things, flinging his clothes on the floor, until she finds a cardboard box full of pictures and letters from exes dating back to his teens.

She reads through the letters, cackling at grammatical errors. As she reaches for another picture, she catches sight of herself in the mirror. Clad only in her underwear, her hair wild, her boyfriend’s letters clutched between her thighs, she sees a stranger staring back at her. The image disgusts her. “I don’t act like this,” she thinks to herself. “What is wrong with me?”

She checks the time. Two hours have passed, not five minutes, as she had thought. She’s overcome by nausea and another migraine. Her left hand begins to tingle, then goes numb.

**The tingling lasts for days. Susannah, more worried by her uncharacteristic behavior than by telltale physical symptoms, ignores it until the numbness moves down to her toes.** At that point, Susannah contacts her doctor, Dr. Rothstein, who’s alarmed by her symptoms and refers her to Dr. Bailey, a famous neurologist, that afternoon.

### Ineffectual Diagnoses

Dr. Bailey is a grandfatherly man. His demeanor makes Susannah want to reassure him that everything’s fine. When she tells him she has a weird numbness in her hand and foot, he asks if she’s ever had Lyme disease, which she has not.

**Bailey conducts a routine neurological exam, testing her reflexes and muscle strength, seeing if her pupils constrict. He declares everything is normal,** though he says he wants to do some bloodwork and have her take an MRI.

Susannah is usually casual about her health. She even shrugged off an incidence of melanoma five years earlier when it was caught early and easily removed. Normally she would put off getting an MRI, but today something compels her to take it right away.

A 30-something lab technician leads Susannah to a private changing room and hands her a cotton gown. He waits outside as she disrobes, dons the gown, and drops her lucky ring—a graduation present from her stepfather, Allen—into a lockbox.

In the MRI room, the technician innocently props her up on the platform and tucks a blanket around her bare legs in preparation for the test. A half hour later, the test is done, but Susannah feels exposed in just the cotton gown. The technician grins at her and tries to make conversation, but Susannah doesn’t reply, thinking he’s flirting. She throws on her clothes in the changing room and rushes to the elevators to avoid another conversation with the technician.**** Over time, his innocent remarks would take on a malevolent cast created entirely by Susannah’s disease. At home, Susannah realizes she’s left her lucky ring in the lockbox at Bailey’s office.

Susannah obsesses over her lucky ring. She’s overcome with nausea at work the next day and has to be walked home by her coworker Angela.

Angela makes Susannah call her doctor. **Dr. Rothstein tells her the results of the MRI are normal, then suggests that Susannah has a virus, possibly mono.** **She’s relieved to finally have a diagnosis.**

Contrary to habit, Susannah takes three days off work, telling her mom she has mono. Her mom’s more worried about the numbness, which hasn’t abated. On her third day off work, Susannah’s dad comes to visit.

“What’s that smell?” he asks when she opens the door. They survey her apartment together. The dirty kitty litter. The overflowing trashcan. The floor covered with unwashed clothes. Black trashbags from the phony bedbug scare.“You can’t live like this,” he tells her.

Susannah returns to the office the next day, feeling ashamed about the state of her apartment and the poor quality of her work as of late. When she pitches two more stories and they’re both rejected, she blames her poor performance on mono and takes another day off. **She gets a call from Rothstein, who says her bloodwork has come back and she doesn’t have mono; it was probably a garden-variety virus.** Susannah is convinced she’s healthy and persuades Stephen to go skiing for the weekend.

On the slopes, Susannah panics. She begins to conjure up more and more outlandish scenarios—what if she can’t make it down the mountain? What if they leave her and can’t find her body later on?

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> This type of illness ebbs and flows, making the patient mistakenly believe it’s gone.

Back at work, Susannah is asked to interview TV newsman John Walsh. To prepare for the interview, she makes her way to the _Post_ ’s archives, where she’s greeted by the librarian—a Wiccan priestess outside of work. Rather than ask the librarian to bring her the articles she needs to prepare for the interview, Susannah asks her to read her tarot cards instead. Innately skeptical of witchcraft and religion, Susannah desperately wants something to believe in right now. **The Wiccan priestess tells Susannah that good things lie ahead, and Susannah is overcome with relief.**
