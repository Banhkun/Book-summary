## From Delusions to Psychosis

On Susannah’s second day in the hospital, a team of doctors and nurses arrives to conduct another neurological exam. Susannah interrupts the exam to tell one of her neurologists, Dr. Russo, that the people on the TV are saying bad things about her. She throws herself off the bed and pushes her way past the team toward the door. Russo later diagnoses Susannah as manic and psychotic, with two possible diagnoses: bipolar disorder or postictal psychosis, psychotic behavior generated by seizures.

Later that morning, Dr. Siegel arrives. **He’s a world-famous neurologist, and he assures Susannah’s mom that everything will be fine.** **Susannah’s mom clings to his words as if they’re a lifeline.**

The next day, Susannah is visited by a psychiatrist, Dr. Khan, who describes Susannah as “disheveled” and “fidgety,” noting that her pajamas are “revealing.” This visual description matches the psychological profile of mania.

While Khan takes notes, Susannah announces that she has multiple personality disorder. She repeats her belief that it’s not safe for her in the hospital and says that she can hear the nurses’ thoughts. Khan asks what else Susannah can hear, and Susannah says, “The people on the TV.” Khan concludes that the team should be looking for neurological causes for Susannah’s psychosis. If they can’t find a neurological cause, Khan suggests they consider a diagnosis of bipolar I, a mood disorder characterized by manic and depressive episodes.

Susannah stares at the doctor as she writes her notes. As she’s staring, she has a visual hallucination: The doctor ages right before her eyes. Susannah turns to Stephen, who’s also in the room, and sees him age too. “I can make people age with my mind,” Susannah thinks to herself. “I’m more powerful than I’ve ever been.”

Later that day, a fifth doctor joins Susannah’s team. Dr. Arslan is a psychopharmacologist, who suggests that Susannah might be suffering from “schizoaffective disorder,” a condition in which mood disorders overlap with thought disorders. He does not tell Susannah’s parents about his suggestion, believing the severity of the diagnosis would upset them.

The video recordings made by the cameras over Susannah’s bed reveal that at 11:06 that evening, Susannah is trying to conduct a phone call using the TV remote control. “Oh my God,” she suddenly cries out and hits the call button for the nurse. “I’m on the news. PUT THE TV BACK ON!”

“We’re investigating Susannah Cahalan. Her father recently murdered his wife,” Susannah hears the news reporter say.__ On the video recording, Susannah grabs the remote and speaks into it again. “Please get me a doctor,” she moans. “Please.” She hears the woman in the next bed talking on her cell phone: “There’s a _Post_ reporter in the bed next to me. I’m going to record her and we can sell it to the _Post_.” Then the woman whispers to Susannah, “I don’t trust the nurses here. They’re bad news.”

Susannah grabs the wires on her head and pulls them out along with chunks of hair. She leaps out of bed, sprinting past the security guard, racing into the arms of a nurse. The purple lady holds her down on the cold floor. “Let me go,” Susannah spits out, her teeth clenched. “Please.”

Susannah’s behavior prompts Dr. Russo to change her diagnosis from “seizures” to “psychosis.” Without telling Susannah’s parents, she recommends transferring Susannah to a psych ward if warranted.

**Susannah’s dad has noticed that she receives better care from the exasperated nurses when she has company,** so he starts visiting every day, arriving first thing in the morning**.** Susannah continues to believe her hallucination that her dad murdered his wife, so she won’t let him in the room. Instead, he takes up vigil in the hallway just outside her door.

Susannah’s mother starts to visit at least three times a day. She keeps detailed notes and a running list of questions for Susannah’s team of doctors. She and Susannah’s father develop a journal system to communicate with each other, as their nasty divorce still makes it difficult for them to speak face-to-face.

Stephen, too, has made a pact to stay by Susannah’s side as long as she needs him. He comes every day, bringing nature documentaries that relax Susannah without her knowing it.

Four more doctors join Susannah’s team. One of them takes her blood pressure and is instantly alarmed: It’s so high that it could cause bleeding in the brain, a stroke, or death.

### Trying to Stay Positive

Susannah has been moved to a new room in the epilepsy ward. It’s peaceful and quiet. Her dad is happy with the change, as well as a newfound warmth in Susannah’s attitude toward him. Heartened, he asks if she’d like to take a walk around the floor. His happiness vanishes when he sees that Susannah can only walk with difficulty. **In order to appear positive, he suggests a family motto.** “What’s the slope of the line?” he says, indicating an upward angle with his arm. “It’s positive,” he says when Susannah doesn’t answer. “What does that mean? It means we make progress every day.”

As Susannah continues to deteriorate physically, her psychosis seems to recede. She begins to spend most of her time staring off into space. On her fifth day in the hospital, the doctors seize on Susannah’s passivity to give her a spinal tap.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> In a spinal tap, doctors use a needle to withdraw fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The patient must remain completely still to avoid injury; movement can cause paralysis or death. Susannah’s psychotic states had made the necessary procedure too dangerous to attempt.

Susannah has been in the hospital for nearly a week. Stephen and her family continue their routine of staying in the hospital with her every day, hours on end, feeding her gourmet food, reading aloud to her, or playing cards, though she’s usually too confused to follow the game. **Her mother makes sure the best doctors visit regularly.** The staff allows Stephen to stay long past visiting hours because his presence calms Susannah and keeps her from escaping.

He plays a country music video for her in the hope that the music will bring her back, but in reality, her short-term memory has been destroyed— each time she watches the video, it’s like she’s seeing it for the first time.

Susannah looks forward to her walks around the floor, but by this time she’s lost key parts of her brain function, as well as a fair amount of motor control. When her cousin Hannah gives her a birthday present, Susannah can no longer tear off the wrapping paper, nor can she recognize the author’s name on the cover of the book, though it’s a writer she knows well. To Hannah, Susannah appears like she has Parkinson’s disease.

Susannah exhibits troubling new symptoms at the beginning of her second week in the hospital. She slurs her words and her tongue twists when she speaks, as if it’s too big for her mouth. She drools and her tongue hangs out. She can’t drink out of a normal cup and speaks in garbled sentences that degenerate into grunts. She’s also making continuous chewing motions and weird grimaces, while her arms keep stiffening out in front of her. Her team suspects that these symptoms, along with her elevated blood pressure and heart rate, indicate a problem in the brainstem or limbic system.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> The brainstem is one of the oldest and most primitive parts of the brain. It controls life-or-death functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.
> 
> Diagnosing which part of the brain is responsible for a certain behavior is difficult, as one behavior may be controlled by many different areas of the brain. If one area goes out, many connections are altered.

Dr. Siegel informs Susannah’s mom that Susannah’s spinal tap shows an elevated number of white blood cells. This is usually a sign of infection or inflammation and indicates that Susannah’s illness is physiological rather than emotional in nature. The news finally gives Susannah’s mom a clue she can wrap her head around. She spends the rest of the evening Googling medical terms like “meningitis” and “multiple sclerosis.”

Susannah receives her first visits from nonfamily friends. It’s difficult for her to carry on conversations, but the visits seem to make her happy. Somehow she’s able to pull herself together for her visitors even though they exhaust her so much that she’s unable to communicate for hours afterward.

**Work friends Julie and Angela leave the hospital after one of their visits wondering if Susannah will ever be the same again. Yet something of Susannah remains.** She can’t read anymore, but her dad gives her a notebook to record how she feels and what’s causing her difficulties. She even asks him to list the people who sent her flowers so she can thank them later.
