## Dr. Najjar

Susannah’s bloodwork and autoimmune tests come back negative. Her MRIs and CT scans are clean. Forced by this evidence to rule out most of the diagnoses they had in mind, **Susannah’s doctors begin to wonder whether they’ll actually be able to figure out what’s wrong with her.**

Dr. Siegel, the physician on whom Susannah’s mom has pinned her hopes, quits Susannah’s team. Susannah’s mom is devastated. She now believes that Dr. Russo is their only hope—until Russo brings up the name of a Dr. Souhel Najjar, the doctor to call when nothing makes sense. Both Russo and Najjar order a second spinal tap for Susannah.

Unbeknownst to Susannah’s family, Siegel asked Najjar to join Susannah’s team. Najjar has a track record of solving a number of mystery cases, and Siegel has confessed that he’s stumped by Susannah’s case. Based on Siegel’s expert summary, Najjar suggests that Susannah might have viral encephalitis. Without seeing her, he prescribes an antiviral drug and recommends testing Susanah for viral encephalitis, caused by a herpes virus. **Again, all the tests come back negative.**

Najjar next suggests that Susannah’s condition might be an autoimmune response. He immediately puts Susannah on IVIG treatment, a protocol he used successfully on another patient. On April 2, a nurse arrives to give Susannah the first of five IVIG infusions. Hallucinating that the nurse is responsible for her illness, Susannah punches her in the chest.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Under normal conditions, our immune system creates antibodies to combat infections from foreign invaders like viruses or bacteria. On rare occasions, the immune system manufactures antibodies that attack cells or tissues in a person’s own body. When this happens, the person develops an autoimmune disease like lupus, multiple sclerosis, or the type of brain inflammation that Susannah suffered from.
> 
> IVIG infusions contain healthy antibodies from thousands of blood donors. Each infusion costs more than $20,000.

Susannah receives her second course of IVIG treatments. By this time, she’s become catatonic. Her brain cells are misfiring, making it impossible for her to sense her body in space. She sits in awkward poses. Her speech has degraded even further.

**In spite of her wretched condition, the people who love her will not give up hope.**

“She’s still in there,” Stephen tells Susannah’s dad.

“That’s who we’re fighting for,” Susannah’s dad replies.

Yet the situation continues to go downhill. Susannah’s chewing motions, staring episodes, and zombie arm movements become more frequent, even as every test comes back negative. The IVIG injections aren’t working. Dr. Siegel is no longer on the case, and Dr. Najjar hasn’t even shown up. What will prevent the other doctors from giving up too? Susannah’s family secretly begins to wonder whether she really will make a recovery.

But then the results of Susannah’s second spinal tap come in. Her white blood cell count has gone from 20 to 80, indicating that her brain is probably inflamed. Dr. Russo changes the diagnosis from psychosis to inflammation from an unknown cause.

The doctors start looking for a source of infection in Susannah’s brain.

### Brain Biopsy

By this time, Susannah is constantly drooling and smacking her lips, even in her sleep. She stares straight ahead, as if sleeping with her eyes open, her tongue hanging out.

The mysterious Dr. Najjar finally shows up, to the excitement of Susannah’s family. Explaining that **in order to see the future, it’s necessary to look backward** , he asks Susannah’s parents for a full medical history. He particularly notes symptoms the other doctors hadn’t explored: her bedbug phobia, numbness and tingling in her hands, her faster heart rate. He addresses Susannah directly, as if he’s speaking with a friend rather than a patient.

His bedside manner is personal and heartfelt. When he was a boy, he did badly in school until one teacher recognized his potential. **As a result, he has committed himself to never giving up on anyone.**

Najjar begins a series of bedside tests. Susannah responds monosyllabically, with a significant lisp. Her reflexes are bad, her pupils don’t constrict properly, and she can’t touch her hand to her nose. She walks stiffly, with delays between steps, angling toward her left side. He concludes that she’s hellishly catatonic.

But then he has an idea: the clock test. Ripping a sheet of paper from his notebook, he hands it to Susannah and asks her to draw a clock. At first, Susannah can’t draw a circle and has to ask for another sheet of paper. She draws a circle and outlines it three times. Then Najjar asks her to fill in the numbers.

Susannah desperately tries to remember what a clock looks like. She begins writing the numbers down, getting stuck on one, drawing another several times. Finally, she gets them all filled in.

The sight of Susannah’s clock makes Najjar so ecstatic that he nearly applauds. Susannah’s parents stare at him in confusion: Susannah has squished all the numbers into the right side of the circle. The left side is completely blank. Najjar explains to them that Susannah’s test provides concrete evidence that the right side of her brain is inflamed.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> In the brain, the right hemisphere is responsible for the left field of vision, and the left hemisphere is responsible for the right field of vision. When the right hemisphere is impaired, the patient will not “see” on the left side.
> 
> This is not to say that the patient is blind on the left side. The left eye is still receiving visual information and sending it to the right hemisphere to process, but the right hemisphere can’t process it correctly. Doctors call this “visual indifference,” as if the right side of the brain just doesn’t care about the left side of the world.

**Dr. Najjar has a flash of insight: what if Susannah’s inflammation is the result of an autoimmune reaction? What if her own immune system is attacking her brain?** He recalls a paper written by a Dr. Dalmau at the University of Pennsylvania, describing four young women stricken by a rare autoimmune disease. Could Susannah have the same condition?

Dr. Najjar has other questions, too. How much inflammation is there? Can her brain be saved?

He knows he can only answer these questions by removing a tiny portion of her brain for study, but he doesn’t know if Susannah’s parents will agree to such a drastic procedure.

The longer Susannah goes without intervention, the smaller her chances of recovering. Recognizing the gravity of the moment, Najjar paces around the room before sitting on the bed next to Susannah.

“Her brain is on fire,” he announces to Susannah’s parents. Then he turns to her and says, “I will do everything I can for you.”

Susannah comes alive. She sits up and throws her arms around Dr. Najjar, tears gathering in the corner of her eyes. Sensing the real Susannah is still in there somewhere, he motions to her parents to follow him out of the room. In the hallway, he tells them that the best way to treat her is to do a brain biopsy. “I would do it if it were my child,” he gently cautions.

They’re overwhelmed by the news. Separately and together, they sob. They pray. Eventually, after much terrified soul-searching, they consent to the operation.

Two days before the surgery, the head nurse comes to Susannah’s room to describe what’s about to happen. Susannah listens calmly, but she and her dad break into tears that evening. **As they laugh and cry together, he brings up the family motto.** “What’s the slope of the line?” he asks. Susannah can’t remember. “Positive,” her dad urges. Susannah angles her arm upwards, as her dad had done the first time. “Getting better every day,” he smiles.

On Monday morning, Susannah is wheeled into surgery. She doesn’t react when a resident shaves her head. Interpreting this as a sign of strength, her dad kneels by the side of her bed, tears in his eyes, and asks once again, “What is the slope of the line?” This time she responds: “Positive.”

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Brain biopsies are relatively simple compared to other forms of brain surgery, but they involve dangerous risks, such as infection or mistakes.
> 
> Susannah’s biopsy involved a process called frameless stereotactic neurosurgery. It visually maps the brain in two and three dimensions, enabling the surgeon to accurately target a specific region of the brain—in Susannah’s case, the right frontal cortex.
> 
> First the surgeon made an incision in Susannah’s scalp. He parted the skin and used a high-speed drill to create a 1-centimeter hole in the skull. He then used a bigger drill to grind the bone into dust to remove a 3-centimeter piece of bone plate.
> 
> This exposed the protective layer of Susannah’s brain. The surgeon removed a section, then removed 1 cubic centimeter of brain tissue, including white and gray matter.
> 
> With the tissue removed, the surgeon stopped the blood flow, stitched a graft onto the brain’s outer layer, sutured it, and reattached the piece of bone plate with screws and a metal plate. He finished by replacing the outer layer of skin in its original position and closing the scalp with staples.
> 
> The surgery lasted four hours.

The biopsy confirms that Susannah’s brain is inflamed, seemingly under attack by her own immune system. She’s put on the highest possible dose of intravenous steroids, but her condition doesn’t improve right away. Her panic attacks increase, accompanied by grimacing, shaking, and zombie-like arm motions.

Dr. Najjar believes Susannah has autoimmune encephalitis. Dr. Russo thinks she has paraneoplastic syndrome, a condition associated with cancer: As the immune system attacks the cancer, it may also attack healthy tissue in the spine or brain, causing psychosis or catatonia.

They’re also investigating a third possibility. Drs. Russo and Najjar send Susannah’s cerebrospinal fluid to Dr. Dalmau, the neuro-oncologist who had conducted the study on four young women that Dr. Najjar remembered when he saw Susannah’s clock test. Like Susannah, the four women in Dalmau’s study had a high white blood cell count and suffered from hallucinations, confusion, and memory deficits. They also had two other things in common: an ovarian tumor and antibodies that disable a critical apparatus in the brain called the NMDA receptor. By the time Susannah is struck by the disease, Dr. Dalmau has developed two tests that allow for a swift and accurate diagnosis.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Everything we do, from lifting a glass to reading a book, results from a chemical signal triggering specific brain cells to fire or not. If a cell can’t receive a signal, it can’t initiate or inhibit behavior.
> 
> Cells receive signals through _receptors_. NMDA receptors excite cells that participate in learning, memory, higher functions, and personality. In 2007, Dr. Dalmau identified a new disease that would come to be called anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis. This condition is caused when antibodies disable NMDA receptors. Experiments indicate that a 40 percent loss of NMDA receptors results in psychosis. A 70 percent loss results in catatonia. An absence of any working NMDA receptors results in death.

While they’re waiting for the results of Dalmau’s tests, Susannah’s team decides to assess Susannah’s cognitive skills. They’ll use the assessment as a baseline for judging future progress.

The assessment reveals that Susannah has a language impairment caused by brain injury. She recognizes and remembers objects but cannot retrieve the words for them.**Because Susannah becomes frustrated at doing badly on the tests, the neuropsychologist concludes that Susannah knows she’s not functioning at her normal level.** The neuropsychologist recommends that Susannah be enrolled in cognitive therapy.
