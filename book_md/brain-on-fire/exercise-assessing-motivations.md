## Exercise: Assessing Motivations

People in medical distress are often happier to get a dire diagnosis than to not get one at all. For instance, Susannah is thrilled to hear that her problems stem from a bipolar disorder, a very serious psychiatric condition. She even rationalizes her relief by telling herself that many famous people have also suffered from this disorder. Now reflect on your own experiences waiting for answers in difficult situations.

Have you ever had to wait for difficult news? How did the waiting make you feel?

If you got bad news, did you embrace it, even though it was bad?

Looking back on your reaction, do you feel you responded appropriately?
