## Exercise: Reframing the Negative

Even though Susannah has gone through a terrible experience, she wouldn’t undo the past. Think about what she’s gained from her ordeal and how she changed a negative experience into a positive one.

* * *

How did Susannah reframe her own story to make it positive?

Do you think that Susannah’s work on behalf of patients with her disease helps her deal with her past?

Looking back on your own life, have you had a difficult experience that you wouldn’t give up? How has it changed your behavior?
