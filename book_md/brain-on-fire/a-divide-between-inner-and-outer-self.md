## A Divide Between Inner and Outer Self

Susannah makes significant progress over the next few months, but her pills make her sleepy and slow, and sometimes she refuses to take them. In her own mind, she’s uncertain about herself, but she always describes herself as nearly 100 percent back.

Experts are called in to assess her progress. Susannah dreads the assessment, as the experts may contradict her assertion that she’s fine. In fact, her fears turn out to be correct; **the assessments reveal a divide between Susannah’s internal world and the world around her.**

She presents as severely impaired on tests of concentration, basic cognitive functioning, and working memory, yet her performance on verbal functioning, abstract reasoning, and analytical thinking reveal a different story. On those tests, Susannah places in the high to superior percentile. Dr. Bertisch, the psychologist who administers the test, concludes that Susannah’s interior world does not match up with the way she presents externally.

Susannah herself is aware of this divide. Social situations are especially difficult because she’s aware of how strange she appears to the people around her. **Susannah often feels that her true self is trying to connect with the world outside but can’t break past her body.**

Dr. Bertisch suggests that Susannah attend group therapy, individual psychotherapy, and a young adult group. Unsure of herself, and unwilling to admit to the chasm between what she knows and what she’s able to convey, Susannah ignores Bertisch’s suggestions.

Susannah worries that she’s become boring. Her family tries to assure her it’s not true, but no one can shake Susannah’s belief that she’s now a dullard. For Susannah, this is the most difficult adjustment to make to her new self.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> When the brain’s frontal lobes are impaired, the patient may behave childishly, have dulled emotions, or be completely devoid of thoughts or feelings.
> 
> Susannah’s slowness was probably a result of the electrical impulses in her frontal lobes not firing or taking too long to get to their intended targets. At the height of her disease, her frontal lobe function was described as “close to zero.”
> 
> Susannah makes a big mistake in ignoring Bertisch’s suggestions. After injury or illness, the brain has a window of time for spontaneous healing. Discounting it reduces the opportunity for faster recovery.

### Search for the Self

Susannah’s old self finally reawakens when she’s in the hospital for another round of treatments. She begins reading again. She begins keeping a diary to understand what’s happened to her.

Susannah’s father encourages her to draw upon her memory to create a timeline of events. As she tries to remember, she can recall only numbness, sleepiness, and three seizures. **She remembers nothing from her time in the hospital.**

Alarmed by the depth of her memory loss, Susannah’s dad invents a new motto: “You must leave the past behind in order to move forward.”

Because Susannah doesn’t want to face the fact that she can’t live on her own, she focuses on her future instead, keeping to-do lists of people to thank, projects to start, articles to write. She begins studying for the Graduate Record Exam in case she decides to go to grad school.

As a result of her illness, Susannah has gained 50 pounds. She calls herself a “roasted pig” and obsesses about being fat. In fact, her worries about being fat are worries about who she will become: Will she remain as slow and unfunny as she is now, or will she regain the spark that defines her true nature?**** Part of her believes she’ll never again be the carefree, confident Susannah she was. **When people ask, “How are you?” Susannah recognizes that she no longer knows who “I” is.**

That is, until she receives a package in the mail. It’s her lucky ring, which she left in the doctor’s office before her first MRI: a metaphor wrapped up in a bow, reminding her that all is not lost.

### Regeneration

As time progresses, Susannah regains former functions and personality traits. When people ask her to explain her illness, she tells them only that her body attacked her brain. However, when Paul, her _Post_ editor, asks her to explain it, she decides to summarize her experiences. She sends Paul a one-paragraph email, ending with “I know what it’s like to go crazy.” It’s enough for Paul to assure her that her writing skills have returned.

Paul’s encouragement is all Susannah needs. She begins a program of research and becomes obsessed with understanding how a human body attacks itself.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Scientists currently have little understanding of what triggers anti-NMDA-receptor autoimmune encephalitis. In people with teratomas, the tumor may set off an autoimmune attack. In the absence of teratoma, causes may be environmental or genetic. Because there is so little understanding of what causes the disease, researchers focus on diagnosis and treatment rather than prevention.

Susannah maintains a regular correspondence with Paul, who actively encourages Susannah to return to work. They hit on a strategy: Susannah will casually stop by the _Post_ offices to say hello in mid-July.

On the appointed day, Susannah dresses up and takes a train into the city. However, as soon as she arrives at the _Post_ office building, the adrenaline that’s bolstered her confidence rushes out of her body. _It’s too soon_ , she thinks.

She texts Paul to meet her outside. He tries to banter with her, as in the old days, but Susannah can’t keep up. He struggles to maintain a careless facade, but they both know she can’t handle her duties. “Your desk is ready for you,” he says nevertheless. “Come on upstairs.” Looking at the ground, she admits she’s not ready to go back right now. They hug briefly, then Paul disappears inside the building, worried that the new Susannah is not the Susannah he once knew.

In spite of this disastrous meeting, two weeks later Susannah gets an assignment to write a piece for the _Post_ ’s entertainment section. She manically jumps into researching the story, phoning sources and compiling her notes, but when she sits down to write, she’s suddenly overwhelmed by writer’s block. She stares at the screen. Slowly, an hour later, the first words come, then others. Soon they’re coming like a fountain.

Susannah’s article runs in the _Post_ on July 28. **She’s published hundreds of pieces before, but none have meant more than this one. It signals her redemption. It shouts, “Susannah’s back!** ” She instantly drops her plans for going to grad school: Susannah’s returning to the _Post._

A week later, Susannah visits the office. Still overweight and anxious about her appearance, she feels uncomfortable. She becomes even more distressed when she realizes everyone sees her discomfort. Suddenly she feels like a lab rat, exposed, waiting to be dissected. She’s jolted by the thought that she might never again feel comfortable in the newsroom where she grew up.

A month later—seven months after her illness forced her to leave work—Susannah returns to her job at the _Post_ for good _._ Human Resources advises her to __ start off slowly, but she jumps in as if she never left. She tackles every article with fiery enthusiasm, however trivial the story. Unable to type as quickly as before, she records her interviews, her speech slow, plodding. Sometimes she slurs her words. Angela guides Susannah without making it appear she needs help. Paul discreetly edits her work, reeducating her in the basics of journalism. Susannah is convinced she’s back to normal, but in fact, she still has a long way to go before she returns to her former self.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Dr. Dalmau and other researchers are currently studying how patients recover from anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis. When Susannah returned to work, she was in an “imprecise” stage, during which the patient is normal according to family, friends, and physicians, but not according to the patient herself. It can take as long as two or three years, even longer, to easily perform tasks that had come naturally before.

One day Susannah gets her hair colored. She feels like a million bucks as she leaves the salon. As she saunters to the subway on her way back home, she bumps into an ex-boyfriend, but all she sees is pity in his eyes. The encounter knocks her off balance. She catches sight of herself in a window and is shocked by her image: frizzy hair, puffy face, chubby frame. **She hates herself for how she’s changed and despairs of ever ridding herself of the self-doubt she now endures.**

### Susannah the Patient Meets Susannah the Reporter

Susannah and two colleagues from work attend a lecture Dr. Najjar is giving on anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis. In the lecture, he uses Susannah as a case study. Though he never cites Susannah’s name, her colleagues recognize that the lecture is about Susannah.

That afternoon, the _Post_ ’s Sunday editor asks Susannah if she’d be willing to write a first-person account of her illness. It’s the assignment Susannah has been hoping for.

She has four days to write the story. She interviews Stephen, her family, and Drs. Najjar and Dalmau. She learns many things in the course of her research:

  * **Children make up 40 percent of those diagnosed with the disease.** Their symptoms include temper tantrums, violence, oversexuality, and mutism. They may start speaking in tongues or repeating other people’s words. Their behavior is frequently misdiagnosed as autism. Formerly, it was described as evil, and exorcism was prescribed as the cure.
  * **Many adults diagnosed with the disease were originally diagnosed with schizophrenia or autism.** A small number of doctors, including Dr. Najjar, are currently researching the link between schizophrenia, autism, and autoimmune disease. (Shortform note: In 2018, Dr. Najjar suggested the term “autoimmune psychosis” to designate a subset of diseases in which autoimmune disorders masquerade as psychosis. See Najjar’s recent research published in the _Journal of Neuroinflammation_.) 
  * **It’s cost-prohibitive to test all psychiatric patients for an autoimmune disease.** Susannah was lucky; she had a financial safety net that allowed for expensive testing. Many people with lifelong psychiatric conditions don’t have that kind of safety net and may remain incorrectly diagnosed their entire lives. 
  * **Many doctors don’t keep abreast of current medical research.** While writing her article, Susannah reached out to Dr. Bailey, the neurologist who had declared Susannah an alcoholic. She was shocked to find that he had never heard of anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis, even though her case had recently been covered in every major medical journal, the _New England Journal of Medicine_ , and the _New York Times._



To illustrate Susannah’s article, the photo editor wants to run images from the EEG videos taken during Susannah’s hospital stay. When Susannah sees herself onscreen, she shudders. There she is on camera, staring into the lens, her hair dirty, her hospital gown slipping off her shoulder. Her eyes blaze with manic fear, as if she’s staring into the face of death. She mouths a single word: “Please.”

Susannah is frightened by seeing herself so unhinged. What frightens her more, though, is the fact that emotions that once wracked her so completely have vanished entirely. **The Susannah in the EEG video is a foreign entity to the Susannah writing about her own illness.**

On October 4, Susannah’s article runs in the _Post_. She receives hundreds of emails from people who have the disease and want to know more about it. She even receives phone calls from people who want a diagnosis from Susannah herself. Acknowledging how lucky she is to have recovered, Susannah is overwhelmed by survivor’s guilt. One man, whose wife is ill, calls Susannah and aggressively challenges, “Why did you get better while my wife’s still sick? Are you so sure you won’t get sick again?” Two weeks later, he calls back to tell Susannah that his wife is dead.

Yet Susannah receives other types of phone calls. One comes from Bill Gavigan, whose daughter fell ill and was routinely misdiagnosed for more than a year. The girl was saved only because Bill’s sister sent him a video of Susannah talking about the disease on the _Today_ show, along with Susannah’s article in the _Post_. Bill gave the video and the article to his daughter’s neurologist, who immediately agreed to test Bill’s daughter for anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis. The girl was diagnosed and treated by Dr. Dalmau’s colleagues. She made a complete recovery. On the phone, Bill tells Susannah, “Without you, our daughter would be dead.”

Susannah’s article is translated into Arabic and published in multiple papers throughout the Middle East. Syria’s news agency publishes numerous stories of the Syrian boy who’d become a miracle doctor in the US. The Syrian ambassador to the UN congratulates Najjar personally. That same year, Najjar is designated one of the best neurologists in the US by _New York Magazine_.

Susannah returns to the _Post_ full-time. She and Stephen move in together. In a few months, she feels comfortable in her own skin again. There’s no longer a gap between what she feels inside and how other people see her. She doesn’t struggle for words anymore. She feels in control. Most importantly, she’s regained her old sense of humor.
