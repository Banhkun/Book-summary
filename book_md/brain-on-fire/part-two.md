## Part Two: Susannah’s Month of Oblivion

Susannah is admitted to NYU Langone’s Advanced Monitoring Unit (AMU), for patients with severe epilepsy. It has been ten days since her first seizure.

At the AMU, patients are monitored 24 hours a day via electrodes implanted in their brains and two cameras over each bed—physical and electrical evidence of seizure activity. The hospital discards most of the footage, keeping only seizures and abnormal events. These recordings will be crucial to Susannah’s reconstruction of her illness once it has passed.

During her first few hours on the floor, Susannah is fitted with electrodes and given a little pink backpack holding her own EEG monitor. Allen arrives, and Susannah screams at the nurses to get him out of her room. She does the same when her father arrives, telling a neurologist that he’s playing tricks on her and is not her father but an imposter.

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Patients with “Capgras syndrome” suffer from delusions that family members are imposters. The syndrome was originally thought to be an indication of schizophrenia. Doctors now believe it can be caused by neurobiological damage, as well as other conditions.

That evening, a neurologist comes to Susannah’s room to conduct a health history. Susannah accurately conveys information about her health but also tells the neurologist that her dad is changing into different people to play tricks on her. “Unclear if hallucinating,” the neurologist diagnoses. Later that night, Susannah is convinced that someone is watching her in the bathroom. She calls her mom, telling her that the nurses are trying to hurt her.

When a nurse enters the room to tell Susannah not to use the phone, Susannah has another hallucination—she “hears” the nurse saying, without moving her lips, “I see you on the news.”

**Later that night, Susannah makes her first escape attempt.** A group of nurses catch her as she dashes from her room. They return her, kicking and screaming, to her bed.
