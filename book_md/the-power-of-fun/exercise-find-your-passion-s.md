## Exercise: Find Your Passion(s)

After making more space for fun in your life, Price recommends filling the new space with something you’re passionate about.

* * *

If you can already identify a passion, describe it below. If you aren’t sure what your passions are, describe something you’ve always wanted to learn about or try but have never had the chance.

What's one thing you can do this week that empowers you to engage with your passion? (For example, you might sign up for a class, invite a friend to practice your passion with you, or talk about what you’re excited about with a close friend or family member.)

What's a potential barrier you anticipate to practicing your passion? Describe the barrier below and one idea about how to overcome it.
