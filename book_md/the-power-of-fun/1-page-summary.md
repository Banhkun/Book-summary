## 1-Page Summary

When’s the last time you did something fun? For many of us, as we get older, fun starts to take a backseat to the neverending list of adult responsibilities. But what if it didn't have to be that way? In _The Power of Fun_ , Catherine Price uses research and personal anecdotes to explain why fun is fundamental to living a happy and healthy life and how everyone can start having more fun.

Price is an award-winning science writer, speaker, and consultant. She's the author of several books including _Vitamania_ and _How to Break Up With Your Phone_. She's also the founder of ScreenLifeBalance.com, a resource hub dedicated to helping people create more intentional relationships with technology and reconnect with what really matters to them. Her journalistic work has appeared in publications including _The Best American Science Writing_ , _The New York Times_ , and _O: The Oprah Magazine_.

In this guide, we’ll start by defining fun and why it matters before explaining how modern society has made it harder to prioritize fun. We’ll then outline Price’s step-by-step guide to invite more fun into your life. We’ll elaborate on Price’s research with insight from other writers and experts in the psychology of well-being, including Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of _Flow_ , and Stuart Brown, author of _Play, _and Gretchen Rubin, author of _The Happiness Project_.__

### What Is True Fun and Why Does It Matter?

According to Price, the word fun has been used to describe so many different types of experiences that it has begun to lose some of its meaning. We use fun to describe anything from getting a massage to going skydiving. She explains that many of us also mistake activities like binge-watching a show or scrolling on social media for fun when these activities are little more than distraction or passive entertainment that rarely leaves us feeling better than before.

Price focuses on what she calls True Fun, the kind of fun that leaves you feeling energized and inspired. She argues that True Fun isn't only the most enjoyable kind of fun, but it’s also good for your physical and emotional well-being. Price defines **True Fun as the intersection of playfulness, connection, and flow.** We’ll discuss each component in turn.

(Shortform note: As Price acknowledges, there's limited research on the nature of fun. Price’s definition of True Fun, for example, is based solely on personal experience and what she extrapolated from the reported experiences of 1,500 volunteers. However, the limited research that exists seems to align with Price’s conclusion that playfulness (or pleasure without purpose), connection, and flow are key elements of what makes experiences enjoyable.)

#### Playfulness

Price defines playfulness as a liberating attitude of curiosity, openness, and willingness to experiment. Playfulness is about doing something just for the sake of doing it, not because it is “productive” or has a higher purpose. Playfulness is less about any specific activity than the attitude you bring to what you’re doing.

> **What’s Your Play Personality?**
> 
> According to Stuart Brown, the founder of the National Institute for Play, the type of play or activity _does_ make a difference. Brown suggests that as they grow up, people tend to gravitate toward certain types of play over others.
> 
> Based on thousands of interviews and observations, Brown identified eight types of play that correlate with eight “play personalities”:
> 
>   * The **Collector** enjoys having and holding collections of objects or experiences.
> 
>   * The **Competitor** accesses the euphoria and creativity of play by participating in a competitive game with specific rules.
> 
>   * The **Creator/Artist** finds joy in making things, whether it be painting, woodworking, or even decorating a room.
> 
>   * The **Director** enjoys planning and executing scenes and events and is a born organizer.
> 
>   * The **Explorer** prefers to explore the world physically, emotionally, or mentally.
> 
>   * The **Joker's** play always revolves around some kind of foolishness.
> 
>   * The **Kinesthete** likes to move and may engage in sports or other physical activities to access the joy and openness of play.
> 
>   * The **Storyteller** finds imagination to be the key to the joys of play and may engage in activities like reading, writing, or performing to create an imaginative world.
> 
> 

> 
> Brown explains that people often see themselves in multiple play personalities but that only one tends to be dominant. Identifying your dominant play personality can be helpful as you try to identify activities that naturally excite and vitalize you.

Citing the work of Stuart Brown, psychiatrist and founder of the National Institute for Play, Price explains that engaging in play can allow people to get back in touch with their most authentic selves. Studies have also shown that play enhances creativity, improves memory, and decreases stress, in addition to facilitating deeper relationships with other people.

(Shortform note: According to Brown’s research, play not only improves people’s physical and emotional well-being but is also fundamental to healthy human development. His research shows a link between a lack of childhood play (or play deprivation) and a future propensity to violence and other antisocial behaviors. Brown argues that healthy play is a means of developing important social-emotional skills and preventing potentially violent antisocial behavior.)

#### Connection

Price defines connection as a sense of belonging and intimacy that arises from feeling understood and valued. Price explains that this connection can take many forms, from deep conversations with friends to spending time in nature or playing with a beloved pet. While we can be connected to places and things, Price notes that most instances of True Fun involve connecting with other people.

(Shortform note: Research supports Price’s claim that human connection heightens the experience of fun. One study found that fun is more enjoyable when you experience it with others, especially with friends. People who had fun with a friend reported feeling more energized and excited than people who had fun alone or people who had fun with strangers.)

Research suggests that human connection is central to our physical and emotional well-being. While loneliness has been linked to a variety of health issues (for example, high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, and dementia), studies have shown that strong social relationships are a better indicator of long-term health outcomes than almost any other indicator, including income, IQ, social class, or genetics.

(Shortform note: Social connection has such a strong impact on health outcomes that it is sometimes prescribed to patients. The practice, known as social prescribing, has become more systematic in the UK's healthcare system and is part of a larger shift in medicine toward a more holistic approach that recognizes the intersecting variables that can impact a patient’s health and well-being.)

#### Flow

The third component of True Fun is flow. Price defines flow as a state of complete absorption in an activity, where a person is fully immersed in the present moment and loses track of time. She explains that flow is characterized by effortless concentration and a feeling of being in control, despite the challenge of the activity. Flow can be experienced in a variety of activities: playing music, engaging in a sport or physical activity, or even in everyday tasks like cooking or gardening.

(Shortform note: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of the seminal book _Flow_ , describes a flow state as an optimal experience in which people are working voluntarily to achieve something important. He emphasizes that a key characteristic of flow is working toward a clear goal. However, Price argues that True Fun (the intersection of playfulness, connection, and flow) is often characterized by a lack of higher purpose. So while Price draws extensively on Csikszentmihalyi’s work, her discussion of flow doesn't directly correspond with his.)

Price argues that opportunities for flow are crucial for a long and fulfilling life. She equates flow with the Japanese concept of ikigai, which roughly translates to “a reason for being.” Price points to the research of Héctor García and Francesc Miralles, authors of _Ikigai_ , who studied the residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa. The authors contend that Okinawa residents live especially long lives because they practice ikigai every day by engaging in meaningful and joyful activities—in other words, by engaging in flow.

(Shortform note: Price correctly identifies that both ikigai and flow are characterized by focused engagement and present-mindedness, but they aren't direct equivalents. Ikigai tends to be a broader, more holistic concept that encompasses all aspects of life, while flow is more specific to a particular activity or task. Ikigai is a way of life, while flow is more often experienced within a defined time period.)

According to Price, the convergence of the three variables of playfulness, connection, and flow often leads to experiences of True Fun, which will vary from person to person. For example, for different people, playing rugby, birdwatching, or online poker might each meet the requirements for True Fun. Price concludes that if each of these three separate components of True Fun have so many benefits, then the combination of all three must be even more potent.

(Shortform note: Price’s conclusion that the individual benefits of all three variables means that there are greater benefits of the three in combination fails to account for potential interaction effects. Interaction effect refers to the way in which the effect of one variable on an outcome depends on the level or value of another variable. In other words, the relationship between two variables isn't simply additive but can depend on the values of other variables. It is important to consider interaction effects in scientific research to better understand the complexity of relationships between variables and to avoid misinterpretation of results or overgeneralization in findings.)

### Why Are We Having Less Fun?

Price argues that despite research that seems to demonstrate the positive impact fun has on our lives, **people today spend less time having fun than previous generations**. She explains that our changing relationships to time and technology inhibit our opportunities for play, connection, and flow that are necessary to experience True Fun.

(Shortform note: It’s difficult to measure and compare the subjective experience of fun across generations. However, numerous studies have shown that gen Z adults and millennials report higher levels of stress than their parents’ and grandparents’ generations. While this doesn’t directly support Price’s claim that people today have less fun than older generations, it does reveal generational differences in self-reported well-being that may in part be affected by how people spend their leisure time.)

#### Our Changing Relationship to Time

Citing the work of Celeste Headlee, author of _Do Nothing,_ Price explains how the rise of industrialization meant workers began being paid by the hour instead of for completed tasks, establishing an incentive to work as many hours as possible to make as much money as possible. Suddenly, time was equivalent to money, leading to the assumption that time not spent making money (including time spent having fun) is time wasted.

(Shortform note: Headlee suggests that our changing relationships to time, which she describes as “hustle culture,” is largely to blame for increasing rates of burnout that were exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a survey conducted by Indeed in 2021, over half (52%) of survey respondents experienced burnout in 2021, up from the 43% who said the same in Indeed’s pre-Covid-19 survey.)

The changing attitude toward time was coupled with the rise of consumer culture. The Industrial Revolution resulted in an increase in the mass production of goods, which companies then needed to sell to make a profit. To sell the oversupply of goods, companies needed to create demand, which they did by building marketing campaigns that convinced people that owning more stuff would make their lives better.

(Shortform note: While the mass production of goods and the drive to increase profits contributed to a growing consumer culture, it was not the sole cause. Before the Industrial Revolution, there was a big divide between the rich and the poor, but the growth of new businesses and factories during the Industrial Revolution created thousands of new jobs, allowing the middle class to grow. This middle class had more money to buy nicer homes and better educations, and they also had disposable income to buy things they didn't necessarily need. The introduction of more sophisticated marketing tactics in the 1950s and the outsourcing of labor and manufacturing to countries with lower wages further contributed to the growth of consumption.)

The result was that people spent more time working in order to be able to buy more things that were marketed as a means to improve life, leaving them less time to pursue opportunities for playfulness, connection, and flow.

(Shortform note: While the Industrial Revolution changed how we think about time and work, a Library of Congress article argues it increased rather than decreased leisure time for the average person. Employers reduced working hours and introduced half-day Saturdays, giving workers more free time. Vacations, though usually unpaid, also became more common. The desire for leisure was fueled by the monotony of industrial work and urban crowding. Additionally, the installation of electric lighting also made nighttime leisure activities safer. As a result, people increasingly attended various leisure activities both within and outside cities, and new forms of entertainment emerged and spread across the country.)

#### Our Changing Relationship to Technology

Our increasing dependence on technology, and specifically smartphones, has further weakened the role of fun in our lives, primarily by replacing True Fun with lesser forms of fun, like distraction and passive entertainment. Price argues that smartphones are the number one source of this kind of bogus fun because they're designed to be addictive, relying on novelty, rewards, and a lack of predictability to hold our attention. While Price acknowledges that our phones can provide a temporary escape from stress or boredom, she argues that they ultimately fail to contribute to our overall happiness and well-being.

(Shortform note: Studies suggest that people diagnosed with ADHD are especially susceptible to the negative impact of smartphone use. For example, one study of South Korean adolescents found ADHD to be a significant risk factor for developing smartphone addiction. This addiction is associated with other mental disorders as well: The same study found that adolescents identified as having a smartphone addiction were more likely to display symptoms of depression and anxiety.)

According to Price, **the ubiquity of smartphones also limits our capacity for playfulness, connection, and flow**. Phones contribute to our sense of busyness and stress, which makes it difficult to relax and engage in spontaneous, unstructured play. Our overreliance on technology for entertainment has also limited our ability to be imaginative and creative. In addition, phones, despite the illusion of connectedness they provide, isolate us by making us less likely to initiate conversations with strangers or put effort into quality in-person interactions. Worst of all, phones are a constant source of distraction, which prevents us from ever entering a flow state.

(Shortform note: The impact of smartphones on our lives is particularly stark for the generation known as iGen, people born between 1995 and 2012. This generation has always had access to the internet and was likely on social media before they were in middle school. Psychologists who study generational differences have noted that while this generation is safer than previous ones in some ways (for example, less likely to get in a car accident or have unprotected sex), they have unprecedented rates of teen depression and suicide.)

### How Can You Have More Fun?

Having explained the power of True Fun and why it has become harder to find it, we’ll now give Price’s tips to start incorporating more fun into your life.

#### Start With a Self-Assessment

Before making any major changes, Price suggests taking time to do a self-assessment (or “fun audit”) of your current relationship to fun to better understand what True Fun means for you.

(Shortform note: Self-assessment is a powerful tool to use before making any kind of life change, whether it be a career shift or implementing a new habit. Self-assessment allows you to make sure the change is right for you, identify potential challenges, and develop a plan, all of which will ultimately increase your chances of success.)

**Step 1:** **Identify what fun feels like**. Many of us are acutely aware of what stress and worry feel like. We spend less time thinking about what fun feels like. Ask yourself how you know you’re having fun. What does it feel like emotionally? Physically? True Fun is often associated with feelings of freedom, release, and excitement, but these feelings may vary in intensity and duration. Retraining yourself to focus on fun will allow you to notice experiences of True Fun, however small or brief.

(Shortform note: Identifying what fun feels like means being more mindful of your experiences. According to mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is the practice of noticing the present moment and observing it without judgment. Practicing mindfulness will help you increase awareness of your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations, making you more likely to notice the things that you have fun doing, and more likely to remember the experience afterward.)

**Step 2:** **Establish your baseline for fun**. Consider how often you have fun. What activities or people do you have fun with? When was the last time you had fun? Is there anything fun you’re looking forward to this week? Do you feel like you’re having enough fun? (Price argues that if you don’t identify fun as a priority and set aside time every week specifically for fun, you’re likely not having enough fun.)

(Shortform note: Baseline data is used in numerous fields, from education to public health to product management. Establishing a baseline is important because it provides you a point of reference or comparison. Without establishing this baseline, you won’t know whether your attempts to integrate more fun in your life are successful.)

**Step 3:** **Reflect on past experiences**. Think about three experiences in which you experienced a combination of playfulness, connection, and flow. As you're reflecting on your experiences, take time to notice any common themes in your experiences. For example, does fun tend to occur with the same people or in the same places? Does it include small groups or one-on-one experiences? These themes are valuable information as you start to consider how to introduce more fun into your life.

(Shortform note: Your memories of your past experiences may not be as accurate as you think. Daniel Pink, author of _When_ , explains that endings disproportionately shape the memory of an experience. For example, an experience that’s overwhelmingly positive but ends badly is more likely to be remembered negatively than a mediocre experience that ends on a high note. Knowing this can help ensure that when you reflect back on your experiences of fun, you think about them holistically, without putting too much weight on the ending.)

**Step 4:** **Document fun when you have it**. Moving forward, start to keep track of things that you do that are examples of playfulness, connection, and/or flow, in addition to any activities you did “for fun.” You may start to notice a disconnect between what you think of as fun and unexpected moments of playfulness, connection, and flow in your day. Circle any activity that involves all three variables, as this is likely a recipe for True Fun.

(Shortform note: Price’s fun journal is based on the “Good Time Journal” outlined by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans in _Designing Your Life_. The Good Time Journal is meant to help you track what activities in your life motivate you (and demotivate you). Like Price, the authors recommend that for each activity, you pay particular attention to who you were with, where you were, and what you were doing. There are online journal templates and an app-based version of the Good Time Journal that could be used for Price’s recommended journaling activity.)

#### Create the Conditions for True Fun

With a better understanding of what True Fun means for you, you can start prioritizing it in your life. Price explains that you don’t just start having more fun because you’ve decided to: You also need to create the conditions that are conducive to fun. To attract more fun into your life, Price recommends following these five steps: Make time, find your passions, invite fun, push boundaries, and stay committed.

##### Make Time

If you're going to prioritize fun, you need to make space for it to happen. The first step in making time is to **give yourself permission to have fun**. Many of us have been socialized to think of fun as self-indulgent or unproductive; we are convinced that our time would be better spent on more serious (often work-related) pursuits. But Price reiterates that fun isn't at odds with being a hard worker or making the world a better place. In fact, she adds, fun might actually support you to do these things better by helping you feel more energized, inspired, and creative.

(Shortform note: Price’s argument for the value of fun is supported by a 2020 study that found the key to a happy and fulfilling life is a balance of “hedonistic pursuits'' and a healthy work ethic. While self-control is crucial for aligning with long-term goals, the study emphasizes the need to pay equal attention to hedonism, or the ability to experience pleasure without guilt or shame. However, for many people, the guilt that comes with self-indulgence prevents them from reaping the benefits of these experiences.)

After you give yourself permission to have fun, think about how you can **free up time in your day for fun**. This might mean focusing on your high-impact tasks at work, saying no to obligations that aren’t necessary or fun, and setting boundaries with your phone and other devices. When you don’t fill your day with busy work, unnecessary obligations, or screens, you might be surprised at how much time you get back.

(Shortform note: In _168 Hours_ , Laura Vanderkam argues that there's enough time every week for you to work, spend time with family and friends, _and_ have fun. The trick is to manage your time intentionally. To begin better managing your time (and free up time for fun), Vanderkam recommends documenting how you spend your time each week and then reviewing your time record to better understand if you're using your time in ways that align with your priorities.)

You might need some help making time for fun. If you're a parent or in a relationship, **ask your family for support**. Have a conversation with your partner about how you're sharing the burden of the mental and emotional labor of your household. Then carve out space for each of you to have independent fun every week. This will create a virtuous cycle of goodwill that you'll both continue to benefit from.

(Shortform note: If you want to talk about fun with your partner, invite them on a date. The authors of _Eight Dates_ write that it’s crucial to talk about fun and playfulness with your partner because having fun with your partner builds trust and intimacy and strengthens your relationship. The authors recommend talking about past fun experiences you’ve had (alone or with your partner), your bucket list, and ideas of how to have more fun as a couple.)

##### Find Your Passions

Price recommends you **use your reclaimed time to pursue your passions** , which she defines as activities or hobbies that focus your attention and leave you feeling invigorated. Not everything you love to do is a passion. For example, you may love taking baths, but this is an activity that relaxes you, not one that inspires you; therefore it doesn't qualify as a passion.

(Shortform note: While pursuing your passions is an excellent use of free time, you shouldn’t feel any pressure to use your leisure time productively. According to some research, many people feel pressure to maximize their leisure time by choosing the most fulfilling and enjoyable activity, which can lead to unnecessary stress. Alternatively, the pressure to maximize leisure time can lead to a performative approach where individuals prioritize external validation, societal expectations, and the appearance of a perfect leisure lifestyle over their own authentic preferences and enjoyment. Ultimately, your passion won’t be fun if the pursuit of it isn’t intrinsically motivated.)

Price explains that our passions are often a great jumping-off point for True Fun because they lend themselves to opportunities for playfulness, connection, and flow. Passions are playful because they're voluntary and pursued for their own sake. They also often lead you to meet new people and make new connections, and they facilitate building skills and knowledge that allow you to experience flow.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Project_ , Gretchen Rubin makes an important distinction between fun and passion. She explains that fun (and leisure) activities are activities you enjoy, while your passion is something you want to get better at. Unlike Price, Rubin recommends jumping into your passion by setting an ambitious goal. For example, if you’re passionate about playing music, you might commit to recording 10 songs by the end of the month. She argues that setting an ambitious goal will help you prioritize your passion, boost your confidence, and bring a new perspective to your life.)

If you've lost touch with what you’re passionate about, Price offers some guiding questions to help you get started:

  * What are you interested in learning?
  * What’s something you used to love but stopped doing?
  * What’s something you’ve always wanted to try but never felt like you could?
  * What’s something you do that lights you up?



Price recommends you brainstorm as many ideas as possible and then choose something (anything) to try. Even if it’s not the right fit, you’ll have learned something about yourself in the process.

(Shortform note: Rubin also suggests approaching a current hobby from a new angle. For example, if you paint, experiment with new materials or surfaces, or, if you’re a musician, try learning a different genre of music.)

Price cautions that many people avoid pursuing their passions because they're afraid of looking stupid or being bad at something. She says that if you're trying something new, you probably _will_ be bad at it, but she offers the reassurance that if you stick with it through the awkward beginner phase, you may discover a new passion (and a potential source of True Fun).

(Shortform note: As Price says, trying something new likely means you’ll be bad at it for a while. As such, being a beginner requires you to have an open attitude, ask questions, and be OK making mistakes. That’s why Tom Vanderbilt, author of _Beginners_ , argues that the willingness to be a beginner is a sign of courage, creativity, openness, and humility—something to be embraced rather than avoided.)

##### Invite Fun

You'll also inevitably have more fun if you **become someone who attracts fun to you**. For many of us, when someone describes “a fun person,” they picture a person standing on a table in the middle of a party convincing everyone to play charades. But what if charades isn’t your cup of tea? According to Price, not a problem. Price explains that you don’t have to be “the life of the party,” or even an extrovert, to be considered fun. When asked to describe someone fun, people describe a person who makes them feel included, laughs easily, and isn’t afraid to try new things or be silly. These are qualities that you can have regardless of where you fall on the introverted/extroverted spectrum.

(Shortform note: Many people think personality is fixed (for example, you’re either fun or you’re not), but, according to Benjamin Hardy, author of _Personality Isn’t Permanent,_ that’s a myth. Hardy explains that personality is fluid and malleable. To change your personality, he says, you must first decide who you want to be and then choose a single goal to work toward. For example, if you want to become a more fun person, your primary goal could be to try one new thing every week. These incremental steps will lead to long-lasting changes in who you are.)

Price identifies two ways you can become more fun: You can adopt a fun attitude, and you can create a fun environment.

To adopt a fun attitude, you need to practice noticing or seeking out opportunities for fun, however small. The ability to laugh at yourself, to look for the absurd in the ordinary, to smile more, to be present, and to notice unexpected and delightful moments of pleasure are all examples of ways to hone your fun radar.

(Shortform note: Rubin (_The Happiness Project_) points out that adopting a more fun-loving and positive attitude won't just improve your mood but also the moods of the people around you. She explains that your laughter, in particular, goes a long way to making other people happy, which will in turn amplify your happiness, creating a virtuous cycle of joy.)

You can also facilitate environments that are conducive to fun (what Price refers to as “playgrounds”). Fun environments are spaces where there's an understanding that the space is meant to be fun, where everyone is 100% in, and where judgment isn't welcome. Your fun environment might be a dinner club with friends, a virtual Dungeons & Dragons tournament, or an adult kickball league. The activity doesn’t matter, as long as the space invites people to let go and be themselves.

> **How to Create a Memorable (and Fun) Experience**
> 
> Even when you intentionally gather people together to have fun, the experience doesn’t always live up to expectations. In _The Art of Gathering_ , Priya Parker outlines five steps you can take before an event to ensure the experience is fun and meaningful for everyone. 
> 
>   * Identify the reason for gathering and use it as a guideline for decision-making.
> 
>   * Curate your guest list to include only those who support the purpose of the gathering.
> 
>   * Select an appropriate venue that enhances the guest experience and encourages desired behavior.
> 
>   * Create directives or rules for behavior during the event to make diverse gatherings more comfortable and encourage engagement.
> 
>   * Set clear expectations with guests before the gathering to help them get into the right mood and prevent disappointment.
> 
> 

> 
> By putting in the work ahead of time to build an environment with the right crowd and clear expectations, you're more likely to have fun during the experience itself.

##### Push Boundaries

In her research, Price noticed an unexpected theme in many people’s experiences of True Fun. She found that **fun often goes hand-in-hand with breaking rules** , however harmless. She explains that play is often about behaving outside the norms of expected behavior or social structure, which often means engaging in small acts of rebellion.

(Shortform note: For most people, breaking rules is easier said than done. Psychological research suggests that people have an innate tendency to conform. Studies show that conformity is hardwired in the structure of the brain. For example, brain-based punishment warning systems are activated when we violate social norms, and individuals with damage in the prefrontal areas of the brain show an inability to behave in accordance with social norms even when they comprehend them. So while we often admire people who are able to think or act outside the norm, our own instincts are often to stick to the norm.)

But, as Price explains, to push boundaries, you need something to push against. She offers a few suggestions of opportunities to push back and suggests finding mini acts of resistance that fit your personality.

You can push back against established patterns (what Price calls “habits and routines”). Many of us operate under a predictable schedule. You can rebel against this predictability by breaking with your normal pattern and introducing some novelty into your day. This can be as simple as changing up your regular takeout spot or taking a walk after dinner instead of turning on a TV show.

(Shortform note: Some argue that the key to happiness is finding a balance between novelty and routine. According to Arthur Brooks, host of the How to Build a Happy Life podcast, "neophilia"—the tendency to seek out new experiences—stimulates interest and curiosity, which promote overall well-being. However, neophilia can also lead to restless or impulsive behavior. To find a healthy balance, he suggests regularly challenging and experimenting with preferences, choosing curiosity over comfort, avoiding newness for its own sake, and making deliberate decisions rather than acting impulsively.)

Similarly, you can push back against traditions. Traditions are a powerful tool of connection, but only when you get to choose them. Changing traditions that you don’t like or that are no longer fun is a prime opportunity for rebellion.

(Shortform note: In _Eight Dates_ , the authors suggest that starting new traditions also builds stability and intimacy in your relationships. If you’re feeling stuck in the traditions you grew up with, explore this list of 27 ideas for new family traditions, which includes ideas like family game nights or watching the sunrise together on the first day of summer.)

##### Stay Committed

The last step of sparking more fun is committing to it. Price insists that to have fun, you have to prioritize fun—not once, but over and over. She outlines several steps you can take to ensure that you continue to keep fun at the top of your priority list.

First, find your people (what Price calls your “fun squad”). This is a group of people that help you have fun, either by holding you accountable to make time for fun or by having fun with you. You might already have a group of people in mind, or you might need to create one. Either way, fellow fun lovers are a key resource in your effort to prioritize fun.

(Shortform note: When it comes to forming your group of people, more isn’t necessarily better. Consider how you plan on using this group. For example, if the focus is accountability, consider limiting your group to four or five people. Research suggests that groups of five or less are more conducive to conversation. However, if you plan on forming a soccer team, you’ll probably need a few more friends.)

Next, prioritize the things in your life that tend to lead to fun (what Price calls your “fun magnets”). Make an effort to spend time around the people, in the places, or doing the activities that you know tend to lead to fun. The more time you spend with things or people that lead to fun, the higher the likelihood that fun will ensue.

(Shortform note: Prioritizing the things in your life that are fun will often mean saying no to things that aren't fun or necessary (for example, being on an extra committee at work). In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown argues that saying no is an essential skill when you're trying to refocus your time and energy on your biggest priorities. Acknowledging that people often are uncomfortable saying no, he offers several helpful tips. First, remember you're saying no to a proposal, not a person. Second, know that saying no to one thing allows you to say yes to something else. And third, don’t put off the conversation. Be direct. People will appreciate your candor.)

Price also recommends incorporating different levels of fun in your life. That means making an effort to have daily and weekly fun fixes but also prioritizing opportunities for more time-intensive experiences that leave you feeling energized and rejuvenated. For example, if you love playing in water, you might join a weekly water aerobics class but also plan an annual rafting trip with your closest friends.

(Shortform note: Rubin makes a similar recommendation in _The Happiness Project_ , emphasizing that it's possible to infuse your day with small moments of fun simply by allowing time for goofiness. She explains that many people, consciously or unconsciously, shut down moments of goofiness or play because they feel busy or rushed. When you catch yourself sacrificing fun for efficiency, she recommends asking “Does this need to be done now?” and “Can we spare time to be goofy?” If you can, then do it. You, and everyone around you, will have more fun as a result.)

These bigger experiences often require a bigger financial and time commitment. Price explains that prioritizing fun sometimes requires an investment, but she emphasizes that investing in experiences (instead of stuff) will have a bigger impact on your happiness.

> **Why Experiences Make You Happier Than Stuff**
> 
> The illusion that more stuff will bring you more happiness is referred to as the “paradox of possession.” Psychologists have identified three reasons why the happiness that we get from acquiring new possessions is fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying.
> 
>   * The novelty of new stuff quickly wears off. We become accustomed to new possessions, and what once seemed exciting or different becomes normal and routine.
> 
>   * It fuels our desire for more or better. Our purchases set new standards, leading us to seek out even better possessions as we get used to the ones we have.
> 
>   * We get jealous. Owning possessions naturally encourages us to compare ourselves to others, making us jealous when other people have better or more impressive things than we do.

> 
> On the other hand, research has found that experiences lead to more and longer-lasting happiness. Experiences, unlike our possessions, become a part of our identity and therefore we value them more deeply. Furthermore, experiences are subjective, making them less likely to invite comparison. The anticipation of and memory of experiences also adds to their enjoyment, while the anticipation of stuff makes us feel impatient and often doesn’t live up to expectations.

Finally, use technology in a way that increases fun in your life rather than distracting you from it. Price recommends assessing your relationship to your devices and implementing extended screen-free periods in your life.

(Shortform note: Before writing _The Power of Fun_ , Price wrote _How to Break Up With Your Phone_ , which offers a 30-day step-by-step plan on how to build a different relationship with your smartphone. Price begins by recommending that you become more aware of when you use your phone and why, including installing a screen time tracker app. She then outlines daily incremental steps you can take to practice using your phone intentionally rather than out of habit. The plan culminates with a digital sabbath in which you practice spending 24 hours without your smartphone.)
