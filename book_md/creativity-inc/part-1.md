## Part 1: Ed Catmull and the Birth of Pixar

**When Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar Animation Studios, started his career, he had one goal: Create films using computer-generated animation.** At the time, all animation was done by hand, and the concept of using a computer to create characters was deemed nearly impossible. In fact, his early pitches of computer animation were rejected by major studios such as Disney.

**Though he faced a multitude of challenges, Catmull persevered.** He worked tirelessly to advance the technology of computer animation and, eventually, co-founded Pixar to marry his love of animation with his expertise for computer technology. Through the journey of Pixar’s creation, Catmull developed leadership strategies that fostered creativity in the workplace while ensuring that the company remained profitable and successful. Any company that values creativity in the workplace can apply these principles and strategies.

**In this summary, Parts 1 and 2 focus on the origins of Pixar, Parts 3, 4, and 5 break down Catmull’s principles, and Part 6 provides a case study that reveals the effectiveness of these concepts.**

### Chapter 1: Childhood and Education

As a child, Catmull was fascinated with the work of two men: Walt Disney and Albert Einstein:

  * **Catmull loved Walt Disney because he created worlds and ideas that had never existed before.** He watched _The Wonderful World of Disney_ broadcast every week and fell in love with animation as an art form. Though the characters were hand-drawn, they came across as fleshed-out characters with thoughts and opinions. Disney Animation Studios was at the forefront of the animation industry and constantly developed new methods and techniques of animation that inspired Catmull.
  * **Catmull loved Albert Einstein because he created explanations for existing phenomena.** He read Einstein’s many biographies and researched his theories. He saw Einstein as an expert puzzle-solver and loved how he used existing technology to create new and exciting perspectives on the universe. 



**Catmull’s appreciation of these two iconic figures eventually led him down the path of computer animation.** At first, he studied the animation stylings of Disney Animation Studios and tried to hone his skills. However, after studying the form for some time, he realized that he’d never been talented enough to work at Disney as a traditional animator. This sparked his desire to find an alternative way to create characters and build worlds (much like Einstein had tried to find different ways to approach challenging and unexplained topics).

#### University of Utah

**Catmull graduated from the University of Utah (U of U) with undergraduate degrees in physics and computer science.** When looking at graduate programs, he met Ivan Sutherland, a pioneer in computer graphics, who convinced Catmull to study the field under him at U of U. Catmull’s colleagues became some of the leading figures in the computer industry. In fact, their efforts at U of U created a resource called “ARPANET” that would eventually develop into the internet.

While in U of U’s graduate program he learned how to work with highly creative and highly intelligent people. His professors gave him and his colleagues the freedom and resources to create whatever they wanted. **They created forerunners to Photoshop, Netscape, PDFs, and user interfaces.**

### Chapter 2: The Birth of Pixar

**After his time in graduate school, Catmull took a job at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) under the direction of Alex Schure.** Schure believed computers were the way of the future and brought Catmull in to run a research lab dedicated to the computer animation process. Catmull began to assemble a team to work for him at the research lab. He had never been responsible for hiring and had to learn on his feet throughout the process. During his time with at NYIT, Catmull learned two valuable lessons:

  1. **When searching for talent, put your ego aside and hire people who are smarter than you.** Surrounding yourself with intelligent and ambitious people may be intimidating, but it’s the best way to create an efficient and innovative workforce. For example, at the beginning of his tenure at NYIT, Catmull interviewed a man named Alvy Ray Smith. He was charming and had a spectacular resume. Initially, Catmull was intimidated by him as he thought Smith might be a threat to his position. However, he hired him anyway. Smith became a close friend and colleague, and his work contributed to Pixar’s eventual success.
  2. **Collaboration is an essential part of innovation.** When you run into a serious obstacle, invite feedback from other sources to help you navigate the issue. For example, a challenge facing computer animators at the time was “motion blur.” Motion blur is the process of slightly blurring an animated image in motion to emulate the way the eye sees movement. Instead of relying on in-house advancements, Catmull solicited ideas from the community. The connections and advancements that the team made because of this outreach were crucial to the development and understanding of the concept. 



While they made significant advancements with the NYIT research lab, both Catmull and Smith believed the innovations they discovered would mean nothing if they didn’t have _creatives—_ people who work on the creative side of animation such as directors, animators, and modelers— working alongside them. They quietly reached out to studios such as Disney to promote their services and technology as the “next big thing.” However, these studios still didn’t see the value of computer animation and passed on their proposal.

#### _Star Wars_ and Lucasfilm

**Using technology in filmmaking wasn’t seen as important in Hollywood until 1977 with the release of an industry-changing blockbuster:_Star Wars_.** While Lucas’s studio, Lucasfilm, used a lot of practical effects, Lucas saw the ways computers could improve the filmmaking process and create stunning new worlds. In 1979, Lucas created a computer division at Lucasfilm, his production studio, and hired Catmull to run the department.

While at Lucasfilm, Catmull gave a group of Disney animators a tour of their facilities and showed off some of their technology. **One of the animators, John Lasseter, was fascinated by the innovations and told Catmull that he had an idea for a film.** The film, which he was planning on pitching to Disney, was called _The Brave Little Toaster_ and would require the use of computer animation. He asked Catmull if they’d be able to work together to make this happen, and Catmull agreed.

After being let go from Disney for being “too ambitious,” Lasseter ran into Catmull at a conference and asked if he could join Lucasfilm. **Catmull agreed and was thrilled to have a true “storyteller” on their team.**

During his time at Lucasfilm, Catmull learned two valuable lessons:

  1. **It’s not enough to have a good idea if you can’t gain support from your team.** Without support, the idea won’t gain the momentum to get off the ground. For example, when Lucas asked the computer department to develop an editing software, the editors pushed back against the technology because they felt more comfortable with the current process. Despite having the support of Lucas himself, Catmull’s editing software project came to a halt because the people he was creating it for didn’t want it.
  2. **Focus on the _right_ things, even if you fall short in other areas. **Know the purpose of your product and what people expect from it. This helps you focus your efforts on the most important elements of your work. For example, Catmull and Lasseter created a short film called _My Breakfast with André_ for a computer summit. Catmull oversaw the technical team while Lasseter worked on creating an engaging story. Though the runtime for the project was only two minutes, the team struggled to meet the deadline and had to rush out an unfinished product for the summit. However, to their surprise, the audience didn’t seem to care about the unfinished graphics. Lasseter’s story had been so effective that some audience members claimed they didn’t even notice the changes between the full animation and the black-and-white wireframes. Catmull learned that, in filmmaking, focusing on the _story_ is more important than focusing on _technical perfection_.



> **The Pixar Name**
> 
> One of the first major issues Catmull’s department at Lucasfilm addressed was “blue-screen matting,” in which an image could be digitally layered onto another image to create the illusion of environment (for example, a biker in front of a blue-screen could be added to a clip of an earthquake ripping up a road, creating the image of the biker speeding away from impending danger). Historically, editors had to physically doctor the physical film frame by frame to create effects of this nature, but Catmull and Smith wanted to create a computer program that would speed up the process.
> 
> After four years of work, the department created the technology and named it the “Pixar Imaging Computer.”**The name “Pixar” came from a combination of two pitched names: Pixer (a fake Spanish verb created by Smith meaning “to make pictures”) and Radar (which another associate thought sounded more high-tech).** This name would go on to become the title of their division at Lucasfilm and, eventually, the name of the iconic animation studio.

#### Lucas’ Divorce and Steve Jobs

In 1983, Lucas divorced his wife, Marcia. **The divorce put Lucsasfilm in a precarious financial situation.** Lucas decided to sell Pixar to save money and keep Lucasfilm afloat. He hired a management team to make the division more appealing to buyers by reducing the number of employees and marketing a profitable product. However, none of these tricks worked. Catmull and Smith refused to lay off any of their team members and most companies still didn’t see the value of computer animation.

**This changed with Steve Jobs.** In 1985, Jobs was the director of Apple Computer Inc. and wanted to develop products that would shape the future of technology. Catmull met with Jobs and showed him the technology they had created. Jobs, a notoriously assertive man, avoided small talk and asked big questions such as “What are your long-term goals?” and “What can your tech do that other tech can’t?” Though Catmull and Smith were a bit uneasy because of Jobs's forceful personality, they eventually agreed to the deal. After negotiations, **Jobs purchased Pixar for $5 million in February 1986, and the company “Pixar” was born.**
