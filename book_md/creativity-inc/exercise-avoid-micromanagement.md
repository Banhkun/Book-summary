## Exercise: Avoid Micromanagement

Micromanagement can stifle creativity and prevent your team from doing their best work.

* * *

Think of a time that someone micromanaged you. How did it make you feel? Describe the situation and how it impacted your work.

Now, think about the way you would have handled the situation if you hadn’t been told how to. Would you have been more effective? Describe your solution.

With this situation in mind, describe a situation in which you’ve micromanaged someone else.

Knowing how micromanaging impacted your work, how could you have approached the situation differently to avoid micromanaging your employee?
