## Exercise: Create a Mental Model

Visualization helps you move through a project while staying focused on your goals and comfortable with uncertainty.

* * *

Think about an upcoming project. Describe your role and your responsibilities for this project.

Using the description of your role, develop a mental model that mimics your responsibilities and defines your process. Think about the mental models of sailing a ship, driving through a tunnel, and being a shepherd for inspiration.
