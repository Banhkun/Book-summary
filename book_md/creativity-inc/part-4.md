## Part 4: Growing Through Change

Another of Catmull’s keys to building a successful organization is being**e willing to implement change, accept randomness, and find your blind spots.** Many creative organizations fall into the trap of holding onto systems that worked in the past without understanding _why_ they worked. They try to force a process onto a problem or concept, even if that process isn’t the most effective for the project at hand.

For example, when Pixar started work on _Toy Story 2_ , they believed the process they developed on _Toy Story_ would allow new directors to succeed at the helm of the project. What they failed to recognize was that the reason _Toy Story_ was successful wasn’t because of the “process.” It was because of the people. Without the right people, the “process” was hollow and almost led Pixar to its demise.

### Chapter 9: Implementing Change and Adapting to Randomness

Many people believe, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” meaning that processes that have worked in the past don’t need to be changed. This can be a dangerous belief, especially in the long term.

**Change is necessary.** The world is changing all of the time, and you have to adapt accordingly. Just because a process has “worked before” doesn’t mean it’s the best fit for new issues or projects. You have to introduce new ideas to meet the ever-changing needs of your organization.

For example, Catmull wasn’t a fan of Pixar making sequels. He built Pixar on the foundation that new and original projects were the most important thing to the organization and viewed sequels as “creative bankruptcy.” However, over time, Catmull changed his view on the importance of sequels. They usually produced high box office returns and freed up the company to use their funds towards new and experimental projects. Because of this, Catmull had the studio produce a sequel every other year to ensure they had the constant income to experiment with new concepts without putting the company at risk.

This isn’t to say that you have to make changes for the sake of making changes. There are reasons to keep processes in place, especially when they’ve been created to combat specific issues. **However, too many well-intentioned rules and restrictions can kill a creative process.**

#### Alleviating the Fear of Change

People are afraid of enacting change because change is often associated with a “broken” or “ineffective” process or product. People don’t want to look incompetent and will often try to lobby for their work, even if that work isn’t effective. **This fear can cripple your team and make them unwilling to adapt.** If unaddressed, this could have disastrous consequences.

For example, as the Silicon Valley computer race continued through the ‘90s and 2000s, companies that were willing to change their focus according to new developments in technology succeeded. However, companies such as Silicon Graphics tried to continue selling large, expensive computers instead of investing in more economical models. While this kept them afloat in the short term, their aversion to change killed them in the end.

**The following are a few tips to help you alleviate the fear of change:**

  * **Discuss the importance of change.** Assure your team that changes aren’t always made because someone failed. They’re often made to adapt to a changing world that’s outside of their control. 
  * **Take off the blinders.** When you and your team have mastered a particular process, it’s often easy to ignore glaring issues. Take the time to look at the process you have in place and point out issues to your team. This will make them understand the need for change and help them let go of the process.
  * **Embrace the learning curve.** When new processes are introduced, it may take your team a bit of time to adjust. Accept that there may be some errors at the beginning and avoid punishing your team members for mistakes. If you do, they’ll be averse to other changes you may want to make.



#### Accepting Randomness

**Often, success and failure are due to random events.** They can’t be predicted and can come out of nowhere. This is not an easy concept to grapple with because our brains aren’t wired to accept randomness. We like to discover a cause and an effect, but random events don’t adhere to these patterns. For example, you could be the most well-prepared person in the world, but if your car breaks down while you’re on your way to an important meeting, things may go downhill by no fault of your own.

**Random events aren’t always bad.** Sometimes, they’re the spark that leads to a new project or unexpected growth in a new employee. However, for these events to be effective, you have to be ready and willing to invest time in developing these random occurrences.

For example, your team is working on a new film about animated birds. For all of the new ideas you’ve tried to bring to the table, everything has felt derived or unoriginal. During a break, a few of your team members watch an unrelated video about a singing competition. This sparks an idea for a direction for the movie: an animated film that focuses on the importance of a bird’s “singing.” The random event of your team watching an unrelated video led to an idea for a new project.

#### Addressing Random Issues

Most people have been taught since they were children that hard work will yield success. **While hard work is important, there’s another factor that plays into achievement: adaptability.** When a random event throws your regular process out of whack, you have to be prepared to make adjustments.

For example, your marketing team has been preparing for a pitch meeting with the executives. An employee has worked for tens of hours developing designs for the pitch packet. A few days before the meeting, their computer crashes. With only a couple of days to adjust, you have to make some changes to meet your deadline.

**When dealing with random events, keep the following tips in mind:**

  * **Don’t play the blame game.** You can’t blame an individual or single team for not predicting an issue if it’s truly random. Accusing people of not predicting a random event is absurd and unhelpful.
  * **Troubleshoot quickly.** Immediately begin to diagnose the issue and adapt. The sooner you figure out a solution to the problem, the more likely you are to get back on track. For example, if the person meant to deliver a presentation gets sick and can’t make it to work, don’t spend your energy freaking out. Get their notes and prepare to give an impromptu presentation yourself. The sooner you begin to study their presentation, the smoother it will go. 
  * **Don’t ignore small problems.** Because time is finite, it’s easy to put all of your energy into solving “serious problems.” However, ignoring smaller issues can lead to an unexpected serious problem down the line. Respect every issue that comes to your attention, because you never know which problem may lead to more serious issues.
  * **Give your teams a level of autonomy.** When it comes to navigating the needs and issues of different departments, it’s impossible to address every single problem as it arises. As a leader, if you feel you need to be involved in every decision, problems won’t be addressed quickly enough, and your organization will drown in “smaller problems.” Instead of directly engaging with every problem, allow your employees to address issues as they arise. 
  * **Develop precautionary measures.** When a random event happens that you and your team weren’t prepared for, it can require a lot of effort to get things back on track. After you’ve solved an issue, look for what went wrong and figure out if there are precautionary measures you can put into place to avoid them happening again. For example, at Pixar, an employee working on _Toy Story 2_ accidentally deleted hundreds of hours of work after typing in an incorrect code. Thankfully, a Pixar team member working from home had a back-up, and they were able to restore most of the work. To avoid this issue in the future, Catmull had his team install restrictions into the software that made it much more difficult to delete files. He saw the issue that caused the accident and put protections in place to avoid a similar accident happening again. 



### Chapter 10: Finding Your Blind Spots

Everyone has blind spots, or problematic areas they’re unaware of. **Discovering these issues isn’t easy because these trouble areas exist outside of your current perspective.** For example, if you’re in upper management at a manufacturing facility, you may not know about issues on the production line if you're not seeing them for yourself.

These blind spots can lead to unexpected meltdowns or poor decision-making.**To avoid potential disaster, raise your awareness and constantly search for the “hidden” problems in your organization.**

#### Searching for Blind Spots as a Leader

When you’re in a position of power, people tend to tell you what you want to hear.**This deferential treatment can skew your perspective in dangerous ways.** For example, a high-ranking executive may believe that employee morale is high because, whenever _she_ sees her employees, they seem happy and hard at work. However, she’s unaware that this high morale is an illusion. Her employees are actually unhappy with their work environment, but they don’t want to upset the “boss.” Employee frustration may continue to fester until, suddenly, people begin quitting “unexpectedly.”

**There are three factors that lead to hidden information:**

  * **Employees are on their best behavior around people in power.** You can’t always rely on your managers or employees to be honest with you about brewing issues. Even when you ask for candidness, team members may withhold information at the risk of looking incompetent. 
  * **Hierarchy can create a false sense of importance.** While hierarchy in a company can be beneficial, it can also lead to people attributing value to job titles. For example, a middle manager may treat an executive with the utmost respect because that person is “important” while they treat their employees terribly because those people _aren’t_ “important.” This can lead to false information being passed up the chain of command while mistreatment goes unreported. As a leader, this makes it challenging to know if an employee is actually doing good work, or if they’re just saying what you want to hear.
  * **Complex and large organizations have a lot of moving parts.** Different departments deal with a series of daily routines and responsibilities. Because of this, every team member has a different perspective based on their limited view of the company. Even executive members who are supposed to oversee multiple departments don’t have a clear perspective on every moving piece of an organization. Therefore, when decisions are made without first consulting others, they’re made with an incomplete picture of the status of the company. 



**Now that you know what leads to blind spots, consider the following tips:**

  * **Don’t always believe the hype.** While it may feel nice to have people defer to you, ensure that the information you’re receiving is as accurate as possible. Don’t allow yourself to get complacent because it boosts your ego.
  * **Encourage a vocal and candid workforce.** When people feel comfortable speaking up, it’s more likely you’re going to hear the truth about brewing issues.
  * **View differing opinions as complementary, not competitive.** The best way to solve problems within a complex organization is to take a wide range of views into consideration. People within departments will have a stronger sense of the issues and problems facing that department than you do, and valuing their perspective will help you avoid overlooking crucial issues you may be unaware of.
  * **Accept that you’ll never know everything.** It’s nearly impossible to know every facet of your company. Once you accept that you’ll never know everything, it’s easier to put your ego aside and listen to the perspectives of others.



#### Hindsight Isn’t 20/20

When someone claims “hindsight is 20/20,” they’re implying that you can understand a decision after the fact because you’ve experienced the results and consequences of that decision. However, it’s a skewed concept. In reality, **your personal viewpoint distorts your version of reality and ignores other factors that may have impacted the result.**

For example, if a young child burns their hand on a pot while it’s on the stove, they likely won’t touch it again. However, they won’t necessarily know the difference between the pot being on the stovetop and the pot being in the cabinet. Therefore, they may develop an aversion to grabbing pots because, in their experience, touching a pot means burning their hand. Even with hindsight, their view is distorted.

This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t learn from the past. **Hindsight can be a powerful teacher, but it shouldn’t control your actions.** For example, if a softball player pitches a great game after using a new warmup, she may continue to practice this warmup. However, she recognizes that it isn’t the sole key to her success. She knows there are other factors at play that impact the quality of her gameplay and continues to search for ways to improve her mechanics.
