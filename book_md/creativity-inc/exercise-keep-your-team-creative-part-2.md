## Exercise: Keep Your Team Creative, Part 2

Steps 5-8 highlight the importance of experimentation, attention to detail, postmortems, and learning opportunities.

* * *

Experimentation leads to innovative and original work. Think of your current workplace. In what ways could you promote experimentation? Think about think-tanks, experimental spaces, and giving employees freedom to solve problems.

Attention to detail requires that you abandon your preconceived notions. Using Pixarâ€™s drawing class for inspiration, look outside of your window. Find an object and describe what you see. Look for tiny details such as texture and color.

Postmortems give you the chance to address issues directly following a project. Think about a project you recently completed. Think about three issues you faced during that project and how you plan to address them in future projects.

Learning opportunities give your employees the opportunity to think out-of-the-box. What opportunities could you offer to your team?
