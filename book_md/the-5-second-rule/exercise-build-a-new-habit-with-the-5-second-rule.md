## Exercise: Build a New Habit With the 5 Second Rule

Robbins states that the 5 Second Rule is a tool to help you overcome overthinking when you’re trying to do something that’s not a part of your normal routine. Practice this by identifying a routine you’d like to change and preparing to apply the 5 Second Rule.

* * *

Identify a healthy habit you’d like to start or a bad habit you’d like to quit. (For example, perhaps you’d like to get out of bed earlier or learn to code. Alternatively, you might want to stop spending time on Twitter or compulsively working too much). How often do you currently perform that habit, and how often would you _like_ to perform that habit?

Think ahead to a time you’ll be able to use the 5 Second Rule to force yourself to act differently than you normally do and either break your bad habit or implement your good one. Describe in detail where you’ll be and what you’ll do. (For example, you could write: I’d like to stop spending time on Twitter. The next time I’m relaxing on the couch and I open Twitter, I’m going to count down from five, then close the app and find a book to read.)

Predict what might happen to threaten your new habit or trigger your old, bad habit. How will you use the 5 Second Rule to overcome that obstacle? (For example, if you want to quit Twitter, you might predict that a stressful day at work will push you to compulsively check Twitter to distract yourself. In this case, you could plan to use the 5 Second Rule to do something more calming than Twitter, like calling a friend or taking a walk.)
