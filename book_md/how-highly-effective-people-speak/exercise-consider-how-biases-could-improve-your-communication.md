## Exercise: Consider How Biases Could Improve Your Communication

Consider how you might use an understanding of cognitive biases to be more persuasive and effective in your daily life.

* * *

Think of a time recently when you failed to convince someone of your opinion or persuade them to take action. This could be work-related (your presentation failed to convince your bosses to try your idea) or personal (you failed to persuade a friend to watch a movie you enjoyed). Write a brief description below.

Now consider why your communication failed to achieve what you were aiming for. Was your presentation too dull, or did it provide too much irrelevant information? Did you fail to convey the emotions the movie made you feel to your friend? Write your answer below.

Using the availability bias, how might you have made your message more emotionally arousing through storytelling? What details could you have left out to make it simpler and more memorable?

Using attribute substitution, how might you have substituted a logical decision with a more emotional one? For example, could you have told your friend less about the plot of the movie and more about the intense emotions it made you feel?

Using the halo effect, how might you have made a better first impression with your audience? In your work presentation, for example, could you have better explained why your idea mattered in the beginning of your speech?
