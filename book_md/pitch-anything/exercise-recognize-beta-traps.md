## Exercise: Recognize Beta Traps

Beta traps are business procedures and social rituals that reinforce your lower-status position.

* * *

Think back to your last sales call. What beta traps did you encounter before you even began your pitch?

How did you react to the beta traps? (For example, did you consent to pitching in a coffee shop? Did you make small talk?)

How did your reaction affect your status in this situation? (Did you feel like an authority on your topic and confidently deliver your pitch? Did you feel like you had to cater to and win over your target?)

How can you bypass these beta traps in the future?
