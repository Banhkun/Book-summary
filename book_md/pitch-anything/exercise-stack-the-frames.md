## Exercise: Stack the Frames

In the final phase of your pitch, you’ll throw a series of four carefully crafted frames (intrigue, prize, time, and moral authority) at your target, to create a set of hot cognitions that will drive her forward.

* * *

Intrigue: Think of an element of your idea that can be used as a promised “reward,” that will pique your target’s curiosity and make her want to stick around. The author’s example was an eccentric partner who would be joining the deal later.

Prize: Put together a brief paragraph that shows you need to evaluate your target’s worth as much as she needs to evaluate yours, and that you are valued elsewhere.

Time: Write down a short set of lines that imposes a reasonable but firm deadline.

Moral authority: Create a summary of the ideals you hold that you will expect your business partners to live up to, and phrase them in such a way to convey these ideals in a lighthearted, but sincere, manner.
