## Exercise: Draft an Intrigue Story

An intrigue story is one you’ll inject into your pitch if you need to jolt the audience’s attention back onto you and out of analysis. It should be brief and describe a risky circumstance with tension and consequences.

* * *

Think of a short intrigue story you could use to grab your audience’s attention. Remember to ground your audience with a backstory, introduce obstacles, increase those obstacles, find a suspense-filled moment to pause your story, and then finally, resolve it. Some thought prompts:

  1. Have you ever rescued a deal at the last minute?
  2. Did you ever arrive at a pitch to find something completely unexpected?
  3. Does your idea, product, or service have an amusing backstory?
