## Exercise: Crafting Your Idea’s Backstory

Your idea needs a backstory that answers the question, “why now?” It should discuss changes in economic, social, and technological forces in your industry, and how these changes have opened a market window.

* * *

How have economic forces developed in your industry or in the market in general, that would affect the success of your idea?

What social forces have arisen lately, that might drive people towards your concept?

What recent technological developments will support your idea?

Based on these three forces, write a short introduction to your idea or product using your “Why now” frame.
