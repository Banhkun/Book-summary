## Chapter 8: Love and Health

Good health means more than just the absence of illness. You’re not truly healthy unless you feel energetic, happy, and free of stress. Think about how you felt as a child or how children you see today feel. Without the concerns of adult life, children are enthusiastic about life. They wake each day with anticipation and spirit and believe they are invincible. If you want to be the vision of health, live like a child.

### You Are Whatever You Believe You Are

**You must live like a child because children have not been corrupted by negative thought patterns that lead to poor health.** They have no reason to believe they are unhealthy or that their bodies are not perfect and strong, and so those results do not come to them.

Your beliefs likewise determine your physical state:

  * If you were sick often growing up, you likely believe you get sick easily. 
  * If you’ve always struggled with your weight, you may think you have trouble losing weight.
  * If you injured your back and experienced pain afterward, you probably believe you suffer from chronic back pain. 



What you don’t realize is that **these things continue to be true because you believe they are.**

Think about the prevalence of disease in society despite the advances in medical science. With the ability to cure diseases and heal from conditions at a higher level than ever, why are so many people living with diseases? The answer is that most people fear diseases. Commercials constantly show pharmaceuticals that can help with certain diseases. The news is full of stories of people dying from disease. You likely know people who suffer from one disease or another. This prevalence creates the thought, “I don’t want to get that disease.” And that thought leads to bad feelings about the disease, rather than positive feelings about good health.

What are your beliefs about your health?

  * Do you feel good about your current physical state, or do you worry about future health issues? 
  * Do you believe that illness is an inevitability as you age? 
  * Are you convinced that your body will diminish with age, or do you believe you are the age you feel? 



Whatever your beliefs are, your feelings follow suit. **Believe in long life and a strong and healthy body, and you will send those good feelings to the law of attraction.**

> **The Placebo Effect**
> 
> Medical researchers often test the efficiency of new medications or treatments using double-blind experiments. These studies provide one group of patients with the treatment and another group with a placebo, or fake treatment. Neither the patient nor the researcher are aware of which treatment the patient received.
> 
> The placebo effect provides the astonishing evidence of how beliefs can lead to physical changes. Often, the placebo patients show improvements in their conditions despite not receiving the actual treatment. This is likely due to the willful belief that they are in the treatment group, which allowed them to feel like their ailments were being treated.
> 
> Through the power of their beliefs and good feelings, they were able to create better health in their bodies. This is the Power at work and the amazing results of focusing on love.

### How the Body Works

Your body is a well-oiled and self-sufficient system capable of amazing things. **There is great power in your body, and you control that power with your feelings.**

The body is made up of trillions of cells that work to keep the body running smoothly. These cells work 24-hour shifts 7 days a week together and alone to maintain your health.

  * Your organs are operated by a leader cell that ensures the other cells work in harmony to function properly. 
  * Patrol cells traverse the body like security guards, searching for disturbances to your cellular equilibrium. When you get injured or become sick, the patrol cells alert other cells in the body so they can activate and fix whatever is wrong. 
  * Memory cells assess unfamiliar organisms and check the rolodex of previous intrusions to determine the treatment needed. 
  * The attack cells rally to destroy the organisms using the myriad of chemical compounds contained in the body like a personal pharmacy. 



So what does this mean for you? Your feelings seep into your cells. Good feelings fill the cells with love, and on that love frequency, more love is delivered to them as good health. Bad feelings create tension in the body, and stress produces a chemical reaction that reduces the viability of your cells, thereby reducing the force of love. The result is a continued reduction of love until the cells become vulnerable to disease.

The good news is that you are the conductor of everything that happens in your body. **You give instructions to your cells through your thoughts and feelings. Believe your cells are full of the force of love, and they will keep you healthy.** If you believe you have trouble losing weight, the cells must respond by slowing their absorption rate, thereby slowing your metabolism. It’s the law of attraction inside your body.

To achieve the health or body you want, tell your cells what you want. They have no choice but to listen and respond in kind.

  * Tell your cells how strong and powerful you feel. 
  * Tell your cells how good your hearing or eyesight is.
  * Tell your cells how happy you are that you can eat anything and not gain weight. 
  * Tell your cells how relaxed and well-rested you are. 



Whatever you tell your cells is what you will be.

### Get the Body and Health You Want

If your body were the solar system, your heart would be the sun and all the organs would be the planets. **The sun is the center of the universe that creates order and harmony, and your heart functions in the same way.**

Scientists have proven that positive feelings strengthen your immune system, boost energy, reduce stress, stabilize blood pressure, and improve metabolism. These positive feelings are felt in your heart, which means that in addition to helping to harmonize the body, the heart grows stronger, as well.

#### Healing With Your Heart

You can use love to improve your health by increasing the love you feel in your heart. You can’t feel love in your heart if you think bad thoughts about your health. When you are sick or diagnosed with a disease, find a way to give love to your heart by thinking good thoughts about your body. **Focus on what is strong, not what is wrong, to harness the force of love in your heart.**

All of your thoughts, even those not about health, can affect your ability to heal or thrive physically. Your heart cannot feel good feelings if you’re upset about bills, family, your job, the neighbors, or any other grievance. It is vital that you seek out things to love and fill yourself with love. Use gratitude to multiply goodness in your life:

  * Be grateful for your health and life. 
  * Be grateful for the body you’ve been given and all the wonderful things it does for you.
  * Be grateful for the nourishment you put in your body, and say thank you for everything you eat and drink. Only eat when you are feeling positive.
  * Be grateful for the medications that help you feel better.
  * Be grateful for your ability to create the body you want through love. 



Gratitude also works when you’re treating an illness or disease. It might not be realistic to stay positive at all times if facing a serious or life-threatening condition, but you don’t have to. To tip the scales **keep the positive feelings at 51% or more, and the force of love will be the predominant feeling in your heart.** That extra one percent is the difference between a healthy outcome and worsening condition.

You can also use your imagination to strengthen the force of love in your heart. When you go in for treatment or take medicine, imagine your body being healed. Imagine your follow-up appointment and the positive outcome you hope for. Imagine what you will feel like when you receive the results you want, and feel the love of receiving them in your heart. The law of attraction must return that picture of positivity back to you.

#### Boosting Your Positivity

If you find it hard to be positive about your health, find other ways to tip the scales. Look around your life and the world for things to be grateful for and love. Surround yourself with the things you love, like your favorite foods or feel-good movies. **Gather whatever you love around you to strengthen your positive love force.** You can also use the Creation Process and the Power Keys to bring more love to your heart. Whatever tactic you use, the body will still fill with love and only receive love in return.

> **A Word About Water**
> 
> Scientists have discovered that when water is infused with positivity, the energy of the water increases. Every cell in the water becomes perfectly balanced and works harmoniously with the others.
> 
> Your body is 70% percent water, including your brain. Therefore, infuse your body with positivity to change the energy of the water in your cells. That same balance and harmony is created within your body as a result. With trillions of cells in your body, the cumulative effect of that balance and harmony will be amazing.

### Other Health Considerations

Your feelings about your body are not limited to your health. You want to feel beautiful and young. You want others to think of you as beautiful and vibrant. So what’s stopping you?

#### Beauty

The ideals of beauty in society have complicated your relationship with beauty. It’s easy to criticize your own looks when you’re forced to compare yourself to photo-shopped images of models and celebrities. What’s ironic is that simply by using the force of love to create beauty, you can outshine even the best digitally altered image of yourself.

**The beauty you want lives inside of you. When you fill your life and heart with love, that love saturates your skin cells.** Your skin glows brighter, signs of aging reduce, your hair gets stronger, and your eyes sparkle. Your magnetic field shines brightly around you, and others will not be able to look away from the power you emit.

However, if you feel bad about how you look or focus on the things you don’t like, you’re on a negative beauty frequency. You can’t shine if your heart is full of negativity. So forget the products and fashion spreads. **Be happy and feel beautiful, and that will be your reality.**

#### Aging

You never have to feel your age. You can feel whatever age you want because you have the power to command your body to feel that age. It seems simple, but the problem is that you’ve been conditioned from an early age to believe you only have a certain amount of time to live. That belief created a thought pattern that counts down your vitality as you grow older.

Imagine what would happen if someone on Earth suddenly lived to be 200 years old. Would you suddenly believe that you could live that long? Would your beliefs about your limited time and potential change? Probably, so why wait? Believe you will be that person. **Believe that your body will remain active and strong until you decide it’s time to age.**

If you can believe these things, your cells will believe them too. The law of attraction in your body will pick up the signal and return a long and prosperous life to you. You are under no obligation to grow old physically. Feel young and be young and show gratitude for your continued good health.
