## Chapter 2: Shape Your Feelings to Shape Your Life

Feelings are part of your DNA. You don’t have a choice about whether you feel. You only have a choice about _how_ you feel. And **how you feel at any moment of any day is important because your feelings are always shaping the trajectory of your life**.

### Feelings Make Thoughts Significant

You have a million thoughts running through your head on a daily basis, but not all of them are significant. And if they’re not significant, they don’t have feelings attached to them and will not play a role in creating your life. Your thoughts need emotional relevance to give them power.

Think of your thoughts like a car and your feelings like gasoline. The car cannot drive down the road without gas, and your thoughts cannot attract life back to you without feelings. This is why focusing on how you feel is so important.

The energy you put into the world is a mirror image of the feelings you experience. **When you feel good, you don’t have to worry about what’s in store for you. You’re sending out love, and that love has no choice but to attract back more love.**

#### The Difference Between Good and Better-Than-Bad Feelings

You may think the absence of bad feelings is the same as feeling good. It’s not. Bad feelings do not simply encompass despair, grief, sadness, frustration, or anxiety. Likewise, good feelings do not simply mean anything besides the most extreme trauma or drama.

Feeling “okay” is not the same as feeling good. True, feeling okay is better than feeling bad, but okay feelings will only lead to an okay life. **If you want to change your life, don’t settle for average feelings.** Feeling good means experiencing passion, joy, love, enthusiasm, and gratitude for life.

The goal for your life is not simply to feel better. You’re trying to attract a certain type of life. Feel passion, and you will be presented with experiences that allow you to feel more passion. The people you meet will be passionate people. The relationships you have will be passionate relationships. Even the songs you hear will inspire passion. All of these things will come to you because you sent passion into the universe, and the universe responded in kind.

#### Doubling Down on Your Feelings

Why settle for simple positive responses when you can create massive responses. **There is no limit to the amount of positivity you can feel, so turn up the volume on your good feelings to create the best life you can.**

  * Sit with your good feelings. Take control of them, and let them grow to immense proportions. 
  * Play around in your joy. How much joy can you feel at any moment? Celebrate the positive feelings by milking them for all their worth. Keep adding things that bring you joy to the list until you’re bursting with joy.
  * Strengthen your positive feelings by piling on more positivity. The more you can strengthen your positive feelings, the bigger the reward. 



### Monitoring Your Feelings

Your life is not stumbling forward unguided. **You create your life every moment you’re awake. If you’re not sure how you’ve been feeling, look at your life.** Are things the way you want them to be? If not, your feelings are likely the culprit.

  * If your job is not satisfying, think about the thoughts and feelings you’ve been having about your job. Chances are, they haven’t been positive. 
  * If you often feel tired or lacking the energy for life, what have your thoughts been about your health or physical abilities? If you feel bad about not having enough energy, you’re telling the universe you want to continue feeling bad about this. You will be given more fatigue and less energy. 



**Take inventory of your life to understand your thought and feeling patterns.** Then, make the decision to start thinking differently about your life.

You are the narrator of your own story. Not everything that happens to you is in your control, but how you feel about those events is. You can change what happens to you by choosing how you feel. Give good to the world so you can get good back.

#### Use Love to Turn Your Life Around

The good news is that bad feelings bottom out. Unlike good feelings, which can soar as high as you can take them, bad feelings can only go so far. The phrase “hit rock bottom” describes the moment when people recognize they need to either change or perish. When you hit that bottom, love is showing you how far you are from your life force. You’re being prompted to feel better, and life will start to improve as a result.

As the ruling force of life, love is always calling to you. Love wants you to reach great heights so it can fill you up. Use the knowledge of _The Power_ to understand when you’re not taking advantage of your life force so you can turn your life around.

One way to turn your life around is to focus on _why_ you want what you don’t have. It’s easy to focus on not having the kind of life you want and feeling bad about it. But **if you change that focus to how those things will improve your life, you will put out that positive energy and draw those things to you**.

  * If you’re dealing with a breakup, you feel bad because you’ve lost a special bond, love, or companionship. If all you focus on is the loss of those things, all you’ll attract back are more experiences to help you feel the loss of those things. 
  * If you can focus on how good it feels to have someone to talk to or share your life with, those are the feelings you will give out. You will attract back events, people, or circumstances that allow you to feel that good feeling.



**It’s not easy to stay positive all the time, but if you realize that wanting what you don’t have comes from a place of loving that thing, you can start attracting that thing to you.**

Every good thing you want is waiting for you. All you have to do is summon it forward by feeling the love you have for it. You only want what you love, so love it to the fullest, and it will be yours.

#### Don’t Wait to Be Happy

If you believe you will be happy only after you have everything you want, you’ll be waiting a long time. The mirror image of your feelings is non-negotiable. If you think, “I will be happy when I have more money,” you’re acknowledging your lack of money. Your thoughts about lack lead to negative feelings about money, so you will not receive positive money experiences.

Waiting to be happy is like waiting for a bus no longer in service. Your feelings of dissatisfaction have put you on a path of dissatisfaction, and that’s all you’ll ever feel. **You must be happy first, feel that happiness, and focus on what you want from a place of positivity.** Only then, can you receive that positivity back.

### The Frequency of a Better Life

You’ve learned that your feelings are like magnets that attract like with like. But how is that happening?

A magnet has a certain magnetic frequency that pulls something with the same frequency toward it. Likewise, your thoughts and feelings have frequencies. Good feelings put you on the frequency of love. Bad feelings put you on a bad frequency because any frequency outside of love is the wrong frequency. You never have to wonder what frequency you’re on. What you’re feeling at this moment is the frequency you’re on.

This sounds complicated, but it’s actually quite simple. If you notice you’re on a bad frequency, change your thoughts and feelings. **At any moment, you can start feeling a different way, and at that moment, your frequency changes.**

There are several possible feeling frequencies for any circumstance in your life. Some of these frequencies include love, excitement, hope, satisfaction, gratitude, pride, boredom, criticism, anger, pain, fear, and disappointment. The example of wanting to travel will help express how frequencies work:

  * You dream of traveling to Europe someday. But you can’t afford to do it right now, so you feel frustrated and upset. You’ve placed “travel” on the frequency of “frustrated and upset” because that is what your feelings are giving out. That frequency can only attract other things with “frustrated and upset” frequencies that relate to your ability to travel. 
  * If you don’t have the money to travel right now but still surround the idea of travel with love, you’ve placed travel on the love frequency. What you will receive are more reasons to feel that love, which will likely turn into the opportunity to travel. 



Even if you don’t have something specific you want or are content with life, you can still make your life better and learn to love life more. **If what you want is a positive life trajectory, rather than a positive outcome, make sure you stay on a positive frequency.**

### Act, Don’t React

When you hand over control of your feelings to life’s circumstances, you move through life on autopilot reacting without thought. If positive things happen, you have a positive response and vice versa. **If you simply react to life, you’ll become trapped on an emotional rollercoaster that never stops—you just go round and round through the highs and lows.**

What you don’t realize is that when you plummet into negativity, you’re not guaranteed an upswing around the corner. You drag more negativity into your life, and down and down you go.

You might think, “Well, it’s natural to feel bad about forking over half your savings when your car breaks down,” and you’d be right. But your negative focus on how much money you’re losing is putting you on the frequency of losing money. The law of attraction has no choice but to bring you more circumstances that deplete your savings.

**You have the power to change your circumstances by changing your actions and reactions.** It doesn’t matter how you’ve reacted in the past. Change your feelings today to get on a positive frequency and erase the past.

#### Another Problem With Reacting

When you stay on the rollercoaster of reactions, you cut positive frequencies off at the knees. Even if you’re happy most of the time, the rate at which your reactions come and go doesn’t allow the power of your positivity to come through. You can feel happy about many things, but if you don’t hold that happiness and feel it deeply, you can’t reach the level of love. **If you don’t reach the level of love, you don’t give the love frequency enough time to connect with other positive frequencies**.

This is where the difference between thinking and feeling comes in. You can think, “I am happy to have received a raise today,” but if your next thought is, “I’m hungry,” the love for your raise dissipates. Worse, if you feel the love in one moment and then react negatively a moment later, you’ve wiped out the positive frequency:

  * You give love by visiting with a close friend but stop giving love when you get a flat tire after leaving.
  * You give love by tucking your child in at night but stop giving love when something on the news upsets you. 
  * You feel love about an upcoming road trip but stop feeling love when you get a bill. 



You either give love and harness its power throughout the day or stop giving love and diminish its force. There is no middle ground. **The force of love does not care about why you couldn’t give love. Justifications for negativity only focus your attention on negativity.** By now, you know what that means.

Blaming others for your negativity doesn’t work either. Your energy is giving out blame, and all you’ll get back is blame. Circumstances or events that elicit blame in your life will continue, even if it’s not the same situation that started the blame cycle.

The same is true for criticism, hate, complaints, and all other negative emotions or reactions. When you give these negative thoughts or feelings power, they send a lack of love frequency to the universe. Remove words like gross, awful, horrible, and vile from your vocabulary. You can’t say these words without eliciting a strong emotional response.

The consequences of good and bad frequencies are likely not obvious. But think about times when you were on a lucky streak or had a run of bad luck. What preceded them? Did you give love by helping a neighbor carry her groceries and then receive a bigger tax refund than expected? Did you complain about your boss and then have your nanny quit? **Look for the chain of reactions of good and bad to see how each frequency led to more of the same.**

### The Feelings Ratio

You’re probably wondering, “How can I avoid feeling bad when bad things happen?” The answer is you don’t have to try not to feel bad ever. **The point is to tip the scales so that the ratio of good versus bad feelings skews positive.** Even if you are 51% positive and 49% negative, that extra one percent is enough to start bringing more positivity back than negativity. The returned positivity is added to original positivity and increases the positivity percentage.

Every day, you face the scale of good and bad. Start the day good, and it will continue to be good despite small hiccups along the way. Start the day in a bad mood, and you’ll have a hard time feeling love, even when good things happen. **Each day that you start good and maintain that good feeling will compound into a happy life.** You’re shaping your future by your thoughts, actions, and feelings today, so accumulate good days to lead to a happy future.
