## Exercise: Love Your Life

Everyone has positive and negative experiences, but sometimes we focus on the negative rather than believing in positive things without realizing the consequences that has on our lives.

* * *

When you look at your life, how do you feel your previous thoughts have either led to positive or negative circumstances?

How do you find positivity or remain positive during difficult moments in life?

Name one change youâ€™d like to make in your life? What thoughts do you think could help create that positive change?
