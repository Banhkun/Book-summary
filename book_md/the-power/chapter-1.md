## Chapter 1: This Thing Called Love

Life is not complicated. Despite what you may think, it’s solely composed of two things: positive elements and negative elements. **In any facet of life, be it personal, professional, financial, or spiritual, your success or failure is determined by your positivity or negativity.**

If your life is more negative than positive, you’re not leading the life you deserve. You may even be jealous of others who seem to have everything they want and believe they got their charmed life through luck or connections. But at the heart of their achievements is behavior. These people did something specific to create the life they wanted—they led with love. With the knowledge gained in _The Power_ , you can have the life you want, too.

The first five chapters will guide you through the power of love, how your thoughts and feelings affect that power, and how to use love to attract what you want in life. The last four chapters focus specifically on using love to improve your finances, relationships, health, and overall life.

### Everything Is Love

Love is often misunderstood as a singular emotion written about in poems, songs, films, and philosophical texts. But what you don’t realize is that love is a force of life, just like other natural forces such as gravity and magnetic fields. You can’t see them with your eyes, but you know they’re there working in the background of everything. **Love is, likewise, an invisible force working behind everything, and it is purely positive.**

Life would cease to exist without love. Children are born out of love. Buildings are built because someone loves to design them and someone else loves to build them. Technology is created because someone has a love for invention. Books are written because someone has a love for stories. Everything in life stems from a seed of desire that was nurtured through love.

Your life is a product of love. Without something to love, you have no reason to engage with life. You would feel no motivation to eat, sing, work, dance, date, or raise children. Love is the desire that propels you to act. It is inherent inside you as a positive force. But if you encompass this force, why isn’t your life perfect? Having the force and using the force are different things. **You need to choose to use love to create a better life before you can achieve it.**

#### Life Choices

You make the decision to either use the force of love or not every minute of every day. **When you feel and experience love, you have positive experiences. When you feel the opposite of love, you have negative experiences.** That’s because love is rooted in the law of attraction.

The law of attraction is the force that draws one thing to another. For example, gravity is attracted to the earth, so everything is kept in place by the force of gravity. Attraction is also what brings people together. It dictates what you eat, how you decorate your home, how your cells multiply, and which community you live in. You make choices based on what you’re attracted to, and through that attraction, you bring life’s elements to you.

You’re only attracted to what you love, so **when you engage with something you’re attracted to, you engage with the world positively**. The following example illustrates this point:

  * You have a positive response to a certain meal. You become attracted to the meal because you love how eating it tastes and makes you feel. Therefore, whenever you eat that meal, you have a positive experience. 
  * If you didn’t like the meal or feel any attraction toward it, you wouldn’t eat it. And if you did eat it, you would feel nothing or have a negative experience. 



This relationship is the essence of giving and receiving. And giving and receiving are the two main elements of the law of attraction.

### Like Attracts Like

When you give love, you receive love. It’s that simple. **The law of attraction dictates that whatever energy you put into the world is the energy that will come back to you.** In simpler terms, what you give is returned in equal measure to you. You put positivity into the world and get positivity back. Likewise, you put negativity in the world, and guess what you get back? That’s right—negativity.

Think about it this way:

  * When you yell at someone, do they respond with love?
  * When you complain about dinner, does it taste delicious?
  * When you criticize the world around you, do you live a satisfying life?



The answer to all those questions is “probably not.” **When you express yourself negatively, you close the door to positivity.**

#### The Power of Thoughts and Feelings

So how do you know when you’re giving positivity versus negativity? Check your thoughts and feelings, for these are the aspects through which you express the force of love.

**Thoughts:** Your life is created through the things you think. If you think today is going to be a hard day, it will be a hard day. If you think life is wonderful, life will be wonderful. You express what you think either as words in your mind or spoken language.

  * Your thoughts create a positive or negative energy. Positive thoughts are about what you love. Negative thoughts are about what you don’t love. Because you can only attract the same type of energy back, whether you think about what you love or don’t love determines what type of life circumstances you’ll experience. 
  * If you believe you’ll find love and think about love positively, the universe has no choice but to bring you circumstances that support your positive ideals of love. 
  * If you grumble or obsess about not having enough money, you’re telling the universe you have a negative relationship with money. All that can be returned to you are situations that support your negative relationship with money. 
  * **You’re a magnet, and your thoughts create the landscape by which things are drawn to you.** Think positively about what you want to create a positive life.



**Feelings:** Your thoughts are not isolated groups of words. They carry emotional attachments, and the attached feelings are what give your thoughts power. When you think positive thoughts, you feel good. When you think negative thoughts, you feel bad.

  * When you think about what you want in life, you can choose to feel positively or negatively about it. **Whatever feelings you attach to the thought is the energy that will surround your thought.**
  * If you think your job is boring but focus on what you love about it, such as the ability to support your family or the experience you’re gaining for the future, your feelings about work are positive. You will experience more joy because your positive feelings will attract positive circumstances to help you find more love.
  * If you think your job is boring and feel frustrated or unfulfilled, you create a life where work is frustrating or unfulfilling. 



It’s impossible to feel good about negative things or negative about positive things. **Focus on the feeling of love in every situation, and you will bring more love into your life.**

### How to Think Positively

Each day, you’re tasked with doing or addressing a variety of things. Some will be good, and some will be bad. If you think or talk about the bad things more than the good things, you will feel negatively about your day. Those negative feelings will continue to attract more things that create struggle in your day until you change your focus.

**Focus on positive things as often as possible.** No action is too small to celebrate:

  * Did someone make space for you in traffic? 
  * Did an interview go well? 
  * Did you eat at your favorite restaurant? 
  * Did something good happen in the world? 
  * Are you happy to be healthy? 
  * Were you successful in paying a bill? 
  * Did you meet someone new you liked? 



Focus on the good things to feel good. Feeling good is how you give love, and when you give love, you will start to experience more good things.

This is the cycle of the law of attraction and the role love plays within it. **There are no limits to what you can achieve because there are no limits to love.** Focus on the thoughts that enliven your love force, feel positively about those thoughts, and watch the world lay more to love at your feet.
