## Chapter 9: Love and Your Life

Everything in life has a unique frequency—words, sounds, animals, plants, food, locations, items, _you_ , and every other element in the universe. When you are presented with the frequency of something else, you have the choice to link to it positively or negatively or not link to it at all by turning away. Whatever you decide is your choice, but you’re no longer ignorant about how to attain what you want in life.

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use _The Power_ successfully and become the love magnet you were born to be. It really is as simple as finding a way to experience more joy on a daily basis. **Keep that joyful feeling flowing, and everything you need to stay joyful will come to you.** Life is magical, and once you discover that, it will open up to you in miraculous ways.

### Open the Lines of Communication With Intention

Imagine your life as a movie playing on your television. Now imagine you get a phone call or text while you’re watching your life movie. When you answer the call or text and look back up, you’ve missed part of the scene or story. This same thing happens when you walk around your life distracted by errant thoughts or negativity.

If you aren’t alert to what’s happening in your life, you won’t see the many opportunities life presents to you to change your life. There is no such thing as happenstance. Remember, life is a catalogue of options for you to love or skip. But **if you don’t see the item when it’s right in front of you, you’ve missed your chance to choose love**.

If you’re alert to life, you can use the options presented as clues to what frequency you’re on.

  * When you drive past a police car, you can assume you’re on the same frequency as the police car. But is there a deeper meaning to that frequency? Is life telling you to slow down? Is there some part of your life that is defying order? 
  * When you hear an ambulance drive by, are you being reminded of your good health and, therefore, triggered to show gratitude? Is it a sign that some part of your life needs immediate attention?
  * When you overhear a conversation at the coffee shop, do you realize you’re supposed to hear that conversation? Is there something being said that you’re meant to hear? 
  * When you hear a song on the radio, do you listen for the significance in your life? Do you believe that you’re meant to hear that song because it is communicating with you?



Only you can understand the significance of the frequencies you come across on a daily basis. **Stay alert to life and be open to everything presented to you. You will receive information that is vital to your happiness.** Life is constantly sending you messages about your life. Pay attention and receive all the answers you need to increase the power of love in your heart.

#### Use Symbols to Represent Good and Bad Frequencies

The force of love is invisible, so it can be hard to know when you’re tipping the scales of your feelings toward it or away from it. **Attach a symbol to the force of love to help alert you when you’re on a good frequency.** This symbol can be anything you want. You just have to love it and designate it as your sign of love. For instance, you might love a certain kind of flower. If you make that flower your symbol, every time you see that flower or something that reminds you of that flower, you know the force of love is working through you.

You can also make something your warning symbol for when you’re on a negative frequency. When you see or hear this symbol, you know something is not right in your world and that you need to be aware of it.

A symbol is a great way to communicate with life, but you can also look at the small ways that life tries to reach you even without a symbol:

  * When you find a lucky penny, money in the laundry, or a letter from an old friend, you can take those as signs of your positive frequency. 
  * When you break something, lose something, trip, or get a tear in your clothes, life is warning you to change your frequency for the better. 



**The more you communicate with life, the more success you will have in staying on a positive frequency with the force of love.**

#### The Anatomy of a Happy Life

When you form an intimate relationship with love, you experience the greatest pleasure in the world. The following description is an example of how you can create an everlasting bond with love and experience that pleasure daily.

**In the morning:**

  * **Show gratitude for your life every morning you wake up** , and spend a few minutes feeling love for yourself and the world. 
  * Imagine the day ahead and show it love. Think of all the things that will happen today and show them love. Another way of saying this is to stack the deck of your day by harnessing the force of love for everything before things happen. 
  * Show gratitude for each thing you touch in the morning: your food, your clothes, and your family.



**Throughout the day:**

  * Imagine arriving home safely before you leave the house, and say thank you for the house you have to come home to. 
  * **Acknowledge the people you pass and send them love.** Imagine them receiving your love and what they need as a result. 
  * Say thank you for good parking spots or good songs on the radio. 
  * Ask questions to make sure you are on the right frequency. Questions like, “Am I doing the right things today?” “What will help me feel even better?” and “Where is my love and gratitude needed today?” will trigger the law of attraction to respond. 
    * When you ask a question, you give a question, and the answer will return to you. But you must be aware enough to see the answer when it comes. You never know how answers will show up in your life.
    * If something difficult or upsetting happens to you, ask what you did to attract it. When you discover the answer, you will learn what you need to do differently in the future. 
  * Throw your love around the world like confetti. **Be grateful for everything you can, and give love away whenever you have the chance.** Look for the good in all situations so you can tip the scales toward love. 



**In the evening:**

  * Give thanks for making it through another day.
  * Give thanks for the love you felt and gave during the day.
  * Show love for the restful sleep you will have.
  * Be grateful for the coming morning and the joy you will feel waking up to another beautiful day. 



Live each day alert and connected to love, and your life will grow with abundance.

#### Ask Love for Assistance

There is no limit to what love can do for you. There is only a limit in what you allow love to do for you. Need to be reminded to send someone a birthday card? Ask love to remind you. Need a personal trainer? Ask love to help you find the right fitness plan. Need a matchmaker? Ask love to find you a mate.

Love will assist you with whatever you need, but it only works if you’re full of the force of love. **You must relinquish control of your life and allow love to do its thing.** Trust in love to guide your life, and you will be guided to everything you want.

### Be Mindful of How You Label Life

Think of the things that come into your life as newborn babies. Babies aren’t born good or bad. They are neutral until that first moment of nurturing takes over. The same is true for all aspects of your life. **Nothing is good or bad until you deem it so.**

  * A snowstorm is only bad if you think of it that way. 
  * A relationship is good if you consider it to be good. 
  * A job is awful if that’s what you want it to be. 



Granted, bad things happen. You get hurt or victimized in some way, but the long-term label you place on that experience is how it will exist for your entire life.

There is no opposing force of love. Negativity does not come from a negative force but from a lack of love. The same is true for depression, failure, and disease. These things are created by a lack of joy, success, and health, all things bathed in love.

You don’t have to wonder if the force of negativity is working against you. **If you experience negative circumstances, you're lacking love in your heart. Change your feelings immediately by finding ways to boost good feelings.**

### Heaven on Earth

When you live fully with the force of love, you experience heaven on Earth. Your heart and soul are hard-wired for the highest frequency of love in your body. When you die and leave behind your human form, you enter a new life as the embodiment of pure love. You become your highest being of love, and you can communicate with the living through that love frequency, even from different planes of existence.

But you are not meant to suffer on Earth and only achieve heaven after you die. You can experience heaven now because heaven is within you as pure love. **Heaven is your highest frequency, so live your life full of pure love and joy, and you’ll be in heaven on Earth.**

#### Space, Time, and Life’s Purpose

You can experience everything you want because you have endless time to do so. This world and this dimension are not the only planes of existence in the universe. There are galaxies and other states of consciousness you can’t imagine, but you will get to experience them one day. And you will have endless adventures once you do.

Like the universe, there’s so much more to you than you know. You are a special being with a powerful tool at your disposal to help you experience pure happiness—the ability to give. **When you give, you’re saying you have enough to share, and you always have enough because the most significant thing you can give is love.**

Whether you give positivity, support, enthusiasm, passion, or friendship, love is at the heart of all of it. The love you give outweighs any material gift because your love is everlasting and life-changing. When you give the gift of love, you not only draw more love and abundance to yourself, but you give someone else the tools to draw more love to their life.

Give love to fulfill your mission in life.**You will never run out of love if you continue to give it freely.** In contrast, if you don’t give love, you can never get love back in return. Your life will be difficult as the wrong people and circumstances come into it, one after the other, until you stop the cycle with love.

Every time you choose to show love for someone or something, you add more positivity to the world. Your light shines brighter, and all the good you can imagine will be drawn to it. You have the power within you to change your life. You ARE the Power.

Your life is about to begin.
