## Chapter 5: Unlock Your Power

Unlock your power with three “Keys” to strengthen the force of love within you: Love, Gratitude, and Play.

### Key 1: Love

To exude greater love in your life, love everything in life with great passion. Approach loving life like you would love a romantic partner. Hold that love and multiply it to the _n_ th degree until love oozes from your body and soul. **Show deep and constant love for all that life has to offer to remove restrictions on your life** , whether financial, personal, physical, or emotional.

When you love life with all your heart, you glow with love. People will notice and feel your powerful energy. All facets of life will open up to you, and you will be a force field against any negative feelings that come your way. When you’re full of love, you have the power of a superhero.

#### Your Courtship With Life

Have you ever heard the phrase, “Love is blind”? It means that you’ve fallen so deeply in love with someone that all you see is more to love. That is how you must fall in love with life. **You must be enamored with life in such a way that everything you see becomes beautiful.**

Look around your world to find things to love. You can love the technology you own, houses in your neighborhood, certain streets, types of food, or shops and restaurants. Set the intention to identify things you love when you’re out in the world. When you’re walking down a street, acknowledge the trees, people, animals, sky, smells, and sounds of nature. Think about how much you love these things. Say the words out loud. Talk about what you love to really feel it.

  * Talk about how much you love your family, your home, or your job.
  * Tell people how much you love them and which things you love the most. 
  * Talk about how much you love when certain things happen, like receiving a drawing from your child, a phone call from an old friend, or a compliment. 
  * Talk about how much you love other people’s happiness.
  * Talk about how much you love the life you have: a glass of wine in the backyard, a body that is fit and healthy, or a farmer’s market or street fair in your community. 
  * Talk about places you love, like cities, stores, or countries.
  * Talk about activities you love, like sports, shopping, or dancing. 



**Make a list of all the things you love to help you feel more love, especially if you’re feeling bad.** Specify all the things you love to lift your spirits and fill your glass to the rim. Make this list once a month. After acknowledging and speaking about what you love becomes a habit, shift to making your list every three months. Whatever you need to do to keep loving life is best for you.

#### Drive Your Mind Toward Love

There’s so much to love, but if you’re not aware of your world or surroundings, you’ll miss all of it. Remember all those thoughts you have on a daily basis? Your mind is constantly activated with thoughts, so much so, you don’t always know it’s happening. Think about the last time you drove a few miles down a road without realizing it. Your brain is so powerful, it operated on autopilot when it was engaged in thought. **If you walk through life on autopilot distracted by random thoughts, you won’t stop to acknowledge what there is to love.**

One way to stay alert to love is to pose questions to your mind about what it sees. Engage your mind with the pursuit of love, and it won’t be able to think about anything else. Ask your mind what it sees and loves. Tell it to count the number of things it sees and loves. The more you engage your mind with these types of questions, the more you guide its behavior. You will control what it’s thinking about, and if it’s thinking about love, you’ll feel more love.

**Make the intention to be alert to love and take control of your thoughts so you can increase the amount of love you feel.** Your days will become filled with all the love you can find. And as those days turn into more tomorrows, you will create a life that you truly love.

### Key 2: Gratitude

There is no greater form of love than gratitude. **When you show gratitude, you give love, which means you will receive love in return.** You can be grateful for anything in life, big or small.

  * Show gratitude for your home, the food in your refrigerator, a new pair of boots, a stable income, or a beautiful sunrise. 
  * Be grateful for your health and happiness, experiences, and friends and partners. 
  * Be grateful you’re alive.



You show gratitude by simply saying, “Thank you.” That’s it.

The key to gratitude is to focus on what you are grateful for and think of all the reasons why. Say them in your mind. Say them out loud. If it’s a person, tell them why you are grateful for them. Even if they’re not with you physically, talk to them as if they are.

#### The Compounding Effect of Gratitude

The gratitude you show, even for the tiniest things, adds up to equal a lot of love. **Give love through gratitude, and receive more to be grateful about.** As you continue to show gratitude, the cycle continues.

  * If you show gratitude for your finances, big or small, you will be rewarded with more financial stability to be grateful for. 
  * If you show gratitude for your spouse or partner, your relationship with them will improve. 



There are three ways to use gratitude to give love and receive what you want back.

  1. Show gratitude for what you’ve been given in the past.
  2. Show gratitude for what you have in your life now.
  3. Show gratitude for what you will receive in the future.



If you aren’t grateful for the life you’ve lived and are currently living, you’re not expressing love for your life. You couldn’t be where you are today without yesterday, and you can’t be where you’ll be tomorrow without today. Say thank you for the life you have, and say thank you for the life to come. **Show gratitude as though you’ve already received the life you want, and the law of attraction will respond in kind.**

#### Be Thankful Daily

Show a little bit of gratitude if you only want your life to change a little bit. But show gratitude throughout each day, and the rewards will be immense. The rewards of gratitude are not merely what the law of attraction brings back to you. Gratitude breeds love, and love is what destroys negativity.

Even at your worst moment, you can always find something good to show gratitude for. **Every small “thank you” adds love to your life because the sensation of gratitude is the antidote to bad feelings.** You can’t feel bad when you’re grateful. Reach for whatever gratitude you can find in dark times to help your light shine brighter.

Look for more opportunities to feel gratitude every day to keep the negative feelings away. When you get a good seat at the movies, rockstar parking, or a seat on a crowded bus, say thank you. And if you can’t find something in the external world, show gratitude for your personal attributes. Your ability to see, hear, walk, laugh, touch, feel, and breathe are all blessings. Your endurance and fortitude are gifts. Your mind is a gift.

Finally, show gratitude for the world around you. Your city, state, and country were built by people who worked under harsh and strenuous conditions. Thank them for this world. Someone gave us the gift of electricity, motor vehicles, and music. Thank them. Thank the people who built roads, maintained open spaces, and protected the water ways. They are deserving of thanks.

Be grateful for everything you can every day. **Be grateful when things are good as well as bad.** It’s the simplest gift you can give to the world and your life.

### Key 3: Play

It was easy to play when you were a kid. You didn’t have adult concerns or responsibilities to get in the way of your mind taking flight with imagination. You made up games and daydreamed about adventures and your future. You have fun when you play, and life is supposed to be fun. **You need to remember how to play like a child as an adult to bring fun back to your life.**

Pretend or make-believe are great games to play to imagine a life you want. And the best part is that the law of attraction makes no judgments about what it receives. It just picks up your love frequency and returns what you give it. Whether you play “make-believe” or seriously focus on a goal, the result is the same, so why not have fun while you’re at it?

#### Minds Games

**Use your imagination to build fantasies about what your life could be.** If you want to be an astronaut, pretend you’re on a spaceship flying toward Mars. Talk to your friends and family like they’re mission control. If you can fashion a space suit, even better. Props add life to your imaginary scenes. Walk around as if you were an astronaut, and feel the joy and love of living your dream. That picture must be returned to you in some way.

> **The King of California**
> 
> Arnold Schwarzenegger grew up in a small Austrian community. His family didn’t have much money, but he still had big dreams. He wanted to have the best body in the world and be an actor in Hollywood.
> 
> Arnold used pictures of superheroes to inform his imagination of what he wanted his body to look like. He envisioned that body and pretended he won the European body-building championships. He imagined coming to America and becoming a famous movie star. He felt what it would be like to be adored and successful.
> 
> Through his youthful make-believe games, Arnold sent the love frequencies of his dreams to the universe. The law of attraction picked up the frequencies and gave him the people, circumstances, and events that led to his dreams. He won Mr. Olympia seven times, starred in several blockbuster movies, and became the governor of California, all because he dared to dream big.

**When you play games with your imagination, really get into character. Act like you are already that person, and play the part.**

  * If you want a better body, imagine what it would feel like to have that body. See yourself with that body in your mind. Walk and talk like you would if you had that body.
  * If you want to be an inventor, pretend to invent things. Imagine building great inventions in your mind, even if they seem unreal. 
    * Nikola Tesla had no reason to believe that laser beams would be a thing, but he imagined them, and so they became real. 



It doesn’t matter how big or far off in the future the life you want is. Your dreams are just an imagination away, waiting to be brought to you. Act like you have what you want now, and watch as your life changes.

**If you do not receive what you want right away, check your mind and heart.** Did you imagine what you wanted but didn’t really believe you could get it? Did you truly surround it with love to magnetize it? The time it takes for you to get on the love frequency is the time it will take for your desires to be granted. Feel your desire now to jump on board the right frequency.
