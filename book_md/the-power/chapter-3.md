## Chapter 3: The Three-Step Process of Creation

Now that you know how your feelings and thoughts create your life, you need to learn how to use them to get what you want. **To attain specific goals in your life, you must follow these three-steps: Imagining, Feeling, and Receiving.** This process can also be used to change something you don’t like.

The first step is to use your mind to imagine what your heart desires. Then, feel the love of doing what you want and having what you want. After you imagine and feel love for what you want, all you have to do is receive what you want. Feel that what you want is yours and show love for it.

To test out the Creation Process and gain confidence using it, try manifesting something small—a flower or book. Use your imagination to see it, feel the love of having it, and then receive it. When you receive it, you will truly believe in the law of attraction and can start using it to benefit your life.

In the following sections, we’ll dive deeper into the steps of Imagining and Feeling to help you use the process to its full potential to Receive.

### Step 1: Imagine Your Life as You Want It

You can have anything you want if you can imagine it and love it. What you imagine must be from a place of love if you want to receive a positive result. Imagining something that brings negativity to another is not coming from a place of love. Your focus is on harm, and that harm is mirrored back to you.

Your imagination has no limits, and neither should you. The most incredible or fantastic thing you can imagine is possible when the force of love is working for you. **Love knows no bounds, so reach as high as you want.**

Famous scientists, athletes, and inventors all reached for the stars and succeeded simply because they didn’t let the limitations of their current world scare them. They broke through with their imagination and changed their lives and, in some cases, the world.

  * Think about Bill Gates in the garage building Microsoft. He didn’t let the fact that a computer operating system had never been created stop him. He imagined his dream and made it a reality. 



Everything you have and are now was imagined by you. If you imagined the life you wanted, you’re probably happy right now. The problem is that many people focus on what they _don’t_ have. They feel resentment, despair, or fear about their lives. **Because the law of attraction is a mirror and not a psychoanalyst, that resentment, despair, and fear is sent back as circumstances or events that lead to an unhappy life.**

Look at your current life to see where you need to adjust your thoughts to create better feelings.

> **The Missing Dog**
> 
> Byrne and her family lived in a home that backed up to the mountains. One night, their dog, Cabbie, escaped through a hole in the fence. She and her daughter assumed Cabbie had wandered into the mountains and went to search for him.
> 
> They searched for hours, even in the dark. Byrne felt her anxiety rising. She knew those feelings were not the ones that would bring Cabbie home, so she said they should go home and change their energy.
> 
> They used their imagination to see Cabbie safely at home and unharmed. They imagined him walking down the hall for dinner. They put food in his bowl. They imagined his collar bell ringing. They called out for Cabbie like he was there. When they went to bed, the daughter imagined Cabbie sleeping in her room like usual.
> 
> The next day, they found an alert about a found dog in the mountains. Sure enough, it was Cabbie. They picked Cabbie up and brought him home safely, just like they’d imagined.

#### Your Desires Are Not Original

It is not possible for your imagination to go off the rails and imagine something that doesn’t exist. Everything is already created. If it weren’t, you couldn’t imagine it. You may not be able to see what you want in the current world, but that doesn’t mean it’s not out there somewhere. **To bring a seemingly impossible desire to fruition, call it forth through your imagination.**

  * Imagine the lifestyle, home, job, and relationship you want. 
  * Imagine what it would be like if your job was everything you wanted it to be. Imagine what getting a promotion looks like. 
  * Imagine what your relationship would be like if your partner was everything you wanted them to be. Imagine the future you want together. 



Use all of your senses to make the imagination more real. Smell it, taste it, hear the sounds of that life, and feel the things that life brings to your world.

  * Imagine what taking a trip to Paris would be like. See the Eiffel Tower lit up at night. Hear the chatter at sidewalk cafes. Feel the spray from the Seine River on your face. Taste the coffee and pastries. Feel the cobblestone streets under your feet. Imagine yourself in Paris so you can be given the mirror image of you in Paris. 



Use props to make your imaginations come to life. **Props can bolster the image you have in your mind and give you something tangible to focus on.**

  * Place pictures of what you want around the home.
  * Buy or wear the type of clothes that fit the life you want.
  * Make space in your garage for the new car you want.
  * Set out an extra place serving at dinner for the partner you want.
  * Open a savings account for the money you want.
  * Put out hangers in your closet for the new clothes you want. 



As soon as you imagine what you want, you’ve created it. The world where you don’t have what you want no longer exists. You have imagined it; now feel the love of having it.

### Step 2: Feel Yourself Living the Life You Want

You know that feelings are what magnetizes your thoughts into frequencies that call on the law of attraction. But how do they do that?

Each of us has a magnetic field surrounding our bodies at all times. Maybe you’ve heard this field described as an aura or halo. This constant force around you is what brings things to your life. And your feelings dictate whether that field is positively charged or negatively charged.

**You add love to your magnetic field each time you give love through your words, thoughts, or actions.** The more love you give, the stronger the love vibration of your field is. And when your field is activated with love, it becomes powerful enough to attract love back.

Over time, if you consistently give love, your magnetic field will become so powerful that you can shift the law of attraction into high gear. With this increased power, the Creation Process will happen so fast, you’re able to receive what you imagined and feel instantaneously.

#### Activate the Magic of Love

**The only barrier to you achieving an outlandish or distant goal is your belief that what you want is too big to attain.** That thought creates feelings of difficulty. You’re saying, “This is too hard to get and will take a long time.” And if you say that, you’ll be right.

But your idea of _big_ differs greatly from what is possible for the force of love. You may desire a new car, a trip to Italy, a house full of children, perfect health, true love, or your dream job. You may even desire to run your own company, win an Oscar, or publish a book. **Whatever you want, no matter how big an achievement it is, imagine that it’s as small as a dot because that’s what it is for the force of love.**

  * Draw a large circle, and place a dot in the middle. Write your desire outside the circle and draw a line to the dot. 
  * Look at this dot whenever you think about what you want to see how small of an accomplishment it actually is for the force of love. 



Try imagining what you want for several minutes each day. Sit with your imagination and picture what you want with all your senses. Feel the joy of having what you want. Stay in that moment until you truly feel what you want is yours, as though you could write your name on it.

  * Certain desires will be easy to imagine, and you might reach this level in two days. 
  * Other desires will be harder to accept as yours, and the process will take longer. That is when seeing your desire as a dot can come in handy.



Once you’ve sat with your desire and felt the love of having it, your work is done for the day. For the rest of it, **give as much love as you can whenever you can to ramp up your magnetic abilities**.

#### Ridding Your Life of the Negative

You can rid your life of negative things using the same process you would to manifest positive things. If you have a negative situation or experience in your life, recognize that this experience was born from a lack of love. Imagine the opposite of whatever the situation or experience is to project love.

You can’t wish the negativity away. **Creation is the process of creating, not reducing. Something positive must be created to replace the negative.** Rather than focusing on what you don’t want, imagine what you want, and create it through positive feelings. Give love to receive love.

Let’s say you’ve suffered an injury that causes you great pain and is not getting better. Your focus is probably on how much pain you’re in and your frustration with the slow recovery. This strengthens the negative because you are giving out negative feelings.

Instead, focus on being pain-free and making a full recovery. Imagine your body as healed. See yourself recovered. Feel the joy of those things, and amplify your magnetic field by giving love to all the good things in your life. When you imagine good health and feel love for it, you create a frequency of good health that must be returned to you.

**Never contradict the feeling of having what you want.** You’ve done the work to create a new world. Even if you haven’t received what you’ve imagined yet, you’ve still changed your world to one where you have it. If you shift back to a focus of not having what you want yet, you’ve shifted your desire to a new frequency, and the old world returns.

  * If you’ve done the work to imagine a full recovery from your injury, move forward with that truth.
  * When someone asks how you’re doing, say something full of love. Say, “I’m feeling good, and my body is healing” or “I’m grateful to be on my way to good health and for this chance to appreciate the power of my body.” Don’t say, “It still hurts a lot” or “Better but not great.” 



You can’t speak of something in a negative way without eliciting a negative feeling. **Be aware of attaching bad feelings to your words. Change them quickly to get back on the good frequency.**

#### How to Change Bad Feelings

Just like you can’t wish away negative situations, you can’t wish away bad feelings. And whether you like it or not, you need bad feelings. Without them, you wouldn’t be able to recognize the good feelings as good. When you feel happy, you know you do because you compare it to times when you feel sad. So **bad feelings are just as valid as good feelings. It’s the way you approach the bad feelings that matters**.

If you feel bad about feeling bad, you attract more bad feelings to you. Each bad feeling attracts more and more until all the bad is piled up. When this happens, turn your feelings toward love to make the bad feelings vanish.

Think of your feelings like a glass of water. Love is the water, and your body is the glass.

  * When you feel bad, your glass is more empty than filled. Therefore, your body is more empty of love than filled with love. 
  * Being mad at the lack of water or trying to resist or ignore the emptiness doesn’t change the level of water. The only way to get rid of the emptiness is to put more water in the glass. 



Likewise, **add more love to your body to fill it to the top. Then, the bad feelings will be gone.**

If this still sounds too complicated, try assigning an image to bad feelings. One example is the image of a horse for each bad feeling. Imagine a bitter horse, a sad horse, a frustrated horse, an irritable horse, or a disappointed horse. Imagine the stable where these horses live. When you feel bitter, imagine climbing onto the bitter horse. If you can climb on this horse, you can climb off of it. See yourself dismounting the horse and leading it back to the stable.

If someone else is expressing their irritability, you don’t have to meet them in that negative space. Imagine them climbing onto the irritable horse. This will help you put their negativity into perspective and keep you from taking it personally and attaching bad feelings to it. And maybe picturing yourself or others bucking around on bitter and irritable horses will be humorous, and laughter is a wonderful way to fill your glass with love.

You can’t decide to never have another bad feeling. But **you can decide to throw love at the bad, and if you can do that, you can change your mood and your life**.

### Step 3: Receive Your New Life

After you’ve imagined what you want and felt the joy of having that thing, all you have to do is receive it. **Trust that once you create the positive frequency for your desire and magnetize it with love, it will be yours.** The law of attraction will shift the universe to bring you the people, circumstances, and events that support your desire and the life you want.

Don’t deviate from your positive frequency by doubting whether you will really get what you want. Doubt interjects negative feelings, and your frequency has suddenly changed. The bonds are created the moment you think of your desire and feel the joy of having it. Believe and move forward confidently toward the life where you have what you want.

Feel your desire deep in your heart. That is the only way to activate the law of attraction to bring it to you. Keep your desires positive and feelings good to receive positive and good things. If what you desire brings harm to another person, those negative feelings will bring back harm, rather than the thing you desire.
