## Chapters 1-4: What Is Emotional Intelligence?

Human beings possess three defining characteristics: cognitive intelligence (IQ), personality, and emotional intelligence (EQ):

  * **Cognitive Intelligence (IQ)** is how well you can learn new information.
  * **Personality** is your preferences and traits such as introversion and extroversion.
  * **Emotional Intelligence (EQ)** is your ability to recognize your emotions, recognize the emotions of those around you, and use this awareness to guide your behavior and develop strong relationships.



For many years, people have correlated cognitive intelligence (IQ) with success in the workplace. However, **workers with the highest IQs rarely outperform their colleagues with average IQs.** In fact, people with average IQs outperform those with high IQs 70% of the time. If IQ is not a determining factor of success in the workplace, what is? **Research now points to EQ.**

### Why Is EQ Important?

**Reason #1: EQ helps you process your emotions.** You have emotional responses to almost everything you experience in your day-to-day life. Though many of your responses may seem minor, they’re important because your reactions develop into patterns of behavior.

Your brain is designed to prioritize emotions. Any time you interact with anything in the world, electrical signals travel through your body to the brain. Once these signals reach the brain, they first travel through the limbic system, the brain’s emotional center, on their journey to the frontal lobe, the brain’s logical center. Therefore, before you can have a rational thought, you have to process your emotions.

**Reason #2: EQ helps you manage triggers and avoid emotional hijacking.** Triggers are events that produce a significant emotional response. When this response controls your behavior, it’s known as an emotional hijacking:

  * Facing a burglar may cause temporary paralysis.
  * Winning the lottery may make your knees buckle.
  * Hearing a loud noise may make you jump.



Emotional hijacking clouds your judgement and does not give your rational brain the chance to inform your decisions. High EQ skills allow you to recognize your triggers and avoid or effectively handle them.

(Shortform note: Read more about emotional hijacking and the importance of EQ in our summary of Daniel Goleman’s Emotional Intelligence here.)

**Reason #3: EQ helps you control your thoughts and develop healthy habits.** You don’t have direct control over your emotions, especially when something triggers them. However, you do have control over your thoughts. You can calm yourself down and handle your emotions by thinking about perspective, timing, and other EQ skills.

**Reason #4: EQ helps you succeed.** High EQ develops skills that directly correlate to success (such as navigating complex situations and keeping calm under pressure). One study found that:

  * EQ directly relates to 58% of skill sets in the workplace.
  * People with higher EQs make an average of $29,000 more per year than those with low EQs.
  * 90% of high-achievers had a high EQ.



### Building EQ

Though both IQ and personality develop in early childhood and don’t change throughout one’s lifetime,**you can develop EQ through practice and persistence.** Much like a muscle when you work out, the brain creates new neural pathways when you practice EQ skills. Though you may feel challenged at first, persistence will make practicing emotional intelligence easier and habitual.

For example, if someone makes you angry, you may currently have the urge to scream. At first, you’ll struggle to use your EQ skills to resist the urge. However, if you use these skills long enough, they’ll eventually develop into habits, and you’ll no longer be tempted to blow up.

#### Personal Competence and Social Competence

You can build EQ by developing two different competencies: **personal competence and social competence.**

First, you need to develop personal competence. **Personal competence is your ability to manage your own emotions and tendencies.** There are two steps to personal competence: **self-awareness and self-management.**

Once you’ve developed personal competence, the next step in developing a higher EQ is social competence.**Social competence is your ability to interact with people effectively.** There are two steps to develop social competence:**social awareness and relationship management.**

Each step builds upon the previous one. Each chapter will cover one of the four steps and will give you tactics to help you implement them into your day-to-day life.

> **Fun Facts about EQ:**
> 
>   * The average EQ of working people in the United States increased by 3-4% between 2003-2008, when EQ became a focus of America’s workforce (with the only dip in growth occurring in 2008, likely due to the economic recession). This shows that awareness and development of EQ skills yield significant results.
> 
>   * On average, CEOs have the lowest EQ in the workplace while middle management typically has the highest. This is because CEOs and higher-level management tend to interact with their workforce less than middle management.
> 
>   * Chinese workers tend to have a higher EQ than American workers. This is because business leaders in China tend to make business personal by scheduling dinners with their employees, having meetings to talk with their employees about their personal lives, and setting an example on how to connect with colleagues.
> 
>   * A 2003 study showed that women typically have better self-management, social awareness, and relationship management skills. The only EQ area where men typically do better than women is self-awareness. Since then, men have caught up in self-management, but still lag behind women in both facets of social competence. This is likely due to the fact that, until recently, men have been told that their emotions are signs of weakness instead of important tools.
> 
>   * Younger people tend to have lower self-management scores than older people. This is because experience comes with age. The more experience you have, the better equipped you are to handle your emotions.
