## Exercise: Make an Emotion vs. Reason List

Differentiating between your emotional and rational brain will help you discover the best route forward when faced with a difficult situation. Use this exercise to make the distinction and clarify your decision-making process.

* * *

Think of an issue you're currently experiencing that requires you to make a decision. Describe it.

What is your emotional brain telling you to do? List your options.

What is your rational brain telling you to do? List your options.

Compare the two lists you just made. How are your emotions clouding your rationality? Where is your rationality ignoring important cues from your emotions?
