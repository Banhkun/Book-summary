## Exercise: Make the Right Impact

Good intentions and positive impact don’t always align. Make sure that your intention leads to the desired impact.

* * *

Think of a recent situation in which your good intentions ended up worsening a situation. This could be anything from a mistimed joke to an unclear objective. Describe your intention, the action(s) that you took, and the resulting impact.

What do you know about the situation now that you didn’t know then? Did you gain any new information or recognize any missed cues? Think about reading the room and respecting the emotions of others. Make a list of these discoveries.

If you could handle the situation all over again, what would you do differently? Describe it.

What can you apply from this situation to future situations?
