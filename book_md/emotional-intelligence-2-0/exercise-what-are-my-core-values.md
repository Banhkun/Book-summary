## Exercise: What Are My Core Values?

Knowing your core values allows you to make rational decisions based upon your beliefs rather than in-the-moment reactions. Use this exercise to solidify your core values and identify behaviors that go against your beliefs.

* * *

What are the core values that guide you? Examples of core values include: showing compassion, being a dependable colleague, putting your family first, fighting for your friends, pursuing your passion, and so on. List 2-5 of your core values.

Now, think about a recent time when you acted or spoke in a way that you're not proud of. Describe it.

Compare this event to your core values. Does your action reflect what you believe? If not, how could you have approached the situation differently to align your actions with your beliefs?
