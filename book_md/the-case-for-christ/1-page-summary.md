## 1-Page Summary

In _The Case for Christ_ , Yale Law School graduate and former _Chicago Tribune_ legal-affairs reporter Lee Strobel approaches the history of Jesus Christ as though it were a story he was reporting on. He isolates the most important aspects of Jesus’s life and death—His biography, His divinity, His resurrection—and consults world-renowned experts in those aspects to determine their truth. A long-time religious skeptic, Strobel begins the book as an atheist; by the end, overwhelmed by the amount of evidence in favor of faith, Strobel is reborn as a follower of Christ.

In course of the book, Strobel visits 14 scholars with an array of expertise—in philosophy, archaeology, psychology, medicine, history, and theology—and subjects them to the same kind of cross-examination he might have used on a witness in a court of law. The results of his investigation are these:

##### 1\. The Biographies of Jesus (the Gospels) Can Be Trusted

Whereas Strobel once thought the gospels were legends concocted by biased authors, his conversation with Craig Blomberg, a scholar of the New Testament, confirms that **the gospels bear all the markings of trustworthy eyewitness accounts** : Their contradictions concern only small details; and even the gospel writers’ contemporary critics took much of Jesus’s story, including the working of miracles, for granted. If the central events of Jesus’s life weren’t contested in the years after his death, there’s no reason to question them today.

##### 2\. The Biographies of Jesus Stand Up under Close Examination

It has long been noted that the gospels of the New Testament don’t all tell the same story, and some skeptics have latched onto that phenomenon to call Jesus’s reality into question. However, the fact that the gospels harmonize on all the major points while diverging on minor ones suggests that (a) the gospels are reliable and (b) **the overall contours of Jesus’s story are factually accurate**. Also, Christianity couldn’t have thrived in Jerusalem—as it did almost immediately after Jesus’s death—if the gospels had been exaggerated: **Everyone would have known the gospel authors were lying**.

##### 3\. The Text of Jesus’s Biographies Hasn’t Been Amended or Adulterated by Later Authors

Strobel’s interview with Bruce Metzger, a Princeton professor specializing in the textual history of the New Testament, confirms that the documents on which the New Testament is based **date to an extremely early period in the Church and are authentic**. This finding answers the suspicion that Jesus’s supernatural activities were added to the Gospels after the fact to establish his divinity.

##### 4\. Secular Sources Attest to Jesus’s Existence

Many believe the only textual source for Jesus’s existence is the Bible itself, but Strobel’s investigation proves otherwise. **In fact, there is more historical evidence for Jesus’s existence than for many historical personages whose reality we take for granted**. And not only his existence: Secular sources, like Josephus’s _Testimonium Flavianum_ and Tacitus’s writings, attest to Jesus’s ability to perform miracles as well as his crucifixion and his early followers’ belief in his Resurrection.

##### 5\. The Archaeological Record Corroborates Jesus’s Biographies as Well

No archeological finding has disproved the New Testament, and **Luke’s gospel has proven especially accurate** , with references to geographical and cultural landmarks later confirmed by archaeological digs in the Middle East.

##### 6\. The Historical Jesus Is the Same as Jesus Christ

The Jesus Seminar, a collective of liberal and radical Christian scholars, has attempted to draw a distinction between a naturalistic Jesus (who really existed) and a mythological Jesus (who only exists in the New Testament). But the Jesus Seminar’s scholars rely on a number of specious sources, such as the Gospel of Thomas, to make their case. **The evidence for the gospels’ account, from secular sources like Josephus to the documentary record of the Christian canon, is far more robust and convincing** than that for the Jesus Seminar’s theories.

##### 7\. Jesus Believed He Was the Son of God

Some skeptics have argued that Jesus didn’t actually believe he was the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. However, the numerous references Jesus makes to his own provenance as a deity and the Messiah confirm **he did in fact believe he was the Christ, sent to redeem the world**. Examples include Jesus’s allusions to the Book of Daniel, wherein the Messiah was “one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven,” and his affirmation of Peter in Matthew 16:15, when Peter names Jesus as the Christ.

##### 8\. There Is No Evidence to Suggest Jesus was Mentally Disturbed

Skeptics of Jesus have claimed he was just a mentally disturbed man whom later peoples have taken all too seriously. However, those with paranoid schizophrenia or other mental illnesses exhibit an array of symptoms beyond delusions of grandeur, including antisociality and trouble expressing emotion. **Jesus exhibited none of these symptoms** , and he supported his claims of divinity by performing independently verified miracles.

##### 9\. Jesus Exhibited All the Traits of God

Although some believe Jesus voluntarily limited his divine powers when he was incarnated, the New Testament shows that he**possessed all the attributes of deity, including omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence**. Key examples include John 16:30 (“Now are we sure that thou knowest all things”), which entails Jesus’s omniscience, and Matthew 28:18 (“All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth”), which indicates Jesus’s omnipotence.

##### 10\. Unlike Claimants Before or Since, Jesus Matched All the Attributes of the Messiah

Old Testament prophets like Isaiah and Micah made a number of predictions about the identity of the Messiah, including minor details like his place of birth and whether he would be buried with no broken bones. The odds that someone could match these prophecies by chance is _infinitesimal_. **Jesus, of course, fit these predictions completely**.

##### 11\. Jesus Died on the Cross

Skeptics of the Resurrection have attempted to explain away Jesus’s “rise” by claiming he never _actually died_ on the cross. Strobel interviews Dr. Alexander Metherell, a biblical scholar and medical doctor, whose medical analysis of Jesus’s brutal beating before the crucifixion, as well as the damage done by the crucifixion itself, establishes conclusively**that Jesus was dead when he was entombed**.

##### 12\. Jesus’s Tomb Was Empty

The relevant canonical sources for the empty tomb—the gospel of Mark and the creed in 1 Corinthians—have been dated to within a matter of years of Christ’s Resurrection; **thus it’s highly unlikely their accounts are the product of legend**. Skeptics at the time implicitly accepted that the tomb was empty, and the fact that the canonical accounts describe women discovering the empty tomb is a testament to the accounts’ reliability: If the New Testament authors were making the whole thing up, they would undoubtedly have chosen to have _men_ discover the empty tomb (first-century Jewish society was extremely patriarchal; women’s testimony wasn’t even admissible in the Jewish courts of the time).

##### 13\. Jesus Appeared to Witnesses after His Death

There is ample biblical evidence for Jesus’s appearance after his death: The early-authored book Acts contains references to Jesus’s appearance, and the gospels describe encounters Jesus’s followers and others had with Jesus.**But there is also a wealth of _circumstantial_ evidence that corroborates the biblical account of the resurrection**, including the disciples’ subsequent martyrdom and the remarkable speed with which Jews converted to Christianity. **No person would go to his or her grave, or completely renounce the religion of his or her birth, for a lie**.

#### A New Convert

At the conclusion of his investigation, Strobel undergoes an existential crisis: Although he’s lived his life as an atheist, he’s discovered the evidence for Jesus Christ is irrefutable. He locks himself in his home office to meditate over all he’s learned; as he does so, he confesses his heavy drinking and adultery to the reader. Looking over the notes from his investigation, he takes what he considers the logical next step: He pledges himself to Christ.
