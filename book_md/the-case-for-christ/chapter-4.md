## Chapter 4: Does the Historical Evidence Support the Accounts in the Gospels?

As convincing as Blomberg’s and Metzger’s arguments are, they do have one weak spot: **They rely solely on the texts of the Christian tradition**. If there were historical evidence for the gospels’ account that _didn’t_ originate with the Church, then the gospels would be that much more credible.

Strobel pursues this line of inquiry by visiting Dr. Edwin Yamauchi, a professor at Miami University of Ohio and a renowned historian of the Mediterranean. Yamauchi participated in the 1968 excavation of the Herodian temple in Jerusalem (destroyed in 70 AD) and has published dozens of papers in scholarly journals. Although he was born into the Buddhist faith, he became a Christian in 1952.

### On Josephus

It’s a common misconception that the evidence for Jesus’s life is confined to the Bible itself—that no secular source records his existence. **In fact, there are clear and important references to Jesus in several non-Christian sources**.

Primary among them are the works of Josephus, a Jewish historian active in the first century AD. In _The Antiquities_ , a history of the Jewish people from Creation to the late first century AD, Josephus refers to Jesus as the “Christ,” or Messiah, and he mentions the execution of James, Jesus’s brother. And in the _Testimonium Flavianum_ , Josephus gives a plainspoken account of Jesus’s ability to do miracles, his crucifixion, and his resurrection.

But is this account actually Josephus’s, or was it added later by editors sympathetic to Jesus?

Over the years the scholarly consensus alternated between acceptance and skepticism, but today there’s widespread agreement that the account is authentic, albeit affected by interpolations. In other words, although most of the account reads as though a first-century Jewish writer wrote it, there are some phrases and vocabulary that appear to have been added later. The interpolated passages, it bears mentioning, include references to Jesus’s divinity, his role as the Messiah, and his resurrection. That is, the passages that are authentically Josephus corroborate Jesus’s existence and acts,**but the passages that describe Jesus’s metaphysical characteristics are likely the work of someone else**.

Nevertheless,**those that insist Jesus never existed are willfully distorting—or ignoring—the record**. Josephus’s bona fides as a historian are well known: His accounts have been supported by archeological findings as well as the accounts of Tacitus, arguably the most important Roman historian of the period.

### On Tacitus

Tacitus, too, mentions Jesus in his writings. In his account of Nero’s persecution of Christians in 115 AD, **he explicitly references a “Christus,” who was crucified by Pontius Pilate and inspired an “immense multitude” to adhere to his teachings**. The reasons Tacitus’s account is especially trustworthy are (1) he was generally unsympathetic to Christians, and so would have no reason to fabricate Christ’s existence, and (2) he establishes that Jesus attracted a large group of followers. Given that Jesus was executed using the most disgraceful method of the time—and so, under normal circumstances, would have been forgotten or disowned—**the fact that he commanded a massive following of adherents who would rather die __ than renounce him at least _implies_ his resurrection**.

### Further History

Josephus and Tacitus are merely the most famous of the ancient historians to corroborate Jesus’s existence.

#### Pliny the Younger

Nephew to first-century encyclopedist Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger served as governor of a Turkish province in the early second century. In his letters, he recounts arresting Christians and questioning them about their beliefs. These Christians testified to the divinity of Jesus and their commitment to a moral life. **Pliny’s letters confirm the wide and rapid spread of Christianity in the generation after Christ’s death**.

#### Confirmation of the Crucifixion Darkness

One Biblical event to which skeptics often point is the darkness that fell over the earth while Christ was on the cross. But, according to a first-century historian named Thallus, the darkness was caused by a solar eclipse—a possibility seconded by other historians of the period. According to these histories, the eclipse was visible from several cities in the Mediterranean.

#### Descriptions of Pilate

Another question mark is Pontius Pilate’s true nature. The gospels portray Pilate as a conflicted authority who eventually yields to the pressure of his Jewish subjects, whereas most historical accounts depict him as tough and inflexible. Don’t these inconsistencies raise red flags?

According to Yamauchi, **critics who harp on these contradictions don’t fully understand the historical context of time**. Pilate’s benefactor in Rome, Sejanus, was removed from his position for plotting against the emperor in 31 AD, and so, even if he were temperamentally unyielding, Pilate would have been keenly aware of his weakened position. A fight with his Jewish subjects would have gotten him in even more trouble with the emperor,**thus the New Testament accounts are probably accurate**.

#### Jewish Histories

Roman histories report on Jesus in more detail than do Jewish histories, largely **because the Jews of the time considered Jesus a heretic**. Nevertheless, there are references to Jesus in the Talmud, a key text in the Jewish canon, that describe him as a false messiah and sorcerer. Although these accounts are pejorative,**they _do_ , in a negative sense,__ corroborate Jesus’s ability to do miracles**.

### Christian Corroboration

Secular histories aren’t the only sources to ground the gospels in fact—other books of the New Testament, as well as ancient Church documents, corroborate Jesus’s biographies, too.

#### Paul’s Letters

Recall that, though the gospels are the first books of the New Testament, they weren’t _written_ first: that distinction goes to Paul’s letters (or “epistles”).

**Because Paul’s letters comprise the earliest documents of Jesus’s life in the New Testament, they are the least likely to have been influenced by myth or legend**. And the Jesus one finds in Paul’s letters is very similar to the Jesus of the gospels: He’s described as the Messiah, and Paul attests to Jesus’s death, burial, and resurrection.

The fact that Paul, after witnessing the resurrection, worships Jesus as God is highly significant, for two reasons. One, Paul was Jewish, and to embrace Jesus as a God was anathema to Jewish monotheism (so he must have had a compelling reason, i.e., the Resurrection). Two, there’s a body of criticism that alleges Jesus’s deity was inserted into Christian doctrine by later adherents. **Paul’s attestation to Christ’s deity undercuts that theory,** thereby making Christ’s deity all the more certain.

#### The Apostolic Fathers’ Letters

In addition to the canonized epistles—that is, the letters included in the New Testament—there are also a number of letters written by the earliest Christians that corroborate the key facts of Jesus’s life and works. These epistles, whose authors are known as the “apostolic fathers,” include the Epistle of Polycarp, the Epistle of Barnabas, and the Epistle of Ignatius.

The Epistle of Ignatius is particularly enlightening. Ignatius, a Syrian bishop who was executed in 117 AD for his beliefs, testified not only that Christ was both human and God,**but also that Christ was persecuted and crucified by Pilate and that he rose from the dead**.

### What If the Gospels Didn’t Exist?

Given the wealth of secular and religious testimony to Jesus’s existence, even if the gospels didn’t exist, we would know that:

  1. Jesus was a Jewish teacher.
  2. He healed the sick and performed exorcisms.
  3. Some people believed Jesus was the Messiah.
  4. He was scorned by the Jewish authorities of the time.
  5. He was crucified by Pontius Pilate.
  6. His followers continued to believe he was alive and adhere to his teachings, despite his shameful execution.
  7. His following spread widely.
  8. People from all levels of society worshipped him as a god.



### Yamauchi’s Personal Journey

Similar to Blomberg, Yamauchi’s intensive study of the historical materials has bolstered his faith rather than undermine it. Although he admits that there are still some gaps in the record, **he has complete faith in the factuality of the gospels and the New Testament as a whole**.
