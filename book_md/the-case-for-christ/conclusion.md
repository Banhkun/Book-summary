## Conclusion: Where Does the Evidence Leave Us?

At the culmination of his investigation, Strobel locks himself in his home office to review everything he’s learned. Through his interviews and research, he’s established the following:

##### The biographies of Jesus (the gospels) can be trusted.

Whereas Strobel once thought the gospels were legends concocted by biased authors, his conversation with Blomberg confirmed that **the gospels bear all the markings of trustworthy eyewitness accounts**.

##### The biographies of Jesus stand up under examination.

That the gospels harmonize on the major points while diverging on minor ones suggests that (a) the authors are reliable and (b) **the overall contours of Jesus’s story are factually accurate**. Also, the early church couldn’t have thrived in Jerusalem—as it did—if the gospels had been exaggerated: everyone would have known the disciples were lying.

##### The text of Jesus’s biographies hasn’t been amended or adulterated by later authors.

Strobel’s interview with Bruce Metzger confirmed that the documents on which the New Testament is based date to an extremely early period in the church and are authentic.

##### Secular sources attest to Jesus’s existence.

There is more historical evidence for Jesus’s existence than for many historical personages whose reality we take for granted. Secular sources attest to **Jesus’s ability to perform miracles, his crucifixion, and his early followers’ belief in his Resurrection**.

##### The archaeological record corroborates Jesus’s biographies as well.

No archeological finding has disproved the New Testament, and **Luke’s gospel has proven especially accurate** , with references to geographical and cultural landmarks later confirmed by archaeological discoveries.

##### The historical Jesus is the same as Jesus Christ.

The Jesus Seminar has attempted to distinguish between a naturalistic Jesus and the mythological Jesus featured in the gospels, but its scholars rely on a number of specious sources to make their case. **The evidence for the gospels’ account is far more robust and convincing** than for the Jesus Seminar’s theories.

##### Jesus believed he was the son of God.

Some skeptics have argued that Jesus didn’t actually believe he was the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. However, the numerous references Jesus makes to his own provenance and deity confirm **he did in fact believe he was the Christ, sent to redeem the world**.

##### There is no evidence to suggest Jesus was mentally disturbed.

Those with paranoid schizophrenia or other mental illnesses exhibit an array of symptoms beyond delusions of grandeur, including antisociality and trouble expressing emotion. **Jesus exhibited none of these symptoms** , and he supported his claims of divinity by performing independently verified miracles.

##### Jesus exhibited all the traits of God.

Although some believe Jesus voluntarily limited his divine powers when he was incarnated, the New Testament shows that he possessed all the attributes of deity, including omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence.

##### Unlike claimants before or since, Jesus matched all the attributes of the Messiah.

Old Testament prophets made a number of predictions about the identity of the Messiah, including minor details like his place of birth and whether he would be buried with no broken bones. The odds that someone could match these prophecies by chance is _infinitesimal_. **Jesus, of course, fit these predictions completely**.

##### Jesus died on the cross.

Skeptics of the Resurrection have attempted to explain away Jesus’s “rise” by claiming he never _actually died_ on the cross. Detailed medical analysis of Jesus’s brutal beating before the crucifixion, as well as the damage done by the crucifixion itself, can’t but conclude**that Jesus was dead when he was entombed**.

##### Jesus’s tomb was empty.

The relevant canonical sources for the empty tomb—the gospel of Mark and the creed in 1 Corinthians—have been dated to within a matter of years of Christ’s Resurrection; **thus it’s highly unlikely their accounts are the product of legend**. Skeptics at the time implicitly accepted that the tomb was empty, and the fact that the canonical accounts describe women discovering the empty tomb is a testament to the accounts’ reliability: If the New Testament authors were making the whole thing up, they would undoubtedly have had _men_ discover the empty tomb (women’s testimony wasn’t admissible in the Jewish courts at the time).

##### Jesus appeared to witnesses after his death.

The early-authored book Acts contains references to Jesus’s appearance to people after his death, and the gospels describe encounters Jesus’s followers and others had with Jesus.**There is also a wealth of _circumstantial_ evidence that corroborates the biblical account of the resurrection**, including the disciples’ martyrdom and the remarkable speed with which Jews converted to Christianity.

### From Evidence to Belief

In Strobel’s case, **the overwhelming evidence for the truth of Jesus Christ—as deity and Messiah—caused him to abandon his atheism**. To conduct the experiential, rather than intellectual, test recommended by Dr. Moreland, on November 8, 1981, Strobel took three key steps:

  1. **He _believed_. **At the time he began his investigation, Strobel’s personal life was a mess: He was abusing alcohol, cheating on his wife, and mistreating his colleagues. Once the evidence of Jesus as Christ became undeniable, **he began to believe in Jesus**.
  2. **He _received_**. For so many religions and systems of faith, one must _do_ something—give to charity, make pilgrimages, and the like. With Christianity, Strobel realized, **one must simply be open to God’s forgiveness** —to offer a prayer of repentance and receive grace. On that date in 1981, he confessed his sinful behavior and promised to turn from it.
  3. **He _became_**. After affirming his belief in Christ and receiving his forgiveness, Strobel was fundamentally changed: **He’d become a child of God**. And although Strobel’s work on his character and faith are ongoing, he’s seen some palpable results from his embrace of Jesus: Not long after his revelation, his daughter said that she wanted God to do for her what He’d done for “daddy.”
