## Chapter 9: Did Jesus Exhibit the Traits of God?

It goes without saying that Christians believe Jesus is God, but what exactly does _being_ God entail? The Old Testament provides a number of details about God that, if Christian doctrine is right, would have to hold true for Jesus as well. For example:

  1. _God is omnipresent_ (He exists everywhere, at all times).
  2. _God is omniscient_(He is all-knowing, and can see all of eternity).
  3. _God is omnipotent_(He is all-powerful).
  4. _God is eternal_ (He is both beyond time and the source of time).
  5. _God is immutable_(He is total in form and substance and never changes).



Some of these attributes immediately present problems for Christian apologists. For example, how can Jesus be omnipresent? When he was delivering the Sermon on the Mount by the Sea of Galilee, he wasn’t simultaneously standing on a street in Nazareth!

To get some clarity on these issues, Strobel visits D. A. Carson, a professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. Carson has authored or edited over 40 books and reads a dozen languages. He holds a bachelor of science from McGill University and a doctorate in the New Testament from Cambridge.

### The Question of Jesus’s Omni-ness

Whereas the God of the Old Testament is omni-everything, Jesus appears limited in all sorts of ways: he can’t exist in two places at once, he admits that he doesn’t know when he’ll return to Earth, and he’s unable to perform miracles in his hometown (there goes omnipresence, omniscience, and omnipotence). **The case against Jesus’s deity, at least how deity is understood in the Old Testament, seems closed**.

However, theologians throughout the years have been able to explain these “contradictions” using a variety of approaches. Two of the most prominent are:

  * _A Jesus of Two Minds_
    * Theologian Benjamin Warfield, who was active in the late 19th century, theorized that Jesus was**both distinctly divine and distinctly human**. In other words, when Jesus does something that seems to undermine his deity—for example, confesses he doesn’t know when he’ll return—he’s evincing his humanity. When he performs an unprecedented miracle—for example, raising others from the dead or rising himself—he’s acting as God.
  * _An “Emptied” Jesus_
    * This solution grows out of Philippians 2, which finds Paul telling the reader that, because Jesus didn’t want to “exploit” his equality with God, he “emptied” himself. There have been various interpretations of what Paul meant here, the most compelling of which is that Jesus relinquished the _independent_ use of his divine powers. That is, while incarnated, Jesus only acted as God when God the Father commanded it.



For Carson’s part, though, the quest for an exhaustive explanation **misses the point**. Incarnation—the event of spirit becoming flesh—is a miraculous process that can’t help but be mysterious. **It is an act of God** , and so it should come as no surprise that mortals have difficulty comprehending it.

Nevertheless,**there is clear textual evidence that Jesus satisfied all five of the key attributes of God:**

  1. Jesus _is_ omnipresent (in Matthew 28:20, he says “and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world”).
  2. Jesus _is_ omniscient __(in John 16:30, the author admits, “Now are we sure that thou knowest all things”).
  3. Jesus _is_ omnipotent (Matthew 28:18: “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,” Jesus says).
  4. Jesus _is_ eternal (John 1:1: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the World was God”).
  5. Jesus _is_ immutable (from Hebrews 13:8: “Jesus Christ the same today and yesterday and forever”).



### To Forgive Is Divine

For most Christians, Jesus’s miracles are the core piece of evidence for his deity. However, New Testament scholars concede that**figures other than Jesus were able to perform miracles**. So what sets Jesus apart?

One less-remarked-upon trait of Jesus that indicates his deity is his _forgiveness of sin_. In the Jewish tradition, when men sinned, they sinned against God and subsequently had to beg his forgiveness. **Jesus’s ability to forgive sin Himself indicates his deity, for God alone can forgive sin.**

And not only was Jesus able to forgive sin:**He was utterly without sin himself**. Other than God, no being is morally perfect, and so, therefore, Jesus is God.

### The Question of Jesus’s Createdness

The most definitive sign of God’s divinity, arguably, is the fact that He is the creator of all things. But in a number of places in the New Testament, Jesus is portrayed as having been _created_ —for example in John 3:16 and Colossians 1:15. Does this mean Jesus isn’t truly God?

The notion that Jesus was created stems from flawed translations of the original New Testament Greek. In John 3:16 for example, when the author calls Jesus the “begotten” Son of God (King James Version), the Greek word typically translated “begotten” actually means something closer to “unique and beloved.” **That is to say, the original Greek doesn’t have the connotation of “created.”**(More modern translations use “one and only Son” in lieu of “begotten.”)

### Was Jesus a Secondary God?

At certain points in the New Testament, Jesus seems to diminish his own primacy. For example, in John 14:28, Jesus tells his disciples that the “Father is greater than I,” implying that Jesus’s deity isn’t foremost.

Whereas many misreadings of Jesus’s pronouncements have their origin in poor translation, **others stem from the omission of necessary context**. In the case of John 14:28, Jesus is preparing his disciples for his ascension to Heaven, and the lines _before_ the above-quoted phrase fill out Jesus’s meaning: “If you loved me, you’d be glad for my sake [that I’m going away], because the Father is greater than I.” In other words, Jesus, as the mortal incarnation of God (the Son of God), is simply saying that God the Father is in a _better place_ than Jesus is currently. That Jesus says “the father is greater than I” isn’t a denial of his deity; it’s a comparison between equal beings.

### Squaring a Benevolent God with Hell and Slavery

In both the New and Old Testaments, God is said to be a beneficent and loving being. But isn’t it the height of hypocrisy for an infinitely compassionate being to (1) consign people to Hell and (2) allow them to be enslaved?

#### What (Or Whom) Hell Is For

Consigning sinful humans to eternal suffering is undoubtedly spectacular, **but it doesn’t entail a cruel or mean-spirited God**. First, without some sort of deterrent, human beings would sin constantly and egregiously, thereby turning Earth into Hell itself. **A case could be made that by creating Hell, God was acting kindly**.

Second, **God doesn’t consign people to Hell unjustly**. Those who have repented, who understand that God is the center of the universe, are never sent and confined to Hell; it’s only those who refuse to repent that stay there for eternity. At the Final Judgment, Romans 3:19 says, “every mouth may be stopped” by God’s law. **In other words, all will understand that their fate, however blessed or cursed, is fair**.

#### Jesus and Slavery

Modern humans, with good reason, find slavery morally unconscionable. But Jesus, despite his ethical perfection, never mentions the practice or advocates for its abolition. (In Jesus’s time, Jews and Gentiles alike owned slaves, and there were even slave rebellions during Jesus’s childhood.) Which raises the question: **How can a morally perfect being have nothing to say about slavery?**

The first thing to remember is that **slavery in the ancient world was vastly different** from slavery as it was practiced in the US. In the ancient world, people contracted _themselves_ as slaves to pay debts, and slaves weren’t exclusively laborers: they served as private tutors for families as well.

Also, slaves in the ancient world hailed from any number of locations and practiced any number of religions. That is to say, unlike American slavery,**no particular race was subject to slavery**.

The other important fact to keep in mind is that Jesus’s mission on Earth was not the overthrow of the Roman economic system (which relied, in part, on slavery). Rather, Jesus’s mission was changing the hearts of men—freeing them from sin and inspiring them to love their neighbors as they loved themselves. **Jesus’s teachings necessarily entailed the abolition of slavery** ; any human being who accepted Jesus as God would find slavery abominable.

A case in point is the evangelical awakening in England in the 19th Century. Devoted Christians in Parliament championed legislation to abolish slavery and then advocated the use of the British navy to put a stop to the transatlantic slave trade.
