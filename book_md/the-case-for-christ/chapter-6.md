## Chapter 6: Is the Historical Jesus the Same as the Jesus of Christianity?

In the ’90s, a small group of New Testament scholars calling themselves the Jesus Seminar rose to prominence. These scholars, a tiny minority of New Testament experts, received a wealth of media coverage due to their idiosyncratic methods and radically new accounts of the Bible. For example, the group voted on the authenticity of each of Jesus’s sayings with colored beads; later, they published a book called _The Five Gospels_ (the canonical four plus the Gospel of Thomas), which featured color-coded text reflecting their votes. **82% of the book was rendered in black, the color for words Jesus never said at all** ; only 2% of the book was in red, the color for words Jesus definitely said.

Given the attention paid to the Jesus Seminar in the media and their assertions of Jesus’s “materiality” (that is, **his mortality rather than his deity**), Strobel feels it’s vital to consider, and, hopefully, refute, the Jesus Seminar. To do so, he visits Dr. Gregory Boyd, a professor at Bethel College who received his graduate education in divinity at Yale and Princeton. Boyd is the author of a 416-page scholarly rebuttal to the Jesus Seminar entitled _Cynic Sage or Son of God? Recovering the Real Jesus in an Age of Revisionist Replies,_ and, in addition to his scholarly work, he serves as a pastor at Woodland Hills Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

### What Does the Jesus Seminar Believe?

The Jesus Seminar holds that Jesus as a historical human being did indeed exist. This Jesus, however, was exclusively a “naturalistic” Jesus. That is, this Jesus might have had extraordinary qualities—of leadership, charisma, or piety—but he was not in any way supernatural; according to the Seminar, the accounts in the gospels of miracles like walking on water or rising from the dead are almost certainly legends created by Jesus’s followers to cope with his death and burnish his memory.

Advocates of a divide between a naturalistic Jesus and a mythological one often point to the historical context in which Jesus lived, a time when miracle workers were not uncommon and so-called “mystery religions” built around resurrections were in existence. When these facets of the ancient world are cited, **there are two claims being made** : (1) that Jesus’s supernatural qualities weren’t actually true to him, but rather imported from preexisting and obviously mythological sources; and (2) that if there were other similarly endowed figures around at the time as Jesus, Jesus isn’t uniquely deserving of worship.

The Jesus Seminar aims to develop a new Christianity, **one free of fundamentalism and responsive to the situation of contemporary human beings**. Scholars in the Jesus Seminar hold a variety of viewpoints on Jesus: Some see him as a religious zealot, others as a political revolutionary, still others as a proto-feminist or socialist.

### Foundational Assumptions

Although the members of the Jesus Seminar portray themselves as lonely truth-tellers amid a sea of biased believers, their positions are actually undermined by their _own_ biases.

For example, the scholars associated with the Jesus Seminar assume from the outset that any sort of supernatural event is impossible, **simply because none of them have ever _witnessed_ such an event**. When you start your analysis of the New Testament or the historical record of Jesus from this position, the gospels become mythological, thus untrustworthy, and you inevitably end up with a naturalistic Jesus.

**Beginning with this assumption, however, is in fact an act of enormous hubris**. Is it more humble and objective to say, “The supernatural is impossible in any time or place no matter what” or “At certain unique points in human history, it’s possible that God has intervened in the world”? When you begin with the humility of the latter assumption, then the historical and documentary evidence of Jesus’s deity begins to look very different.

### Problems of Method

To determine the authenticity of Jesus’s pronouncements, the Jesus Seminar **uses an array of flawed criteria** , including double dissimilarity and multiple attestation.

#### Double Dissimilarity

Under this criterion, for a statement of Jesus to be considered authentic, it cannot resemble something a rabbi or early Church leader would say. The reasoning here is that, if a statement of Jesus _does_ resemble early Jewish or Christian sources, it was likely taken from those sources by the gospels’ authors and attributed to Jesus.

The problem with this logic, however, is that **Jesus was both a Jew _and_ the founder of Christianity**—it’s completely unsurprising that he would sound like the rabbis of his time, and that later Church leaders would sound like him.

#### Multiple Attestation

Under this criterion, a saying of Jesus can only be considered authentic if it’s found in more than one source.

One problem with this rubric is that many of our most trusted sources of ancient history are singular—that is, for many events of antiquity that we assume actually happened,**** we only have a single source. **In other words, the Jesus Seminar holds the events of the bible to a stricter standard than other ancient events**.

Another problem is that, according to the Jesus Seminar’s precepts, the mention of a saying in more than one gospel _doesn’t count as multiple attestation_. For this rule, they’re relying on the argument that Matthew and Luke are based on Mark, thus any saying that’s mentioned in all three really amounts to just _one_ mention. **What this position fails to take into account is recent scholarship that disputes Matthew’s and Luke’s reliance on Mark** (see the discussion of “Q” in Chapter 1).

### Jesus as One Among Many

Members of the Jesus Seminar have sought to emphasize Jesus’s “naturalism” by placing his pronouncements and deeds in historical context—by showing that rabbis and other Jewish figures were purported to have performed miracles as well. If other religious leaders of the time were perceived as having supernatural powers—**powers no one now believes in or takes seriously** —then it stands to reason Jesus’s powers should be treated similarly: as myth.

However,**the parallels between Jesus and other “wonder workers” of the time don’t go very far**. Boyd notes three ways in which Jesus is unique:

  1. No other religious leader was so closely associated with the supernatural.
  2. No other religious leader performed miracles of Jesus’s caliber (whereas rabbis were known to bring rain by praying for it, no rabbi was known to have cured permanent illnesses or raised the dead).
  3. No other religious leader performed miracles on his own authority (whereas rabbis would pray for God to perform a certain miracle, Jesus assumed that authority himself as God himself).



#### The Case of Apollonius

Skeptics have often noted the parallels between Apollonius of Tyana, a historical figure active in the first century AD, and Jesus: both healed the sick, performed exorcisms, and raised the dead; and both were allegedly seen by their followers after they died. However, Apollonius’s feats are dismissed as legend whereas Jesus’s are accepted as fact. **Why, a skeptic might ask, do we not worship Apollonius? Or, vice versa, dismiss Jesus?**

There are numerous problems with this line of argument:

  * _First_ , our only source for Apollonius’s supernatural abilities is a single biography written a _century and a half_ after Apollonius’s death. (Compare this with Jesus’s biographies, which were written as little as thirty years after his death and are corroborated by numerous secular historians (see Chapter 4)).
  * _Second_ , Apollonius’s biography was commissioned by an empress who worshipped Apollonius and planned to dedicate a temple to him. Thus the biographer would have incentive to embellish Apollonius’s story.
  * _Third_ , whereas the gospels present the facts of Jesus’s life with the definiteness of an eyewitness account, Apollonius’s biography features sentences that indicate much of the story is hearsay.
  * _Fourth and finally_ , when Apollonius’s biographer was writing in the third century, Christianity had already long been in existence. **Thus it’s more likely that the story of Apollonius was influenced by the story of Jesus than vice versa**.



### Mystery Religions

Just as certain skeptics believe accounts of Jesus to have been influenced by first-century myths, **others believe Christianity itself to be a hodgepodge of already existing religious practices**. For example, there were a number of “mystery religions” practiced in the ancient world that included narratives of death and resurrection as well as rituals of baptism and communion.

As with other arguments about external influence, **there are too many logical flaws in this critique for it to be credible**. For example, it’s often noted that the mystery religions feature myths of gods dying and rising again. But these myths are tied to natural lifecycles, like crops dying in the fall and growing again in the spring, and take place sometime in the distant past. **Jesus’s death and resurrection have no such metaphorical and fairytale content** —they are narrated by near-eyewitnesses as fact.

### Suppressed Gospels

Arguably the most controversial of the Jesus Seminar’s pronouncements was that the Gospel of Thomas, a long marginalized text, should be included in the New Testament canon. The Gospel of Thomas features passages that the Jesus Seminar argues (1) predate the accounts of Jesus found in the canonical gospels and (2) depict a naturalistic Jesus.

Scholars associated with the Jesus Seminar have also raised questions about other “secret gospels” that have been discovered, including “Secret Mark” and the “Cross Gospel.” Some Jesus Seminar members have speculated that these secret gospels feature revelations about Jesus that expose him as exclusively mortal.

**To most serious scholars of the New Testament, however, these so-called “secret gospels” are simply a distraction**. In fact, most aren’t even discoveries: theologians have long known about the Gospel of Thomas—and have dismissed it because it so clearly contravenes the Jesus of the canonical four gospels (see Chapter 3).

“Secret Mark,” according to its proponents, is a longer and more reliable version of the gospel of Mark, one that was suppressed by the early Church. The problem with this assertion is that no copy of “Secret Mark” exists, **and there’s only the thinnest evidence it ever _did_ exist**. Everything we know about “Secret Mark” is contained in a quote from it included in a letter by a second-century author. (And, curiously enough, _there’s no existing copy of the letter, either_ —only a picture taken of it by the mid-twentieth-century scholar who found it.)

(Shortform note: Some contemporary commentators believe that the scholar who photographed the letter actually fabricated it.)

### Boyd’s Personal Journey

For liberal interpreters of the New Testament, like the scholars comprising the Jesus Seminar, Jesus’s divinity becomes symbolic: The miracles and resurrection are there simply to inspire Christians to hew more closely to Jesus’s teachings.

For Boyd, whose belief is rooted in his years of scholarship and deep faith, this understanding of Jesus is utterly wrongheaded. **Jesus’s power to inspire and instruct is indistinguishable from the truth of his supernatural abilities** ; Paul himself says that if the resurrection didn’t truly happen, then faith is useless. The fact that Paul—and the gospel authors—remain committed to their faith is a token of Jesus’s divinity _in fact_.

Boyd, too, is committed to Jesus because he is certain of the reality of Jesus’s divinity. He acknowledges that some of the claims about Jesus, the supernatural ones in particular, are perhaps hard for a modern person to believe. But the evidence for those supernatural events—the healing of the sick, the rising from the dead—is incontrovertible. The Jesus Seminar’s distinction between a “Jesus of History” and “Jesus of Faith” simply doesn’t hold up under scrutiny; the Seminar’s central pieces of evidence are thin and/or contradictory,**whereas the New Testament, coupled with secular sources like Josephus, paints a remarkably consistent picture of a divine Jesus**.

For Boyd, it’s a no-brainer for him to put his trust in the gospels.
