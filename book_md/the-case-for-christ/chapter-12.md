## Chapter 12: Was Jesus’s Tomb Truly Empty?

Jesus’s death on the cross, as conclusively established by Dr. Metherell, confirms the initial condition for the Resurrection (i.e., Jesus’s medical death). But what evidence do we have he was indeed raised?

There are two proofs for Jesus’s rise:**The eyewitness accounts of his disciples (discussed in the next chapter), and the fact of his empty tomb**.

To analyze the latter, Strobel visits William Lane Craig, an expert on the Resurrection and author of a number of classics of Christian apologetics, including _Reasonable Faith_ , _The Only Wise God_ , and _The Existence of God and the Beginning of the Universe_. Craig is also a renowned debater of atheists and skeptics.

### The Burial of Jesus

It goes without saying that, in order for Jesus’s tomb to be empty, _he would have had to be buried in a tomb in the first place_.

As it turns out, this fact can’t be taken for granted. Historians have shown that the bodies of crucified criminals were generally left on the cross to be eaten by birds or thrown in mass graves.

**But those skeptics that appeal to the general case ignore the specific circumstances of Jesus’s burial**.

First of all, there’s ample textual evidence that **Jesus was in fact buried**. For example, Corinthians 15:3—which, we know from Craig Blomberg, was authored very shortly after Jesus’s death—says explicitly that Jesus was buried.

Second, the gospels corroborate the summary account one finds in Corinthians. In all four gospels, the authors mention that Jesus’s body was turned over to Joseph of Arimathea and buried. It’s especially important that these facts appear in Mark, **which was the earliest of the gospels to be written** and thus less vulnerable to later embellishment. And, according to the textual history of Mark, the story of Jesus’s final week—termed the “passion story”—**was taken from an even _earlier_ source**.

### The Case of Joseph of Arimathea

Those skeptical of Jesus’s burial often highlight the implausibility that Joseph of Arimathea would have arranged for the honorable interment of Jesus’s body.**This is because Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Sanhedrin** , the council of Jewish leaders that voted unanimously to execute Jesus.

The gospel of Luke accounts for this twist with the addition of a key detail: **Joseph of Arimathea wasn’t present at the vote to kill Jesus**. Thus he may have been less indisposed toward Jesus than the rest of the Sanhedrin.

But there are other reasons to believe that this unlikely figure did indeed give Jesus an honorable burial. First of all, given early Christians’ anger toward the Jews for their role in Jesus’s death, it’s unlikely that an author of the time period would give credit to a member of the Sanhedrin if it wasn’t due. A second reason is that, for all the accounts of Jesus in both historical and Christian documents,**there’s no alternate story of Jesus’s burial**.

### The Tomb

Interestingly, the biblical creed of the Resurrection (Corinthians 15:3–10) never mentions an empty tomb—it only reports that Jesus was resurrected and appeared to a number of witnesses. How can we be sure Jesus appeared _physically_ rather than _spiritually_?

The Jewish understanding of resurrection—which is the same understanding present in the Bible—**necessarily entails _physical_ resurrection**. (In fact, in the Jewish tradition, it’s the _bones_ that are raised, while the flesh rots away.) So, when the Bible reports that Jesus appeared before the various witnesses to the Resurrection, it is implying an empty tomb.

**It is also impossible that Jesus’s body was tampered with while he was entombed**. First, based on archeological discoveries of tombs from that era, the entrance would have been blocked by a heavy stone disk that would have required several men to move. Second, the tomb likely would have been guarded.

#### Arguments Over the Guard

One way skeptics call the Resurrection into question is by arguing that Jesus’s tomb wasn’t in fact guarded (and thus the disciples could have stolen his body).

Although contemporary scholars have ruled out the possibility that the disciples removed Jesus’s body—their later martyrdom simply wouldn’t make sense if they’d been the perpetrators of a hoax—**there is historical evidence that Jesus’s tomb was indeed guarded**.

When first-century Jews and Christians argued over whether the disciples had removed Jesus’s body, the Jews said, “The guards at the tomb fell asleep [which was why the disciples were able to remove Jesus’s body].” In this way, these first-century Jews, who were near contemporaries of Jesus,**implicitly acknowledged that there were guards at Jesus’s tomb**.

### The Discrepancies

Naturally, there are some differences among the gospels regarding Jesus’s empty tomb—**differences which skeptics have latched onto to call the entire Resurrection into question**.

For example, in Matthew, Mary and Mary Magdalene arrive at the tomb at dawn and an angel opens the tomb for them; in Mark, the women arrive at sunrise and the tomb is already open; and in Luke, the women arrive at dawn to find the tomb already open. There also discrepancies regarding who arrives at the tomb (Is it just Mary and Mary Magdalene, or are Salome and Joanna there, too?) and who’s _in_ the tomb when they arrive (in Mark, a “youth” is inside; in Luke, it’s “two men”).

When one focuses on these minor details, however, one risks losing the forest for the trees. In other words, **the gospels are remarkably consistent with regard to the major events of the Resurrection:** Joseph of Arimathea’s handling of Jesus’s body and its entombment; the arrival of some group of women at the tomb Sunday morning; the tomb’s emptiness; and the vision of angels reporting that Jesus has risen. **The core of the story is consistent across the gospels** , and so it’s better scholarly practice to trust those consistencies rather than dismiss them. In fact, if the gospels aligned perfectly in all their details, they would (counterintuitively) be _less_ trustworthy: One would suspect that the gospel writers had colluded to get their story straight.

The immateriality of the discrepancies notwithstanding, there _are_ in fact ways to harmonize the gospels’ accounts. For example, all the writers mention that Mary and Mary Magdalene arrived at the tomb with other women; some writers simply chose to mention some of the women by name whereas others didn’t.

### The Witnesses

As noted, the witnesses to Jesus’s empty tomb were a group of women sympathetic to him—isn’t it possible they fabricated their account?

What this objection fails to take into consideration is the**position of women in first-century Jewish society**. At the time, women were very much second-class citizens; in fact, they weren’t even allowed to testify in Jewish courts of law! If the gospel authors wanted to fabricate witnesses to the empty tomb, it’s likely they would have had one of Jesus’s male disciples (Peter or John, perhaps) go to the tomb on Easter Sunday. **That all four gospels portray women bearing witness to Christ’s resurrection is a testament to the account’s veracity**.

But why were the women there in the first place? If they knew the tomb was sealed, why would they go to anoint a body they knew they wouldn’t be able to access?

Simply put, they loved Jesus deeply and were in deep mourning. **They likely visited his tomb in the desperate hope that, somehow, they would be able to anoint his body**.

### The Positive Evidence

In addition to the rebuttals outlined above, there is a wealth of affirmative evidence that the tomb was empty.

  1. The empty tomb is implicit in the preaching of Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, one of the earliest sources of Jesus’s life.
  2. Both Christians and Jews of the first century knew where Jesus’s tomb was. If that (historical, really existing) tomb hadn’t been empty, no religious movement would’ve sprung up around Jesus’s Resurrection (because skeptics could just go to the tomb and see that he was still buried there).
  3. Mark likely derived his empty tomb story from an earlier source, one possibly written before 37 AD. It’s improbable that an account written so soon after Jesus’s death would have been embellished by legend.
  4. Mark’s account is relatively “dry” in comparison to the floral and fantastic accounts of the tomb written in the second century. The simplicity of Mark’s telling implies its credibility.
  5. The fact that the empty tomb was discovered by women, a fact testified to by all the gospels, suggests the account’s authenticity. (If the gospel authors wanted to fabricate a story about Jesus’s empty tomb, they would have used male witnesses.)
  6. The earliest Jewish arguments against the truth of the Resurrection presume the fact of the empty tomb. In the first century, Jews and Christians alike accepted that the tomb was empty.



### Alternative Possibilities

##### Could the women witnesses have gone to the wrong tomb?

This theory, proposed by Kirsopp Lake in 1907, is absurd on its face. As noted in #2 just above, **both Jews and Christians of the time knew exactly where Jesus was buried**. If the women witnesses had gone to the wrong tomb, they would have been quickly corrected by the Jewish authorities (who had an interest in showing Jesus’s Resurrection to be a concoction).

##### Could the disciples have removed the body?

Even if the disciples were able to get by the guards and steal Jesus’s body, this theory doesn’t make sense given the disciples’ own faith—for which, eventually, they were put to death. **Why would they die for a hoax they’d perpetrated themselves?**

##### Could the empty tomb be the product of later legend?

The textual scholarship on the gospels, Mark’s especially (see Chapter 1), has shown the gospels were written quite close in time to the events in question. Simply put, if the gospels contained fabrications or exaggerations, **they would have been corrected by the eyewitnesses and near-eyewitnesses still living**.

_Isn’t_ any _alternative account more plausible than a dead person coming back to life?_

Yes, **but only if one is thinking exclusively naturally or materially**. If one believes in the existence of a supernatural God, however, the Resurrection is, in fact, comparatively simple.
