## Chapter 13: Did Witnesses Actually See Jesus Alive after His Death?

The authenticity of the empty tomb established, Strobel sets out to determine whether the second key proof of the Resurrection—that certain people encountered __ Jesus after he was buried—holds up.

To do so, he travels to Lynchburg, Virginia, to meet with Gary Habermas, one of the most formidable apologists of Christianity in the world. A professor at Liberty University, Habermas has participated in high-profile debates with leading atheists, including Antony Flew, author of _The Presumption of Atheism_. Famously, in his debate with Flew, four of the five judges—who were philosophers affiliated with various colleges and universities—declared Habermas the winner, and the fifth said the debate was a draw.

Habermas earned his PhD at Michigan State University, and he has authored seven books concerning the Resurrection, including _The Resurrection of Jesus: An Apologetic_ and _Did Jesus Rise from the Dead? The Resurrection Debate_.

### Who Saw Jesus Rise?

Critics of Christianity are eager to point out that, whatever other evidence there might be for the Resurrection, **no one actually saw Jesus rise from the dead and leave the tomb**.

Scholars like Habermas concede this argument, but they definitely don’t think it means the Resurrection didn’t happen. If Jesus died on the cross—which Dr. Metherell’s account established beyond the shadow of a doubt (see Chapter 11)—then all there’s left to prove is whether Jesus appeared to people after his death. **And there’s ample evidence to indicate he did**.

### 1 Corinthians

The early church creed featured in 1 Corinthians includes the assertion by Paul that Jesus had not only appeared to him, but to the twelve apostles, 500 of Jesus’s followers, and Jesus’s brother James. There are several reasons why Paul’s testimony is especially convincing:

  1. Scholars have dated the writing of 1 Corinthians to between 55 and 57 AD, and Paul likely gave the creed to the church at Corinth prior to 51 AD. Which is to say, **the creed was being promulgated a mere _twenty years_ after Jesus’s death**. (And possibly even earlier: Habermas himself agrees with the minority of scholars who trace the creed to between 32 and 38 AD—within _two to three years_ of the Resurrection.) If early Christians or their critics took issue with Paul’s account, there were plenty of eyewitnesses still living whom they could have questioned.
  2. **Paul was initially a committed skeptic of Jesus**. That means that he would have had to have an _especially good reason_ —for example, Jesus’s appearing to him after his death on the cross—to become a believer.
  3. **Paul learned about Jesus’s appearing to the other witnesses when he visited Jerusalem himself**. During this trip, Paul __ interviewed Peter and James _in person_ with the aim of establishing a factual account of the Resurrection (in Galatians 1:18, Paul uses the Greek word _historeo_ —signifying an “investigative inquiry”—to describe his trip to Jerusalem).
  4. In 1 Corinthians 15:11, Paul states that he’s preaching the same creed as the other apostles. This means that _all_ the apostles, including those like Peter and James that saw Jesus after his death, agreed on the factuality of Jesus’s posthumous appearance.



#### The Question of the 500

Although the majority of Paul’s account is corroborated elsewhere in the New Testament, one detail he mentions is conspicuously absent from any secular or religious source:**the 500 witnesses to whom Jesus allegedly appeared**. To some, this unsubstantiated claim destroys Paul’s credibility.

One thing to remember is that **the creed in 1 Corinthians is the oldest and most widely corroborated passage in the New Testament**. Isn’t it just possible that Paul’s account is right where the others are wrong?

Another key point is that **Paul didn’t _have_ to mention the 500 if he didn’t want to**. In essence, he was inviting his readers, many of whom would have been contemporaries of the 500 witnesses, to seek them out and ask about Jesus’s return themselves. Why would he invite this kind of scrutiny if he wasn’t sure his account was correct?

#### The Question of the First Witness

Another discrepancy between Paul’s creed and the gospel accounts concerns the person to whom Jesus first presented himself: in 1 Corinthians, it’s Peter; in John, it’s Mary Magdalene. Don’t _these_ contradictions hurt Paul’s credibility?

**They do not, because there may not even be a discrepancy**. The creed actually never says that Jesus appeared _first_ to Peter; rather, it says that Jesus appeared to a number of people and simply _lists_ Peter first. That is to say, he might have appeared to Mary Magdalene first, but for contextual or cultural reasons—for example, the inadmissibility of women’s testimony in Jewish law—Paul decided to omit the specific female witnesses.

### The Four Gospels and Acts

Of course, 1 Corinthians 15 isn’t the only place in the New Testament where Jesus’s reappearance is described; his appearance to an array of people both named and unnamed is reported in the four gospels and Acts as well. In fact, **the gospels and Acts tell us that Jesus appeared to over a dozen individuals** , including Mary Magdalene (John 20:10), Cleopas and another disciple (Luke 24:13), and a variety of the apostles (John 20:19, John 20:26, and Acts 1:4). And several sightings appear in multiple books: for example,**both Luke 24:50 and Acts 1:4 describe Jesus as having been with the apostles just before His ascension**.

It’s especially noteworthy that Acts in particular features detailed accounts of Jesus’s reappearance. Acts, like Paul’s letters, comprises quite early Church material and so is unlikely to have been embellished by legend. And it features the testimony of the witnesses themselves, for example, Peter’s description of eating and drinking with Jesus after he rose from the dead (Acts 10:41). Given the fact that these followers of Jesus would risk their lives—**and, in some cases,_give_ their lives**—to worship him, it is highly unlikely they would base their devotion on a canard.

(Shortform note: The stories of the apostles’ fate after Jesus’s ascension vary in both the secular and Church literature. A common understanding is that eleven of the Twelve—all except John—were martyred. Other sources indicate that only Peter, Paul, and James were martyred.)

#### The Problem of Mark

Mark’s gospel, which most scholars agree is the earliest of the gospels, presents a quandary for believers**:** The earliest manuscripts of Mark are missing verses 16:9–20**—i.e., the passages describing Jesus’s appearances after the women find his tomb empty**.

Considering the wealth of witness reports elsewhere in the Bible, Mark’s omission certainly doesn’t disprove Jesus’s rise. In fact, **Mark reports a young man saying that Jesus was risen** and would appear to the apostles, including Mark’s companion Peter, in Galilee. Even if the “true” version of Mark doesn’t include accounts of Jesus’s appearance—a claim that is still debatable—Mark clearly believed that Jesus had risen from the dead and would appear to his brethren.

### The Alternatives

As with the fact of Jesus’s empty tomb, skeptics have proposed a number of alternative theories to explain Jesus’s “appearance” after his death.

#### 1\. The Effect of Legend

If one concedes that Mark’s gospel ends before recording any posthumous appearances, one can construct a timeline whereby **each successive gospel embellishes Jesus’s Resurrection**. For example, in Mark, there are no appearances; in Matthew, a few; in Luke, more; and in John, the most. (Shortform note: This sequence follows the gospels’ chronological order of authorship rather than their sequence in the New Testament.)

There are three rebuttals to this argument:

  1. Not all scholars agree that Mark is indeed the earliest-authored gospel. Some, albeit a minority, believe that Matthew was actually written first.
  2. Even if the number and elaborateness of Jesus’s appearances increased over time,**the bare fact of his Resurrection isn’t disputed**. The apostles were obviously inspired by something magnificent and unique to start their Church; if legends grew _around_ that unprecedented event, it doesn’t disprove the event itself.
  3. **1 Corinthians 15 (not to mention Acts) predates the gospels** —including Mark—and features great detail about the appearances. If one argues that legends develop over time, then the creed found in 1 Corinthians 15 is the _least_ legendary of the biblical accounts of Jesus’s rise.



#### 2\. Mental Phenomena

Another possibility is that the various witnesses who claimed to see Jesus alive were being completely truthful—**only they’d _hallucinated_ Jesus’s appearance**.

Gary Collins, whom Strobel interviewed to determine whether Jesus __ was psychotic (see Chapter 8), writes that hallucinations are by definition personal and subjective experiences. In other words, a “mass hallucination”—that is, an identical hallucination experienced by several witnesses—is a contradiction in terms.**It’s impossible for all of the witnesses to Jesus’s rise to have hallucinated it**.

But what about a softer form of hallucination: groupthink? Couldn’t some of the disciples who hallucinated Jesus have talked the others into seeing what wasn’t really there?

The notion that the disciples were “talked into” seeing Jesus fails for the same reason the “legend” argument does:**It beggars belief that a disciple would go to his death believing a lie**. (Not to mention: Among those who saw Jesus were skeptics like James and Thomas, who wouldn’t be vulnerable to groupthink or persuasion of this kind.)

### Habermas’s Personal Journey

As an evangelical Christian and ardent defender of the faith, Habermas believes that the Resurrection is the key event for Christianity, the justification for belief itself. However, his sense of the Resurrection’s importance is also personal.

In 1995, Habermas’s wife, Debbie, was dying of stomach cancer, and Habermas was distraught. But when he thought about God raising Jesus—**when he recalled that if there’s a Resurrection, there’s a Heaven** —he felt peace.
