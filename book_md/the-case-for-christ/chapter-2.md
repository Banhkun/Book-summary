## Chapter 2: Do the Biographies Hold up Under Examination?

Although Strobel finds Blomberg’s arguments compelling, he intends to make sure he raises as many objections as he can to strengthen the case for Jesus. So, putting on his lawyer cap, he subjects Blomberg’s account to eight tests.

### Test 1: Authorial Intent

Given the theological goals of the gospels’ authors—that is, their goal of persuading and converting nonbelievers—one might think they weren’t at all interested in providing an accurate historical account. **This is not the case**.

On the contrary,**the gospel writers were at pains to adhere to the conventions of historical or biographical writing of the time**. For example, Luke begins his gospel with an explicit statement of purpose; he defines his task as producing an “orderly account” of the events he relates, based on his own careful investigation.

#### A First Objection

Some scholars have argued that the gospel writers’ intent was not to record history accurately, **but rather to provide a history where none existed**. This argument relies on the fact that early Christians believed Jesus would return to consummate history _during their lifetimes_ , and so they had no reason to preserve his teachings for posterity. When it became clear that Jesus would not be returning in the immediate future, the gospel writers took it upon themselves to fashion a concrete historical record.

There are two problems with this argument:

  1. Early Christians weren’t so sure of Jesus’s impending return—in fact, most of Jesus’s pronouncements imply a great number of years before the end of the world.
  2. **It’s valuable to remember that Christianity is an outgrowth of Judaism** , whose prophets continually heralded the imminent return of the Lord. Despite this, the Jews of antiquity still preserved their prophets’ teachings. Thus, it stands to reason that early Christians would have done the same.



#### A Second Objection

In early Christianity, it was common for Christians to believe Jesus was speaking to them from the spiritual world, and these “prophecies” would be considered on par with Jesus’s own teachings. Thus the gospels, as a blend of the pronouncements of Jesus and these prophecies, muddy the water in terms of what Jesus _really_ said and did.

**This objection betrays an ignorance of the text of the New Testament**. In his letters, Paul is careful to distinguish early Christian prophecy from Jesus’s own words (for examples, see 1 Corinthians 7 and 1 Corinthians 14).

A second rebuttal to this objection consists in the fact that many of the controversies of the early Christian church—concerning circumcision, the relationship between Jew and Gentile, and divorce, among other topics—**aren’t addressed in the gospels**. If the gospels were indeed a mix of prophecy and direct reportage, the gospel writers would have included various “prophecies” concerning these topics. Because they _didn’t_ , **it stands to reason that they were only interested in Jesus’s own words**.

### Test 2: Authorial Ability

If one concedes that the gospel authors’ primary intent was the accurate presentation of facts, there remains the question of _ability_ : Were the gospel authors able to give an accurate portrayal of Jesus’s life given the resources available to them? Because they were writing some 30 years after Jesus’s death, weren’t they at the mercy of flawed memories and mythological thinking? **Can we be sure Jesus’s actual acts were well preserved for the gospels’ authors?**

#### The Benefits of an Oral Tradition

The answer is yes, due to the emphasis on orality in the ancient world. Papyrus scrolls—the most advanced information-storage technology of the time—were rare, and most teaching and learning happened via oral communication. This practice had two key effects:

  1. **It created a culture that emphasized memorization**. Certain renowned rabbis of the era committed the _entire Old Testament_ to memory. It’s likely that Jesus’s disciples had the information contained in the gospels memorized—and much more besides.
  2. **It opened oral narratives to constant review and correction**. Unlike a game of “Telephone,” where the fun of the game is garbling the original message, an oral tradition like that of ancient Christianity prizes _accuracy_. Each new inductee into the tradition of Jesus’s teachings would have taken care to learn His deeds and precepts _exactly_.



### Test 3: Authorial Integrity

Isn’t it possible that the gospel writers were simply dishonest—**that they created a false history to fool people?**

There’s no evidence to suggest Jesus’s acolytes were anything but principled and honest. Ten of the eleven remaining disciples after Jesus’s death refused to renounce their beliefs and were subsequently put to death. Given their willingness to die for the Jesus they immortalized in their writings, **it’s highly unlikely that they embellished their accounts**(because what person would die for something he or she made up?).

### Test 4: Authorial Inconsistency

As noted above, there are obvious discrepancies among the four gospels. **But, counter-intuitively, these inconsistencies actually constitute a sign of authenticity**. Imagine if all four gospels were entirely consistent in their every feature—or, better yet, imagine if they were identical? **Wouldn’t that seem suspicious, as though the authors conspired to get their stories straight?**

In fact, **the gospels are _more_ believable because of their internal differences**. Even legal scholars like Simon Greenleaf, a Harvard Law professor, have determined that the amount of inconsistency among the gospels is actually _consistent with truthfulness_.

**And when it comes to specific contradictions among the gospels, there are usually perfectly reasonable explanations**. To take one example, Mark and Luke write that Jesus sent the demons into the swine in a place called “Gerasa,” whereas Matthew says the place was “Gedara.” In fact, Gerasa was a transliteration of a particular town’s name, and Gedara was the province in which that town was located.

### Test 5: Authorial Bias

The gospel writers loved Jesus deeply and had committed their lives to spreading his Word—wouldn’t they be tempted to skew the record to make Jesus look better than he was in reality?

This is a possibility, but it’s more likely that, because of their devotion, **the gospel writers took it upon themselves to portray their God as faithfully as they could**.

### Test 6: Authorial Omission

Most scholars’ efforts have been devoted to authenticating what the gospel writers included in their works. But how can we test for what they _didn’t_ include? In other words,**isn’t it possible the gospel writers suppressed embarrassing or disqualifying details of Jesus’s life?**

This question fails to take into consideration the many inconvenient passages the gospel writers _did_ include in their accounts. For example, scholars and religious leaders have long referred to the “hard sayings” of Jesus. These are precepts that challenge believers’ abilities, whether by dint of the sayings’ difficulty or their complexity. Several of these hard sayings seem to undermine Christ’s divinity: Mark 6:5, for instance, tells us that Jesus’s power to do miracles in Nazareth was limited by people’s lack of faith (thereby calling into question his omnipotence); and, in Mark 13:32, Jesus says he doesn’t know the date or hour of his return (thus calling into question his omniscience). **If the gospel writers were really intent on covering up the “hard” parts of Jesus’s life, why would they include these events?**

In the final analysis, if the gospel authors felt obligated to include these difficult passages in their accounts, it stands to reason they’d feel beholden to the truth overall, too.

### Test 7: Factual Corroboration

Police detectives will often follow up on witness testimony by visiting the scene of the crime and using forensics to make sure the witness’s account “checks out.” Have archeologists and other scholars attempted to find corroborating evidence for the gospels?

**The answer is yes**. Recent archeological and archival discoveries have corroborated the gospel writers’ references to the material aspects of their world: places, central figures, and events. (See Chapter 5 for an archeologist’s opinion on the veracity of the gospels.)

### Test 8: Contradicting Witnesses

If there had been contemporaries of Jesus and his disciples who could challenge or deny the accounts in the gospels, **they would have done so** : Jesus was a controversial figure whose teachings were seen as heresy by dominant religious authorities of the time, and those authorities would have been more than happy to correct the record.

Interestingly, the contemporaneous challenges to the gospels **never question Jesus’s power or ability to work miracles—** rather, they portray Jesus as a magician whose gifts derived from some other source than God. In other words, **they implicitly acknowledge the factuality of Jesus’s divinity by admitting his ability to work miracles**. They had to concede Jesus’s supernatural abilities—too many of the writers’ contemporaries had witnessed Jesus’s miracles themselves.

### Blomberg’s Personal Journey

After Blomberg shows that the gospels pass Strobel’s eight tests, Strobel asks Blomberg about his own faith. Blomberg recalls the story of doubting Thomas—who needed to see to believe—and acknowledges that sound evidence shouldn’t be the grounds for faith. Nevertheless, he says, his faith has been strengthened by his scholarly work on the New Testament, and he tells Strobel that there are scholars who came to the New Testament as doubters and soon became believers. Strobel notes he falls into the latter camp.
