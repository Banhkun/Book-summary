## Exercise: Assess Your Relationships

Examine the quality of your relationships with family members.

* * *

Choose a family member or romantic partner whom you wished you had a better relationship with. Write two to three sentences describing the quality of your relationship.

Which of the concepts in this chapter help you understand this relationship’s shortcomings? (For example, you might realize that your mother struggles to show an interest in your goals, or that a romantic partner wasn’t willing to adjust their lifestyle to spend adequate time with you.)

Now that you understand this relationship better, describe one way you could approach it differently so that it’s more fulfilling for you and the other person. (For example, if you realize your relationship with your brother isn’t fulfilling because you don’t seem to share any common goals, perhaps you plan to regularly try new activities together that are outside both of your comfort zones. Or you could make plans to do something your brother enjoys together and then do something you enjoy.)
