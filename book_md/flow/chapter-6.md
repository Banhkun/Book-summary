## Chapter 6: Find Flow Through the Mind

**Just as every movement and sense is associated with a suite of skills and activities that can provide flow, there are many activities associated with thinking that can produce flow.** This chapter discusses the mental activities capable of producing flow: wordplay, history, science, and philosophy. First, we’ll revisit the general state of mind.

### The General State of Mind

As we’ve discussed, our mind is disordered and chaotic when left to its own devices. Most people can’t focus for more than a few minutes at a time without some kind of external stimulus. Giving order to your mind through mental flow activities is a way to find enjoyment without depending on external circumstances.

**We’re not aware of how uncontrolled our minds are because we build routines and habits that make our attention move smoothly from one activity to the next throughout the day.** For example, when you wake up, you make breakfast and do other tasks to get ready for work. You work, come home, relax, and get ready for bed. But if there’s a moment that your attention isn’t focused on something external, your mind wanders to what is most bothersome or worrisome to you. For example, you may think about the state of the world, worst-case scenarios, fears, grudges, pain (real and perceived), and general frustration.

**To avoid focusing on unpleasant feelings and ideas, people often fill their minds with easy-to-access information from sources such as television.** This helps structure your thoughts with little investment of mental energy. But if you rely on external input for structuring your mind, it can be hard to find contentment without it.

The rest of this chapter focuses on learning to order your mind without depending on external stimuli.

### Mental Flow Activities Require Language

It may seem illogical to distinguish mental activities that produce flow from physical activities that produce flow—all activity, whether primarily physical or not, requires some thinking to be enjoyable. For example, athletes have to practice mental discipline to be successful, and recognizing their achievements requires thinking. **But the activities discussed in this chapter require symbolic thinking, or mentally manipulating language or concepts.**

### Words

One of the most important ways humans can structure their minds is with words. We’ll discuss:

  * The role of memory and systems of order in this process 
  * Word-centric activities



#### The Role of Memory

Memory is one of the most important mental skills. It allows us to retain knowledge, build on it, and share it with others. **Before the development of writing systems, remembering information and sharing it orally was the only way to communicate information.** For individuals, memory helps build knowledge that orders the mind and life and builds confidence in our skills and abilities.

Here are two common activities that depend on memory:

1.**Recounting your ancestry.** Before we had writing systems, recalling our ancestors was one of the oldest ways of ordering our life. Detailing the members of your family from past to present develops or reinforces your identity and is enjoyable because you have a specific goal that requires effort. Even today, when many feel disconnected from their ancestral past, it’s still enjoyable to think about where you’ve come from.

2.**Riddles, sayings, and verses.** Our ancestors remembered information by packaging it into riddles, sayings, poetry, lists, and more. Information included health tips, edible plants, and inheritance customs.

In some cultures, elders held riddling competitions. One elder would sing riddles in front of the whole community and ask another elder to guess what they meant. Solving the riddles required logical reasoning and the riddles themselves conveyed useful information to the community at large.

In addition to memory, solving a riddle requires possessing some problem-solving ability and specialized knowledge—things memory enables you to learn and retain.

##### The Devaluing of Memory

The oldest records show that having a good memory has long been held in high esteem. **But in the past century, studies of children determined that memorization isn’t the most optimal learning device, and the emphasis on memorization was phased out of schools.** Later, the widespread availability of written and electronic records made having a good memory even less important. Today, a good memory is considered most useful for competing on game shows or doing trivia.

Memorization may not be the best learning device, but it’s a great skill to have to create an ordered mind: Regardless of your circumstances, you can enjoy revisiting the stories, concepts, chemical formulas, song lyrics, or whatever you choose to memorize without needing external stimulation. But you have to want to learn and share the information for its intrinsic value; if you learn and share information just to boost your own ego and control your environment, you won’t feel as satisfied as if you do it to order your consciousness.

**To select the right information, decide what interests you and pay attention to it.** Learn what specific information interests you most and plan to memorize it. For example, if you’re interested in the history of the Civil War, you might discover that you’re most interested in the battles that involved artillery. Structuring memorization around tasks you care about gives you a sense of control and makes it less of a chore.

Consider carrying snippets of information that interests you in order to review it when you’re feeling out of sorts, or have a free moment and want to commit it to memory. This can boost your mood.

#### Ordered Systems

In addition to memory, giving something order requires two steps:

1.**Naming and numbering.** Giving something a name, or a corresponding word, helps you mentally categorize things and think in the abstract. Numbering something gives it a quantity.

2.**Creating concepts.** With names and numbers, you can create concepts to help you understand how things relate to one another. For example, in the 6th-century-B.C.E. in Ancient Greece, Pythagoras and his students tried to discover “numerical laws” that could apply to multiple disciplines, such as music, geometry, and astronomy. Their effort is similar to religion, which seeks to explain how the universe works. The formulas and proofs created during these times supported activities such as map making and predicting seasonal changes, and gave rise to experimental science.

**Imagining hypothetical situations helps people create concepts in a similar way to solving riddles.** For example, Archytas was a 4th-century-B.C.E. town leader who wondered what would happen if he walked to the edge of the universe and stuck out a stick. He reasoned that he’d be able to extend the stick past the edge, which meant that the universe was infinite. Later, Einstein developed his theory of relativity in a similar way by imagining seeing the time on a clock tower from two trains going different speeds.

##### Thinking Is Pleasurable

People developed disciplines such as mathematics and the sciences because thinking and the order it provides was pleasurable—if it weren’t, they might not have developed these disciplines.

But many historians disagree, contending that material determinism—the materials available—dictate how people live. For example, they’d argue that geometry and arithmetic were invented because civilizations such as the Ancient Egyptians needed them to build irrigation systems. In other words, external phenomena, such as needing a new technology, were responsible for the creative feats a society achieved.

But Csikszentmihalyi thinks this is too simplistic. **While external phenomena may determine the ideas that members of a society focus on, it can’t always explain where those ideas came from.** For example, though World War II accelerated research around the development of atomic bombs, the idea of creating such a weapon was developed during more peaceful times by European physicists at a Danish brewery. Put simply, people like thinking so much that they often develop ideas without thinking about the rewards they could gain from them, or their consequences.

Being familiar with a subject and thinking about it can grow your knowledge of as well or better than developing it through external inputs. Philosophers especially are famous for seeming absent-minded when they’re actually hyper-focused thinkers. For example, Democritus, a Greek philosopher, was sometimes seen sitting for days lost in thought and people thought he was ill. Hippocrates, a doctor, tended him and determined he wasn’t going out of his mind; he was dialed into thinking about how the world worked.

#### Using Words: Conversation and Writing

Now that we understand the role of memory and ordered systems, we’ll explore how conversation and different writing forms can elicit flow.

##### Conversation

Conversation has traditionally helped us communicate information, but more recently, the focus on conveying information efficiently has made people lose the skills to enjoy small talk. **However, conversation isn’t just about accomplishing something—it’s a means of confirming that everything is well in the universe, thereby improving the quality of experience for yourself and others.**

For example, if you’re on a walk and say something as simple as, “great weather we’re having today,” to a stranger, you’re not just offering a commentary on the weather—you:

  * Show you’re friendly
  * Acknowledge the person exists
  * Affirm that it’s acceptable to strike up a conversation with someone by talking about the weather
  * Suggest that “great weather” is a worthy thing to want and that it means things are right in the world, providing order to that person’s consciousness



If the person replies, “Gorgeous, right?” that affirms for you that things are in order, too. Another example is small talk from TV or radio hosts—they discuss what’s going on in the world, reaffirming that it’s in order as it should be. **Some researchers think that without obvious statements of how the world is, we’d start to doubt its goodness or order.**

Though many conversations are short, creating quality conversation is a beneficial skill. One way to teach children to become attuned to words is to encourage wordplay with puns. For example, when the child uses a word or phrase that offers two different meanings, pretend to understand the phrase in light of the meaning they didn’t intend. For example, if the child says, “having Aunt Theresa for dinner,” you could feign shock that they’re discussing eating Aunt Theresa herself rather than having her over for dinner. It may encourage them to learn to enjoy commanding language and develop the skills to do it.

##### Writing

Writing is another way to use language creatively. But like conversation, good writing has fallen out of style in favor of conveying information efficiently. **Yet it provides a way to understand your experience and remember it later, giving order to your consciousness.** Here are three kinds of writing to try:

  1. **Poetry.** Writing poetry helps present experiences in a new light while using conventions creatively. Reading poetry is a good way to learn how to write it. With a little training, almost anyone can learn to write poetry that showcases their own experiences.
  2. **Prose.** Even writing basic prose allows you to voice your experience and is more accessible because it lacks conventions like rhyming and meter. Writing letters or journaling are both activities that work well for this purpose.
  3. **Crossword puzzles.** Each clue in a crossword is a mini-riddle, and solving each mini riddle makes you feel accomplished. If you want to take it further, write your own crossword puzzles. That way, you’re not dependent on any outside input. 



### History

Though history doesn’t have as many rules as other disciplines, its framework of placing events in chronological order is enough structure to make it enjoyable; you don’t have to be a historian.

Studying history—your own or someone else’s—has the following benefits:

  * You escape from the present and mentally explore another time.
  * You create a record of a time to draw on later.



There are two methods to study history:

  1. **Study aspects that matter to you.** For example, you could learn about the history of your community by going to museums or reading. As with memorization, focus on the information that interests you rather than exhaustively remembering details. 
  2. **Study or preserve your own history.** For example, you may journal, buy souvenirs to remember a trip, take photographs, or write an account of your family’s history.



### Science

The sciences offer a wide array of interesting topics, questions, and problems to explore. There are rules that limit possible solutions or answers, and the scientific method is a framework for testing ideas. **What motivates people to solve problems is the _challenge_ of solving them, and the satisfaction of having discovered something no one has before, while considerations such as improving the world come second.**

People tend to think it takes an advanced degree, a research lab with expensive equipment, and the ability to manage intricate experiments to be a scientist. Though being part of a research institution can help with securing funding, publishing papers, and receiving recognition, you don’t have to be a trained scientist to enjoy studying science.

Here are the characteristics you need to study science as an amateur:

  * Be curious.
  * **Learn from others’ studies.** Cultivate an openness and skepticism for new ideas so as not to follow those that aren’t supported by facts. 
  * Observe the world and record your observations in detail.
  * Develop an explanation that accounts for your observations.



Here are some examples of modern ways you can interact with science:

  * Start a flower garden and make new crosses.
  * Learn about a health issue that’s impacting you or someone else.
  * Collect different types of rocks and characterize their properties.



### Philosophy

As with the sciences, there are many opportunities to be a philosopher (philosophy originally meant “love of wisdom”) without being part of an elite institution, such as a university or think tank. Here are the basic steps:

  1. **Decide what to focus on.** For example, perhaps you’d like to explore what it means for something to be “beautiful.” 
  2. **See what the field already thinks.** Even if you only read or listen to material that you choose, you’ll glean a sense of what people think on the subject. For example, if you were curious about how reality works, you might focus your studies on ontology, or the branch of philosophy that covers being, and read the works of philosophers that cover it. 
  3. **Write your insights.** Write out the question you had, or the problem confronting you, and share your insight describing your solution. Do it for your own learning rather than hoping it’ll be read and admired someday like famous philosophers. 



### How to Be a Life-Long Learner

If you don’t make an effort to learn and think for yourself once you’re out of school, you’ll be at the whim of what others around you think. **Once you’re done with school, cultivate a desire to learn that comes from internal motivation rather than external motivation to get a passing grade.** Learning what you’re about and how the world around you works is one of the most enriching things you can do to have a fulfilling and meaningful life.
