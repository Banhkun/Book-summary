## Chapter 7: Find Flow at Work

Since you spend a large portion of your life working, whether you enjoy your work can greatly affect your quality of life. This chapter explores what makes work feel worthwhile. First, we’ll look at some of work’s negative connotations. Then, we’ll discuss people’s relationship with work in the U.S., and some examples of people—real and fictional—who successfully make the most of work.

### Work’s Negative Connotations

To understand our relationship with work, we first need to understand the function of it in our life. One reason we work is to satisfy basic needs. If we were content to use our income to meet our basic needs, then work might feel more worthwhile. For example, nomadic peoples of the Kalahari desert hunt and gather for sustenance, but they don’t invest as much energy in maintaining a dwelling or acquiring material goods. As you widen your ambitions to include acquiring expensive material goods, you’ll likely have to invest even more energy into work to afford them.

What work consists of and how different cultures view it varies widely. **Many cultures view work as a necessary part of life, but one to avoid as much as possible.** For example, in the Bible, Adam is sentenced to doing work, which is depicted as an integral part of living in a civilization, yet still undesirable. Work also has negative connotations because some groups of people have been forced into slavery to do work that benefits people in power. For example, slaves built the Great Wall of China and the Egyptian pyramids.

### Study: Our Paradoxical Relationship With Work and Leisure

To examine people’s relationship with work, leisure, and flow, Csikszentmihalyi paged his study participants at eight random times during the day for two weeks and asked them to report several things:

  * What they were doing
  * How they were feeling
  * How many challenges they were dealing with
  * How many skills they were using



**A person was deemed to be experiencing flow when they were dealing with an above-average number of challenges for the week, and they were using an above-average number of skills.** Here are the results:

  * Overall, people reported being in flow about 33 percent of the time.
  * During work, people reported being in flow 54 percent of the time.
  * During leisure—including activities such as eating out, socializing with friends, and watching TV—people reported being in flow just 18 percent of the time. (People also reported being in flow less frequently doing leisure activities that required outside resources, such as equipment or energy, versus those that didn’t.)



The more regularly a person was in flow, the more likely they were to report a high quality of experience. When in flow, they described feeling “active,” “creative,” “concentrated,” “motivated,” and “strong.” In contrast, people experiencing apathy—facing a below-average number of challenges and using a below-average number of skills—described feeling, “dull,” “dissatisfied,” “passive,” and “weak.” People were apathetic:

  * 16 percent of the time at work.
  * 52 percent of the time during leisure.



The type of work and role also affected the _percent of the time_ people experienced flow:

  * Blue-collar workers were less often in flow at work (47 percent) than office workers (51 percent) and managers and supervisors (64 percent).
  * Managers and supervisors experienced flow less often in leisure (15 percent) than office workers (16 percent) and blue-collar workers (20 percent).
  * Managers were less likely to be apathetic at work than blue-collar workers (11 percent versus 23 percent).
  * Blue-collar workers were less likely to be apathetic during leisure than managers (46 percent versus 61 percent).



Lastly, as part of the study, Csikszentmihalyi asked people whether they would rather be doing a different activity. Their response indicates how motivated they feel about their current activity. **This question revealed a paradox: When working, people were more likely to say they would rather be doing something else, even if they were in flow; when in leisure, they were content to keep doing what they were doing, even if they weren’t in flow.** In other words, even though people reported better quality of experience while working, they still wished they had more leisure time.

#### Possible Explanations

There are several ways to explain why someone might strive for more leisure time and less work time, even when work offers higher-quality experiences:

1\. **The work is too challenging.** It’s possible that people’s jobs are so demanding that they prefer to do less-challenging leisure activities, such as watching TV. However, there are plenty of people, whose jobs are demanding, but who still seek out challenging leisure activities, so this isn’t the most viable explanation.

2\. **The work conflicts with your goals.** You might perceive working as being in conflict with your goals in two ways:

  * **Work impedes your goals.** Even if you enjoy your work in the moment, you may not fully appreciate it if you think it detracts from achieving goals that are more meaningful to you.
  * **You work because you have to, not because you want to.** If your only motivation to work is because it pays rather than because it’s satisfying, you’ll be less likely to enjoy it.



3\. **Job dissatisfaction outweighs the benefits of working.** Though you may enjoy some parts of your job, these may not be sufficient to balance the parts you dislike. Ideally, you’d work to improve the dissatisfying elements. Here are three categories of dissatisfaction and their solutions:

  * **Burnout**. When a job demands too much of your attention and you face frequent stress, you might experience burnout. When you’re stressed, it’s difficult to focus and do your best work. What causes stress varies from person to person. For example, someone may find the idea of taking on an additional work project stressful while another will embrace the challenge—it’s about how you perceive the challenges you face. **To reduce stress and improve the quality of your experience, change your attitude about the opportunities available to you and take steps to align your work with your goals.** For example, implementing a new organization system could help streamline aspects of your work so they’re not so stressful. Strategies to cope with stress will be discussed further in Chapter 9.
  * **Little challenge or variety.** Challenging experiences are one way to generate flow. Similarly, a role that allows you to do a variety of tasks rather than one repetitive task is more likely to produce flow. How challenging or how much variety you have in your work depends on how _you_ act on the opportunities available to you rather than the role itself—take advantage of the opportunities you have available to shape the role into what you want it to be.
  * **Coworker conflict.** When you don’t get along with your coworkers, it can sap your energy. To deal with coworker conflict, which can stem from conflicting agendas, it’s best to develop and work on your personal goals while also helping others work on theirs. This is more time consuming than focusing only on your own goals, but it’s usually more satisfying.



### To Find Flow, Adapt or Find New Work

There are two ways to find flow through work:

  1. **Adapt to opportunities.** Recognize opportunities for flow and take advantage.
  2. **Pursue work that’s likely to produce flow experiences.** It’s possible your current job offers few opportunities for flow. Find another line of work that is more conducive to producing flow.



We’ll now discuss the first option in detail. Note: Neither of these strategies alone guarantees that you’ll find flow in work. Ideally, jobs everywhere would be structured to help workers find flow and workers should learn to recognize opportunities to adapt their work into an optimal experience.

#### Adapt to Opportunities

You don’t need glamorous or exciting work to find flow: Master the work’s challenges, build complexity into it, constantly develop new skills, and immerse yourself fully. The rest of this section offers examples.

##### Example 1: Serafina Vinon’s Story

Serafina Vinon is a 76-year-old farmer in a remote alpine community in Italy called Pont Trentaz. Each day, she wakes up at 5 a.m. to milk her cows, after which she cooks breakfast and cards wool or tends her orchard. In the summer, she cuts hay and carries it down the mountain. She could take a direct route, but she prefers to take a winding one to minimize erosion. When she’s not working, she spends time with her great-grandchildren or plays accordion with family and community. **And she doesn’t distinguish between work and leisure time: When asked what she likes doing best, she listed both work activities and leisure activities.** Other older residents of Pont Trentaz responded similarly, as did their children.

But their grandchildren’s responses tended to reflect a greater interest in leisure activities, such as seeing shows, traveling, and reading. Younger generations are typically less content with the status quo and may settle into tradition over time, but it’s more likely they’ll continue to stray from the meaningful work structure developed by the generations before them in favor of leisure instead.

##### Example 2: Joe Kramer’s Story

Joe Kramer works in a factory that assembles railroad cars. **Instead of climbing the ranks from welder to manager, he learned how to perform every task on the assembly line, allowing him to fill in where he’s needed.** He also has a knack for fixing equipment, which he developed by repairing household appliances, such as toasters, during childhood. For his skills, he’s widely considered the most valuable employee in the factory. In his free time, he builds intricate gardens on the two empty lots he and his wife purchased next to their property. The gardens include pathways, terraces, and a sprinkler system. Because he was mostly free to enjoy the gardens at night, he devised a lighting system to shine on the water and illuminate the rainbows created by the spray.

**Kramer has an _autotelic personality_ : He turns ordinary experiences into flow experiences by making use of the opportunities available to him.** In contrast, most other welders interviewed in the study shared the view that work was something impossible to enjoy.
