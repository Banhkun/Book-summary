## Chapter 1: Introduction

Throughout human history, people have sought happiness for its own sake, and have sought other things, such as wealth and power, to achieve happiness. Though we live longer and have more material wealth than ever before, many people think their lives are being wasted and spend time feeling anxious and upset rather than happy.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi wrote _Flow_ to offer insight on cultivating happiness that he learned from researching when people feel the most enjoyment and happiness. **Though it’s not a prescription, he hopes people can use this knowledge to structure their lives to feel happier.** This chapter provides an overview of what happiness is, how our genetics and culture shape our quest for it, and how to cultivate it.

### Sources of Discontent

Understanding what happiness is requires understanding where discontent comes from. Csikszentmihalyi offers two reasons it’s difficult to find happiness:

1\. **The universe is a harsh place.** Cold temperatures and darkness make the universe inhospitable to life. On Earth, disease, natural disasters, and famine have made survival challenging for millions of years.

To weather chaos, humans created myths, religions, and cultural norms. For example, as kids, we’re taught how the world is, and we think living will be better and easier when we’re adults. We also may think that struggle in the present will bring happiness in the future. For example, a teacher might reassure you that a boring class will help you land a job as an adult.

**Discontent occurs when our reality doesn’t match how we’re told the world should be, making happiness feel difficult to achieve.** This happens when people in an established, successful culture think their continued progress is inevitable, but they experience a setback. For example, the Chinese thought their culture would keep advancing until they were conquered by the Mongols.

When we realize life isn’t as easy as we thought, we may:

  * **Ignore it and seek out more of what we’ve been told makes life good.** For example, we may acquire more material wealth, such as fancy cars or a powerful job. But despite our success, we rarely feel satisfied, and we still want more.
  * **Address** **the problem with concrete solutions.** For example, if we realize we’ve gained weight, we may join a health club and make fitness goals to get healthier. While this may help in the short term, it’s impossible to escape the reality that the body isn’t immortal and will eventually wear out. If you don’t come to terms with this, you’ll waste energy feeling upset that your efforts to stay healthy won’t thwart death.
  * **Escape from reality with hobbies, alcohol, or drugs.** Though these can be good distractions, they don’t typically help us find meaning in life.
  * **Turn** **to religion.** Religion is one of the main ways people find meaning in life, but it can be difficult to reconcile with science or other contemporary teachings.
  * **Develop anxiety about the beliefs we held about how the world works and feel disillusioned or apathetic about our purpose in life.** On the extreme end, we may not feel like the world makes sense or want to continue living.



None of these reactions provide long-lasting solutions to the problems we face.

2\. **When we solve challenges, new challenges appear.** For example, finding cures for diseases means people are living longer and overpopulation is harming the planet. Also, when your basic needs are met, you tend to develop new needs. For example, if you achieve a certain level of wealth, you’ll likely want to continue growing it rather than feeling content with what you have.

There’s nothing wrong with continuously working to improve yourself and your life as long as you’re not so fixated on the outcome that you don’t enjoy the present. People who prioritize enjoying the present are able to enjoy whatever they do, even if it’s hard.

### Flow: A Clue Toward Happiness

**Csikszentmihalyi found that people are happy when they feel a sense of control over their thoughts and feelings. When this happens, we experience a flow state: We enjoy ourselves, feel a sense of purpose and meaning, and other things don’t seem to matter as much.** Csikszentmihalyi also refers to these states as “optimal life experiences,” experiences that become a reference point for how life should be. For example, an artist who feels immersed in creating a beautiful painting is experiencing flow. It can also happen when you gain an important insight during tough times.

Optimal experiences occur most frequently when you’re voluntarily working hard to achieve something important. This requires being in control of your circumstances, which is often difficult work. For example, a swimmer who’s swimming the most difficult race of her career may experience muscle cramps and fatigue, but she may look back on the experience as incredibly worthwhile because she directed her actions and accomplished something admirable.

#### What It Takes to Achieve Flow

You may think your thoughts and feelings indicate what will bring you happiness, but this isn’t always true. Your thoughts and feelings may be influenced by biological needs, genetics, or how society has taught you to react in certain situations. According to Freud, socialization persuades people to follow social norms even if they don’t want to—it manipulates our biological needs to make us react predictably to punishments and rewards, thereby maintaining social order. For example, people will likely comply with a dictator’s rule because they’d prefer not to be killed.

**Though it’s okay to seek what feels good and avoid what feels bad, it’s best to think independently so you don’t fall victim to manipulation.** Plus, to consistently overcome life’s challenges, you need to break away from needing external rewards or punishments to achieve success—you have to provide rewards for yourself regardless of your circumstances.

Different disciplines have used different approaches to address this—for example:

  * Yogis teach themselves to resist sexual desire and ignore pain.
  * Zen practitioners create a sense of continuous spontaneity.
  * **Psychoanalysis aims to overcome the id and superego, in favor of the ego.** The id represents the needs of your genes, the superego represents the desires of society, and your ego is your true needs based on your current environment.



Although we’ve developed ways to control our inner thoughts, it’s still difficult to apply this knowledge because:

  1. **Every individual has to do the work.** As with other complex teachings, it’s not enough to simply learn the information—you have to learn it _and_ apply it to your life through trial and error.
  2. **It has to be reshaped to fit the current cultural context.** Society and culture are constantly changing. For ideas to be most effective, they need to be reformulated to match the society they’re being applied in. For example, Zen teachings made a lot of sense for the time and place they were created in, but it can be difficult to apply in modern California because it’s a different time and place. Plus, the emphasis can shift to practicing rituals a certain way rather than embracing what’s most helpful. To overcome this, people need to apply principles as they make sense. For example, Martin Luther cited his grievances with the Catholic Church as a rationale to create new practices that fit better with his version of Christianity.



We’ll discuss specific ways to achieve flow throughout this summary.

### Research Methods

To answer the question of what happiness is, Csikszentmihalyi recruited people around the world to participate in surveys about what made them happy. First, he looked at people who spent a lot of time doing the things they most enjoyed and excelled at it, such as chess players and surgeons. Later, he and his fellow researchers developed a sampling method where participants were asked to write what they were thinking about and feeling when prompted by a pager. Participants received about eight prompts per day. The ideas presented in the book are based on the results of these surveys. The concept of flow has inspired research around the world to understand what makes people happy and improve their quality of life.

### Summary Preview

Each chapter explores a principle of flow and achieving control over your inner life:

  * Chapter 2: Controlling consciousness is the key to flow.
  * Chapter 3: Nine elements characterize enjoyable experiences; cultivate them and recognize opportunities for flow in your life.
  * Chapters 4-6: There are multiple personality characteristics and activities that facilitate finding flow.
  * Chapters 7-8: Learning to find flow at work and in relationships can improve your quality of life.
  * Chapter 9: Life isn’t without its challenges. Learning to enjoy life despite challenges and trauma will improve your quality of life and make you more resilient.
  * Chapter 10: Developing a personalized meaning of life unifies everything you do, turning life into one large flow experience.



Just as it takes effort to be happy, it’ll take effort to apply the concepts in this book to your life. But the effort is worth it.
