## Chapter 4: Activities and Personality Traits That Promote Flow

Though you can experience flow unexpectedly, you’re most likely to experience it when you deliberately take part in certain activities and possess the skills or traits necessary to facilitate it. In this chapter, we’ll explore the activities and personal traits that facilitate flow in detail, as well as obstacles to experiencing flow. First, we’ll discuss how culture shapes flow experiences.

### The Influence of Culture on Flow Experiences

The culture you live in can influence how you experience flow. Cultures are structured to minimize disorder with norms, beliefs, and opportunities for fulfillment. For example, successful governments convince people that supporting the government will help them achieve happiness. **While cultural structure can limit people’s opportunities, it can also streamline their success by helping people channel their energy into achieving a narrow set of goals.** When people work toward specific, challenging goals, they’re more likely to enter flow.

The degree to which cultures actually help people succeed in pursuing their goals and experiencing flow varies widely. It’s easy to judge the success of a culture based on your own culturally shaped values about what success means. To avoid this, and focus on the goals of the people living in a given culture, evaluate success based on:

  * Whether the culture provides opportunities that align with peoples’ goals
  * Whether as many people as possible have the ability to work toward their goals and become complex and skilled over time



Some cultures provide ample access to flow experiences. Here are two examples:

  * The Shushwap region in British Columbia provided an abundance of resources for local native tribes. People lived in the same villages for 25-30 years, enjoying access to plentiful resources such as salmon and tubers. **Eventually, the elders of the tribe recognized that their tribe’s level of enjoyment had waned: Life was too predictable and no one felt challenged.** To overcome this experience, the elders relocated their village to another area where they had to learn how to survive in new terrain, such as the routes prey traveled, where to gather tubers, and the best fishing spots in nearby rivers. The move also helped the previous area they’d lived in recover from their use.
  * One pygmy group in the Democratic Republic of the Congo expects all members to contribute to the enrichment of each other and the tribe. In addition to activities for survival, such as hunting or fishing, members of the group are expected to make art, tell stories, sing, and more.



#### Falling Short

Why do some cultures fall short in offering flow experiences? Here are five scenarios:

  * **The government or culture makes it difficult to survive.** When people are focused on survival, they don’t have time or energy to grow their skills and become more complex.
  * **There’s too much structure.** Similarly, if the culture or government creates too much structure in everyday life, there isn’t time or opportunity for people to seek out meaningful, enjoyable activities.
  * **Societies respond to adverse situations in ways that don’t benefit the people in the long term.** Over time, these responses can become ingrained in cultural customs because people think it’s their only option. For example, Dobu Islanders were steeped in a culture of fear: They believed they could be subjected to sorcery or betrayal from the environment, family, or community at any time. Dobu leaders weren’t trying to make life difficult for their people when they created these customs—they were just responding to their circumstances. 
  * **Members of society are forced to do things that don’t align with their goals.** This creates alienation. For example, a factory worker who has to do the same menial task for hours each day and does so only because they need to feed their family is less likely to experience flow than someone holding a job they like. Alienation is akin to boredom. 
  * **Members of society experience a loss of order or meaning in everyday life.** This is called anomie. When it isn’t clear what rules people should follow or what people value, those who depend on societal order for their own personal order start worrying. For example, this can occur when prosperity increases quickly and a long-held value like hard work becomes less relevant. It can also occur during an economic downturn when it can be harder to find work, which makes it harder to meet basic needs.



#### Measuring Success

We don’t have a definitive way to measure how successful different cultures are at providing flow experiences, but surveys offer clues. **For example, development, wealth, and the stability of a government increase the likelihood that a country’s residents will report living more fulfilling lives.** Despite high rates of divorce and crime compared to other developed countries, the U.S. ranks high for the level of satisfaction among its residents. Csikszentmihalyi attributes this to how much time and money we spend on happiness-enhancing activities—the average U.S. resident spends their waking hours each week in the following ways:

  * 30 hours working
  * 10 hours “working” (talking to coworkers, daydreaming, and other goofing off)
  * 20 hours doing leisure activities like watching TV, socializing, exercising, or reading
  * 50-60 hours on bodily maintenance and unstructured free time



Note: Leisure time doesn’t translate to time in a flow state. As we’ve discussed, the leisure activities many gravitate toward, like watching TV, don’t produce a flow state. You’re four times more likely to experience flow doing your work than watching TV. This is one of the biggest paradoxes of our times: We have more time for leisure activities, yet we don’t seem to enjoy our lives more than previous generations. **This is because having opportunities for enjoyment isn’t enough—developing the skills to enjoy opportunities and developing the ability to control consciousness are just as important.** Without these abilities, we can end up overwhelmed with the resources available to us or bored because we don’t push ourselves to develop our skills. We’ll discuss these concepts further, particularly in Chapter 7: Find Flow at Work.

### The Structures of Flow-Producing Activities

Many activities have been developed around helping participants and audiences achieve flow. Games, sports, religious rituals, and art are examples. Regardless of the activity, every flow experience Csikszentmihalyi studied helped people become more complex through:

  1. Developing a new sense of self
  2. Achieving a specific goal
  3. Improving performance of the activity
  4. Experiencing a new reality



Your consciousness becomes more complex doing activities in several stages. When engaging with an activity, you enter and exit a flow state depending on whether you’ve reached your current goal, and you never stay in the same state for long. The stages are:

  1. **Flow 1.** You start an activity and immediately have to master certain skills to do it well. For example, if you’re learning to play tennis, just learning how to hit the ball over the net will likely occupy your time at first. However, it’s a concrete goal with clear feedback that you’ll soon achieve. 
  2. **Boredom or Anxiety.** Once you’ve achieved your goal, what used to be difficult is now easy. In the tennis example, hitting a ball over the net becomes too easy, causing you to be bored and exit flow. Or you may face an opponent who is more skilled, making you feel anxious and exiting flow.
  3. **Flow 2.** Flow 2 occurs when you leave your anxious or bored state by working toward new goals. In the tennis example, you might practice a new skill, such as hitting the ball toward the outer edge of your opponent’s court. Once you’ve achieved these goals, you may slip back into Boredom or Anxiety, at which point you’ll have to develop new goals. 



Each time you return to flow to pursue a new goal, you’ve become a more complex person with new skills that enable you to take on greater challenges.

#### Categories of Flow-Producing Games and Activities

There are four categories of games and activities; each offers optimal experiences for different reasons:

  1. **Aleatory.** These activities center on random chance. Winning these games can provide a sense of power or provide a plan of action. For example, the Chinese try to divine the future based on the patterns of dropped sticks. Trying to understand the present and future is a strategy for ordering consciousness. Even winning a game like bingo is fun because its structure makes the odds feel in your favor despite the random gameplay.
  2. **Mimicry.** Mimicry is any activity that creates an alternate reality using disguise or fantasy. Art forms, such as dance and theater, fall in this category. For example, members of the Yaqui Indian tribe of Mexico dressed as deer—their prey—in ceremonies because it made them feel kinship with the animals. 
  3. **Vertigo.** This category includes activities that directly modify your perception, such as spinning or doing drugs. It’s the most direct way to reorder consciousness, and though it might make you think you’ve expanded your consciousness, this isn’t possible—you can’t expand consciousness; you can only reorder it, which might give you the impression you’ve expanded it.
  4. **Competition-centered.** The Latin root of the word competition means, “seeking together.” In competitive activities, you feel most satisfied when your skills are well-matched with those of your opponent, and you’re able to push yourself to win. If you have more skills than your opponent, winning is easy and boring. If you aren’t as skilled, competition can make you feel anxious because you’d like to win, but you can tell you don’t have the skills.



### Personality and Flow

In addition to culture and the activities at your disposal, your ability to experience flow may depend on the experiences you had growing up and the habits you’ve acquired. Some people seem able to take advantage of all kinds of opportunities, while others are unmoved. **If you’re naturally inclined toward finding flow in everyday experiences, you have an autotelic personality.** But even if you don’t have an autotelic personality, research suggests that most people are able to increase their ability to find flow with practice.

If you have an autotelic personality, you likely habitually do four things:

1\. **Observe the environment** and decide what opportunities you have to act.

2.**Set goals.** Setting goals can occur in one of two ways:

  * **You develop a goal to overcome a specific challenge.** For example, if you have strong customer service skills from working as a waiter, but you want to use those skills to make a difference in the world, you might develop the goal of becoming a nurse. This choice implies you’ll need additional training to achieve your goal.
  * **You already have a certain skill set and develop a goal to use it or further hone it.** For example, you quit your job at the office to start a bed and breakfast. You may not have done similar work, but you think you already have skills, such as business management, to successfully achieve it.



Once you’ve set the goal, monitor feedback as you develop new skills and adjust your behavior accordingly. In the nurse example, you might need to take additional chemistry classes. If you get a low grade on a quiz, this might indicate that you need to use a different technique to study the material. **On the whole, you recognize that pursuing the goal is your choice and feel empowered to make it suitable for you; you don’t feel forced to work on it for external reasons, such as the wishes of your parents.**

Sometimes, people set goals that are too ambitious and become disillusioned when they don’t succeed. For example, if you try to become a millionaire before you’re 20 but don’t succeed, you might respond by drastically scaling back your ambitions. Or you may doubt your potential from the start and set the achievement bar low to avoid failing. To avoid these pitfalls, choose realistic opportunities that match the skills you have or will soon develop.

3\. **Concentrate on activities.** Your ability to enjoy an experience and successfully do something depends on your ability to concentrate and sustain your attention. People with autotelic personalities focus their attention so they’re immersed in an activity. For example, a basketball player is so focused that she can make a basket without being distracted by the crowd.

Concentrating on an activity involves becoming less self-conscious: Rather than worrying about what you’re doing, you neutrally look at the situation and adjust accordingly. Thinking so deeply about the activity you’re doing may naturally push your worries about yourself out of your mind, or you may naturally be unselfconscious, which allows you to immerse yourself in the activity. Either way, deep concentration helps you enjoy the activity and feel part of a system bigger than yourself.

4\. **Enjoy a variety of experiences.** People with autotelic personalities are able to enjoy a variety of activities, even when life is objectively harsh. This includes diligently seeking enjoyment instead of thinking things will just work out.

### Obstacles to Flow

Even if you’re predisposed to focus on your shortcomings and focus inwardly when circumstances get tough, it’s possible to cultivate a more autotelic personality with practice. This requires first understanding the personal and familial obstacles people face when seeking flow experiences.

#### Personal Obstacles

Personal obstacles can be mental or genetic.

##### Mental Obstacles

There are four neurological reasons you might have difficulty experiencing flow:

  1. **You have an attention disorder.** Attention disorders encompass a variety of learning disabilities. Most often, individuals have difficulty focusing their attention on a specific task. 
  2. **You have schizophrenia.** People with schizophrenia are unable to selectively filter information in their environment. Instead, they process all information and feel overwhelmed.
  3. **You’re self-conscious.** Self-conscious people worry about doing something wrong or how they appear to others. Because their attention is focused on themselves, they’re robbed of the energy to feel enjoyment, which often involves a loss of self-consciousness.
  4. **You’re self-centered.** Self-centered people judge all information on the basis of its usefulness to them. They spend too much time focusing on fulfilling their current goals and don’t seek new opportunities for enjoyment. For example, they might believe a person who could become a friend but who can’t help them in their current pursuits isn’t worth talking to. 



In sum, all mental obstacles to flow involve attention: For people with attention disorders or schizophrenia, attention is too scattered, but for self-conscious and self-centered people, attention is too focused on the self.

##### Genetic Obstacles

Some people may be genetically predisposed to ordering their consciousness and enjoying life. In one study, participants were asked to look at an image of an ambiguous shape popping out of a background and reverse it in their mind so that the shape receded into the background. Participants who reported enjoying their lives had to look at just a few points on the image to complete the task, whereas those who reported less enjoyment needed to look at more points.

**The findings support the idea that happier people need fewer external cues to complete tasks.** They’re able to control their thoughts and experiences independently from their environment, which leads to more enjoyment.

In a similar study, participants were divided into two groups based on whether they regularly experienced flow. First, a machine measured a participant’s baseline brain activity, or cortical activity. Then, each person was asked to concentrate on tones and flashes of light while the machine continued to monitor cortical activity. In participants who reported not experiencing flow regularly, brain activity increased from their baseline activity when exposed to the stimuli. But in the group that reported regular flow experiences, cortical activity actually decreased below their baseline.

**These results suggest that people who experience flow regularly have flexible attention: They filter out irrelevant information, focusing only on what’s needed to complete the task.** This is different from people with schizophrenia and others with attentional disorders and could be the defining characteristic of an autotelic personality. However, though it’s clear that flow and the ability to focus attention are related, more studies are needed to determine whether:

  * Having flow experiences boosts the ability to focus attention, or vice versa.
  * Focusing attention is learned or genetically inherited.



#### Familial Obstacles

How your parents interacted with you, starting from a young age, can affect your ability to order your life and experience flow as an adult. There are five things parents can do to encourage flow, which parallel the nine elements of enjoyment:

  1. **Offer choices.** Children need to feel they have choices and feel empowered to accept the consequences of those choices. 
  2. **Provide increasingly complex opportunities.** As a child grows into a more complex individual, parents need to ensure that they provide increasingly complex opportunities for the child’s growth and development.
  3. **Trust in the child’s choices.** If a child is interested in something, her parents should make her feel safe, comfortable, and unselfconscious about pursuing it. 
  4. **Support the child’s present-day interests.** Parents shouldn’t constantly hound the child about doing things in the present to support her future, such as studying to get into a good college—instead, show an interest in her present-day experiences and feelings.
  5. **Establish clear expectations.** Parents should provide clear goals and consistently give feedback so the child knows exactly what her parents expect of her.



In some families, a lot of time and energy is spent negotiating what children spend time on and what they do at any given moment, making children feel at the whim of others’ goals for them. In contrast, in families that apply the five previous principles, children know what is expected and feel supported pursuing activities and goals that matter to them. One study demonstrated that teenagers whose parents provided this framework were more content overall and resilient in different situations. **Children who experience abuse, or whose parents threaten to stop loving them, have to dedicate their energy to keeping themselves whole, and they don’t have energy to dedicate themselves to many outside pursuits.** As adults, they may seek pleasure however they can.
