## Exercise: What’s Your Coping Style?

Reflect on your coping style.

* * *

Think of a recent time you experienced a major setback. How did you react at the time and in the days and weeks that followed?

What coping style does your behavior reflect: Negative, positive, or a mix? How does your behavior reflect this style?

In a similar future situation, is there anything you’d do differently to push yourself toward a more positive coping response? Why or why not?
