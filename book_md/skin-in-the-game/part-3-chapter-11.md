## Part 3 | Chapter 11: Skin in the Game of Philosophy and Religion

We’ve extensively covered the areas in which skin in the game is responsible for ethical, productive behavior in our world, as well as the ways in which a lack of skin in the game causes systemic harm.

For the final section of our guide, we’re going to examine Taleb’s bold, sweeping claims that skin in the game reveals the meaning of life and religion. He argues that skin in the game reveals that **what we truly value above all else is the survival of the human race**. With this in mind, Taleb then argues that **religious belief is rational in the sense that it contributes to our survival.**

First, we’ll explain how skin in the game is the only thing that’s truly “real.” Then, we’ll show how skin in the game reveals that the end goal of all humanity is survival. Finally, we’ll build support for Taleb’s argument that religion is fundamentally rational by showing how it contributes to our survival and arguing that everyone is religious to a certain extent.

### Defining “Real”

Risk taking—skin in the game—is the essence of life itself. As Taleb puts it, “real life is risk taking.” He means this literally—by definition, a life without risk is not a real life. Let’s break down exactly what Taleb means by “real.”

Taleb is saying that risk defines what we consider to be reality and creates meaning by defining value.

#### Skin in the Game Determines What We Call Reality

In a metaphysical sense, skin in the game is how we define reality. Risk is what separates reality from fiction. Movies aren’t “real” because their events have no lasting consequences. They’re entirely without risk. Taleb asserts that this is why dreams aren’t real. When we wake up, they have no lasting consequences.

Taleb brings up a thought experiment posed by philosophers: Imagine we were able to plug ourselves into an “experience machine” that could create the illusion of real life. We would see, hear, and feel a full world for an extended period of time, but it would all be implanted in our brains instantly. Would that experience be real? Taleb says no—because of the absence of risk or lasting consequences.

> **The Experience Machine’s Libertarian Roots**
> 
> This “experience machine” thought experiment was first posed by philosopher Robert Nozick in his 1974 book _Anarchy, State and Utopia_. Nozick was a libertarian who wrote _Anarchy, State and Utopia_ as a counterargument to the political philosophy of John Rawls. The experience machine is intended to support his argument that maximal pleasure for as many people as possible cannot be the end goal of society, as some people seek higher values than pleasure (and so should not have their behavior limited by the government except when necessary to preserve human rights).
> 
> To prove that some people seek higher values than pleasure, Nozick argues that even if the experience machine could provide whatever pleasurable experience you could want, some people would refuse to plug into the machine, because they want things that the machine can’t give them—for example, to live up to a higher ideal in the “real” world by staying and providing for their family.

#### Skin in the Game Is What Makes Us Human

Skin in the game is at the core of everything valuable or meaningful.

Humans emotionally connect to the idea of risk and loss—it’s baked into our neurology. This is because **how much we value something can be measured by how much we’re willing to risk for it.**

If you want something, you’re going to need to sacrifice something to get it—for example, if you want a larger income, you need to spend time and effort to secure a raise at work or find a new job. Even then, you’ll never know for sure that you’ll get the raise you want. This is where risk comes into play—our world is inherently uncertain. Every sacrifice you make to get something you want is a risk.

In this way, risk and sacrifice are the core of human experience. **Risk is what makes us human.**

> **Why Do Humans Find Stories Meaningful?**
> 
> In his book Story, screenwriting teacher Robert McKee argues that stories “entertain when they give the audience a _fresh model of life_ empowered with an affective meaning” [emphasis added]. Humans are on a never-ending quest for meaning. We want to figure out what will make us happy—more than that, we want to know what is worth sacrificing for.
> 
> Like Taleb, McKee understands that we define value by how much we’re willing to risk, and he makes it a central tenet of his writing advice. Characters in stories need to have something to lose, or else it becomes obvious that nothing in the story matters, and the audience gets bored. Stories with stakes are engaging because they have a chance of showing us a new situation where meaning can be found.

#### The Origin of Value

So, skin in the game is a reflection of value, but this still doesn’t answer the question: **Why do we value what we value?**

Taleb frames everything we are, everything we do, everything we risk, as a means toward one end: the survival of the human race. Everything we feel an emotional attachment to is, somehow, intended to motivate us to keep the human collective alive.

All of society is one group effort to help us all live for as long as possible. We build houses to protect us from nature, we build cities to help us collaboratively fulfill our survival needs, and we create technology to help us live longer and easier lives.

In order to achieve these goals, each of us needs to make countless sacrifices over the course of our lives—it takes sacrifice to build a career that benefits society and to forge mutually fulfilling relationships. Skin in the game is what it means to be human because being human means being wired to contribute to the collective's survival.

> **Irrational Beauty**
> 
> Taleb doesn’t comment on beauty or art—the things we value highly, but don’t seem to have much practical value when it comes to survival. Immanuel Kant defined beauty as that which is pleasurable, yet not a means to another end. That is, not a biological pleasure like food or sex (which would, by Kant’s definitions, be “agreeable”) nor a conceptual pleasure that makes you happy because you _rationally know_ it will help you get what you want, like a house or a car (which Kant would call “good”). Music, art, and aesthetics are “beautiful.” In this way, Kant defines beauty specifically as what Taleb would call “irrational,” as it seems to serve no greater purpose.
> 
> If that’s the case, how would Taleb explain how much humans value beauty? Artists often bear tremendous risk and sacrifice in order to create something beautiful, showing, by Taleb’s definition, that they value it, despite it not contributing to humanity’s survival. By his logic, Taleb would have to argue that beauty serves some practical purpose for humanity that we can’t easily identify. For example, beauty could merely be an intense drive for pattern detection that motivates us to discover subtle information valuable for survival. An unromantic way of looking at the world, for sure.

### Redefining Rationality

With this conception of humanity in mind, Taleb redefines what is “rational.” Instead of defining rational beliefs as those that align with our understanding of the way the world works, **Taleb argues that we should see any belief that enables survival as rational.**

It’s impossible to judge the rationality of beliefs using logic and abstraction. The universe is too incomprehensibly complex—there will always be unknown factors that could lead us to faulty conclusions. Even if we did possess complete knowledge of the universe, no one on Earth would be able to effectively process that information into a usable mental model. We need a different way to determine the rationality of beliefs.

To this end, Taleb believes in a “natural selection” of beliefs: **Any belief that has survived for several generations is rational because those who held that belief have survived and chosen to pass it down.** This is an extension of the Lindy effect—time is the only impartial judge of quality.**** In this view of rationality, even beliefs that are distorted or outright untrue can be “rational” if they cause us to behave in a way that helps us survive.

> **Critique of Taleb’s Rationality**
> 
> This definition of rationality is a recurring point of contention among Skin in the Game’s critics. If we were to totally refrain from abstract judgment of beliefs and instead wait for them to play out over years to see if they survive, truly irrational beliefs could cause massive amounts of suffering—as an extreme example, if the Allied Forces had allowed Nazi Germany’s ideas to play out, they could have destroyed the world. It’s necessary to label some beliefs as irrational.
> 
> It’s impractical to assume that _all_ new beliefs are inferior to traditional ones. Taleb’s assertion that “everything that survives survives for a reason” doesn’t necessarily prove his more extreme point that every belief that _has survived_ has aided that survival. Sometimes, beliefs survive _despite_ hurting our chances of survival—people believed in medicinal bloodletting for thousands of years.
> 
> Additionally, the world is constantly changing, and we have reason to believe that it’s changing faster and faster. Even if a belief has been successful at promoting survival for the past several millennia, this doesn’t 100% prove that it will continue to do so forever—this is the main idea in Taleb’s own _The Black Swan_. The world is inherently unpredictable and can change in unpredictable ways.

This leads us to Taleb’s major argument that we’ll be discussing for the rest of the guide: **Lasting traditional religions are all rational belief systems because they aid humanity’s survival.** In order to explain why, we need to first take a look at loss aversion—the human instinct to overestimate the pain we’d feel upon losing something.

#### Loss Aversion Helps Us Avoid Ruin

Most psychologists describe humans’ sense of loss aversion as irrational. They justify this with math—studies show that people are willing to overpay to insure against financial loss. (Shortform note: Check out examples of this in our guide to Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

In Taleb’s view, however, loss aversion is very rational. It’s a mental bias that helps us survive. He takes into account one factor that, he claims, invalidates the conclusions of most social scientists who attempt to deal with probability: the effect of “ruin.”

“Ruin” is a state of loss that you can’t come back from. If a business suffers enough losses that it’s forced to shut down, it’s ruined. Even if its profits would skyrocket in the next quarter, it doesn’t matter. The business has suffered a permanent loss.

Opportunities for ruin are all around us, yet they’re largely ignored when academics try to analyze risk. It’s impossible to mathematically calculate risk versus reward when ruin is a potential outcome because no benefit could outweigh the finality of ruin.

Taleb uses the example of Russian Roulette. Imagine someone offers you one million dollars to load one bullet into a six-chamber pistol, spin the cylinder, and fire at your own head. Traditional cost-benefit analysis would conclude that, on average, you can expect to make $833,333. That doesn’t sound too bad! In reality, however, almost no one would take this deal. **Cost-benefit analysis leads to invalid conclusions if you’re risking a permanent loss.**

With this in mind, the human instinct to overcompensate and avoid risks appears to be more rational. Even if there’s only a tiny chance of total ruin, it’s worth it to take precautions against it. For example, only about 5% of home insurance owners ever successfully file a claim—yet around 85% of homeowners insure their homes. On average, you’d come out ahead financially if you refuse to get home insurance, but it’s worth it to hedge your bets against ruin.

Additionally, **risks are cumulative toward ruin**. Our tendency to overestimate loss is a reflection of _all_ the risks we bear, across our lives, not just any individual risk. If you lack loss aversion and take many undue risks—for example, you frequently forget to pay your credit card bills and hurt yourself parkouring—the costs add up, and you could find yourself in financial ruin. **A hypersensitive aversion to small losses helps avoid a cumulative permanent loss.**

> **Why Taleb Hates _Nudge_**
> 
> As we’ll see, Taleb uses the rationality of loss aversion to explain his view of religion—but of course, he can’t help insulting economist Richard Thaler again on the way there, calling him a “creepy interventionist.” Why does he resent Thaler so much?
> 
> In his book _Nudge_ , Thaler argues that those offering choices should “nudge” people to make better, more “rational” decisions, without forcibly coercing them. Thaler uses loss aversion as an example of “irrational” behavior that should be discouraged—for example, he argues that employers should make their employees’ retirement accounts operate by a fixed, wise investment strategy by default, as loss aversion makes employees who are forced to choose their own strategies make irrational decisions that end up costing them money. Taleb argues that such discouragement would prevent people from creating strategies that protect themselves from ruin.
> 
> Taleb further details his argument against Richard Thaler’s “Nudging” in his Scala Politica. His main problem is that since those doing the “nudging” lack skin in the game, they’re not held accountable for any unforeseen side effects of their large-scale intervention. In Taleb’s eyes, these side effects are inevitable due to the complexity of large-scale systems.
> 
> Because groups operate differently at different scales, Taleb makes the point that **behavior that is rational for an individual may be irrational for the collective**. He uses the example that if people are “nudged” to invest their retirement accounts in the same basket strategies that provide the safest benefits for the individual, the collective as a whole will suffer from a lack of diversity in strategy. The potential damage of one Black Swan event multiplies.
> 
> Taleb does brush past one of Thaler’s main points: Thaler explicitly supports “libertarian paternalism”—the libertarian part of which means that the government should avoid limiting someone’s choices. Taleb exaggerates the decision-making power “nudgers” want to have. Still, this doesn’t defeat the logic of Taleb’s argument, as even small “nudges” have an intense, multiplied impact when applied at scale.

Taleb asserts that there’s no reason to ever risk ruin directly. **There is always a way to take risks without enabling the possibility of ruin.** This is why Taleb opposes the consumption of genetically modified crops. In his eyes, there are many other ways to feed the world that lack potential unknown dangers.

(Shortform note: This idea is summed up in Taleb’s “barbell strategy” from _The Black Swan._ Instead of investing in a single “moderately risky” venture, invest a lot of money in an extremely safe way and the rest in extremely aggressive, risky ventures with the potential for huge upside. By pursuing both extremes, you protect yourself from the rare risk of ruin and open up the possibility of an extremely rare windfall.)

With this view of risk and ruin in mind, Taleb presents a new perspective on religion.

### The Rationality of Religion

Taleb claims that the ultimate purpose of religion is to offset the _risks of societal ruin_ caused by humans’ self-serving instincts, and as such, it’s extremely rational.

**Religion is society’s expression of loss aversion.** Just as each of us plays it safe in all the little areas of our lives to avoid cumulative ruin, religion ensures that as many people as possible live in ways that avoid contributing to the risk of destroying the human race.

This is why religions impose commandments on their adherents—these rules are a way for entire civilizations to hedge their bets against moral deviance. These rules are typically simple, without gray areas, and err on the side of restriction and safety. This makes them easy to teach, difficult to misunderstand, and more likely to avoid the risks of moral ambiguity. Consider the 10 Commandments. If a society is deeply, _spiritually_ compelled to obey commandments like “You shall not steal,” “You shall not murder,” or “You shall not commit adultery,” it’s going to be a more stable, productive society.

A single small theft of one of your neighbor’s sheep isn’t going to have much of a harmful effect on society. But if everyone is constantly stealing every little thing they can get away with, society will suffer. **A widespread, oversensitive aversion to these sins mitigates the cumulative damage to the collective.**

Additionally, religion provides a visible sense of group identity that encourages collaboration and self-sacrifice. Taleb supposes that other benefits of religion that aren’t immediately apparent exist, too—most importantly, **the fact that the vast majority of surviving human civilizations have formed lasting organized religions speaks to the efficacy of religious belief**.

> **Another Purpose of Religion**
> 
> Taleb is a vocal admirer of the philosopher John Gray, calling him the wisest living person today. Although Gray is an atheist (unlike Taleb, who is a practicing Greek Orthodox), he shares a similar stance on religion as Taleb, criticizing the hostility toward religion held by “evangelical atheists.” Gray argues that religion is a historical prerequisite for a society built on liberal, humanist values such as human equality and personal autonomy.
> 
> Gray points out that “new atheists” like Sam Harris hold the assumption that widespread scientific understanding rationally results in a society built on liberal values. Gray, however, states that there is no link between scientific advancement and liberal values, as evidenced by historical ideological movements that are illiberal, yet founded in science and atheism, like Stalinism and Maoism.
> 
> Liberal values like freedom and justice cannot be taken for granted as universally accepted virtues. There have been many ideologies, religious and secular, that deliberately reject these ideas—Gray cites the Salafi Islam of Boko Haram and Pol Pot’s communism in Cambodia. Specific moral perspectives like liberalism aren’t prewritten within the human heart.
> 
> Instead, Gray argues that religious beliefs are what spawned the idea of the uniquely valuable human soul—the foundation of liberal values. There would be no liberal humanism without religion. Gray cites Nietzsche, who recognized this fact and rejected both liberalism and the religions that he saw as responsible for it. Even the idea of the separation of church and state is founded in Christian thought, established in the Bible and by ancient Christians like Saint Augustine.

#### In Practice, Religious and Secular Beliefs Are Very Similar

The final point we’ll discuss from Taleb's argument (that religion should not be dismissed as irrational) is that **in practice, religious beliefs are not too different from secular beliefs**.

To explain, Taleb distinguishes between two types of beliefs, which we’ll call Metaphysical Beliefs and Actionable Beliefs. Metaphysical Beliefs are those that explain how the world works and why, while Actionable Beliefs are those that dictate how people should act. For example, the idea that God created the world is a Metaphysical Belief, while the idea that you shouldn’t steal is an Actionable Belief.

Taleb asserts that **religions are often judged based on their Metaphysical Beliefs, when they should be judged based on their Actionable Beliefs.** The philosophical underpinnings of any worldview don’t matter—only the actions of its adherents have the power to help or harm. Additionally, the link between Metaphysical and resulting Actionable Beliefs isn’t as predictable as most would think.

Philosophies and religions that seem like complete opposites when considering their Metaphysical Beliefs often end up looking quite similar when you examine their Actionable Beliefs. For example, most modern Christians behave identically to atheists in important matters—they go to the hospital when they’re sick or injured and obey the laws of secular governments.

Similarly, **atheists often do things that appear religious** ,**revealing further overlap in Actionable Beliefs**. Meditation and yoga are both popular among atheists, and nearly all atheists partake in rituals of some kind—weddings and funerals, for instance.

Additionally, Taleb sees no difference between the Metaphysical Beliefs held by religious people and the Metaphysical Beliefs held by atheists, in the sense that they both require faith in something you can’t see. For example, atheists often have faith in the efficacy of a complex government or the invisible hand of the free market—powers that you trust are working, even if you can’t see or fully understand them.

To summarize, Taleb asserts that everyone is similarly “religious” to some degree, so it would be hypocritical to immediately dismiss organized religion as irrational.

Religion is rational because it emotionally compels people to live with skin in the game, and as we’ve established, this is the foundation of an honorable, fulfilling life.

> **Values Matter More Than Beliefs**
> 
> Similarly to Taleb, novelist David Foster Wallace equates religious and atheist ideologies in his 2005 Kenyon College Commencement Speech “This is Water,” which was later republished in book form.
> 
> Wallace argues that “there is actually no thing as atheism.” Like Taleb, Wallace downplays the Metaphysical beliefs of any worldview, instead focusing on the direction and meaning it adds to your life. In his eyes, the most important characteristic of any religion or ideology is _the value system it causes you to live by._ Any worldview that tells you what is important and why is a religion, and some of these value systems are far healthier than others.
> 
> Wallace explains that some people worship money, power, or beauty, measuring how well they’re fulfilling the purpose of life by these materialistic values. But these values are temporary and largely out of your control. If you pursue materialistic values, you’ll never feel like you have enough and fall into helpless despair when they’re gone. Like Taleb, Wallace judges traditional religion favorably, as, compared to these materialistic ideologies, it provides a more reliable source of purpose and meaning founded on virtuous principles.
> 
> Wallace’s point with this commencement speech was to explain the true value of education. By being exposed to new ideas and different perspectives, the student is really learning how to detach from assumptions and _consciously choose_ how to interpret the world around them. They’re learning how to avoid the default setting of simply worshipping whatever their parents, friends, or culture worships, becoming aware when they are chasing something that can’t be caught and adjusting accordingly.
