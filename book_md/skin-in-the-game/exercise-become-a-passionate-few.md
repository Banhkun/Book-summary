## Exercise: Become a Passionate Few

The idea of the passionate few reveals that most of us vastly overestimate what it takes to change the way things are done. Consider how to use this knowledge to improve your life.

* * *

Think of a current status quo that you’d like to change. This could be an annoying procedure or unnecessary rule at work, or maybe an ingrained habit in your household.

Imagine you knew that nearly everyone involved would gladly let you have your way, as the rule of the passionate few assumes. Are you passionate enough to make the change happen? Why or why not?

What’s a step you can take to make this change happen?
