## Chapter 10: Skin-in-the-Game Problems of War and Peace

We’re going to conclude our exploration of those areas of life that suffer from a lack of skin in the game by discussing the role skin in the game plays in war and peace.

Taleb argues that **populations with skin in the game tend to fight shorter, relatively non-destructive wars** , and that**all the bloodiest conflicts in history were driven by third parties without skin in the game**.

In this section, we’ll start by showing why Taleb sees peace as the dominant status of civilization and how, when left to their own devices, people tend to resolve conflict and collaborate. Then, we’ll explain how institutions without skin in the game perpetuate war, even when they intend to create peace. Finally, we’ll explore why so many people falsely assume that the natural state of civilization is ceaseless, destructive conflict, which leads them to believe that institutions without skin in the game need to intervene.

### Humans Progress Toward Peace

Typically, over time, people find ways to coexist peacefully. Conflict is an inescapable consequence of human interaction, but **Taleb frames war as a stepping-stone toward longer eras of peace and collaboration.**

War puts mass skin in the game, not only for the people doing the fighting, but everyone who bears the risks of war—all civilians who suffer domestic turmoil and a stressed economy. The mutual drain of resources required by war puts constant pressure for peace on both sides.

According to Taleb, conflict is much more the exception than the rule. In most cases, both sides decide relatively quickly what trades or concessions they are willing to make, and peace is restored. In this way, people with skin in the game tend toward peace and collaboration.

> **The War of Peace**
> 
> Taleb has engaged in a lengthy feud with psychologist Steven Pinker on the topic of whether or not violence has declined over the course of history. Taleb’s chapter on war is partially a response to Pinker’s 2011 book _The Better Angels of Our Nature_ , in which he argues that the world is safer and more peaceful than ever before.
> 
> Pinker credits this in part to powerful democratic human institutions such as the United Nations that Taleb disdains. Taleb argues that the seventy or so years of overwhelming peace we’ve had since World War II could simply be a statistically predictable gap between massive wars, and that centralized institutions intended to create peace often cause more conflict than they resolve, as we’ll see next.

### Institutions Propel War

There is an exception, however. **All the longest and most intense conflicts are driven by institutions without skin in the game of the war.** If the ones ordering the war aren’t personally suffering its dire consequences, it’s more likely to continue.

For Taleb, this is another reason why decentralized states are better than a large unified nation—centralized governments are more likely to participate in deadlier wars because the decision-makers are farther away from the people making the sacrifices.

This idea can be illustrated by the widespread disillusionment of Americans regarding the Vietnam War. In 1970, two-thirds of Americans believed the war was a mistake, yet it continued until 1975. Since the central decision-makers had power over the entire US population, many people were drafted and suffered as a result of someone else’s beliefs—a skin in the game asymmetry which prolonged the conflict.

#### Problems With Externally-Imposed Peace

In Taleb’s view, once conflict has begun, only those engaged in the conflict have the ability to stop it. **Foreign efforts to implement peace by powers without skin in the game cause more problems than they solve.**

They often entirely misunderstand the wars’ root causes, due to their lack of direct experience with the conflict.

Even if a war is settled on paper among dignitaries, if the people themselves aren’t the ones to reconcile, the underlying conflict won’t go away.

> **Institutional Failures in the Israeli-Palistinian Conflict**
> 
> In the book, Taleb argues this point with the example of the Israeli-Palestine Conflict, which has been raging for more than seventy years—due to foreign intervention, in Taleb’s eyes. Let’s take a quick simplified look at key moments in the history of this conflict through the lens of skin in the game.
> 
> Arguably, the first significant foreign intervention spurring this conflict was the 1917 Balfour Declaration, when Britain gave an undefined part of Palestine to Zionists lobbying for the creation of a Jewish homeland there. The Jewish population in Palestine grew, and hostility between them and the Arabs already there intensified to the point of armed conflict. In 1947, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, the United Nations gave Jews their own state, Israel, prompting Palestinians to go to war to reclaim the land, supported by foreign intervention from the Arab League. They lost the war, prompting Israel to take even more Palestinian land.
> 
> At each of these events, foreign bodies without skin in the game intervened at a distance from the consequences. Taleb argues that if, at either one of these junctures, world powers would have simply let Israel and Palestine solve their own problems, the conflict would have been resolved by now.
> 
> In 1993, a pair of peace treaties called the Oslo Accords were signed between the Israeli and Palestinian governments, but this didn’t last long, because, Taleb argues, “no peace proceeds from bureaucratic ink”—the people actually living in Israel and Palestine were dissatisfied with this agreement. In Taleb’s eyes, both states’ governments lacked skin in the game, as neither side achieved the desires of the people they were representing.

### People Overestimate Historical Conflict

Taleb argues that people mistakenly believe in the need for strong institutions to establish peace because of the assumption that without the order of a centralized government, the natural state of coexisting societies is constant bloody turmoil.

He challenges this assumption, suggesting that most people vastly overestimate the toll of small-scale wars and conflict throughout history. Why?

  * Academic accounts of history give a warped perspective
  * Interference due to the availability heuristic
  * People assume frequent conflict means worse conflict



#### Academic Distortion

Taleb accuses historians of fitting historical records to their flawed political theories. Just like academics in other fields, they overestimate the accuracy of conjecture that cannot be proved. They can’t help but interpret history through their own understanding—which causes them to write history books that portray the default state of man without governance to be constant warfare.

Additionally, Taleb states that, due to the fact that history books must condense large spans of time, wars and conflict seem more common and impactful than they really were. Books tend to leave out unremarkable periods of peace, making eras without large government seem more violent than they really were. Historical accounts put greater emphasis on conflict precisely because it is the exception to the norm.

> **Pushing Back Against Academic Distortion in Schools**
> 
> There have been pushes in recent years to reform the way history is taught in schools for reasons similar to Taleb’s—reformers accuse schools of teaching history from a limited point of view that excludes valuable facts and perspectives from the narrative. American history classes are alleged to be overly nationalistic, idealizing past “wars for freedom” and failing to consider nuance when dealing with events regarding race, gender, and foreign policy.
> 
> Some argue that the traditional narrative structure of history classes is what needs to be updated. One experimental undergraduate class based at Harvard deals in “cases” in which students are given the same historical information that historical decision makers did, and are forced to weigh the issue at hand as if it is happening in real time. This method is intended to teach students historical context as well as valuable critical thinking skills.

#### The Availability Heuristic

Another factor contributing to a distorted view of historical warfare is the availability heuristic: The psychological principle that people tend to put disproportionate emphasis on the ideas that most readily come to mind. In this instance, we overestimate the frequency and negative effects of historical conflict because our idea of it is so emotionally impactful.

We’re far more likely to think of the bloody American Revolutionary War than the evolution of the fur trade happening during the same time period.

(Shortform note: The availability heuristic was originally identified by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, as described in Kahneman’s book Thinking, Fast and Slow. It was first studied when researchers found that, when asked if there were more words in English that _started_ with the letter “k” or had “k” as the _third letter_ , subjects incorrectly guessed the former, as words that began with “k” came to mind more quickly and easily.)

#### Conflating Frequency With Loss

When judging the destruction of historical wars, people often make the false assumption that frequent conflict necessarily means worse conflict. **Conflict should be judged by the negative impact it has on the population instead of the mere fact that conflict is happening.**

Frequent skirmishes between smaller states can be a sign of relatively harmless jostling for power, which has little impact on anyone outside of the military itself. Often, commerce and quality of life can thrive despite war and conflict. On the other hand, it only takes one particularly intense war to send a nation into chaos and create millions of refugees.

To explain, Taleb discusses the recent history of Italy. Historians generally say that Italy was in constant turmoil before its unification into a single nation in the late 19th century. It consisted of several independent states that were constantly at war with one another. Taleb insists that the actual damage done by these battles was drastically less than the loss suffered when unified Italy entered World War One—which wouldn’t have occurred if Italy hadn’t been unified.

For these reasons, Taleb argues that institutions like large centralized governments aren’t as necessary to avert massively destructive war as many people assume. Decentralized, uninvolved states are much more stable.

> **The Virtue of Volatility**
> 
> Taleb introduces this idea in Antifragile—that volatility doesn’t mean fragility. In fact, some amount of small, random destruction is required in antifragile systems. When humans prevent small, relatively harmless forest fires, flammable material that would have normally been burned away collects on the forest floor, until it sparks into a fire too big to stop. Small skirmishes between Italian states prevent the need for war on a national scale. **Random stress better prepares systems for the uncertain future than the suppression of all stress.**
> 
> Systems that are too stable suffer from stagnant decay. Taleb applies this idea to business and politics—he asserts that companies that keep their CEOs for too long fail to adapt or innovate and that the United States’s two political parties have passed their “expiration dates.” Ancient Greeks solved this problem by choosing assembly members by drawing lots.
> 
> Taleb also ties this idea back into his overarching disdain for modernity and human design. Modernity is marked by domination over nature, but many modern inventions do away with small amounts of discomfort that are, in the long run, healthy. Taleb’s examples include safe, boring office jobs, “efficient” MBA programs that replace trial and error, and social science that oversimplifies the world.
