## Part 1 | Chapter 2: Skin in the Game of Employment

Now that we’ve covered the basics of skin in the game and risk-based ethics, we’re going to take a closer look at the specific ways in which skin in the game helps our civilization operate as effectively as it does.

We’ll start by discussing Taleb’s view on employment—the cornerstone of our modern capitalist society. Taleb argues that **employment is a mutually beneficial agreement in which employees give up their freedom to a company that, in exchange,_bears some of their personal risk_**. In other words, employees put their skin in the company’s game.

This highlights one of Taleb’s key ideas that will form the backbone of this section: **Freedom comes from bearing one’s own risks.**

First, we’ll take a closer look at the risk-freedom trade-off made by employees, detailing the benefits employees receive from employers and the ways in which their freedom is limited. Next, we’ll discuss the exceptions to this rule: employees who manage to keep their freedom by embracing greater risk. Then, we’ll discuss where the employee-employer relationship falls short and identify its inherent inefficiencies. Finally, we’ll show how you can apply this understanding of freedom and risk in your own life.

### Employers Purposefully Limit Their Employees’ Freedom

For businesses, hiring employees is a way to minimize risk. Today’s corporations are so efficient and produce goods at such a massive scale that any obstacle in the assembly line comes at enormous cost. Undependability and errors are more costly than ever before.

Employers do what they can to make sure their employees keep production running and subjugate their desires for the sake of the company. As Taleb puts it, employers want to take away their employees’ freedom.

Employers give employees something to lose—skin in the company’s game—so they’re more likely to reliably fulfill their duty. **The ideal employee is scared enough of losing what the company gives him that he makes his duty to the company a central priority of his life.** People are far more motivated by fear of losing what they have than the desire for something they don’t—employers use this fact to ensure their employees’ loyalty.

Essentially, employers pay employees to put skin in _their_ game and accept some of the company’s risk for a share of its rewards. This not only benefits the employers, who earn profits from the work of their employees, but also the consumers, who get to buy the things they want.

(Shortform note: While Taleb argues that the employee relationship is driven by fear, this doesn’t mean that the workplace itself needs to be driven by fear. If workers are constantly threatened with being fired or otherwise punished, the miserable work experience will make them _less_ afraid of losing their job, making employees less reliable and defeating the purpose of employment. On top of this, studies have shown that fear-based workplaces hinder productivity, further incentivizing owners to maintain a positive work environment.)

### Employees Trade Freedom for Security

What does this skin in the game look like? What does the employee receive in exchange for their freedom that they’re so afraid to lose?

  * Job Security
  * Benefits and Perks
  * Personal Identity



We’ll discuss each of these in turn.

**For employees, the central exchange of employment is** **trading away freedom to reduce personal risk through job security.** Employees are less free than the unemployed—eight hours a day, they’re forced to go to work.

In exchange, though,_their personal risk is greatly reduced_. As long as an employee fulfills her job description, the employer promises a steady paycheck—a long-term commitment to help the employee get a place to live and food to eat. Compare this to an independent contractor or freelancer, whose future income is never assured.

This security is the first benefit that the employee has to lose—the form that her skin in the company’s game takes. An employee can always be fired, cutting off that steady paycheck, and the fear of losing it ensures that employees are dependable.

> **Is Job Security Dead?**
> 
> Some experts have asserted that job security has become a thing of the past. Highly competitive and rapidly changing industries mean that companies no longer need to offer the long-term job security typical for most of the 20th century. As a result, employees are advised to prepare to pivot—attain valuable skills, don’t be shy about promoting yourself, and always keep an eye out for other opportunities.
> 
> Taleb mildly disparages the idea of working on yourself in order to appear employable. In his view, the need to maintain an employable image limits your freedom more than simply having a job does—you’re no longer trying to just keep one company happy, but _every_ company happy. He would prefer that you focus on putting your “Soul in the Game” and do good regardless of the incentives.
> 
> Taleb’s opinions aside, even if long-term job security is becoming obsolete, employment certainly isn’t. In most cases, even short-term job security is more attractive than freelance work.

Secondly, employers give their employees benefits and perks that make the idea of getting fired even more unattractive. Standard benefits like health insurance are obviously important to employees, but they may also find themselves hooked on luxuries like a company car, expensive business trips, or a workplace fitness center.

(Shortform note: Most of the time, humans tend to normalize to a consistent baseline of happiness regardless of their external circumstances, a phenomenon psychologists have termed “hedonic adaptation.” People with cushy perks at work aren’t significantly happier than those without them, yet they assume they’d be much less happy without them. You should take steps to avoid falling into this trap: pursue time in the flow state, rotate pleasures in your life to keep them feeling new, and spend some time helping others.)

Finally, to many employees, their relationship to the company is a source of fulfillment and a core part of their personal identity. This is another part of their skin in the company’s game—if an employee loses her job, she also loses the identity that gives her life meaning. Imagine a workaholic lawyer who gets disbarred. The idea of being a lawyer gave her life so much direction and meaning that without it, she doesn’t know what to do. Sometimes, employers even encourage this—if an employee defines herself by her work, she is more likely to prioritize good work and be dependable.

Additionally, long-term employees often build their social lives around those they work with—yet another benefit they have to lose if they’re fired.

> **Diversify Your Identity**
> 
> How can you avoid investing too much of yourself into your job? Author Mark Manson recommends that you develop a diverse identity: Define yourself according to multiple different values.
> 
> We each assess our own self-worth in different ways—some people are proud of being successful at work, while others are more proud of being well-liked by friends, or their faithfulness to a religious code. Manson argues that the healthiest way to live is to invest time and emotion into multiple roles you play in life. Don’t be _only_ a good worker, but also a good parent, a good friend, a good artist. Pursue a greater variety of interests and allow yourself to care deeply about all of them.
> 
> This way, if you get fired, you won’t collapse into an identity crisis or depression—your life will still be rich with meaning. You’ll be less afraid of losing your job and retain more of the freedom sacrificed in employment.

#### Corporate Culture: Another Way Employees Lose Their Freedom

Not only are employees expected to fulfill their job descriptions, they are also expected to do so in a certain way, further limiting their freedom.

During long-term employment, employees adapt to a specific corporate culture. They begin to obey a set of manners and customs that are specific to the job—for example, wearing a tie to work, acting respectfully and professionally in meetings. Employees are also motivated to maintain a good reputation among their coworkers. These behavioral limitations are a large part of the freedom given up by employees.

> Corporate culture is not always a bad thing—its “limitations'' can sometimes contribute to personal evolution. Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio’s Principles states that this kind of culture is vitally necessary in any ambitious organization. Dalio requires his employees to comply with a specific culture designed to foster productivity and fulfilling working relationships—the cornerstones of which are radical transparency and radical honesty. Anyone who can’t adapt to this tightly optimized work culture is asked to leave the company. As Dalio puts it, it’s “a family business in which family members have to perform excellently or be cut.” While this sounds harsh, it ensures that the remaining team members can be proud that they’re performing at their best.

### The Exception: Employees With Freedom

Taleb highlights a unique group of employees that are able to transcend these limits on their freedom. **Those who are able to visibly provide enough value to the company that they are _unable to be replaced_ can regain some of their “freedom” as long as they remain valuable.**

This special group of employees—“wolves,” as Taleb calls them—are “freer” than the typical employee, with fewer restrictions on their behavior. **This is because they bear more of their own risks.**

These employees know that if they produce good enough results, they’ll never be fired, so they don’t care about their image or reputation. They ignore dress codes, curse and swear on the job, and take four-hour lunch breaks, behaving as erratically as they’d like. However, by refusing to mold to the corporate culture, they risk being fired if they ever become less productive. **They willingly take on greater risk in order to have more freedom.**

> **When High Performers Need to Be Fired**
> 
> Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk argues that these high-performing wildcards may need to be fired regardless of how much money they’re making. In Vaynerchuk’s eyes, a positive work culture is priceless in the long run. “Toxic” employees that put their coworkers in a bad mood are slowing down productivity in subtle ways. Time spent worrying about office politics or pacifying a nasty communicator is time that could be spent getting things done.
> 
> Likewise, employees with below-average sales numbers or other forms of trackable productivity may be making work a brighter place, paying for themselves by making the most productive employees happier to be at work. An emotionally healthy work culture is a valuable asset, and it’s worth protecting.

### Where the Employee-Employer Relationship Falls Short

We’ve seen how employees limit their freedom in order to maintain productive organizations for their employers, and what they get in return.**** However, it’s impossible to perfectly merge an employee’s skin into the company’s game.

**Employees are hired to follow job descriptions, which are imperfect proxies of the company’s mission.** Employees of large organizations, whether they be centralized governments or large businesses, are distanced from the consequences of their actions.

Job descriptions are a way of compensating for this. Jobs are designed so that, in theory, if an employee follows the description well over a long period of time, they will be successfully contributing to the organization’s goals. However, it doesn’t always work this way.

People under long term employment are less efficient, more inclined to game the system, and make worse decisions than fully independent agents.

#### Employees Are Less Efficient

Salary or hourly pay is doled out independently of productivity. This is an important part of the security of employment—employees trading away their freedom are primarily drawn by the promise of a steady paycheck. But this also means that employees are less efficient across the board. For example, if due to some temporary inefficiency, an employee doesn’t have anything to do, he’ll still get paid.

> **Ingrained Inefficiency**
> 
> Inefficiency is an unavoidable weakness of mass employment. However, it can be exacerbated by a weak organizational culture. One example: This Italian hospital worker was paid for 15 years for doing absolutely nothing—a bureaucratic oversight. He told his friends he had retired and spent his days just relaxing at home (until he was caught, and charged with fraud, abuse of power, and extortion). This could only happen to an employee—a freelancer, say, a graphic designer, must be continuously generating value to get paid.
> 
> However, the hospital’s lax culture was partially at fault. A degree of truancy was commonplace at the hospital—workers would frequently swipe each others’ time cards to cover for those skipping work. Six hospital supervisors were investigated for allegedly being aware this scam was happening. Even a head physician at the hospital had skipped his afternoon shifts for years without being caught. Moral norms are shaped from within groups—if the guidelines are loosened, transgression spreads.

#### Employees Game the System

Employers use quantitative metrics and performance reviews to determine how well employees are fulfilling their job descriptions. However, neither of these mechanisms are perfect.

One idea that Taleb repeats is that **when motivated, people can manipulate any metric**. If an employee knows her reward is directly linked to a specific quota, she’ll prioritize that one aspect of her job instead of attempting to maximize overall productivity. If a high school teacher is judged by the administration purely based on her students’ standardized test scores, she may teach something closer to a test-prep class rather than something more helpful for everyday life.

Employees can game performance reviews, too. If an employee is judged by more subjective metrics, _image_ becomes more important than true productivity. It’s become an office work cliché to try and look busy without actually doing any work.

> **The Cobra Effect**
> 
> The phenomenon of incentives that cause unintended consequences is called the “Cobra Effect,” named after a law from British-ruled India. The British government posted a reward for cobra skins in an attempt to incentivize the extermination of venomous cobras. Instead, people began breeding more cobras in order to collect the reward.
> 
> The Cobra Effect is central to Taleb’s view of the world. As we discussed, he believes that opaque, complex systems make Cobra Effects far more likely to occur than successfully implemented incentives. He argues that more skin in the game is the only effective solution to any Cobra Effect—or, barring that possibility, the lack of artificial incentives altogether.

#### Employees Make Worse Decisions

Employees typically make decisions based on the impact to their jobs rather than the impact on the organization.**** They’re not incentivized to take risks. **All employees need to do to receive their rewards is look like they’re fulfilling their job description and maintain the status quo—which is not always the correct decision.**

If an unexpected situation occurs and something needs to change, but it’s not in anyone’s job description to do it, employees are likely to keep their heads down, keep doing what they’re getting paid to do, and hope someone else takes care of the problem. In this case, employees take the option that best preserves their jobs, even if it means inadvertently dooming the organization to fail.

For example, workers at the Chernobyl power plant continued to run a compromised safety test against their better judgment because they didn’t want to risk their jobs by disobeying orders. It was easier for them to believe that their supervisor knew what he was doing. This ended up causing one of the largest manmade disasters in history.

> **The Dangers of Inertia**
> 
> Business professor Richard Rumelt’s book Good Strategy/Bad Strategy frames inertia, an unwillingness to change, as a constant force that must be battled at all times for an institution to run well. It’s almost always easier to continue what you’re doing than to critically analyze what you need to change, and for this reason, Rumelt labels inertia as one of the greatest challenges any company can face.
> 
> Rumelt identifies three types of inertia that can plague your organization: “inertia of routine,” “cultural inertia,” and “inertia by proxy”—that is, your organization’s failure to change procedures, values, and clientele, respectively. In order to conquer entropy, leaders within the organization need to stay on alert for any changing circumstances and be prepared to destroy the old ways of doing things to make way for the new.

### How to Approach Freedom in Our Lives

Taleb doesn’t frame “freedom” as an absolute good. There are pros and cons to how much “freedom” you have—as we’ve discussed, **the more freedom you have, the more risks you embrace**. It’s up to each of us to decide for ourselves how much freedom and risk we want and strike an appropriate balance.

The majority of first-world citizens are employees—they have chosen to limit their own freedom for the rewards described above: job security, benefits, and a sense of personal identity. At the same time, there’s nothing stopping us from quitting our job and making a living independent of any existing organization. Many people do—freelancers, entrepreneurs, and even hermits living off the land. A free country enables us to choose how free we want to be.

Regardless of what we decide, Taleb cautions us to be aware of how much freedom we have and what risks we’re taking to have it. If you act too boldly and don’t have the freedom to do so, you will lose what you have. A salesman who overestimates his value to the company (and consequently, his freedom) and keeps skipping meetings will eventually be fired. Alternatively, if you feel like you lack freedom in your life, you could try taking more risks.

> **Freedom Through Discipline**
> 
> In _Discipline Equals Freedom_ , former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink (_Extreme Ownership_) makes the same connection between freedom and personal sacrifice as Taleb. Willink explains his philosophy in an interview for Forbes:**** Discipline means saying “no” to easy things that you don’t really want, whether that be time spent on Twitter, a second helping of ice cream, or even a comfortable but unfulfilling job. True freedom—the ability to do what you want to do—is only achievable through the discipline to deny yourself and delay gratification.
> 
> In his book, Willink makes it clear that externally-imposed discipline—for example, coercion from a brutal drill sergeant—isn’t discipline at all. It falls apart as soon as the external force disappears. Self-imposed discipline, like the kind found in purposeful employees, is the only path to freedom. Willink wakes up at 4:30 every morning, consciously choosing to limit his freedom in this way because of what it gives him in return. You don’t have to be this extreme, but it’s fulfilling to intentionally manage your freedom in this way, choosing your own risks and rewards.
