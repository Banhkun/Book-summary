## Chapter 1: The Basics of Skin in the Game

In this book, Nassim Nicholas Taleb deconstructs what we know about life and society with a new ideological framework that’s both unconventional in its insights and fundamentally human. By reinterpreting life in terms of risk and reward, Taleb demonstrates how “skin in the game” is the foundation of an honorable, fulfilling life and why shirking your fair share of risk is the root of all evil.

**Someone who has “skin in the game” has a vested interest in the outcome of an event—and, more importantly, has something to lose.** At a rodeo, the rider on the bucking bronco has skin in the game, while the audience member eating popcorn in the bleachers does not.

**Essentially, Taleb equates skin in the game to risk**. The more you have to lose, the more skin you have in the game.

According to Taleb, our first impressions of how the world works are often not just wrong, but dangerously contradictory to reality. Understanding skin in the game is vitally necessary to accurately understand law, morality, politics, science, religion, and many other driving forces of our world.

> **Origins of “Skin in the Game”**
> 
> Taleb originally formalized his view of “skin in the game” in his 2012 book Antifragile. The main idea of _Antifragile_ is that a certain amount of stress and chaos makes some “antifragile” things stronger, like how breaking down muscle during a workout triggers growth. “Skin in the Game” was the name of a chapter near the end of that book, in which Taleb applies the idea of antifragility to ethics.
> 
> **People who don’t have skin in the game are essentially stealing antifragility** , which is unethical. For example, if a popular finance pundit offered bad investment advice that drove up sales of his book, he would become more antifragile, profiting from uncertainty. It doesn’t matter if the advice works or not—he comes out ahead either way. However, the investors taking the bad advice would become more fragile, as they’re at greater risk of losing money.
> 
> Most of the ideas present in the Skin in the Game chapter of _Antifragile_ are repeated in this book.

In this section, we’ll first more closely define skin in the game and explain why Taleb finds it so important. Next, we’ll cover some basic principles surrounding skin in the game that will remain relevant throughout the book. Finally, we’ll define the key concept of asymmetry of skin in the game, explain why it’s unethical, and show how it applies to unethical transactions.

### Why Put Skin in the Game?

Taleb believes that an ideal system—whether it’s a country, a company, or even a religion—is made up of as many people with as much skin in the game as possible. Why? Let’s go over the primary benefits of having skin in the game.

  * Reason #1: Skin in the Game Teaches True Knowledge
  * Reason #2: Skin in the Game Inspires Better Work
  * Reason #3: People Behave More Ethically with Skin in the Game



#### Reason #1: Skin in the Game Teaches True Knowledge

Taleb is adamant that **knowledge gained through direct experience is vastly superior to knowledge sussed out through abstract reasoning**.

In any given situation, the only way to verify if your understanding is correct is _direct exposure to the outcome_ caused by your understanding. Imagine a high school boy who is dying to know if a girl at school likes him or not. He could dissect every conversation they’ve ever had and come up with countless theories of what she was thinking and feeling, but the only way he can know for sure is by putting his skin in the game and asking her.

**Individuals improve by learning from failure**. The pain of real failure teaches far more than learning in isolation. Having skin in the game allows people to grow from their mistakes. An actress could read as much on acting theory as possible, but if she doesn’t go out and risk cold reception in auditions or on stage, she’ll never improve.

Likewise,**systems improve by eliminating what doesn’t work**. 90% of startups fail. If every business that wasn’t able to generate enough income to survive were given bailouts in order to continue running—if they carried no risk and didn’t have skin in the game—we would be surrounded by suboptimal businesses. Systems learn through elimination and filtering.

> **Skin in the Game Gives Systems a Growth Mindset**
> 
> In her seminal book _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck argues that the #1 predictor of success for a given individual is whether or not you have a “fixed” mindset or a “growth” mindset—that is, whether you believe that your innate abilities are set for life or able to be trained and improved.
> 
> Like Taleb, Dweck stresses the importance of learning from failure—direct exposure to your own failure teaches more effective lessons than anything else. The most successful individuals understand that difficult challenges are the path to growth and actively seek them out.
> 
> Skin in the game is the way to give _systems_ a growth mindset. A market economy with entrepreneurs’ skin in the game, for instance, embraces difficult challenges in the same way a growth-minded individual would, as firms in competition rush to solve problems like inventing the best portable music player. Difficult challenges mean more elimination, which is a good thing, so we don’t get stuck with the Zune.
> 
> Without skin in the game, systems are stuck with a fixed mindset. An office manager who’s too afraid to fire bad workers has created a system without skin in the game—bad workers are no longer at risk. As a result, the office will steer away from any difficult tasks and remain mediocre.

Additionally, **skin in the game reveals true character**. Skin in the game reveals preferences. A man on a dating app may claim he loves hiking and adventuring, but if he spends his one day off of work watching Netflix, his true preferences have been revealed.

Similarly, skin in the game reveals who can truly do good and who is all talk. If two mayoral candidates both claim they care passionately about the plight of the homeless, but one candidate spends every weekend volunteering at nonprofits for the homeless while the other plays golf, their difference in true character has been revealed.

> In his book _Story: Style, Structure, Substance, and the Principles of Screenwriting, _screenwriting guru Robert McKee presents a view of the world that, interestingly, overlaps significantly with Taleb’s. “Choices made when nothing is at risk mean little,” he writes, “the greater the pressure, the deeper the revelation, the truer the choice to the character’s essential nature.” The more you risk and sacrifice, the more the image you project to others disappears.
> 
> McKee asserts that skin in the game’s ability to reveal true character is one of the secrets to interesting, resonant storytelling. In stories, characters have to be under pressure to be interesting because only then do we get to see who they really are.

#### Reason #2: Skin in the Game Inspires Better Work

On an individual level, **people are more engaged when their skin is in the game**. Specifically, they’re less likely to get bored, more likely to put in effort, they’ll make better decisions, and they generally feel more fulfilled. In fact, as we’ll see a little later, the key to fulfillment is to put as much skin in the game as possible.

A teenager would be much more engaged during her driver’s license test than during the drive to a friend’s house. This is because she _has something to lose_ if she fails her driving test—skin in the game.

Ideally, all jobs would incorporate an element of skin in the game, tying rewards to results. One example of this is the commission earned by real estate agents. This incentive makes the job more exciting and encourages better work.

Without skin in the game, people are more likely to cut corners and put in less effort. Skin in the game is what makes work feel important—without it, you just don’t feel the need to do your best.

> **Skin in the Game Puts You in the Flow State**
> 
> In _Flow_ , psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi introduces the concept of the “flow state,” which has become ubiquitous in modern psychology. The term refers to the feeling of being “in the zone,” when you’re so engaged in what you’re doing that the world around you seems to disappear. Csikszentmihalyi argues that we should strive to be in flow as much as possible—not only is it enjoyable, it establishes “inner order” (a sense of deep life satisfaction) and helps you develop into a more complex individual.
> 
> Skin in the game helps you get into the flow state in several ways—it almost always involves clear goals, immediate feedback, and the difficulty necessary to avoid boredom, all of which contribute to feelings of flow. The driver’s test mentioned earlier would check all these boxes.
> 
> Additionally, having something to lose motivates you to tackle challenges that are initially uncomfortable, but put you in the flow state, contributing to a satisfying life in the long run. For example, people have skin in the game most often at work, where they report being in the flow state 54% of the time.

#### Reason #3: People Behave More Ethically With Skin in the Game

People are less likely to give in to temptation if they know they’ll be punished if they get caught. Telling your four-year-old that he’ll get a time-out if he hits his brother is putting his skin in the game.

Another example: Taleb is a proponent of strong tort law as a means of compelling powerful corporations to behave ethically. The ability for wronged parties to sue puts corporations at risk. By making companies financially liable for their mistakes and misdeeds, tort law forces corporations to directly put skin in the game and act more ethically.

> **Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Personal Politics**
> 
> Taken together, Taleb’s three reasons for prioritizing skin in the game may be the foundation of his personal politics.
> 
> Most of the time, Taleb is deliberately evasive about his political affiliation. He’s often presumed to be a libertarian for opinions such as this one, that tort liability is the best way to ensure corporate responsibility.
> 
> However, Taleb has stated online and in interviews that libertarian isn’t the most accurate label to describe him, as he doesn’t see personal liberty as the highest virtue. Taleb makes it clear in _Skin in the Game_ that whenever tort law is ineffective at curbing harm caused by corporations, government regulation becomes a necessity—he isn’t fundamentally opposed to government.
> 
> Instead, Taleb describes himself as “not a libertarian, but a localist.” The foundation of Taleb’s political belief is skin in the game. He believes that it’s unethical and destructive for anyone to obscure the mistakes they make at the expense of others, and as a result prefers local government over centralized government.
> 
> Taleb has claimed that he is, in certain ways, both liberal and conservative. He’s liberal in the sense that he’s open to change, but he’s conservative in the sense that he wants change in the form of small incremental changes instead of sweeping reform.

### Principles of Skin in the Game

Next, we’ll go over some broad principles that are key to understanding skin in the game.

  * Principle #1: If You Don’t Have Skin in the Game, You Shouldn’t Be Involved
  * Principle #2: Time and Distance Remove Skin from the Game
  * Principle #3: Some People Put More than Skin in the Game
  * Principle #4: Skin in the Game is the Heart of Law and Ethics



#### Principle #1: If You Don’t Have Skin in the Game, You Shouldn’t Be Involved

A central tenet of Taleb’s argument is that people with no skin in the game have no business being involved. Even if people believe they have the knowledge or skills to help someone, if they have no skin in the game, they should mind their own business.

In the book, Taleb criticizes the United States’s 2003 intervention in Iraq. They had no skin in the game, so the negative consequences of their actions had little impact on them.

> **Iatrogenics in Iraq**
> 
> This falls within the topic of “iatrogenics”—when well-intentioned intervention causes more harm than good. This is one of Taleb’s major ideas, recurring throughout the _Incerto_.
> 
> Some would argue that the US _did_ have skin in the game. The Iraq War came at devastating cost to the United States, and overturning the government of Saddam Hussein did little to bring peace to Iraq. However, one reason things turned out poorly is the fact that the United States didn’t have their skin in the _right_ game. Despite the fact that the US sacrificed thousands of soldiers’ lives and billions of dollars to fight in Iraq, _none of their losses were directly linked to the goal of peace in Iraq_ , so it didn’t happen.
> 
> Taleb compares the situation to a doctor who injects a patient with cancer cells in order to lower his cholesterol. The patient dies, but his cholesterol levels look great. The goals of the war were imperfectly linked to the goals of the Iraqi people. It would be impossible to implement skin in the game in a situation like this, which is why Taleb for the most part opposes foreign intervention altogether.

#### Principle #2: Time and Distance Remove Skin From the Game

The farther away someone is from the consequences of their actions, the less skin she has in the game. A grandmother will be more invested in the happiness of her grandchild if she lives in the same house than if she lives in another country.

Likewise, the longer it takes for the consequences of someone’s actions to surface, the less skin she has in the game. As time passes, it becomes more difficult to attribute effects to their causes. A doctor prescribing a drug that causes cancer 20 years down the road will be held less accountable than a doctor who prescribes a drug that kills the patient instantly.

Time and distance reduce the benefits of skin in the game, hindering the ability to learn from mistakes, lessening the pressure to do good work, and encouraging more unethical behavior.

> **Defensive Medicine: When Doctors Have Skin in the Wrong Game**
> 
> Another example of a skin-in-the-game misalignment, “defensive medicine” refers to the harmful practice of prescribing treatment with the intention of avoiding liability rather than doing what’s best for the patient. Unethical medical professionals do this by creating time and distance between treatment (or lack thereof) and its results.
> 
> Taleb uses the example of a cardiologist prescribing statins to someone who doesn’t need them, which are harmless in the short term but have a chance of causing problems years down the road. This would be an example of “positive” defensive medicine, unnecessary treatment to avoid being blamed for doing nothing. “Negative” defensive medicine is the similarly neglectful practice of avoiding risky treatment that, if unsuccessful, would make doctors liable for malpractice, but overall would result in better chances for the patient. The consequences of skipping surgery are more difficult to pinpoint than a botched surgery because of time and distance between cause and effect.

#### Principle #3: Some People Put More Than Skin in the Game

While people with skin in the game accept responsibility for their own actions, **some people accept greater risk and/or reject greater rewards for the sake of helping others**. They put their skin in other people’s games. As Taleb phrases it, these people have their “Soul in the Game.” For example, a songwriter breaks off her record deal because the label pressured her to write boring mainstream hits, sacrificing money and publicity to create better art.

These “artists,” as Taleb calls them, put more skin in the game than anyone. People of any profession can be artists. They gain the benefits of skin in the game in spades:

  * They learn ravenously, becoming masters of their field.
  * They’re engaged and fulfilled by taking risks and making sacrifices.
  * They have the pride of ethical integrity, acting based on moral principles instead of the potential for reward.



We should all aspire to be artists and take risks for the sake of others.

> **Putting Yourself on the Hook**
> 
> Seth Godin’s book _The Practice: Shipping Creative Work_ is all about taking risks in order to help others and, in the process, reinventing yourself as a professional artist, no matter what profession you’re in. He further defines what it means to have your “Soul in the Game.”
> 
> “Askıda ekmek” means “bread on the hook” in Turkish. In ancient times, customers at the local bakery would buy an extra loaf and tell the owner to put it “on the hook” for anyone in need to take, free of charge. Godin uses this as a metaphor throughout the book to describe how you should approach creative work—he urges you to put _yourself_ on the hook. By spending your life channeling your attention and effort into work that might not succeed, or that might even embarrass you, you’re paying your entire life forward for those who need what you create.

#### Principle #4: Skin in the Game Is the Heart of Law and Ethics

Taleb argues that**the foundation of ethics is that everyone involved has equal skin in the game.**

The Golden Rule to “treat others the way you want to be treated” is another way of phrasing this same idea—although Taleb prefers the Silver Rule: “Do not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you.” When in doubt, you shouldn’t presume to know what’s good for others better than they do—Principle #1 from above.

In short,**your actions that benefit you should benefit others, and, more importantly, your actions that harm others should harm you.** This is the definition of skin in the game and the definition of ethics.

All codified law, since its beginning, has been intended to enforce penalties for actions with negative consequences—implementing a certain degree of ethics into society and forcing people to put skin in the game.

> **Moral Philosophy: Taleb Versus Kant**
> 
> Taleb’s moral philosophy fits into a larger set of theories known as “consequentialism”—the idea that the outcome of an action, rather than its _intent_ , determines whether or not it’s moral. The alternative school of thought is known as “deontology,” which holds that the morally right thing to do remains constant, even if the outcome of a specific action turns out poorly.
> 
> Taleb acknowledges this divide, and specifically argues against one of deontology’s most influential proponents: the Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant. Both Kant and Taleb attempt to solve the same problem with their moral philosophies: People who believe they’re doing good often inadvertently do harm. Kant solves this problem by formulating universal moral laws that, if everyone followed, would result in a perfect world—taking the guesswork out of ethical dilemmas by providing objective rules.
> 
> Taleb, however, argues that such universal laws do not exist. Since groups and systems of varying sizes behave differently, **ethical laws that regularly do good on the individual level will regularly do harm at the systemic level**. Despite Kant’s argument to the contrary, there is no way to articulate a perfect moral code, so skin in the game, as imperfect and sometimes impractical as it is, is the only solution. We’ll examine this idea in greater detail in Chapter 8 of this guide.

### Complex Systems Make Skin in the Game Necessary

One belief foundational to Taleb’s worldview is that the world is far too complex to ever fully understand or reliably predict. He couches this statement in a mathematical principle called the “curse of dimensionality”: As systems grow, _the rate at which they become complex accelerates_.

Taleb makes it clear that any adjustment made to a large, complex system will cause an avalanche of unintended side effects. This is another reason skin in the game is so vitally necessary. Without the true knowledge gained from failure, we would never know enough to navigate the infinitely complex world.

#### Why Complex Systems Are so Difficult to Predict

The trickiest thing about large, complex systems is that**complex systems behave differently than their component parts**.

Many theorists and analysts use the “mean-field approach” to study systems—they reduce a system down to one of its simple components, and use it to draw conclusions about the system as a whole. However, in the vast majority of cases, the mean-field approach proves nothing. Systems behave differently than their component parts—sometimes even in ways that appear to contradict them.

For example, as we’ll see in a future section, large populations often adapt to the preferences of small minorities. If we were to use the mean-field approach, we would assume that in a country where 99.7% of people pay no attention to “kosher” dietary restrictions, kosher food would be incredibly difficult to find. Yet in the United States, 41% of all packaged food is kosher.

**In almost every chapter of the book, Taleb examines how complex systems work in the exact opposite way from what a surface-level observer would expect.**

> **The Nature of the Unknown**
> 
> This idea of complex systems being impossible to predict is one of the central themes uniting the books in Taleb’s _Incerto_ series—in fact, Taleb derived the word “Incerto” from the Latin word for “uncertainty.”
> 
> In _The Black Swan_ , Taleb argues that the majority of people entirely misunderstand “the unknown.” The unknown isn’t just the absence of knowledge, it’s the _opposite of knowledge_ , a world where knowing more can mislead you. Applying previous knowledge in domains of uncertainty—that is, whenever systems are large enough to become opaque—can cause severely harmful consequences.
> 
> In _The Black Swan,_ Taleb illustrates this idea by recounting a misunderstanding between Jews and Romans in the first century. The Romans put a statue of the emperor Caligula in the Jewish temple in exchange for a statue of Yahweh in their Roman temples. To the Jews, Yahweh wasn’t the same kind of god as the ones the Romans knew, and to diminish him to the status of a man like Caligula was disrespectful and profane. The Romans applied their existing understanding of “gods” in the wrong place, provoking the Jews to revolt.
> 
> In the same way, a modern intellectual could apply the mean-field approach to a complex field where it doesn’t belong, for example, economics, and come to conclusions that lead to massively harmful economic policy.

### Unethical Asymmetries of Risk

A final concept that’s foundational to Taleb’s worldview is the idea that it’s unethical to force someone else to embrace more risk than you—in other words, putting someone else’s skin in your game.

(Shortform note: Throughout this guide, we’ll refer to “skin in the game” and “risk” somewhat synonymously. Having skin in the game means that you’re _risking_ something in your efforts to achieve a desired outcome. If you fail, you suffer the consequences.)

Risk is unavoidable in an inherently uncertain world. **Danger occurs when some people, and not others, are aware of specific risks.** People frequently use this information to unfairly pass some of their risks onto others.

This is why Taleb emphasizes the idea of asymmetry throughout the book—**hidden imbalances in risk are unethical**. Intentionally making your desires more likely by making the desires of others less likely—transferring risk—is, in Taleb’s eyes, theft.

(Shortform note: There are examples of unethical imbalances in risk all around us. For instance, some argue that the information collected by the government to calculate appropriate financial aid is helping schools drive up tuition, as they are made aware of exactly how much a family can afford. The school’s risk of losing income is mitigated, while the quality and potential value of the student’s education remain an uncertain risk. Asymmetries of risk that involve the asymmetry of information like this are the most dangerous, as they’re more likely to go undetected.)

We’ll see many more examples of this in later sections, but first, let’s take a look at a simple example: how this happens in unethical transactions.

#### The Ethics of Transactions

People often pass on risk by masking it as a gift such as helpful advice, a good deal on a valuable product, or a wise investment. It’s difficult to tell whether gifts like these are helpful or harmful—which is why there should be skin in the game. **You shouldn’t accept “gifts” like these unless the giver has something to lose if it ends up being harmful.**

For example, if an insurance salesman is giving you the hard sell for a life insurance policy, ask if the salesman himself is on the policy. If it was a bad policy, he would be getting ripped off, too—his skin would be in the game.

Another example: If someone sells you a pressure cooker that malfunctions and explodes, causing you bodily harm, you should be able to sue for massive reparations. This puts their skin in the game.

> This also means that, if you’re selling something, you can deliberately use skin in the game to signal honesty and gain the trust of your customers. This is how money-back guarantees work—sellers are staking their profits on the quality of their product, giving their customers peace of mind and making more sales.
> 
> Author Tim Ferriss takes this idea one step further with something he calls a “lose-win guarantee.” When he sold athletic supplements, he offered to give customers _double_ their money back if they were unsatisfied. The visible skin in the game hooked customers, and the money he lost fulfilling the guarantee was less than the extra profits it earned.

On the sellers’ side of things, Taleb outlines specific guidelines for honorable, ethical transactions.

##### Guideline #1: Sellers should be transparent about the product.

Not only is it unethical to actively mislead your customers, it’s also unethical to hold back any information that might dissuade them from agreeing to the transaction. For example, it would be unethical if someone sold you a house without letting you know it’s built on a cracked foundation that will soon require repairs.

This debate dates back to the Stoic philosophers of the second century, with some arguing that the seller’s only obligation is to reveal only what is required by law. Taleb is of the opinion that the ethical thing to do is to ensure total symmetry of information.

##### Guideline #2: Sellers should be transparent in their intentions.

In Taleb’s eyes, any marketing or negotiating tactic that involves misrepresenting your intentions is unethical.

To explain, he recounts the story of a third-century Jewish scholar named Rav Safra. A customer approached Safra while he was praying and asked to buy some wine. Misinterpreting Safra’s silence as a refusal, the customer negotiated against himself, offering more and more money for the wine. When he finished praying, Safra insisted on only taking the customer’s lowest offer, since he had initially intended to accept it. He saw any advantage caused by an asymmetry of information as unethical.

Taleb recognizes that these ethical guidelines are rarely followed in practicality and would be difficult to implement in a body of law. Still, we should strive to achieve symmetry of information in any transaction.

> **Information Asymmetry Is Bad for Everyone**
> 
> Asymmetry of information is a common talking point whenever the ethics of transactions are discussed. In his 2005 book _The Undercover Economist_ , economist Tim Harford devotes an entire chapter to the problem of information asymmetry.
> 
> Harford argues that, in the long run, asymmetry of information benefits no one. For instance, if customers in the market for a used car have no knowledge of which cars are reliable, they would be far less likely to take the gamble of buying one. Everyone loses. For this reason, honest sellers intentionally try to close the information gap by _signaling quality_ —building a trustworthy reputation. For example, a well-decorated storefront signals that the sellers there are unlikely to pack up and skip town after getting away with a bad deal—they’re trustworthy.
> 
> If all sellers operated like Rav Safra, the market would operate more effectively. Buyers would happily spend money on the best deals available, and the sellers offering the best deals would have the most success. This is why Taleb considers transparency a moral imperative.
