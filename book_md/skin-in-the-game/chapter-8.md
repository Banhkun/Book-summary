## Chapter 8: Skin-in-the-Game Problems in Government

The next area we’ll discuss in which the absence of skin in the game causes problems is centralized government. Throughout the book, Taleb criticizes centralized power structures in which a few people make decisions that affect everyone. In his view, large systems, like governments or economies, are far too complex for individuals to effectively manage from the top down.

Instead, **Taleb advocates for the decentralization of power** —smaller territories are more likely to govern themselves effectively. For example, Taleb credits the success of the United States of America to its federalist nature—the government of each state has more skin in the game than the federal government has in any state.

First, we’re going to examine the benefits of decentralized government: greater accountability and more democratic representation. Then, we’ll take a look at why people believe in the power of centralized government and the one fact they overlook in doing so: Intellect and morality don’t scale.

### The Virtues of Decentralized Government

By nature, the government doesn’t have much skin in the game—it’s a small segment of the population tasked with managing the affairs of the entire nation. As a government grows, decision-makers move farther away from the consequences of their actions, in distance and time, removing skin in the game. And, as we’ve established, a lack of skin in the game prevents workers from learning from their mistakes and causes them to make less ethical decisions.

#### Centralized Government Enables Corruption and Mismanagement

Since they have no direct exposure to the consequences of their own decisions, government officials are never given the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Additionally, **without skin in the game, public officials are able to transfer their risk unfairly onto others.**

Whenever someone in government uses taxpayer money to compensate for their own mismanagement or enacts a policy that benefits their image more than their constituents, they’re creating an immoral asymmetry of risk. Since they’re operating within such a large, complex system, this kind of corruption is difficult to detect.

More specifically, Taleb criticizes corrupt civil servants who make decisions that benefit certain industries, then join those industries after leaving office. Taleb criticizes former Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner for facilitating the bailout of big banks and then accepting a multi-million dollar salary at a private equity firm as a “reward for good behavior.”

Similarly, Taleb condemns instances in which government workers deliberately enact elaborate industry regulations, then get hired by those industries as experts with exclusive knowledge of the way those regulations work.

> **Regulations Are Easily Abused**
> 
> Taleb describes his first-hand witness of this kind of corruption in _Antifragile._ When he worked at a Wall Street investment bank, the managing director notified the traders that they were all expected to donate a percentage of their income to a few specific politicians’ campaigns, politicians who it was well known would treat their industry well. Taleb refused on moral grounds.
> 
> Another incident occurred when Alan Blinder, former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, tried to sell Taleb an unethical service: Blinder’s company would split up the funds of someone wealthy like Taleb among several different banks in order to circumvent government regulation that put a cap on deposit insurance. Blinder admitted to having several former regulators on his staff that were profiting from their extensive knowledge of regulation loopholes. It was legal, though extremely unethical.
> 
> In 2020, political scientists published a study identifying what they call “Unrules”—exemptions in regulatory law that allow certain individuals and organizations to circumvent regulation. Unrules are extremely prevalent in regulatory law—by scanning a massive regulatory code document for keywords, the researchers found that for every five or six instances of regulatory obligations, there was a way to get around them. While unrules aren’t necessarily a sign of corruption—they allow regulatory bodies to more precisely regulate complex situations—they also allow people like Alan Blinder to deliberately plant loopholes and more profitably wield insider knowledge.

To solve this problem, Taleb proposes that, after they enter office, civil servants should never be allowed to earn more than a set amount from the private sector, even after they leave office. This would help curb bribery and ensure that those running for office do so for honest, selfless reasons.

(Shortform note: The United Kingdom has instated a watchdog committee for this purpose. While the Independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA) hasn’t capped civil servants’ income, it sets some limits and investigates post-service jobs for corruption. The committee, however, lacks the ability to enforce its rules and has long been a target of criticism.)

Decentralized governments of smaller states with more skin in the game are less tolerant of corruption and mismanagement because public officials are closer to the consequences of their decisions.

The effects of a city council’s policies on a small town (for example, changes to a public school’s budget) are much more tangibly noticeable than the effects of a federal policy across a nation (for example, restructured tax brackets). This adds pressure to serve effectively and ethically.

Additionally, with a more localized government, each decision-maker has less power and responsibility to potentially abuse. In a worst-case scenario, their corruption or mismanagement will harm fewer people.

> **Taleb’s Favorite Form of Government**
> 
> Taleb has stated in his other books and online that in his eyes, the ideal size for an autonomous state is the city-state, ideally one that is under control of a greater empire. _Antifragile_ uses the example of the prosperous centuries of _Pax Romana_ for provinces under the control of the Roman empire.
> 
> Each province was overseen by a Roman governor, but for the most part, were controlled by local senators. Powerful external control prevented these city-states from destroying one another through war, and having local decision-makers ensured that the effects of government decisions were easily observed and improved.

#### Decentralized Government Better Represents Its Citizens’ Preferences

Taleb also uses the previously discussed theory of the passionate few to reinforce his argument for a more decentralized political system. **Given that a vocal minority can dictate policy for an entire population, smaller autonomous states allow for a more accurate reflection of their citizens’ true preferences.**

Consider a hypothetical passionate few in the United States rallying in support of a specific policy. The activists, however, are largely concentrated in just three states. If the nation was not divided into states, the passionate few could impose their preferences on the entire country, leaving 47 states with a large population of citizens indifferent or modestly opposed to the policy. But since policies are allowed to go into effect on the state level, those three states are able to enact it for themselves without impacting the other 47. Now, each state has policies that more closely reflect its true preferences.

Reasoning along these lines, Taleb defends Great Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. He implies that as an independent state, Britain’s policies will be more closely aligned to its citizens’ preferences, instead of being unduly influenced by a minority that resides elsewhere in Europe.

> **Taleb and the European Union**
> 
> Taleb is a severe critic of the European Union, calling it a “horrible, stupid project” that’s “doomed to fail.”**** In his eyes, it allows a passionate few of politicians and their supporters to drag down citizens across Europe with misguided top-down decision-making.
> 
> One commonly criticized example of the EU’s mismanagement is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which The Guardian in 2013 called “the most blatant transfer of money from the poor to the rich that has occurred in the era of universal suffrage.” The idea behind the CAP is simple: subsidize farming in order to protect farmers’ jobs and increase food supply throughout Europe. In practice, a significant amount of the EU’s $65 billion a year farming payout has gone to the farms on political families’ estates and corrupt government leaders—companies owned by the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic collected $42 million in farming subsidies from European taxpayers in 2018. On top of this, food prices in 2013 were 17% higher in Europe than comparable countries like Australia and New Zealand.
> 
> Taleb calls the EU’s unified currency a “terrible idea,” as it “encouraged everyone to borrow to the hilt.” This idea has support from economists.

### Refuting the Argument for Centralized Government

#### The Argument for Centralized Government

If decentralized government provides accountability and greater representation, why do people push for more centralization?

Taleb asserts that **if you trust in the potential of human design, the skin in the game of a decentralized government can seem unnecessary**. Skinless Intellectuals who “hate skin in the game,” as Taleb puts it, hate it because they believe rational, intelligent humans, if given enough power, would be able to create a better society than individuals with skin in the game acting in their own self-interest.

Taleb takes the opposing view: human design is fundamentally limited. Large governments manage such large, complex systems that their intervention and attempts at restructuring are far more likely to be harmful than beneficial. Ensuring that decision-makers have as much skin in the game as possible protects us from leaders with too much faith in their own intellect and morals.

> **Centralization’s Blurred Lines**
> 
> Supporters of bigger centralized government point to success in Europe—by percent of GDP, countries such as France, Spain, and Germany have significantly larger governments than the United States, and sport lower poverty rates, longer life spans, and lower rates of teenage pregnancy. Nordic states like Denmark and Finland are even more extreme examples of the same trend. Higher government spending has shown to be effective.
> 
> However, although government spending is heavily correlated with centralized power, they’re not the same thing. The United Kingdom, for example, spends less of the nation’s annual GDP on its government than Germany, yet it has a single-payer healthcare system, unlike Germany’s more decentralized multi-payer system. Nordic countries with large governments are propped up by strong decentralized free markets. Most countries have found a unique balance between centralized and decentralized decision-making, showing that some goals may be better accomplished through centralization, and others through decentralization.

#### Intellect and Morality Don’t Scale

Taleb identifies one common misconception that he believes contributes to many of the world’s biggest problems:**** Those who support centralization mistakenly assume that the logic and ethics they use to make decisions on a small scale will have the same effects at a large scale.**** In reality, **when those in power make decisions at a large enough scale, the intellect and morals used on the individual level fail to effectively do good**.

Large nations are far too complex for even the most intelligent, insightful leaders to fully understand and predict. Any given decision could have multiple unforeseen consequences, and without skin in the game, mistakes go undetected, causing permanent, compounding problems that no one knows how to solve.

As for morals: It’s easy to believe that we should make decisions based on absolute morality—that the right thing to do is right no matter what. In practicality, however, in order to achieve the most moral results we must employ different sets of ethics for organizations of different sizes.

You can teach a child to share his toys with his brothers and sisters, hunter-gatherer tribes can learn to pool their resources and divide it according to need, but you can’t teach a nation to work hard and then give away the fruits of their labor. **The moral principles fall apart when applied at a large scale.** Attempts to implement them cause more harm than good.

> **Scaling Is the Heart of Taleb’s Politics**
> 
> The cornerstone of Taleb’s political perspective is that groups of different sizes behave in extremely different ways—as stated in _Skin in the Game_ , it’s possible to be “at the Fed level, libertarian; at the state level, Republican; at the local level, Democrat; and at the family and friends level, a socialist.” Since the rules change as groups grow bigger, you need to allow groups of different sizes to set their own rules.
> 
> In the _Scala Politica_ , Taleb’s book-length political manifesto published as an academic paper, Taleb argues that borderless globalism is impossible—people naturally care about their own families and sometimes their own nations, but they wouldn’t find the same sense of meaning if they could only relate to humanity as a whole. Additionally, there is no one way of life that will satisfy everyone on earth. This requires a system that allows “tribes” of different sizes to coexist. Taleb cites Yoram Hazony, an Israeli-born political theorist whose ideas have been gaining recent traction in American conservative circles, although Taleb puts his own caveats on Hazony’s ideas.
> 
> Hazony’s main idea is that cultural cohesion within a large nation is the ideal political structure, even when it means excluding outsiders and treating them less favorably. In fact, he argues that nations can _only_ thrive when they’re excluding others—in his eyes, if a nation embraces global ideals and identity, including everyone, it will inevitably seek to assimilate the entire world, becoming a hegemonic “empire.” A nation defined by its differences from surrounding peoples, on the other hand, provides the strength and stability necessary to coexist with them.
> 
> Taleb agrees with Hazony on this point but applies his logic to groups of any size. In Taleb’s eyes, “fractal layering” is necessary—in-groups of different sizes (nations, families, religious communities) must be allowed to develop and coexist. Whereas Hazony would argue that a single religious tradition is necessary for a prosperous, unified nation, Taleb holds that Hazony’s “monolithic, absorbing nationalism” that seeks to eliminate factions within itself—one that requires all citizens to adhere to one religion, for instance—is just as ineffective as globalism (and fosters xenophobia).
