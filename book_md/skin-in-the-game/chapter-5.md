## Chapter 5: Skin in the Game of Doing “Good Deeds”

To conclude our discussion of how skin in the game improves the world, we’re going to take a look at the reason why it’s a necessary ingredient in any good deed imaginable. Without skin in the game, behavior that appears virtuous and honorable on the surface is, at best, cheapened and ineffective, and at worst, inauthentic and malicious.

In this section, we’ll also cover some of Taleb’s ideas about another area in which skin in the game is necessary to be authentic: threats and intimidation.

In both cases, Taleb argues that **the risks of skin in the game prove that you are what you claim to be.**

First, we’re going to discover why skin in the game is the most honorable virtue there is, show how virtue without skin in the game is far less virtuous, and establish a few virtue-related rules to live by. Second, we'll show why skin in the game is a vital component of an effective threat.

### Virtue Requires Skin in the Game

#### The Courage to Act Is Skin in the Game

**Taleb defines courage as the tendency to put skin in the game** —It’s the willingness to bear risk and make sacrifices.

In Taleb’s eyes, courage is the highest virtue because it’s required in order to do anything good. Anything done to benefit others requires some amount of risk that you must be prepared to bear.

Without skin in the game—without true courage—virtue is just empty words. Let’s take a closer look at how this happens.

#### Virtue Without Skin in the Game

All virtuous behavior requires some degree of risk and sacrifice—for example, the sacrifice of time and effort required to spend your weekends volunteering at soup kitchens.

For this reason, **the only way for seemingly virtuous action to lack skin in the game is if it also benefits the one doing the virtuous action**.

The return benefit takes your skin out of the Game by offering you a reward independent of the well-being of the person you’re trying to help. If a man only volunteers at soup kitchens as a means of picking up women, it obviously makes his work less virtuous.

**Taleb judges the virtue of an action by the lack of reward you receive for doing it.** The most virtuous actions are sacrifices made in private with no expectation of return. Publicizing your own virtue cheapens whatever good deed you’ve done. For example, anonymous donations to a good cause are truly virtuous, while widely publicized donations are less so.

> **The Highest Virtue: Taleb Versus Kant**
> 
> This is another place where Taleb’s morality converges with that of philosopher Immanuel Kant. Similarly to Taleb, Kant narrows the definition of virtue. Kant asserts that _true_ virtue is that which is done for no other motive than “good will”—it can’t get you anything in return, whether that be a salary from an employer, intrinsic satisfaction, or even reciprocal love from a significant other. Ideally, sacrifices must be made, and impulses must be restricted.
> 
> In this sense, what Taleb calls “courage” and what Kant calls “good will” are the same thing—the willingness to sacrifice anything to live according to a moral law.
> 
> Still, they don’t totally agree: Kant sees the “moral law” that you should obey as universal, objective, and able to be put into words, while Taleb sees it as unknowable. You could suggest, then, that Taleb sees sacrifice as an even more necessary component of virtue than Kant does, because he sees it as an added pressure to ensure intended positive consequences (skin in the game).
> 
> Neither Taleb nor Kant assert that transactional virtue is necessarily a bad thing or immoral. But it’s not the truest, laudable, highest form of virtue, either.

**Taleb argues that people who make a living in “altruistic careers” outside of the free market—whose income comes from donations or, in the case of government workers, taxes—don’t have skin in the game**. Examples include politicians, lobbyists and activists, and even salaried humanitarian workers. The virtue of these jobs is cheapened somewhat by the salary and other benefits they receive in return.

Additionally, without skin in the game, Taleb insists that activist and nonprofit organizations are more likely to do harm than for-profit businesses, even if their intentions are good. Since these workers’ income isn’t directly tied to how much value they create, it becomes impossible to tell how much good they’re really doing for society.

> **Skin in the Game Problems in Foreign Aid**
> 
> Taleb points to the aid industry as an example of the detrimental effects of nonprofits without skin in the game. Zambia-born economist Dambisa Moyo agrees, noting several unintended consequences of foreign aid, including increasing poverty and stunted economic growth across Africa.
> 
> Often, foreign aid supports corrupt and inefficient governments—in 2004, one expert asserted to a U.S. Senate committee that the aid-minded World Bank abetted the corruption of $100 billion of its funds intended for African development. Additionally, aid takes away the incentive for governments to improve the local economy—it takes 426 days to get a business license in Cameroon, making local enterprise much more difficult and foreign enterprise more attractive. Finally, donated goods can put local Africans out of business. American food sent to Africa earns money for American farmers, not African farmers.
> 
> Foreign aid is certainly a noble cause, but if it’s not executed well, it can cause more harm than good. Taleb’s point is that, without skin in the game, nonprofits are unlikely to learn from their mistakes.

#### Principles of Virtue

##### Principle #1: Don’t publicize your virtue.

Make it a point not to advertise your own virtuous actions or beliefs—practice virtue in secret. The only way you can be sure that you’re doing good is if you’re receiving nothing in return. Otherwise, you risk taking advantage of those you’re claiming to help.

The highest possible virtue is doing good even when it means you’ll be punished for it. The only virtuous opinions you should broadcast are the ones that oppose the dominant consensus, when you risk harming your reputation, or worse, for standing up for what’s right. Think of Malala, the Pakistani activist who was shot in the head by a Taliban assassin for her advocacy for women’s education.

> In this section, Taleb essentially condemns the act of “virtue-signaling”—the act of publicly behaving in a way that makes you look as noble as possible. This criticism has exploded in popularity in recent years, especially online. No one would deny that it’s immoral to pretend to help others for your own gain, but some argue that accusations of virtue-signaling have become increasingly unfounded.
> 
> More frequently, anyone who does anything virtuous is accused of virtue-signaling. While Taleb argues that, ideally, all virtue is done in secret, honest virtue isn’t invalidated just because someone was there to see it. And ironically, many of those who accuse others of virtue-signaling are doing so to bolster their own reputations and claim moral superiority themselves.

##### Principle #2: Don’t advocate for a lifestyle you are unwilling to live.

Don’t advocate for a lifestyle you are unwilling to live. People often proudly support “virtuous” ideologies but are unwilling to make the sacrifices that the ideology logically requires.

To illustrate, Taleb describes the time he met writer and activist Susan Sontag. He recounts how she behaved rudely toward him after learning he used to be a trader, pointedly denouncing the market system.

Taleb asserts that it was immoral for Sontag to live in active opposition to the free market while reaping its benefits—he reports that Sontag fiercely negotiated for large sums of money from publishers and lived in a New York City mansion sold for $28 million. This is a skin in the game imbalance—by advocating for a lifestyle without living it, she was detaching her rewards from the influence she had on others.

If Sontag wanted to pursue her activism morally, she should have put skin in the game by living the lifestyle she advocated for, in a collectivist commune isolated from the free market she fought against. In contrast, Taleb praises progressives Ralph Nader and Simone Weil for living austere lives in accordance with their principles.

> **Sacrifices Made on Principle**
> 
> Taleb doesn’t go into too much detail about how Nader and Weil live according to their virtues—let’s take a closer look here.
> 
> Ralph Nader is an activist famous for sparking reform in a wide range of industries with the goal of protecting consumers from the abuse of power by corporations and government. In alignment with his environmentalist ethic, he doesn’t own a car and relies on the bare minimum of electricity, preferring to write on a typewriter. Taleb says he “leads the life of a monk”—and he does. Nader has never married, and lives in a tiny apartment off of $25,000 a year.
> 
> Simone Weil was a French philosopher and political activist motivated by a need to improve the conditions of the working class. In order to truly understand the impact she wanted to have, Weil quit her job as a high school teacher to spend a year doing grueling work in car factories. She eventually put her life on the line, traveling to Spain to enlist in another country’s civil war, against the authoritarian Nationalist faction. She died of tuberculosis at the age of 34, refusing to eat any more than those in her home country of France were able to under Nazi control.
> 
> Though some of this self-denial may seem unnecessary, Nader’s and Weil’s sacrifices served the very real purpose of putting skin in the game. Those who promote change at a massive scale require greater accountability because the potential harm they could do is greater.

##### Principle #3: If you want to help the world, start a business.

Taleb asserts that a good business does more to help the world than anything else. The risk it takes to start a business gives you a large amount of skin in the game, which, as we’ve discussed, is always a good thing.

Starting a business interacts with the economy at a small scale. There is little chance of doing major damage to the general public, unlike the large-scale systemic impact of government intervention.

Additionally, being willingly paid by customers is the most reliable sign of value because it requires them to sacrifice money—it puts their skin in the game. Every sale means that, at that moment, the customer wants your product more than anything else in the world that amount of money could buy.

In Taleb’s eyes, the most altruistic thing you can do is to start a business, ensure you are generating value by making large profits, then spend those profits generously on others.

> **Ethical Business Practices**
> 
> While Taleb argues that starting a business is the most ethical thing you can do, as companies grow, so do the opportunities for dishonesty and fraud. When starting a business, it’s important to make sustainable, scalable ethics a top priority. Here are some tips for start-up founders on how to create an ethical business:
> 
>   * Define your company’s mission and core values, and consult them frequently as your company grows.
> 
>   * Be choosy about who to hire—you only want team members that share your values and goals.
> 
>   * Invest in your employees—once you’ve assembled a winning team, generous benefits and a positive workplace will keep them excited about your mission.
> 
>   * Know your limits and foster open dissent. Human fallibility requires mutual accountability—encourage your employees to call you out if they believe you’re straying from the organization’s core values.
> 
>   * Start small when giving back to the community—keep an eye out for any opportunities to be generous. Every good deed counts.

### Threats Require Skin in the Game

We’re now going to examine another way skin in the game proves that you are what you claim to be. Taleb writes extensively on threats—how people use skin in the game to intimidate and control the behavior of others. He argues that skin in the game is a key component in effective threats because it’s the only way to indisputably show power.

#### Two Types of Threats

In the sense we’re using it here, a threat is a show of force intended to get someone to do what you want them to do.

Let’s distinguish between two categories of threats: verbal threats and what we’ll call true threats. Verbal threats are when someone _tells_ you __ how they’ll hurt you if you don’t comply, while true threats are when someone _shows_ you how they’ll hurt you if you don’t comply.

Verbal threats are what most of us imagine when we think of “threats.” If a farmer is on his porch with a rifle and tells a trespasser that if he doesn’t get off his property, he’ll shoot, that’s a verbal threat. In certain situations, verbal threats can actually make you appear weaker. Ironically, someone who tries too hard to appear intimidating can seem weak, like they’re trying too hard to avoid real confrontation.

True threats are far more effective. **True threats show your target that your power is real** , typically by getting as close as possible to actually going through with the threat, without actually doing it. If our farmer on the porch shoots the hat off of his trespasser’s head, that’s a true threat. It proves that the farmer has the power to carry out his threat. This action always entails risk, putting skin in the game. Our farmer risks accidentally hitting the trespasser, or aggravating the trespasser into pulling a gun on him.

> **The True Threat of Nuclear Retaliation**
> 
> Nuclear proliferation has been a hot-button issue for decades, and the debate is centered around true threats—nuclear weapons are necessary, it’s argued, because the very real true threat of retaliation deters all nations from firing at all. If only one side had nukes, there would be nothing to stop them from using it.
> 
> Some argue that this train of thought is faulty. People at war act irrationally, and eventually, someone will make the decision to launch. Nuclear weapons are a time bomb in that respect, and the safest course of action is worldwide disarmament. Biological and chemical weapons have already been agreeably done away with (for the most part), and, although it wouldn’t be easy, it’s possible to do the same for nuclear weapons.
> 
> Others argue that nuclear weapons are successful deterrents of all kinds of warfare and that, by allowing all nations to wreak relatively equal havoc on one another, nukes allow weaker nations to stand up for themselves. For example, the author of the Forbes piece linked above argues that the fact that Israel hasn’t been invaded since producing a nuclear bomb in 1968 speaks to the efficacy of nuclear deterrence. Theorists in this camp see complete nuclear disarmament as unfeasible, as most nuclear states continue to upgrade their stockpiles instead of moving toward “complete disarmament” as agreed in 1968.
> 
> The debate of whether or not nuclear threats are effective at preserving peace rages on—but surprisingly, Taleb doesn’t see it as a huge threat. He has faith in nuclear deterrence and argues that, even in a worst-case scenario, nuclear explosions don’t cause multiplicative damage like a biological weapon would—although it would be disastrous, a nuclear strike wouldn’t be the end of the world.

#### Assassins Win if They Don’t Have to Kill

To illustrate this idea, Taleb spends a significant amount of time talking about assassins—specifically, the original Assassins, an Islamic sect from the Middle Ages from which we get the word “assassin.”

These Assassins dealt in true threats. Their goal was to exert control over those in power in order to advance various religious and political goals. For example, they left a dagger planted in the earth next to where the sultan Ahmad Sanjar was sleeping, showing him that they were capable of killing him if he didn’t submit to their demands.**** They carried out their threats if they had to, but they preferred to exert control by avoiding bloodshed altogether.

(Shortform note: When they did kill, however, these Assassins did everything in their power to cultivate an image of power and mystery. The more fearful their reputation, the less real killing they had to do. For this reason, Assassins struck in crowded public areas, for example, during prayer at a mosque. Not only did witnesses get to see how effective the Assassins were,__ they saw that _they were willing to do anything to kill their target_. Assassins were often immediately caught and eventually put to death, showing their dedication to the job and making the order seem even more intimidating.)
