## Part 2-4: Nuts, Seeds, and Spices

### Flaxseeds

#### Daily Recommendations

1 serving per day

**Serving size**

  * 1 tablespoon ground



What to eat: Golden or brown flaxseeds

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Nutrients

  * Contains lignans and omega-3 fatty acids
  * It’s best to blend flaxseeds for better digestion. Ground flaxseed should last at least 4 months at room temperature.



Studies show:

  * A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial showed blood pressure drop from 158/82 to 143/75 after eating a few tablespoons of flaxseed a day, compared to no change in control.
  * Prostate cancer patients eating 3 tablespoons per day of flaxseed after a month show lower cancer proliferation rate.



### Nuts and Seeds

#### Daily Recommendations

1 serving per day

**Serving sizes**

  * ¼ cup nuts or seeds
  * 2 tablespoons nut or seed butter



What to eat: Almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, chia seeds, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, walnuts

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Studies show:

  * ¼ cup of nuts daily may lead to lifespan extension of 2 years+
  * Nuts have high caloric density, but studies show that adding nuts to diet cause lower weight gain than control. Where do the high calories from nuts go?
    * 70% of nut calories displace other foods.
    * 10% of calories are not absorbed by the gut.
    * 20% may come from nuts boosting metabolism.



#### Specific Choices

**Walnuts**

  * Have the highest antioxidant and omega-3 levels and suppress cancer proliferation _in vitro_.
  * The PREDIMED study showed the Mediterranean diet with nuts reduced stroke risk by 50%, and lowered all-cause mortality risk by 39%, while olive oil did not reduce all-cause mortality.



**Peanuts**

  * Women at high risk for heart disease who eat nuts or peanut butter daily halve their risk of heart attack compared to non-eaters.



**Pistachios**

  * Erectile dysfunction is an early sign of vascular disease and can predict heart disease.
    * 40 over 40 rule: 40% of men over age 40 have erectile dysfunction.
  * 3 to 4 handfuls of pistachios a day for 3 weeks show improvement of erectile function by 50%
  * The Nurses’ Health Study show pistachios can also improve female lifespan.



### Herbs and Spices

#### Daily Recommendations

1 serving per day

**Serving sizes**

  * ¼ teaspoon turmeric
  *     * any other you enjoy



**What to eat:** Allspice, barberries, basil, bay leaves, cardamom, chili powder, cilantro, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, cumin, curry powder, dill, fenugreek, garlic, ginger, horseradish, lemongrass, marjoram, mustard powder, nutmeg, oregano, smoked paprika, parsley, pepper, peppermint, rosemary, saffron, sage, thyme, turmeric, vanilla

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Nutrients: Spices have high antioxidant density.

This can be too much of a good thing

  * Poppy seeds contain opium, and you can overdose—the safe dose is below 1 teaspoon for 10lbs of body weight.
  * Nutmeg can create amphetamine-like compounds—the safe dose below 2-3 tsp per day.
  * Cassia cinnamon contains coumarin, which may be toxic to liver—the safe dose is below a teaspoon per day.



#### Specific Choices

**Turmeric**

  * Curcumin appears to be the dominant active ingredient.
  * Turmeric has been shown to reduce lung disease, brain disease, cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ulcerative colitis.
  * 1/8 teaspoon of turmeric daily reduces free radical damage and DNA breakage by 50%, in extracted blood cells.
  * A compound in black pepper (piperine) inhibits drug metabolism in the liver and increases the bioavailability of turmeric.
  * Cooked turmeric seems to offer better DNA protection. Raw turmeric offers better anti-inflammatory effects.
  * What about curcumin supplements?
    * Turmeric appeared to have twice the effect of curcumin in inhibiting cancer cell growth _in vitro_.
    * Curcumin-free turmeric has similar effects as turmeric, so other compounds in turmeric may contribute to its health benefits.
    * Eating curcumin supplements also raises more of a risk of overdosing on curcumin.
  * Don’t take turmeric if you have gallstones (it pumps the gallbladder and causes pain) or if you’re prone to kidney stones (turmeric contains oxalates; restrict to <1 teaspoon daily of turmeric if you have kidney stones).



**Fenugreek**

  * Found to improve 1 rep max lifts for leg press and bench press, by about 100%. (For the leg press, placebo improved 48kg, while the fenugreek group improved 84kg.)
  * It has an odd site effect—it causes armpits to smell like maple syrup.



**Cilantro**

  * Reduces inflammation levels in arthritis patients and reduces uric-acid levels



**Cayenne pepper**

  * Might be useful for cluster headaches and irritable bowel syndrome, because it depletes a pain neurotransmitter (substance P).



**Ginger**

  * A randomized controlled trial showed 1/8 tsp of ginger worked as well as the drug sumatriptan for migraines.
  * 1/8 tsp a day, 3 times a day reduced menstrual cramp pain from an 8 to a 3 over 2 months (using the 10-point pain scale).
  * Ginger counters vomiting and motion sickness.
  * During pregnancy, the maximum amount of ginger recommended is 20g.



**Peppermint**

  * This is the most antioxidant-dense common herb.



**Oregano and marjoram**

  * Containing antioxidants, these herbs reduce chromosome damage from radioactive iodine by 70% _in vitro_.



**Cloves**

  * This is the most antioxidant-dense common spice.



**Amla** (powdered dried Indian gooseberry fruit spice)

  * This is the most antioxidant-dense uncommon spice, at 261.5 units compared to 9.24 for blueberries.



**Spice mixes**

  * Spice mix, when applied to a high-fat chicken meal, doubled antioxidant presence in bloodstream and reduced triglycerides in blood by 30%.



**Liquid smoke**

  * Smoke compounds are carcinogenic, but they’re fat-soluble. Therefore, the cancer-causing compounds don’t reside in spices or liquid smoke.
