## Shortform Introduction

### Caveats

_How Not to Die_ contains many good ideas, and it's one of the most rigorously cited mass-market books on nutrition out there.

That said, because it's written for a wide audience and doesn't want to bog readers down in scientifically precise language, Michael Greger sometimes cuts corners on his claims. Here are issues to note:

**The magnitude of effects is important.** Does eating organic blueberries have a 5% effect or a 50% improvement of health, compared to conventionally grown blueberries? Does meat-eating cost 1 year of life, or 5 years? Often Greger simply says the difference "is significant"—but this is a statistical term, which laymen may misconstrue as "the difference is huge." He often does this more when the difference is small (below 5%). When the difference is big, he'll use the actual number ("a 20% difference!"). This is misleading and over-represents the effects of some diet choices.

**Whenever Greger says something has "up to a [X%] difference", this is misleading.** When doing statistical analysis, science uses confidence intervals—"the effect can be as low as 1%, as high as 10%, and an average of 5%." Greger would sometimes represent this to mean "up to 10% improvement." This is misleading as it over-represents the likely effect.

**Many of the underlying cited studies are questionable in scientific rigor**. This includes issues such as small sample sizes, unclear controls, unclear selection of the patient group, funding by the agricultural group that would benefit from positive results, and only one study done for the conclusion. Remember that all scientists have an agenda and naturally bias toward publishing positive results. But based on a single study, he might say confident blanket statements like “citrus protects DNA from damage.” By far the most convincing studies are large population studies, or large randomized controlled trials, which are highlighted in the next section.

Occasionally his interpretations of research is questionable. For instance, to promote organic foods, he says “organic fruits and vegetables do appear to have more nontraditional nutrients like polyphenol antioxidants.” However, his cited study found “no consistent differences in plasma or urine carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamins E and C content, LDL cholesterol, antioxidant activity, ability to protect against DNA damage, immune system markers between participants consuming organic and conventional diets.” Now, they do say slightly different things—he’s talking about nutrient density in foods, and the study is talking about blood levels. **But it’s disingenuous to use this citation to back up his point.** By far he says what most of his references say, but this error occurred more often than expected, thus possibly requiring a slight downweighting of his recommendations down a notch.

### The Most Convincing Studies

_How Not to Die_ features hundreds of nutritional studies to back up its claims. While many of them suffer from the issues discussed above, a handful of them stand out as particularly robust and well-known among scientists. If you’re interested in digging deeper into the book, you might find these studies especially meaningful.

  * The Nurses’ Health Study showed that consumption of processed and unprocessed red meat was associated with an increased risk of death from cancer and heart disease, and shorter life spans. Each increase of 1 serving of meat per day increases mortality in a stepwise fashion. Processed red meat is worse than unprocessed red meat.
  * Similar conclusion from NIH-AARP study, showing a higher mortality risk between the highest and lowest quintile of red meat eaters, for both men and women. Both of these control for BMI, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, energy intake, and vegetable consumption. So meat itself looks damaging, even after controlling for vegetables.
  * The Ornish Lifestyle Heart Trial showing that lifestyle changes could **reverse** heart disease, reducing stenosis by 8% over 5 years, compared to 28% worsening for control.
  * The PREDIMED randomized controlled trial showed that the Mediterranean diet with olive oil or nuts reduced the risk of stroke by 30-50% and reduced mortality risk by 39%.
  * A Taiwanese population study showed that even eating just a little meat (a serving every few days) increased the rates of diabetes by 2x in men and 4x in women, compared to vegetarians.
  * Fruit and vegetable consumption reduces stroke by 30% and coronary heart disease by 20% when controlled for typical factors (like BMI, smoking, and alcohol).



### Organization of the Book

The book is divided into two major parts:

  * Part 1: A discussion of the 15 most common causes of death, in decreasing order, starting from heart disease and ending with deaths caused by medical care. For each disease, Greger explains how the disease arises and its risk factors, as well as ways to decrease your chance of dying from this disease.
  * Part 2: A discussion of what to eat to reduce your risk of all causes of death. Based on a whole-foods, plant-based diet, Greger discusses the benefits of foods like vegetables, berries, and nuts. He also recommends certain foods within a group as healthier than others.
