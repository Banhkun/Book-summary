## Part 1-7: Prostate Cancer, Parkinson’s

### Prostate Cancer

Annual deaths from prostate cancer: 28,000

#### Prostate Function and Disease

The prostate surrounds the urethra and secretes the fluid part of semen.

Half of men over 80 have prostate cancer, but most die with the disease.

#### Dietary Risks for Prostate Cancer

**Milk and hormones**

  * High intake of dairy products increases total prostate cancer risk with a relative risk of 1.07.
  * Overall, each daily glass of milk showed higher rates of premature death, heart disease, and cancer in women.
    * 3 or more glasses of milk a day show a mortality hazard ratio of 1.93!
  * Women who drink milk have 5x the rate of twin births.
  * Japanese men showed a 25x increase in prostate cancer risk after World War II. This is also associated with a 7x, 9x, and 20x increase in egg, meat, and dairy consumption respectively.
  * Cow’s milk stimulates human prostate cancer cells _in vitro_ by 30%.
  * The culprit could be D-galactose, which induces premature aging in lab animals and causes acute symptoms in patients with galactosemia, possibly from oxidative stress.



**Eggs and choline**

  * Men eating 2.5+ eggs/week show 81% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer.
  * The culprit could be choline, which is converted into the toxin trimethylamine.
  * Overall, men eating poultry showed 4x the risk of prostate cancer progression (like metastasis) which could be due to cooked-meat carcinogens like HCAs.



**Meat and IGF-1**

  * IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) stimulates cell production. This is useful for growth as a child, but less helpful in adulthood.
    * Laron syndrome is caused by a natural inability to produce IGF-1. These patients almost never get cancer.
  * IGF-1 is triggered by animal protein consumption.
    * After 11 days of avoiding animal protein, IGF-1 levels drop by 20%, and IGF-1 binding protein levels increase by 50%.
  * An increase in animal protein consumption of 3% is associated with a 15% increased risk of bladder cancer.
  * Vegetarians who include eggs and dairy in diets don’t achieve significant reduction in IGF-1.



#### How Not to Die from Prostate Cancer

**Vegetarian diet**

  * _In vitro_ , blood from a standard diet slowed down prostate cancer cell growth by 9%. Blood from men placed on a plant-based diet for a year reduced cancer cell growth by 70%.
  * Cruciferous vegetables are especially helpful, cutting cancer progression by over 50%.
  * Increasing plant protein intake of 2% is associated with a 23% decreased risk of cancer.
  * Vegetarian diets can reverse prostate cancer. PSA levels in people on a plant-based diet decrease, while levels increase in a control group.



**Exercise vs Diet**

  * Exercise is helpful, but not as helpful as a plant-based diet.
    * This was shown by comparing 3 groups: 1) the control, which was sedentary, 2) exercise-only (15 years exercising for an hour each day, 5 times a week), and 3) plant diet + moderate exercise (14 years of plant-based diet, and moderate exercise like a daily walk)
    * _In vitro_ , blood from the control group killed 1-2% of cancer cells. Blood from the exercise group killed 20x more cells. Blood from plant-diet group killed 40x more cells.



**Flaxseed**

  * Lignans are phytoestrogens shown to slow prostate cancer cell growth _in vitro_. Lignans are especially concentrated in flaxseeds.
  * Prostate cancer patients eating 3 tablespoons per day of flaxseed after a month show lower cancer proliferation rate.
  * Flaxseed is also comparable to drugs like Flomax in causing relief for benign prostatic hyperplasia.



### Parkinson’s Disease

25,000 people die from Parkinson’s every year

#### Mechanism of Parkinson’s Disease

Dopaminergic neurons in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra control movement.

In Parkinson’s, these cells die off. 70% of the cells could be dead before symptoms appear.

Head trauma increases risk of Parkinson’s (think Muhammad Ali). So wear helmets, and don’t box or play football.

#### Toxins Linked to Parkinson’s

Toxins have been linked to elevated levels of Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s brains show elevated levels of pesticides and PCBs. The higher level of pollutants, the more damage seen in the substantia nigra.

Chemicals flow into oceans and into animal feed, and then get concentrated in meat.

**Toxins last in the environment for a long time.**

  * The halflife of mercury is 2 months. The halflife of dioxins, PCBs, and DDT is much longer, as long as 10 years.
  * Breast milk shows higher concentrations of pollutants in the first pregnancy vs. subsequent ones. This suggests toxins accumulate in the mother’s body over decades, then are extruded through milk.



Top sources of common toxins:

  * Arsenic: poultry, tuna
  * Lead: dairy
  * Mercury: seafood
  * DDT: fish
  * PCB: fish and fish oil
  * Hexachlorobenzene: dairy and meat
  * Dioxins: butter, eggs, processed meat



Children are more at risk of arsenic, the pesticide dieldrin, dioxins, and DDE (DDT by-product).

Aren’t most of these toxins banned from industrial usage? How do they get into meat even after they’ve been banned?

  * **Toxins get concentrated down the food chain**. Toxins appear in rain and water at low levels and enter plants. Then animals that eat a large quantity of those plants, like cows and pigs, severely concentrate the toxins in their meat.
  * Animal feed sometimes consists of animal trimmings itself, and animals further concentrated by eating other animals. So toxins accumulate in generations of cannibalistic animals, then we eat the animals that have highly concentrated toxins. 



Finally, these toxins show a link to Parkinson’s Disease.

  * Toxins cause direct damage to protein folding: pesticides are able to trigger accumulation of alpha-synuclein proteins _in vitro_.
  * Eating more than half an egg a day is associated with 2-3 times higher odds for cancers of the mouth, colon, bladder, prostate, and breast. THis might be because of dioxins.
  * The risk of Parkinson’s may increase 17% for every daily cup of milk drunk.
    * This may not necessarily be due to toxins, since the effect seemed more closely tied to lactose than to milk fat, and to milk than to butter. Galactose could be the culprit.
    * Milk may also lower uric acid, an antioxidant in the brain.



Constipation is associated with Parkinson’s.

  * This could be because Parkinson’s causes a lack of thirst and decreases fluid intake.
  * Alternatively, it could be causative—the longer feces stay in the bowel, the longer time feces can be absorbed from the diet.



#### How Not to Die from Parkinson’s Disease

**Nicotine**

  * Smoking has repeatedly been associated with lower Parkinson’s risk.
  * Obviously smoking comes with all sorts of other problems, so it’s best to get nicotine from outside the diet. The highest non-tobacco sources of nicotine are in bell peppers, then tomatoes, and small amounts in potatoes. Pepper eating is associated with lower risk of Parkinson’s.



**Plant-based diet**

  * People who eat dairy-free, plant-based diets show lower levels of PCB toxins associated with Parkinson’s.
  * Mercury in the hair of plant-based diet eaters were up to 10x lower than in hair of people who ate fish.
  * A plant-based diet removes 98% of dioxin intake.



**Berries and flavonoids**

  * Flavonoids inhibited alpha synuclein deposits from accumulating _in vitro_
  * A population study showed berry eating does lower risk of Parkinson’s.



**Coffee and caffeine**

  * Coffee consumption is associated with 1/3 lower risk of Parkinson’s.
  * Caffeine seems to be the main effector—tea is protective, but decaf is not.
  * Giving the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee per day in caffeine improved movement symptoms in Parkinson’s patients in 3 weeks.
