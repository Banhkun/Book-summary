## Part 2-6: Exercise and Supplements

### Exercise

#### Daily Recommendations

1 serving per day

**Serving sizes**

  * 90 minutes of moderate-intensity activity
  * 40 minutes of vigorous activity



**What to do**

  * Moderate-intensity activity includes cycling, hiking, housework, ice skating, shoveling snow, walking briskly (4 mph), yard work, yoga.
  * Vigorous activity includes basketball, jogging, rock climbing, running, vigorous swimming, tennis, and weightlifting.



#### Nutrients and Benefits

Is exercise more important than eating for body weight? No—**eating is still the principal cause of obesity**.

  * Compared to past times, people may actually be increasing physical activity over time, but foods are more calorically dense now and cause a net increase in calories eaten.
  * Compared to exercising away 100 calories, simply not eating those 100 calories is usually much easier.
  * Diet is the #1 risk factor for decreasing lifespan, responsible for 26% of deaths and 14% disability-adjusted life years, compared to tobacco smoking at 22% and 12% respectively.
  * Losing 1% of the nation’s body-mass index could reduce 2 million cases of diabetes, 1.5 million cases of heart disease, and 127,000 cases of cancer.



#### Specific Choices

**Sit less.**

  * Every extra hour spent watching TV per day is associated with 11% increased risk of death.
  * Men who sit for >6 hours per day have a 20% higher death rate compared to men sitting <3 hours. Women show a larger increase in mortality at 40%. This is true even among people who exercise daily for an hour.
  * A possible mechanism is endothelial dysfunction—when active, blood flow increases, and blood vessels signal to arteries to relax. This effect doesn’t happen when a person is inactive.
  * Walking 300 minutes per week reduces mortality by 14%. Walking 150 minutes per week reduces mortality by 7%, and walking 60 minutes/week reduces mortality by 3%.



**Other options for activity:**

  * Switch to a standing desk—this causes an extra 30,000 calories burned per year.
  * Have walking meetings or stand-up meetings instead of sit-down meetings.
  * Take short breaks from work, taking just 1 minute to walk or climb stairs.
  * Turmeric can improve endothelial function, along with 1 hour per day of exercise.



**Reduce muscle soreness and oxidative stress from exercise.**

  * Reduce lactic acid with bioflavonoids from citrus.
  * Reduce inflammation with anthocyanin flavonoids in berries.
  * Whole-food antioxidants reduce DNA damage from exercise, whereas vitamin C supplements promote even more oxidative stress.



### Supplements

While Dr. Greger recommends that all your nutrients come from whole foods, he does suggest that a few nutrients be supplemented when on a plant-based diet.

**Vitamin B12**

  * B12 is made only by microbes, and is present in meat but not plants.
  * B12 deficiency can lead to paralysis, psychosis, and blindness.
  * Dosing
    * If you’re under 65: 2,500 micrograms of cyanocobalamin once a week, or 250 micrograms a day
    * If you’re over 65: up to 1,000 micrograms daily



**Vitamin D**

  * If you live above 40 degrees latitude, during the months of November through February, you might get so little direct sunlight that you don’t produce any vitamin D.
  * Dosing
    * One 2,000 IU vitamin D3 daily



**Iodine**

  * Dosing
    * 150 micrograms daily
  * Green-light: Seaweed has iodine; eat two sheets of nori.
  * Yellow-light: Seafood and dairy milk
  * Red-light: Iodized salt—the sodium is too high.



**Omega-3s**

  * Dosing
    * 250mg omega-3s
  * Algae oil or yeast products are best.
  * Avoid fish oil. They contain PCBs, mercury, and pollutants. Mercury from seafood can worsen cognitive performance.
