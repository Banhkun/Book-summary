## Part 1-6: Breast Cancer, Suicide

Annual deaths from breast cancer: 41,000

  * 230,000 are diagnosed each year.



#### Risk Factors for Breast Cancer

**Alcohol**

  * The metabolic product of alcohol, acetaldehyde, is the carcinogen.
  * Even moderate drinking—one drink a day—shows a small increase in risk of breast cancer.
  * Red wine is exempt from this effect, possibly because of compounds in grape skins that suppress estrogen synthase.



**Decreased melatonin**

  * Melatonin regulates sleep and circadian rhythm and is secreted in the dark. Melatonin suppresses cancer growth.
  * Blind women (who secrete melatonin constantly) shows half the odds of breast cancer.
  * Women who work on night shifts show an increased relative risk (1.14) for breast cancer.
  * Higher vegetable intake increases melatonin levels; meat lowers melatonin.



**Heterocyclic amines (HCAs)**

  * HCAs are produced when cooking meat at high temperatures.
  * Meat eaters who eat well-done meat eaters show 5x the odds of breast cancer compared to people who eat rare meat. Well-done meat eaters also show a higher risk of colon, esophagus, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach cancer.
  * Mechanism of action: a particular HCA (PhIP) has estrogen-like effects and induces breast-cancer cell growth.



**Cholesterol**

  * LDL may be used by breast cancer to synthesize estrogen or tumor membranes for cell growth.
  * Women with total cholesterol >240 show a 17% increased risk of breast cancer vs. those with cholesterol <160.



#### How Not to Die from Breast Cancer

**Exercise**

  * Five hours a week of vigorous aerobic exercise lowers estrogen and progesterone by 20%.
  * Walking an hour a day shows reduced relative risk (0.91) when controlled for BMI.



**Fiber**

  * Premenopausal women who ate 6g of fiber a day had 62% lower odds of breast cancer vs those eating <4g a day.
  * Every 20g fiber/day showed a 15% lower risk of breast cancer.
  * Getting up to a minimum of 25g/day may be required to show an effect. The average vegetarian may only get 20g/day.



**Apples**

  * Daily apple eaters show 24% lower odds of breast cancer (and also of ovarian, laryngeal, and colorectal cancers).
  * Apples contain antioxidants in skin that seem to suppress breast cancer cell growth _in vitro_.
  * Compounds in skin reactivate maspin (mammary serine protease inhibitor) which reduces cancer growth.



**Cruciferous Vegetables**

  * 250g each of broccoli and brussels sprouts per day reduced heterocyclic amine (HCA) levels in urine by around 22%.
  * Mechanism of action: may improve liver function to detoxify HCAs.
  * Sulforaphane suppresses the ability to form tumors. To match the levels of sulforaphane used in _in vitro_ studies, you would need to eat ¼ cup of broccoli sprouts a day



**Flaxseeds**

  * Contain lignans and phytoestrogens that dampen the effects of human-made estrogen.
  * 1 tbsp of flaxseeds can extend a woman’s menstrual cycle by a day.
  * A study of cancer patients showed that eating a 25g flaxseed muffin caused a 31% increase in apoptosis and a 71% reduction in C-erB2 (a marker of cancer aggressiveness).



**Soy**

  * Women with breast cancer who ate the most soy had reduced mortality and recurrence of cancer.
  * Eating soy during childhood cuts the risk of breast cancer in adulthood by half. Eating soy as an adult reduces risk by 25%.
  * Soy contains phytoestrogens, which stimulate the estrogen receptor less strongly and compete against estrogen for binding.
  * Soy may reactivate the anti-cancer BRCA genes through demethylation.



**Miscellaneous Foods**

  * Green tea consumption is associated with a 30% reduction in breast cancer risk.
  * Mushrooms: >1/2 a mushroom per day shows 64% lower odds of breast cancer.



### Suicidal Depression

Annual deaths from suicide: 41,000

7% of the population suffers from at least one depressive episode each year.

#### Depression

The definitive cause of depression is unknown.

The monoamine theory suggests that depression arises from the relative depletion of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.

  * The enzyme monoamine oxidase breaks down monoamines; people with depression show higher levels of this enzyme.
  * Tryptophan is an amino acid and precursor to serotonin. Depletion of tryptophan worsens mood.



#### How to Reduce Risk of Depression

Disclaimer: there are big confounds with associative studies between mood and diet.

  * Vegetarians are often reported to be happier than omnivores. However, it’s not clear the vegetarian diet is causative—it could be that happier people tend to seek out vegetarian diets.
  * The gold standard, as always, is a randomized placebo-controlled trial



**Reduce arachidonic acid from meat.**

  * This is a proinflammatory compound; produced naturally in our bodies, but enriched in animal products.
  * Omnivores consume 9x more arachidonic acid than vegetarians.
  * In multiple studies, omnivores that go onto a plant-based diet report significantly increased energy, better sleep, and general health.
  * Highest sources of arachidonic acid: chicken and eggs have the highest level; beef, pork, and fish.



**Avoid aspartame.**

  * An experiment showed a high-aspartame diet shows more depression and irritability and lower cognitive function



**Plants are natural monoamine oxidase inhibitors.**

  * Phytonutrients from plant foods like apples, berries, onions, spices naturally inhibit MAO, which increase levels of neurotransmitters in the brain.



**Tryptophan**

  * If tryptophan is important to produce serotonin, why not eat more of it?
    * Tryptophan supplements led to deaths in the 1980s and subsequent bans.
    * High-protein meals fail to increase tryptophan, possibly because other amino acids compete for absorption in the gut or across blood-brain barrier.
  * Carb ingestion improves mood and lowers depression.
    * This might work by shunting non-tryptophan amino acids from the bloodstream into muscles, which then allows tryptophan more access into brain.
  * Seeds like sesame, sunflower, and pumpkin have high tryptophan-protein ratios.



**Saffron**

  * Worked as well as Prozac for depression.
  * Smelling diluted saffron improves anxiety for 20 minutes.



**Coffee**

  * Suicide risk drops with increases in coffee dose.
    * People who drink 6 cups of coffee daily were 80% less likely to commit suicide.
  * Adding sugar to coffee negates its positive effects on mood.



**Antioxidants and folate**

  * Free radicals and oxidative stress cause tissue damage.
  * Higher levels of carotenoids reduce damage.
    * Lycopene from tomatoes has the highest antioxidant activity.
    * Daily eaters of tomatoes have half the odds of depression.
  * Antioxidant supplements do not seem protective, while whole foods do.



**Exercise**

  * An interventional study showed exercise was equivalent to Zoloft for relieving depression in people over 50 years old.
