## Part 1-5: Blood Cancers, Kidney Disease

### Blood Cancers

Annual deaths from blood cancers: 56,000

This includes a range of diseases:

  * Leukemia: 52,000 diagnosed each year, 24,000 die
    * In leukemia, bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells, crowding out the ability to produce red blood cells and white blood cells. Leads to anemia, infection, death.
  * Lymphoma: 70,000 diagnosed, 19,000 die
    * Lymphoma is the proliferation of lymphocytes, which are white blood cells.
    * These cells collect in lymph nodes and disrupt immunity.
  * Myeloma: 24,000 diagnosed, 11,000 die
    * Myeloma is the proliferation of plasma cells, which are antibody-secreting white blood cells.
    * These cells displace bone marrow and make abnormal levels of antibodies that clog kidneys.
    * Multiple myeloma happens when cancer is discovered in multiple bones.
    * This is particularly resistant to treatment; most people diagnosed do not survive beyond 5 years.



#### Animal Viruses Causing Cancer

Of all foods in the large population EPIC study, poultry showed the greatest risk for blood cancers. For every 50g of poultry you consume daily, your risk of blood cancer increases between 56 and 280 percent. By comparison, a chicken breast weighs 350 g.

Why could this happen? A hypothesis: poultry viruses cause cancer. The viruses include avian herpesvirus, avian leukosis virus, and lymphoproliferative disease

  * People who grow up on poultry farms show almost 3x the odds of blood cancer.
  * Farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and butchers all show higher rates of blood cancers.
  * Some other animal products like milk show no such cancer risk, so it’s not from exposure to toxins like dioxins.
  * Eating well-done meat lowers the risk of lymphoma compared to rare meat, even though it increases exposure to cooked meat carcinogens.
  * There’s still no smoking gun yet on viruses directly causing cancer through infection and genetic mutation. This is an area of active research.



#### How Not to Die from Blood Cancers

Besides reducing your consumption of poultry, eating specific things helps protect against blood cancers:

**Greens**

  * A plant-based diet reduces all cancer forms, lowering risk of blood cancer by half.
  * Patients with lymphoma that eat >3 vegetable servings a day show a 42% improved survival rate. Green, leafy vegetables and citrus showed the most protective effects.
    * It’s not clear whether the diet reduced cancer effects, or it improved tolerance to chemotherapy.
  * In healthy patients, >5 servings of green, leafy vegetables per week showed half the odds of lymphoma.
  * Sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables kills cancer _in vitro_ while ignoring healthy cells.
  * Vitamin C and carotenoid in diet lowers lymphoma risk, but supplementing vitamin C doesn’t do anything.
    * High-dose supplements actually increase the risk of death. Why? A large dose may disrupt the natural balance of antioxidants that reduce disease



**Acai Berries**

  * An extract of acai triggers apoptosis in cancer cell line _in vitro_ , and it increases the activity of macrophages.
  * To get better antioxidant bang for your buck, look to purple cabbage, cinnamon, and cloves.



**Curcumin (from turmeric)**

  * In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, curcumin reduced antibody levels in myeloma patients.
  * _In vitro_ , curcumin stopped myeloma cell growth.



As a side note, pet ownership seems to lower lymphoma risk. The mechanism might be by boosting immunity.

### Kidney Disease

Annual deaths from kidney disease: 60,000

#### Kidney Disease

  * Kidneys filter 150 quarts of blood daily to make 1-2 quarts of urine.
  * Kidney malfunction leads to accumulation of toxins, causing weakness, shortness of breath, and confusion.
  * Kidney failure requires dialysis, but the life expectancy of a patient requiring dialysis is less than 3 years.
  * Only 41% of Americans have normal kidney function, compared to 52% 10 years ago. Something in the environment is likely causing this trend.
  * Most people with kidney failure die from other causes like cardiovascular disease. Patients under 45 with kidney failure are 100 times more likely to die from heart disease.



#### Animal Meat and Kidney Disease

**Animal protein, animal fat, and cholesterol all implicated in declining kidney function.**

  * Animal protein causes hyperfiltration, or an increase in workload of kidney.
    * Kidney filtration rate shoots up within hours of eating animal protein.
    * Humans evolved a hyperfiltration capacity to handle sudden boosts in protein intake, say from a fortuitous killing of a large animal. Eating a lot of animal protein once in a while is OK. But now we’re overloading daily.
  * Mechanism of action: animal products cause inflammation in the kidney.
    * In an experiment, giving an anti-inflammatory drug along with eating animal protein shows no hyperfiltration response.
  * Another mechanism of action: meat protein increases acid load to the kidneys. Animal protein tends to have higher levels of sulfur-containing amino acids like methionine
    * The worst offenders are fish (including tuna), pork, poultry, cheese, beef
    * Acid load requires ammonia production to balance pH. Chronic exposure to ammonia is toxic and degrades kidney function over time
    * Eating sodium bicarbonate can lower the acid load, but this comes with excess sodium which itself causes kidney damage.



**There is no correlation between plant protein or plant fat with kidney damage.**

  * Compared to eating animal protein, eating an equivalent amount of plant protein causes no noticeable stress on kidneys.
  * A six-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial showed that plant protein helps preserve function in diseased kidneys, compared to dairy protein.
  * Unlike animal foods which are acidic, plant foods are basic.
    * Plant protein does not contain as much acidic amino acid
    * Plant-based diet can return acidic urine to neutral within a week
    * Best performing plants here are vegetables, fruits, and beans.



#### Kidney Stones

1 in 11 Americans are affected by kidney stones today.

They’re formed from crystallized calcium oxalates and uric acid.

**Eating less meat reduces the risk of kidney stones a lot.**

  * Eating extra animal protein (1 can of tuna fish daily) increased the risk of kidney stones by 250%.
  * Eating less meat and salt reduced kidney stone risk by 50%, compared to a low-calcium diet which only decreased by 25%.
  * Removing all meat reduces risk of uric acid crystallization by over 90% in 5 days.
  * Higher vegetable intake does not increase risk of stone formation, despite increase in oxalate dosing



#### Phosphorus

Excess phosphorus increases risk of kidney failure and heart failure. It seems to damage blood vessels and hasten aging and bone loss.

Americans consume twice as much phosphorus as needed.

The source of phosphorus matters—**animal phosphorus is much more damaging than plant phosphorus**.

  * Animal phosphorus comes in phosphate form, which is readily absorbed.
  * Plant phosphorus comes in phytate form, which is not readily absorbed.
  * This is similar to the difference in absorption of animal heme iron vs plant non-heme iron (from the chapter on colorectal cancers).



Phosphorus additives are the worst. These are found in cola drinks, and they’re added to meat to enhance color and add water weight.

  * Avoid foods that contain pyrophosphate and sodium triphosphate.



#### Nitrosamines

Nitrosamines are **carcinogens that result from nitrites used for curing meat**.

The chemical reaction involved has nitrates turning into nitrites, which then turn into carcinogenic nitrosamines and nitrosamides.

  * Thus, nitrates and nitrites are precursors to nitrosamines.
  * For nitrite free food, look at the fine print—the label often says “nitrite-free, except those naturally occurring in celery juice.” This is equally as bad—fermented celery juice contains nitrites.



Tobacco use is a big risk factor for kidney cancer because of nitrosamines. Nitrosamines stick to blood vessel walls and continue harming—so-called thirdhand smoke.

One hot dog has as many nitrosamines and nitrosamides as 4 cigarettes. To reduce your risk, reduce your processed meat consumption to under 20g a day.

Once again, **animal sources of amines are more harmful than plant sources.**

  * Animal products contain amines and amides, thus creating nitrosamine in the stomach.
  * Plant foods contain not only contain less amines and amides, but they also contain vitamin C and other antioxidants that block the formation of nitrosamine. Thus, unlike meat, plant foods do not show an increased risk for kidney cancer.
