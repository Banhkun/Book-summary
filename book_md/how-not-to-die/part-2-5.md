## Part 2-5: Whole Grains and Beverages

### Whole Grains

#### Daily Recommendations

3 servings per day

**Serving sizes**

  * ½ cup hot cereal or cooked grains, pasta
  * 1 cup cold cereal
  * 1 tortilla or slice of bread
  * ½ bagel or English muffin
  * 3 cups popcorn



**What to eat:** Barley, brown rice, buckwheat, millet, oats, popcorn, quinoa, rye, teff, whole-wheat pasta, wild rice

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Studies show:

  * From the Nurses’ Health Study, the highest quintile of whole grain intake showed a reduced total mortality and reduced cardiovascular mortality.
  * Whole grains reduce the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and stroke.
  * Whole grains reduce inflammation across a panel of markers (e.g. CRP, interleukins, TNF-alpha).



Eat whole grains according to the Five-to-One rule:

  * The ratio of grams of carbohydrates to dietary fiber should be 5 or less.
  * When grains are processed into flour, they are digested more rapidly, and glycemic index increases.



#### Specific Choices

**Gluten**

  * Outside of celiac disease, is gluten sensitivity real? Two randomized controlled trials show most people who claim to feel better on a gluten-free diet feel worse on a no-gluten placebo. Exposure to gluten can induce feelings of depression. So it appears gluten sensitivity isn’t just in people’s imagination.
  * But some people showed wheat sensitivity, which is correlated to sensitivity to other foods like eggs and milk. If you remove eggs and milk from the diet and challenge with gluten, there’s no effect. So **going on a healthier diet may be the reason gluten-free diets work**.
  * About 2% of the population may have celiac disease or wheat allergies. For the other 98%, there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet has benefits, and it may actually negatively affect gut flora.



**Pigmented grains**

  * Pigmented rice (red, purple) may have antioxidant benefits over brown rice.



**Oats**

  * Contain avenanthramides, which are anti-inflammatory compounds.
  * They suppress inflammation for skin rashes.



### Beverages

#### Daily Recommendations

5 servings per day

Serving sizes

  * One glass



What to drink : Black tea, chai tea, chamomile tea, coffee, earl grey tea, green tea, hibiscus tea, hot chocolate, jasmine tea, lemon balm tea, matcha tea, oolong tea, peppermint tea, rooibos tea, water, white tea

#### Nutrients and Benefits

The common “8 glasses a day” recommendation seems to originate from a 1921 paper measuring urine and sweat output.

The new recommendation is 10-15 cups of water a day for men, and 8-11 for women, including liquid from foods. Net of food, this translates to 6-11 cups for men and 4-7 for women.

Studies show:

  * Low liquid intake is associated with heart disease, kidney disease, urinary tract infections, and other diseases. But it’s unclear whether low fluid drinking is to blame—it’s associated with other unhealthy behaviors like lack of exercise and poor diet.
  * Each extra daily cup of fluid reduced risk of bladder cancer by 7%.
  * The Adventist Health Study showed that people drinking >5 glasses of water a day showed half the risk of heart disease, compared to <2 glasses.
  * Dehydration causes lower cognitive function and depressed mood.
  * 2/3 of children might be in a state of mild dehydration!



#### Specific Choices

**Coffee**

  * Overall, each additional cup of coffee drunk per day showed a 3% lower risk of premature death.
  * The NIH-AARP study showed >6 cups of coffee per day caused a 10-15% lower mortality rate for people over the age of 55. Below the age of 55, coffee _increased_ the risk of death.
  * Coffee shows benefits for liver disease, mood, and Parkinson’s Disease.
  * It improves energy, alertness, and cognitive performance.
  * Drawbacks to coffee:
    * Coffee induces acid reflux. Decaf has less of this effect.
    * Coffee may increase cholesterol when it’s not prepared using a paper filter. This might be caused by the fat-soluble compound cafestol.



**Tea**

  * Tea reduces risk of cancer, diabetes, and tooth loss. It also lowers cholesterol, blood pressure, body fat, and allergic symptoms.
  * Mentally, it promotes alpha brainwaves (which is associated with a mindset that is alert, focused, and calm).
  * White tea has more antioxidants than green tea if you add lemon, as some phytonutrients are activated at a lower pH.
  * Cold-steeping tea (2 hours in the fridge) reduces caffeine content and may improve antioxidant activity (by around 20%).
  * Topical green tea can clear genital warts.
  * Drawbacks to tea:
    * Green-tea extract pills have caused liver toxicity.
    * Overdose of tea causes fluorosis problems.
    * The safe limit of tea is 20 bags of black tea, 30 of green tea, or 80 of white tea per day.



**Sweeteners**

  * Greger approves blackstrap molasses and date sugar as green-light foods used for sweetening.
  * The low -calorie sweetener erythritol is absorbed by the gut, so it doesn’t cause the laxative effect of sorbitol and xylitol. It also hasn’t been implicated in disorders like hypertension or headaches like other low-calorie sweeteners
  * Artificial sweeteners may cause excess calorie consumption in a few ways:
    * Consciously knowing that you’re consuming fewer calories makes you compensate by eating more.
    * Subconsciously, the sweet sensation could trigger body to want to eat more. In the past, the sensation of sweetness meant you were around food like blueberry bushes.
    * It maintains your cravings for sweet things, instead of letting your taste buds adjust to more naturally-tasting foods.



**Hibiscus**

  * Hibiscus tea has the highest antioxidant content among beverages, at 6.99 units compared to 2.11 for jasmine tea and 1.21 for black tea.
  * 3 cups of hibiscus tea a day dropped blood pressure by 6 points over control.
  * Hibiscus tea is acidic, so rinse your mouth after drinking.
