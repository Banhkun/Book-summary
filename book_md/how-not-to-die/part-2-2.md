## Part 2-2: Beans, Berries, and Other Fruits

### Beans

#### Daily Recommendations

3 servings per day

**Serving sizes**

  * ¼ cup of hummus or bean dip
  * ½ cup cooked beans, tofu, tempeh
  * 1 cup of fresh peas, sprouted lentils



**What to eat:** Black beans, black-eyed peas, butter beans, cannellini/garbanzo beans, chickpeas, edamame, kidney beans, lentils (beluga, French, red), miso, navy beans, peas, pinto beans, small red beans, tempeh

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Nutrients: protein, iron, zinc, fiber, folate, potassium

  * Canned beans are as nutritious as boiled beans, except for the salt they contain.



Studies show:

  * Beans drop LDL and total cholesterol.
  * Every 20g increase in daily legume intake reduces premature death by 8%.



#### Specific Choices

**Soy**

  * Half of nutrients are lost when soybeans are converted into tofu or soy milk.
    * For tofu, choose ones made with calcium.
  * Tempeh or miso are whole soy foods that are preferable to tofu and soy milk.
    * Don’t boil miso since it has probiotics.
    * Despite its salt, miso may have protective effects that cancel out the increased risk of stomach cancer and hypertension.



**Lentils**

  * There is a healthy “lentil effect”—when eaten, lentils blunt the sugar spike of foods eaten hours later. Compounds in lentils seem to relax the stomach and slow the rate of sugar absorption.
  * When lentils are sprouted, the level of antioxidants doubles.



**Black beans**

  * Have more phenolic phytonutrients than other legumes.



### Berries

#### Daily Recommendations

1 serving per day

**Serving sizes**

  * ½ cup fresh or frozen
  * ¼ cup dried



**What to eat:** Acai berries, barberries, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, concord grapes, cranberries, goji berries, kumquats, mulberries, raspberries, strawberries

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Nutrients: 10x more antioxidants than other fruits and vegetables by density

  * Compared to fresh berries, frozen berries are roughly the same in nutrition or about 20% less nutritious in antioxidant activity, but tend to last longer and are cheaper.
  * However, berry jams lose the majority of nutrients.



Studies show:

  * Protection against cancer
  * Immune system boost
    * 1.5 cups/day of blueberries for 6 weeks doubled natural killer counts in athletes after intense exercise, when normally it drops by half
  * Protection for the brain
    * Women who ate one serving of blueberries and two servings of strawberries a week had slower rates of cognitive decline, by as much as 2.5 years.
  * Fructose in fruit is less harmful than added fructose
    * Fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients in berries may cancel out the harmful effects of fructose, such as by lowering the rate of absorption.
    * A small trial found that feeding a diet that included 20 servings of fruit per day had no effect on weight, blood pressure, or triglycerides, but lowered LDL by 38 points.
  * Flavonoid intake is associated with lower risk of fatal cardiovascular disease.
  * Moderate your intake of berries and anti-inflammatory drugs during 3rd trimester of pregnancy, since berries contain anti-inflammatory polyphenols



#### Specific Choices

**Blackberries**

  * Contain the highest antioxidant density at 650 units, vs. blueberries at 380, raspberries at 350, strawberries at 310, mangoes at 110, and apples at 60.



**Cherries**

  * Can reduce inflammation. Useful for gout.



**Goji Berries**

  * Highest concentration of melatonin. 3rd highest antioxidant capacity of common dried fruit.
  * Zeaxanthin content helps protect against macular degeneration.



**Black Currants**

  * Improves computer eye strain—may be due to anthocyanins.



### Other Fruits

#### Daily Recommendations

3 servings per day

**Serving sizes**

  * 1 medium-sized fruit
  * 1 cup cut-up fruit
  * ¼ cup dried fruit



**What to eat:** Apples, dried apricots, avocados, bananas, cantaloupe, clementines, dates, dried figs, grapefruit, honeydew, kiwi, lemons, limes, lychees, mangoes, nectarines, oranges, papaya, passion fruit, peaches, pears, pineapple, plums, pomegranates, prunes, tangerines, watermelon

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Studies show:

  * A diet low in fruits is found to be the second leading dietary factor for global disease burden in DALYs
  * Fruit is associated with lower cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.



Are fruits and nuts fattening?

  * In an experiment, one group was told to eat two fruit-and-nut bars daily. Despite the extra 340 calories from the bars, they didn’t gain weight after two months.
  * Fruits and nuts are satiating. They offset calories elsewhere, while delivering better nutrients than common processed foods.



#### Specific Choices

**Watermelon**

  * Seeds have respectable antioxidant levels.
  * Citrulline is useful for erectile dysfunction.



**Apples**

  * In a study, eating a dozen dried apple rings a day dropped LDL 16% in 3 months.



**Grapefruit**

  * Be careful with grapefruit when you’re on medication—grapefruit can suppress liver enzymes that metabolize drugs.



**Avoid olives**

  * This is an anti-recommendation: avoid eating high-sodium olives.
  * Olive oil has most of the olive’s nutrition removed, so try cooking without oil.
