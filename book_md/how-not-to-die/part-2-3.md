## Part 2-3: Green, Leafy, and Other Vegetables

### Cruciferous Vegetables

#### Daily Recommendations

1 serving per day

**Serving sizes**

  * ½ cup chopped
  * ¼ cup Brussels or broccoli sprouts
  * 1 tablespoon horseradish



**What to eat:** Arugula, bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, horseradish, kale, mustard greens, radishes, turnip greens, watercress

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Nutrients: **sulforaphane** is thought to be the main beneficial component.

  * Protects against DNA mutations and ability to form tumors
  * Protects brain, eyesight, immunity
  * May help with autism



Sulforaphane requires the enzyme myrosinase to be produced.

  * Raw cruciferous vegetables suppress cancer cell growth _in vitro_ , but not cooked vegetables.
  * Michael Greger suggests a “hack and hold” technique—chop, then wait forty minutes while sulforaphane is produced.
  * Frozen cruciferous vegetables lose much of the antiproliferative anti-cancer effect, because tyrosinase is destroyed before packaging. Powdered mustard seeds have tyrosinase and increase sulforaphane production.



Supplementing sulforaphane seems ineffective.

  * Bioavailability is 8x better when eating broccoli sprouts vs. supplements that contain the same amount of precursor chemical.



Too much sulforaphane could cause DNA damage.

  * How much is too much? Over 4 cups of broccoli sprouts.



#### Specific Choices

**Red cabbage**

  * More antioxidants per dollar than other foods



**Broccoli sprouts**

  * When grown yourself, these are a very cheap source of sulforaphane.



### Greens

#### Daily Recommendations

2 servings per day

**Serving sizes**

  * 1 cup raw
  * ½ cup cooked



**What to eat:** Arugula, beet greens, collard greens, kale, mesclun mix, mustard greens, sorrel, spinach, swiss chard, turnip greens

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Nutrients:

  * Chlorophyll blocks carcinogen activity, possibly by regenerating coenzyme Q10
  * Warning: Greens contain vitamin K. If taking warfarin or blood-thinners, can nullify the drug



Studies show:

  * Greens decrease cancer risk
  * An increase of 1 serving a day is associated with 4% lower risk for coronary heart disease.
    * Vitamin C-rich foods contributed most to the effect.
  * People who were in the highest quintile in fruit and vegetable intake showed a much lower relative risk (0.69) for ischemic stroke, compared to those in the lowest quintile.



**Eat greens with fat to better absorb nutrients.**

  * Fat-soluble compounds like beta-carotene, lutein, vitamin K, zeaxanthin are better absorbed when paired with fat.



**Method of preparation—fresh is better.**

  * Fresh kale showed much better antiproliferative effects than frozen and heated-in-bag kale (in some assays, cooked kale showed no antiproliferation while fresh did).
  * Boiling broccoli removes 50% of glucosinolates. Steaming broccoli doesn’t change the nutrient levels significantly.



#### Specific Choices

**Kale**

  * Green kale is best, as it showed greater antiproliferative anti-cancer effects in vitro.



**Vinegar**

  * (Shortform note: this isn’t a green, but it was included in the chapter.)
  * In type 2 diabetics, 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar at bedtime reduced fasting sugar by 6%, compared to 0.7% in control.
  * Acetic acid may lead to improved nitric oxide production.



**Avoid alfalfa sprouts**

  * _Salmonella_ outbreaks seem most common in alfalfa sprouts.



### Other Vegetables

#### Daily Recommendations

2 servings per day

**Serving sizes**

  * 1 cup raw leafy vegetables
  * ½ cup raw or cooked non-leafy vegetables
  * ½ cup vegetable juice
  * ¼ cup dried mushrooms



**What to eat:** Artichokes, asparagus, beets, bell peppers, carrots, corn, garlic, mushrooms (button, oyster, Portobello, shiitake), okra, onions, peas, purple potatoes, pumpkin, seaweed, squash, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, zucchini

#### Nutrients and Benefits

Studies show:

  * Improved attractiveness.
    * Carotenoids from yellow/red vegetables deposit in skin and make rating of your face more attractive.
    * Intake of green/yellow vegetables is associated with decreased facial wrinkling in Japanese women (controlling for age, smoking, BMI, and sun exposure).



**Diversify your vegetables.**

  * Different vegetables have different phytonutrients and different benefits to the body.
    * Cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts lower the risk of colon cancer on the middle and right side of the body.
    * Carrots, pumpkins, and apples lower risk on the left side.
    * _In vitro_ , radishes do nothing to stop pancreatic cell growth, but do stop stomach cancer.
  * Population studies might underestimate the effect of plant foods because people tend to concentrate on eating a small selection of typical fruits—apples, bananas, and grapes.
  * In studies, _variety_ of intake was a better predictor of decreased inflammation than absolute _quantity_.



**Promote vegetable eating with better names.**

  * Restaurants can call vegetable dishes exotic names, like “traditional Cajun red beans and rice” rather than “red beans with rice.”
  * For kids, calling broccoli “Tiny Tasty Tree Tops” doubles vegetable eating.



**Cooking methods: raw is best.**

  * Raw vegetables generally have the most nutrients available.
  * But cooking can compensate if it makes you eat more vegetables.
  * How much cooking destroys nutrients varies with the vegetable.
    * Steaming destroys 10% of vitamin C in broccoli.
    * Boiling and pressure-cooking reduces antioxidant capacity by 20-50% depending on the vegetable.
    * Microwaving reduces nutrients on average by 5%, but some vegetables show a 50% decrease, and some actually increase activity (carrot, celery, and green beans).
    * Artichokes, beets, and onions aren’t affected by cooking method.
    * Cooking can sometimes help: cooking carrots increases vitamin A, and cooking tomatoes increases lycopene.
  * If you’re afraid of germs, wash vegetables with a 5% acetic acid (vinegar) solution or 10% saltwater to clean the vegetables.



**Is organic food better?**

  * Organic fruits and vegetables do not produce higher serum levels of vitamins or nutrients compared to conventional fruits and vegetables.
  * Pesticide contamination risk was 30% lower in organic foods, but still under allowed limits.
  * In any case, people tend to far overestimate the risks of pesticides, equating pesticide risk to motor vehicle driving. In truth, they have far less of a consequence than most people think, and it’s far better to eat vegetables than to avoid them for fear of pesticide exposure.
  * (Shortform note: the Environmental Working Group publishes the dirty dozen and clean 15 lists for pesticide exposure. The worst foods, most likely to be exposed to pesticides, are strawberries, spinach, kale, apples, and grapes. The best foods, least likely to be exposed, are avocados, corn, pineapples, peas, and onions.)



#### Specific Choices

**Tomato**

  * The yellow fluid surrounding seeds has anti-platelet compounds.
  * Choose whole, crushed, or diced tomato products instead of tomato sauce or puree.



**Mushrooms**

  * Ergothioneine is an antioxidant that works in the mitochondria.
  * Our cells have a specific ergothioneine transporter; humans don’t synthesize it.
  * Oyster mushrooms have 1000 units of ergothioneine, 9x more than black beans.
  * It’s best to cook mushrooms because of the agaritine toxin.
  * Morel mushrooms have higher levels of toxins; Dr. Greger recommends not eating morels.



**Sweet potatoes**

  * Phenolics and antioxidants are at highest levels when raw. Boiling decreases nutrients by ~10%, roasting by 20-30%



**Spinach**

  * Spinach shows the top _in vitro_ antiproliferative action against breast, brain, kidney, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and stomach cancer.



**Other antiproliferative vegetables**

  * Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale
  * Garlic, green onions, leek
