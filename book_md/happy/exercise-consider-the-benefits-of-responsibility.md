## Exercise: Consider the Benefits of Responsibility

We often talk about “responsibility” in terms of it being a burden or a duty. However, Brown suggests that the key to happiness is accepting full responsibility for our thoughts, emotions, and actions. Think about whether or not that might be true.

* * *

Briefly describe an instance in which you took responsibility for a positive outcome, such as a personal achievement or a team success. How did accepting responsibility make you feel? How would you have felt if you weren’t able to claim responsibility?

Now describe an incident in which you had to admit to a mistake. How did accepting _that_ responsibility make you feel? If you had managed to avoid admitting that mistake, would you have felt better or worse in the long run?

Compare how accepting responsibility made you feel in both scenarios. In the final sum, do you think that accepting responsibility _in both cases_ made you more or less happy than if you’d avoided responsibility in both cases?
