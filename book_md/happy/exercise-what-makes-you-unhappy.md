## Exercise: What Makes You Unhappy?

Brown and the Stoics insist that it’s not other people or unpleasant events that stop us from being happy, but rather how we interpret them. And yet often, it feels that anger and hurt are a natural, automatic response to the things that happen in our lives. Consider whether it’s helpful to accept responsibility for that response.

* * *

Describe an event or circumstance beyond your control that has made you unhappy. What specific emotions did it bring up?

What did you tell yourself about that event or circumstance immediately after it occurred? Did that story help to _compound_ or _reduce_ the unpleasant emotions you felt?

If you now feel some emotional distance from that triggering event, can you think of a more charitable way to reframe it? If so, how?
