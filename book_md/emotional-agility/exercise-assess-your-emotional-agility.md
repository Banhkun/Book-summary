## Exercise: Assess Your Emotional Agility

Consider a recent event to which you reacted poorly in a way you later regretted. This exercise will help you reflect on the event—and determine a better course of action in the future—using the principles of emotional agility.

* * *

What was the situation and how did you feel in the moment? Be specific in labeling your emotions. (For example, you made plans to meet up with a friend for coffee, and she brought her friend without asking you. You were annoyed, so you didn’t talk much and left early. Upon reflection, your emotions were more accurately those of _hurt_ and _anxiety_.)

Try to view the situation objectively. What narrative or explanation lay behind your emotion? Can you identify another, more objective explanation? (You told yourself that your company isn’t enough for your friend—she felt that she needed someone else there to have a good time. However, she may have brought her friend because you have a lot in common and she thought you’d hit it off.)

How did your response align—or not align—with your values? (Your actions of shutting down and leaving early didn’t align with your values of _connection_ and _assuming generous intent_.)

How could you react to a similar situation in the future in a way that aligns with your values? (In the future, you’ll assume that your friend is bringing others along for _your_ benefit, and you’ll be sure to let her know ahead of time if you prefer a coffee date just between the two of you.)
