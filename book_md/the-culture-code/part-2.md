## Part 2: Vulnerability | Chapters 7-11: What Is Vulnerability and Why Does It Matter?

Once a team feels like a connected unit, team members must feel comfortable showing vulnerability. **Vulnerability is the cornerstone of teamwork in the workplace.** In this section, we’ll discuss **the key attributes of vulnerability, why it's good for workplace culture, and problems that arise when it's missing.**

### The Key Attributes of Vulnerability

**Vulnerability is the exposure of personal weakness followed by a call for help or support.** This develops a collective sense of trust: _We can show the areas where we struggle and help strengthen each other_.

**Vulnerability requires humility**.**** All team members (but leaders in particular) must be willing to admit when they’ve made mistakes. It sends a message: _I am not perfect, and I know that your feedback can help me_.

#### The Three Tools of Vulnerability

##### Tool #1: Using Notifications

**Notifications are quick bursts of communication in which information is shared.** They are observations, not commands, and provide context through which the team may operate more efficiently. They remove the “fluff” from a conversation and focus solely on the task at hand. When exchanging notifications, team members address issues and explain actions. For example, a pilot in a “mayday situation” may call out “we don’t have brakes” or “I’m turning the plane now.”

> **United Airlines Flight 232**
> 
> On July 10, 1989, United Airlines Flight 232 experienced what the National Transportation Safety Board describes as a catastrophic failure. They lost control of the plane after an engine exploded and cut through both the main and backup hydraulic control lines.
> 
> Though flying blind, the pilot, co-pilot and an emergency flight simulation expert managed to get the plane to the ground. When simulations were run after the incident, every test crew failed under the same circumstances.
> 
> How did the crew aboard Flight 232 manage to overcome unbeatable odds? The team communicated via notifications at triple the rate of the average airline crew as they revealed issues, explained actions and responded to questions. Because of the increased communication, the pilots managed to save the lives of 185 people.

##### Tool #2: The Vulnerability Loop

**The Vulnerability Loop is the exchange of vulnerability between two or more parties.** This requires the introduction of vulnerability by one party and typically follows the following steps:

  * Person 1 expresses vulnerability
  * Person 2 recognizes Person 1’s expression
  * Person 2 responds by expressing their own vulnerability
  * Person 1 recognizes Person 2’s vulnerability
  * A new precedent is set, and the trust between both parties becomes stronger



When this process is repeated throughout an entire organization, groups can build a support system through which they collaborate and problem-solve.

> **The Give Some Game**
> 
> The game:
> 
>   * Participants are given four tokens, then meet a stranger who is also given four tokens.
> 
>   * Each token is worth one dollar if the participant keeps it, but two dollars if the participant shares it.
> 
>   * The question for the participant is: _How many tokens should you give away?_
> 
> 

> 
> On average, people give away 2.5 tokens, leaning towards cooperation without going to extremes. However, when researchers added the vulnerability loop to this game, tendencies changed.
> 
> Participants in one study were asked to perform a lengthy activity on a computer that had been set to crash just as they were about to finish. After the computer crashed, another participant (who was actually secretly one of the researchers running the project) would graciously spend time “repairing” the computer. They would succeed after a bit of time, saving the participant from having to restart the task.
> 
> After this experience, the participants were asked to play the Give-Some game. The participants who had been helped were significantly more generous—not only with the individual who supported them but with total strangers. The show of vulnerability and the support that followed created a bond of trust that permeated throughout every interaction in the game.

##### Tool #3: Active Listening

**Active listening forces the listener to put their ego aside and create an environment in which vulnerability can be expressed.** While they may speak up occasionally to ask a clarifying question or offer guidance, good listeners keep their focus on the other person. In contrast, constantly thinking of what you’re going to say next prevents you from taking in and processing the words of the other person.

> **Concordances**
> 
> Dr. Carl Marci developed a method through which he could scientifically track the connection between people via galvanic skin response (an indicator of emotional response determined by a change in electrical resistance in the skin). In his experiments, Marci noticed moments in which the responses in the skin of both the speaker and the listener would sync up. He called these moments concordances. Concordances typically occurred when one of the individuals involved in the conversation stopped speaking and put all of their energy into listening to the other party.
> 
> In a specific example, Marci recorded a session between himself and his therapist in which he spoke about his experience proposing to his then-girlfriend. While Marci spoke, his therapist only responded in affirmative nods, smiles, and noises. Despite his lack of speech, the data showed that the session contained several moments of concordance. Instead of speaking, his therapist listened. Rather than interrupt or intervene, he tried to process and understand Marci’s point of view. Through active listening, Marci’s therapist connected to Marci without saying a word.

### The Benefits of Vulnerability

#### Benefit #1: The Development of Trust and the Removal of Insecurity

Once team members are willing to express a need for assistance, **they develop trust and are able to address issues head-on without the obstacles of self-doubt or competition.**

##### The Red Balloons

In 2009, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) created a challenge to explore the best ways to prepare for potential future attacks. They released 10 red balloons in secret locations throughout the United States and offered $40,000 to the first team that could locate all of them.

Across the country, various teams began preparing, creating new search engine software, constructing teams of software engineers and hackers, and tapping into existing information networks. One team from MIT, however, did none of the above, had next to no funding, and only began preparing mere days before the challenge launched, yet managed to win the challenge within 9 hours.

How did an underfunded, underprepared team win a near impossible challenge in mere hours? The team at MIT created a website that invited people to join their team with the promise of $2,000 to the person who found each balloon, $1,000 to the person who invited that person, $500 to the person who invited the person who invited that person, and so on. When all was said and done, 4,665 people aided in MIT’s effort to find the balloons.

The team succeeded through the promotion of the vulnerability loop. By granting payouts to the people who made the invites as well as the individual who made the discovery, they created a vulnerability loop driven by financial incentives. It promoted asking for help as a prize was available even if you did not make the actual discovery.

On other teams, financial incentives were only given to people who made the actual discovery. This led to selfish behavior as inviting friends to help with the process could cost participants a payout.

#### Benefit #2: Quick and Cooperative Decision-Making

Vulnerability develops trust. **With trust, team members can act quickly and cooperatively, even in high-pressure situations.** The group is able to move as if part of a well-oiled machine, with each cog of the machine fulfilling its purpose and relying on the other cogs to fulfill theirs.

##### Log PT

In training, the Navy SEALs go through a series of exercises known as Log Physical Training (Log PT). In Log PT, a team of six trainees gets pushed to their limits through a variety of exercises in which they carry an unwieldy telephone pole.

Success in these exercises relies on coordination and cooperation. When Log PT succeeds, the movement between exercises seems simple and fluid. When one teammate struggles, the team takes on additional weight to support them until they regain balance. Each trainee relies on their teammates to support them in their times of weakness and vice versa.

Log PT forces trainees to make choices for the betterment of the group instead of personal advancements. This lesson applies to battlefield demeanor as SEALs must be able to work as a singular unit and support one another in life-or-death situations.

#### Benefit #3: Collective Problem-Solving

Vulnerability often reveals problem areas, and **open feedback produces a variety of potential solutions through collective insight.** Feedback via committee curates opinions from team members with different backgrounds, expertise, and experience that allow the group to determine the best route forward.

**Inspirational team members can help individual projects flourish through surfacing._Surfacing_** is the process of bringing tensions and solutions to the surface through a series of questions and conversations. Through surfacing, team members can begin to look at the problem in different ways and spot different directions for their projects.

> **BrainTrusts: Feedback via Committee**
> 
> At Pixar, the director of a project receives feedback through a series of meetings called BrainTrust meetings. In these meetings, producers and other directors pick apart the film in detail. Through an analysis of the film’s flaws, the team begins to determine the best ways in which the film can improve.
> 
> BrainTrust meetings require extreme levels of trust and vulnerability. Directors must be comfortable exposing a project they are passionate about to intense scrutiny. Though the process is often frustrating and painful, the resulting product improves drastically.

> **Givechi: Surfacing**
> 
> Roshi Givechi works for IDEO, one of the most successful design companies in the world. Givechi moves between teams, asking the challenging questions and pushing team members to think beyond their current frame of mind.
> 
> Givechi (who coined the term “surfacing”) is never confrontational. Rather, she sparks conversation through questions such as:
> 
>   * What excites you about this project?
> 
>   * What are you not looking forward to?
> 
>   * What is one thing you’d like to get better at?
> 
>   * What is the primary purpose of this project?
> 
>   * What barriers are you currently experiencing?
> 
> 

> 
> While some of her questions may seem simplistic or obvious, they allow for team members to unearth issues or potential solutions they may not have recognized before.

#### Benefit #4: Preparation for Future Issues

Vulnerability does not only apply to immediate issues or projects. Through a willingness to have plans picked apart, **team members can make future obstacles easier to overcome by planning for problems before they occur.**

##### SEAL Team Six

In its 2011 operation to kill Osama Bin Laden, SEAL Team Six rehearsed multiple downed helicopter scenarios in preparation for their raid. The officer in charge of the mission showed vulnerability by admitting there were potential issues with the initial plan—particularly surrounding the use of untested stealth helicopters.

This was ultimately the saving grace of the mission. When invading the compound, one of the helicopters crashed, but the soldiers managed to adapt and succeed. Thanks to the vulnerability exhibited by the officer in charge before the mission, the soldiers were prepared.

### The Consequences of a Lack of Vulnerability

**Human nature pushes us to hide our flaws.** When team members hide flaws, they put all of their energy into that concealment, leading to insecurity and defensiveness.

| When Vulnerability Is Present  | When Vulnerability Is Absent   
---|---|---  
Communication  | Team members work openly and cooperatively, freely exchanging ideas and concepts.  | Team members work in isolation, keeping their ideas to themselves.   
Feedback  | Team members are willing to accept and invite feedback, thus improving their output.  | Team members grow defensive when receiving feedback, thus leading to errors in their output.   
Cohesiveness  | Team members support one another, embracing responsibility when at fault and helping coworkers when they falter.  | Team members blame one another for issues, unwilling to admit personal fault or support others in their hardship.   
  
#### Consequence #1: Insecurity Takes Over

**When team members fear vulnerability, they allow their insecurity to dictate their behavior.** A culture that prohibits vulnerability tends to punish people for showing weakness. As a result, team members get insecure about their performance and become defensive. They reject feedback and fail to see errors in their own logic, robbing the group of the opportunity to fix issues.

##### The Ambush

After completing an arduous journey, Dave Cooper, a former Navy SEAL, received an order from his superior that required their team to travel back to base in the middle of the night. Cooper objected as nightfall would exacerbate the dangers of potential ambush points and mine-laden stretches of the route. After a screaming match between the officer and Cooper, the officer eventually used his rank to end the conversation, rejecting Cooper’s feedback in the process.

On their way back to base, the vehicle was ambushed. Overwhelmed and left with no other choice, the team had to surrender—fully expecting to be killed by their attackers. Much to the surprise of the team, the attackers decided not to execute the American soldiers, but took their weapons and disappeared into the night.

The mission almost resulted in the deaths of four soldiers because the commanding officer allowed his insecurity to dictate his behavior. He became defensive and treated feedback as an attack on his competence as a commander. Had he been comfortable with vulnerability, he would have accepted feedback and planned for potential issues, and they may have avoided the incident.

#### Consequence #2: People Don’t Notice Issues

**When vulnerability is punished, team members do not seek out feedback.** Without the use of feedback, the team robs themselves of the opportunity to fix issues that they had not noticed before.

##### The Ad Proposal

Kyle is on the brink of a promotion and has an idea for a new ad campaign. He has spent weeks developing materials and believes that this package will be the final key to the promotion he’s been after for quite some time. He wants to get some feedback on his work before he takes the proposal before the executive team, but the advertising team hasn’t developed a work environment in which vulnerability is permitted. In fact, the last time Kyle asked for help, he was berated by his boss and told that he should know how to do his job by now.

With this in mind, Kyle decides to take his proposal straight to the executives of the company. The CEO of the company opens to the first page and immediately notes that there’s a clear misspelling on the proposed marketing material. He then states that, if the advertising team won’t even take the time to review their own work, he won’t take the time to read through it. This slip-up ultimately costs Kyle the promotion and hurts his relationship with the executive team. Had Kyle’s team been more accepting of vulnerability, he may have asked for feedback that likely would have revealed something as simple as a spelling error.
