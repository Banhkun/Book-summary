## Exercise: What Is Your Groupâ€™s Purpose?

Purpose sparks motivation. Without it, people quickly become disinterested in their work, leading to a decrease in quality and efficiency.

* * *

Reflect on a recent experience in which a co-worker or employee seemed unmotivated at work. What do you think led to this feeling? How did that lack of motivation impact their work?

What are some ways in which you could have used purpose to help drive them in their work? List them. Think specifically about the ways in which central purpose impacts the actions of team members and the importance of individual purpose within a group dynamic.
