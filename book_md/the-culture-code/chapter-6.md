## Chapter 6: How Can You Develop Safety?

Now that you understand the key attributes of safety and the importance of its development, **let’s discuss ways you can implement safety in your workplace.**

### Communication and Interaction

#### Belonging Cues

**Deliver a constant stream of belonging cues.** Trust is difficult to develop and requires persistence. On their own, individual belonging cues do not make much of a difference. Giving constant reminders of belonging allows team members to gradually feel more comfortable and safe. Here are a few methods to develop each aspect of belonging cues:

  * **Connection: Give your full energy and attention to the immediate conversation.** Show that you understand you are talking to a unique person, not a robot.
  * **Future: Assure the individual that they have a future with you and/or the organization**. This puts their anxieties about the future at rest while giving them a goal to strive for.
  * **Security: Exaggerate your appreciation.** This calms insecurity by reassuring team members that they are doing strong work. Receiving appreciation for a task or project makes people more willing to complete a similar task or project in the future.



#### Feedback

**Use belonging cues in your feedback.** Belonging cues remind people that your feedback is meant to be constructive and helpful. When team members know they are appreciated and cared for, they are much more receptive to critique.

**Use “Magical Feedback”** When giving feedback, ensure that team members know the following:

  * They are valuable.
  * They are part of a special group with high expectations.
  * They have the capacity to match and exceed those expectations.



An Ivy League study shows that the use of this “magical feedback” drastically improves response and performance.

**Avoid “Sandwich Feedback.”** “Sandwich Feedback” is the process of delivering feedback in a “positive-negative-positive” format (start with a positive comment, give an area of improvement, and end with another positive comment). This style of feedback can be confusing and doesn’t communicate the information clearly. Give positive and negative feedback separately:

  * Handle negative feedback through dialogue. Discuss areas of improvement, focusing on how to improve, not necessarily on the failure itself. 
  * Deliver positive feedback using energetic praise and authenticity. Genuine enthusiasm motivates and inspires hard-working employees.



> **The Spurs**
> 
> Gregg Popovich (head coach of the San Antonio Spurs) is known to have a temper, often going off on his star players. However, he is also statistically one of the most successful coaches in the history of the NBA. How does someone express so much anger, yet still yield results? Even through his frustration, Popovich uses belonging cues within his feedback:
> 
>   * Connection: He shows his team members that they are special to him by connecting to them as human beings. He physically engages with them and takes an interest in their lives.
> 
>   * Future: When discussing performance, he insists that the team is special and requires high expectations. He doesn’t accept anything less than that expectation.
> 
>   * Security: He assures players that he has faith that they can match expectations. He then reminds them that there are things more important than basketball. By putting things into perspective, he takes pressure off of his players.

#### Listening and Defusal

**Magnify your listening cues.** Even small interjections such as “uh-huh” or “yes” make a difference. This encourages and energizes employees as they communicate their ideas and concepts. With this in mind, do not mistake interruption for engagement. Interrupting someone while they are attempting to communicate destroys any sense of connection that had been developed throughout the conversation.

**Defuse negative behaviors and remove antagonistic employees.** Negativity disrupts productive workflow. Methods of defusal include:

  * Maintaining positivity when approached with negativity
  * Using humor when tension infects the team
  * Asking questions to stimulate group participation
    * “How would you approach this issue?”
    * “What do you think of this idea?”
    * “Where are the problem areas and how can we solve them?”



### The Hiring Process and “Threshold Moments”

**Be methodical and specific when hiring**. Take the time to determine work ethic, ability to perform, and chemistry. This will save you a lot of energy down the line as you can more accurately determine proficiency and fit before an employee becomes a part of the company culture:

  * Use tests and projects during on-boarding to determine their quality of work.
  * Engage with potential employees through extensive interviews to determine personality and demeanor.
  * Create group projects to observe how potential employees interact with one another. 



**Use belonging cues in your hiring and onboarding process.** The sooner employees feel connected to the group, the sooner they can become a productive member of your company’s culture. Start this process as soon as you meet potential employees:

  * Connection: Show interest in both their excitement and anxiety. Starting a new job is challenging, and your empathy will show them that you care about their current emotional state.
  * Indication of Future: Explicitly show employees their trajectory and the potential upward mobility within your ranks.
  * Security: Express that you are investing in them just as much as they are investing in you. Explain that you foster an open and transparent work environment in which their opinion will be valued, and that feedback and discussion are encouraged.



**Take advantage of “threshold moments,” which are first impressions** , either the first day that someone joins or the first moment you meet each day. Use belonging cues in threshold moments.

> **The Call Center That Cared**
> 
> In Bangalore, India, a call-center called WIPRO (pronounced WHIP-row) was having issues with turn-over. At the end of each year, 50-70% of employees were leaving the company. They tried introducing financial incentives and employee benefits, but nothing seemed to work.
> 
> WIPRO leadership decided to bring on a research team to try to help them solve the problem. The research team developed an experiment. During onboarding, they split new employees into three groups:
> 
>   * Group One was given an additional hour after the training process in which leadership talked about WIPRO’s successes. At the end of the session, each new hire was given a sweatshirt with the company’s name on it.
> 
>   * Group Two was given an additional hour after the training process in which leadership asked employees about their own personal experiences, skills, and goals. At the end of the session, each new hire was given a sweatshirt with both their name and the company’s name on it.
> 
>   * Group Three (the control group) did not receive anything beyond the training process.
> 
> 

> 
> A year after the experiment was completed, the data showed that members of Group Two were significantly more likely to stay on-board compared to Group One or Group Three. By making a personal connection with the new hires, WIPRO saw a drastic rise in retention as employees were more inclined to stay on board with a company that took the time to connect with them.

### Leadership

#### **Promote a** V**ocal** W**orkforce**

**Promote honesty and directness, especially surrounding feedback and “bad news.”** When you receive news from someone, be sure to thank them. If people don’t feel safe delivering bad news, you often won’t get the information—even if it’s essential.

**Seek out connection and create environments in which people can have a voice.** Until given a platform or permission, many team members will not feel comfortable speaking up out of fear or insecurity. Ways to ensure team members are voicing their opinions or concerns include:

  * Establishing a rule that no meeting can end without everyone contributing something.
  * Holding review sessions in which team members can offer feedback.
  * Holding regular forums where anyone can bring an issue to the table.



#### Interaction and Community

**Create an environment that promotes interaction through “collision-rich” workspaces.** “Collisions” are personal interactions between team members that promote connection through community. These interactions develop chemistry between team members and create an environment in which you and your team can use belonging cues to their fullest extent. To create a “collision-rich” workplace:

  * Keep employees’ workspaces in close proximity to one another.
  * Develop communal spaces for employees to interact.
  * Connect team members with one another.
  * Go out of your way to interact with your co-workers and employees.



**Serve the group, even in seemingly small ways**. Participating in small tasks sends a powerful message: _I am not above you; I am in this with you._ This message promotes connection between you and your team and develops mutual respect. Some ways you can begin to serve the group include:

  * Picking up trash
  * Cleaning a communal workspace
  * Ordering lunch for the team



**Let yourself (and your team) have fun.** This may sound trivial, but genuine enjoyment is essential to developing psychological safety. In fact, laughter is a key indicator of a safe and well-connected workplace. Take the time to create engaging and entertaining activities through which you and your team can simply have a good time and bond. These can be workplace activities (a group lunch once a week or a friendly contest) or external events (sporting events or team retreats).
