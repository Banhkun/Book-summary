## Introduction

**Why do certain organizations become greater than the sum of their parts while other groups fall short?**

This question has plagued the business world for centuries. Many companies have attempted to solve the problem by hiring experienced employees, enforcing strict performance standards, or taking direct control of projects. Unfortunately, none of these produce consistent results. While the skills of individual team members have obvious implications in the workplace, they are not indicators of success.

**The solution to this problem rests not in the intellect or experience of your team, but rather in their ability to work together as a unit.** Think of group culture like a machine. If all of the cogs are intricate but don’t operate with the other cogs, the machine won’t run. You’re left with an expensive, but useless piece of junk. On the other hand, if all of the cogs operate smoothly with one another, the machine runs efficiently, even if some of the cogs aren’t as developed as the others.

### Kindergarteners vs. Business School Students

Peter Skillman, a designer and engineer, developed a test to determine how synergy impacted success. He asked teams to build the tallest structure possible using uncooked spaghetti, tape, string, and a marshmallow. **Half of the teams consisted of MBA students. The other half consisted of kindergarteners.** The MBA students built structures that averaged about 10 inches. However, the kindergarteners built structures that averaged 26 inches. How did _kindergarteners_ outperform _MBA students_?

The MBA students got caught up in a process known as _status management_. Status management is when team members attempt to figure out who’s in charge, where they fit into the group, and how they are supposed to interact with their fellow team members. The MBA students spent so much time trying to figure all of this out that they failed to effectively solve the problem in time.

The kindergarteners, on the other hand, had no concerns about their place in the group. Instead, they immediately began experimenting, playing with different methods of construction, calling out issues as they saw them, and offering assistance to their team members without hesitation. Though their efforts seemed chaotic, they were actually working in a more efficient way than their business school counterparts. The kindergarteners may not have had the education, experience, or skills that the MBA students possessed, but their interactions were informed by a group culture that allowed them to work without fear.

**Teams that excel beyond the skill sets or education of their individual team members develop strong internal cultures that promote selfless behavior and experimental thinking.** The establishment of this culture depends upon the development of three foundational concepts: **safety (_you belong here_), vulnerability (_you can take risks_), and purpose (_you are here for a reason_).**

In this summary, we’ll discuss the _key attributes_ and _benefits_ of each of these concepts as well as the _consequences_ of their absence. Once you have an idea of what each of these entails, we’ll break down different ways you can _implement these ideas_ into your workplace.

(Shortform note: the original text develops the attributes, benefits, costs, and tips for each concept (safety, vulnerability, and purpose) over several chapters and anecdotes. For the sake of clarity, we’ve reorganized the content to highlight the core concepts of the text, with the anecdotes acting as support.)
