## Exercise: Develop Vulnerability in Your Workplace

Developing vulnerability and cooperation in the workplace takes time, practice, and a little bit of pain. Learn how to show vulnerability and promote cooperation in your workplace.

* * *

Vulnerability relies on interaction. Think about a recent workplace conversation in which you and/or a coworker got defensive. Describe it.

With this in mind, what could you have done differently to make the conversation more effective? Think about active listening, asking questions, and sporadic intervention.

Effective feedback relies on honesty and connection. Think about a recent time you delivered feedback, but it wasn’t received well. Describe it.

With this in mind, what are some ways you could have more effectively delivered your insight? Consider the need for candor, “magical feedback,” and the importance of delivering feedback in-person.
