## Exercise: Develop Safety in Your Workplace

Developing safety in the workplace takes time, effort, and planning. The sooner you implement core concepts of safety into your company culture, the sooner you will see a change in your organization.

* * *

What are some ways that you could develop opportunities for “collisions” in your organization? List them. Remember, “collisions” are personal interactions between team members that promote connection through community.

Small acts of service show that you are willing to chip in and support the group as a whole. What are some small ways you can serve the group? List them. Remember, these can be as small as picking up trash or cleaning a communal workspace.

Genuine enjoyment is one of the best ways to develop safety in the workplace. Can you think of ways you can promote fun in the workplace? List them. These can be either work-related (think team-building or developing a workspace) or external activities (think a company dodgeball game or a trip to the local museum).
