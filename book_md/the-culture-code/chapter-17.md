## Chapter 17: How Can You Develop Purpose?

Now that you understand the key attributes of safety and the importance of its development, **let’s discuss ways you can develop purpose in your workplace.**

### Communication and Interaction

#### Priorities

**Give priorities a name and rank.** Clear priorities allow team members to make decisions with consistency—even without direct instruction.

> **The Lost Receipt**
> 
> A retail store has the following priority ranking:
> 
>   1. Protect co-workers
> 
>   2. Serve guests
> 
>   3. Make strong relationships with suppliers
> 
>   4. Listen to corporate policies
> 
> 

> 
> An employee at the store is approached by a regular customer wanting to return an item that they lost the receipt for, but corporate has a policy that refunds cannot be issued without a receipt. The employee refers to the company’s priorities and offers the customer store credit because she knows that serving customers is a higher priority than following corporate policies. The employee made a decision based around the core priorities of the group and has adhered to the company standards without needing direct guidance or instruction.

**Clarify your priorities more than you think you need to.** Often, leaders think that the priorities of the company are clear and apparent to all employees. Unfortunately, this is not typically the case. Repetition builds routine, so constantly remind team members about the priorities of the company.

> **_Inc._ Magazine**
> 
> _Inc._ magazine asked employees at 600 different companies to name the top three priorities of their respective companies. Management predicted that 64% of their employees would know the priorities of the company. However, _Inc._ discovered that only 2% of employees actually knew the priorities of their company.

#### Signals of Purpose

**Develop a unified language through catchphrases.** Catchphrases may seem corny, but _their cheesiness gives them power_. Ridiculous phrases stick in the minds of team members. Catchphrases make company ideals easy to remember and immediately actionable. Keep it simple and straightforward:

  * Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach him to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.
  * Shoot for the stars, but be happy with the moon.
  * Practice doesn’t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.



**Use iconography and items to solidify your company’s purpose.** Put identifiable company objects and icons around the workspace. Such iconography could include awards, team photos, gear, or sketches. These items serve as a constant reminder to team members: _this is why we do what we do._

### Leadership

**Focus on what’s important to your organization.** Develop standards and language around the core principles of your company. Incentivizing certain behavior allows you to build consistency in your workforce’s decision-making process.

> **Zappo’s Call Center**
> 
> Tony Hsieh (the president of Zappo’s) noticed that employees in the call center were held to a “calls per hour” standard to determine proficiency. This standard promoted ideals that the company did not believe in (namely brevity and impersonal connection).
> 
> Hsieh decided to change the standard to a new metric called “Personal Emotional Connections” (PECs). PECs promoted creating a bond with the customer by giving personalized attention and care. While there was no clear way to measure this standard, it focused the actions of employees into the company’s framework.

**Set the bar, and set it high, especially with seemingly small tasks.** If the small things are treated with the utmost care, this behavior will typically seep into larger tasks. To encourage these standards, develop phrases to translate your purpose into expectations. For example, if you’re coaching basketball, and you want your players to give 100%, you may use the phrase “Backline-to-Backline,” implying that you expect them to sprint on every change of possession.

**Use mental contrasting.** Mental contrasting is the process through which you visualize an attainable goal, then visualize the obstacles:

  * You visualize an eventuality: _this is where we’re working towards._
  * You recognize your current state: _this is where we are today._
  * You discover obstacles: _this is what is currently in our way._



This process **acts as a constant reminder of the purpose of your journey, the obstacles in your way, and the progress you’ve already made.**
