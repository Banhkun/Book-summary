## Exercise: Develop a Successful Group Culture for Your Team

Successful group cultures rely on the development of the three foundations discussed in this summary (safety, vulnerability, and purpose). As you respond to these questions, think about what you’ve learned throughout this summary and refer to the “How Can You Develop... “ chapters of each part for inspiration.

* * *

Think about the ways in which your organization has developed a successful group culture. List them and connect them to one of the three foundations of group culture (safety, vulnerability, and purpose).

Now think about the ways in which your company can improve upon safety. List them and explain your reasoning. Think about the use of belonging cues and ways to promote interaction between team members.

Next, think about the ways that your organization can further develop trust through vulnerability. List them and explain your reasoning. Think about the development of feedback sessions and the improvement of listening cues.

Finally, think about the ways that your organization can clarify and express their purpose. List them and explain your reasoning. Think about the requirements of your organization (high-proficiency vs. high-creativity) and the clarity of your team’s priorities.
