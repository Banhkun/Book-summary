## Part 1: Safety | Chapters 1-5: What Is Safety and Why Does It Matter?

**Safety is the cornerstone of interconnection.** It develops direct communication, honest feedback, and a willingness to go above and beyond through constant signals of belonging. In this section, we’ll discuss **the key attributes of safety, why it's good for workplace culture, and problems that arise when it's missing.**

### The Key Attributes of Safety

#### Open and Honest Communication

**In a safe work environment, employees are willing and able to speak out, regardless of the hierarchy of the company.** The group is concerned with one task: solving problems to promote success. This means that even the low-level intern has the ability to speak to the CEO, which makes them feel secure in their importance to the team. Though they may be a small cog in the machine, they are essential to its operation.

**In a safe environment, team members feel valued.** No one wants to feel like they’re not appreciated. Safety lets team members feel like they belong in the group and have something substantial to contribute.

**Note: safety does not imply niceness.** Sometimes, courtesy must be put aside to allow for direct, unadulterated feedback. However, in a safe work environment, this bluntness comes from a place of care and a genuine desire to develop success.

#### Belonging Cues

Safe working cultures are full of behaviors and actions known as **belonging cues.** These cues create a feeling of safety and comfort within the workplace and address three specific topics: **connection, future, and security:**

  * **Connection** cues allow team members to feel as though they are supported by the group while being valued as individuals. Connection cues include physical connection, active listening, and small courtesies.
  * **Future** cues let team members know that they have a future with the organization. Future cues include discussions about upward mobility, correlations between team members and model employees, and conversations about long-term goals.
  * **Security** cues let team members know that they have permission to speak up without fear of losing their position. Security cues include the embrace of feedback, the promotion of team opinion, and the acknowledgment of strong work.



**Examples of belonging cues include:**

  * Interactions in close proximity
  * Eye contact
  * Back-and-forth communication
  * Energized conversations
  * Open and honest dialogue
  * Physical interaction (when appropriate): handshakes, fist bumps, and so on



### The Benefits of Safety

#### Benefit #1: Chemistry

**When team members repeatedly use belonging cues, they develop strong chemistry with one another.** It sends a message to team members: _you are a part of this team and you belong._ This creates magnetic workplaces that nurture efficiency and cohesion. Team members communicate quickly, contribute new ideas regularly, and give their input energetically.

##### The Allen Curve

Thomas Allen, a professor from MIT, wanted to understand the science behind group chemistry. Through his research, he discovered that successful groups had one thing in common: **their desks were in close proximity to one another _._**

As a result of this discovery, Allen developed a concept he called the “Allen Curve.” The Allen Curve displays the correlation between physical proximity to frequency of communication. Essentially, the closer team members are to one another, the stronger their chemistry and their resulting work.

#### Benefit #2: Willingness to Go Above and Beyond

**When employees feel valued and supported in the workplace, they are willing to go above and beyond** , even if the problem at hand is not technically their responsibility. Rather than spending a significant amount of time and energy strategizing, teams dive into issues head-first. They’re even more willing to work after hours to resolve the issues.

##### The Targeted Advertisements Race

At the start of the 21st century, software engineering companies were in a race to discover the best way to deliver targeted advertisements to consumers—a discovery that could potentially jumpstart a multi-billion dollar industry. The clear favorite was a company called Overture. Valued at a billion dollars, the company was already thriving and hired some of the most intelligent minds in the software and advertising industries.

However, this powerhouse company lost the race to a small company called Google. Though they did not have nearly the same amount of funding or experience and were relatively unknown at the time, Google managed to come out on top and dominate the industry.

How did a company with an obscene amount of talent and seemingly endless funds lose out to a young startup? The small upstart used belonging cues in their day-to-day operations. For instance, they developed connection through full-contact hockey games and developed security through open discussion forums. Employees were willing to go above and beyond for the organization because they felt intrinsically connected to the group. Individuals felt empowered to solve problems that weren’t explicitly assigned to them—one person personally took on a challenge of mismatched ads.

At Overture, on the other hand, employees had no desire to perform outside of their given positions because the leadership failed to develop a safe and connected work environment.

**Google won, not because it was the more intelligent company, but because it was the culturally safer company.**

#### Benefit #3: Connection Despite Tension

Even in times of incredible tension, **employees can develop and maintain interconnection.** Groups will experience highs and lows—that’s just a fact of life. But if safety has been established in the workplace, team members will stick together even in the most volatile of times.

##### The Christmas Truce of 1914

The Flanders trenches of WWI produced some of the most violent fighting in military history. Despite this, soldiers on both sides along the trench came together on Christmas Eve, sharing food, music, and laughter, leading to one of the largest unsanctioned cease-fires in military history.

This unofficial truce did not happen overnight. **It was the result of months of small interactions between the two sides through belonging cues:**

  * Connection: At many points along the line, the opposing trenches were no more than a few hundred feet apart from one another. Due to the close proximity, soldiers began to recognize commonalities between themselves and the opposition. They ate at the same time, entertained themselves in the same ways, and struggled with the same harsh environment.
  * Security: From mealtimes to burial runs, both sides had unspoken agreements to initiate cease-fires at certain times. They knew that in those brief moments, they were safe. 



These “mini-truces” fostered a sense of empathy between the warring soldiers as they were reminded of the humanity of the opposing side. Though this is an extreme example, it clearly demonstrates the ways in which belonging cues significantly impact people’s perception of safety.

### The Consequences of an Unsafe Environment

#### The Absence of Belonging Cues

When belonging cues are not present in the workplace, safety quickly disappears and efficiency drops drastically:

**Belonging Cue** | **When Present** | **When Absent**  
---|---|---  
Connection  | The team works together towards a common goal through support and input.  | Cohesion dissipates as team members have no sense of support or camaraderie.   
Indication of Future  | Work ethic increases as the promise of a long-term future incentivizes effort.  | Work ethic deteriorates as employees have no long-term incentives in sight.   
Security  | Team members willingly contribute ideas without fear of retaliation.  | Employees begin to cut corners and only contribute the bare minimum out of fear.   
  
#### Consequence #1: Negativity Infects the Workplace

When team members begin to resent their environment, they work with a lingering sense of insecurity: _Do I belong here? Is my work any good? Do other people want me here?**These insecurities lead to the development of negative behaviors such as:**_

  * Arguing with team members 
  * Providing little to no effort 
  * Negating the energy in the room



Negativity is contagious. It spreads quickly between employees and disrupts productive workflow.

##### The Bad Apple Experiment

Forty 4-person groups attempted to develop a marketing plan for a startup. An actor was placed within each of these teams with the task of disrupting performance by injecting a negative behavior into the group (aggression, laziness, or depression). In almost all of the teams, **the actor’s bad behavior corrupted the other team members** , often leading the other members of the group to behave in a similar way to the actor.

On the sole productive team, a leader figure managed to defuse the actor’s negative behavior by responding to his hostility with non-biting humor and by navigating the group back to the task at hand. They managed to excel thanks to the leader’s ability to create a safe working environment as the actor disrupted the volatile behavior.

#### Consequence #2: People Make Mistakes

An unsafe environment causes mistakes in a number of ways:

  * Employees feel overwhelmed or stressed by the weight of expectations and start cutting corners to produce.
  * Employees no longer care about the position in which they are working. They do not feel heard or appreciated, and their work ethic drops quickly as a result.
  * Employees see no future with the company, and, therefore, have no incentive to go above and beyond.



You may try to fix these mistakes with aggressive, proactive discipline. However, **discipline without connection creates resentment**. Employees feel attacked as the intentions behind the feedback are unclear. Discipline in this manner demoralizes the team and makes even the most capable employees ineffective.

##### The Minuteman Missileers

The Minuteman Missileers oversee the protection and day-to-day upkeep of some of the most powerful weapons in the world. Despite their dangerous and powerful position, **the Missileers have regularly made significant errors within recent years** , including (but not limited to):

  * Leaving nuclear missiles unattended on runways.
  * Dropping rocket boosters into a ditch after running a vehicle off of the road.
  * Failing to meet proficiency standards to the point of being deemed “unqualified.”



**What is causing some of the most well-trained members of the military to fail so regularly?** Their work environment lacks safety. If you look at their company culture within the framework of belonging cues, the reasons for their mistakes become abundantly clear:

  * **No Connection:** The team works in almost total isolation in a dilapidated structure with little to no opportunity for physical, mental, or emotional interaction.
  * **No Indication of Future:** After the Cold War, the missileer position became less prestigious as nuclear tensions declined. Now, a job in missiles provides no long-term incentives. With no upward mobility in sight, officers feel stuck in the program rather than seeing a future because of it.
  * **No Security:** From proficiency tests to readiness reviews, officers are expected to take near-impossible exams with inhuman accuracy and punishment for failure of any kind is swift and harsh. Therefore, many within the missile program feel the need to cut corners or seek out alternative methods in order to avoid reprimand or, worse, expulsion from the program.
