## Chapter 12: How Can You Develop Vulnerability?

Now that you understand the key attributes of safety and the importance of its development, **let’s discuss ways you can encourage vulnerability in your workplace.**

### Communication and Interaction

#### Listening and Communication

**Increase your responsiveness when listening.** It allows the speaker to feel heard and supported as they express their concerns and fears. The most effective listeners:

  * Make the speaker feel secure.
  * Come at the conversation from a supportive stance.
  * Ask _occasional_ questions that gently challenge the speaker to dig deeper into an issue or obstacle.
  * Make _occasional_ suggestions to lead the speaker down alternative paths.



**Avoid prematurely offering suggestions when discussing issues.** Encourage the speaker to explain their stances and develop their logic by asking them to tell you more about their current situation.

**Accept discomfort.** Vulnerable conversations require diving into painful experiences and facing nasty realities. Though they are not always pleasant, they are essential for discovering ways to improve effectiveness and develop solutions to problems. Be willing to have the difficult conversations and be supportive of the team members you have them with.

#### Interconnection

**Use language that promotes connection and collaboration.** For example, rather than having a “notes session,” consider calling it a “solution session.” A “notes session” sounds judgmental and one-sided. A “solution session” sounds supportive and reciprocal. These are seemingly small adjustments, but they bolster the group’s sense of togetherness.

**Use “flash mentoring.”** “Flash mentoring” follows the same principles as traditional mentoring (find someone you respect in the group and shadow them), but instead of taking months or years to follow them, take a few hours. This allows you to quickly build relationships with other team members and understand their work process. Once you understand how a fellow team member operates, it becomes much easier to develop behaviors of cooperation.

### Feedback

**Be candid, not brutal.** You don’t want to demoralize or embarrass the person you are giving feedback to, but, at the same time, you need to be straightforward with your feedback. The best approach is to aim for candor: make your feedback specific and avoid making it personal or judgmental.

**Give bad news in person.** When bad news is sent digitally, it feels cold and can easily be misunderstood. Speaking in person allows for team members to connect on a personal level, even when the conversation is inherently negative.

> **Chicago Cubs**
> 
> When Joe Maddon (a coach for the Chicago Cubs) needs to discipline a player, he calls them into his office, has them draw a piece of paper with the name of an expensive wine out of a glass bowl, has them purchase the wine, then shares the bottle of wine with them while he speaks with them. This disciplines the player while opening the door for reconnection.

**Separate performance and development discussions.** Often, performance and development feedback are grouped into one discussion. Combining these two conversations blurs your intentions and lessens impact because the conversations, though similar, occur under different pretenses:

  * Performance evaluations are inescapably judgmental and high-risk. They often impact salary and promotion status and do not touch on growth or improvement.
  * Professional development, on the other hand, focuses on discussing strengths and offering support for weaknesses. These discussions do not correlate to compensation and tend to feel more like a coaching session in which leadership can present opportunities for growth.



### Leadership

#### Set an Example

**No signal of vulnerability is more powerful than one that comes from a leader.** When team members see a high-level member of the group admit to a mistake, they immediately feel more comfortable owning up to their own areas of concern. Accepting imperfection and opening yourself up to scrutiny sends a message: _I am not perfect, and I know that your feedback can help solve this problem._

**Leave the group to their own devices on occasion—especially if you’re in a leadership position.** Stepping away shows immense vulnerability as you let go of the reins and trust your team to perform. This allows the team to figure out what they need to do to cooperate and succeed themselves, thus increasing their coordination and effectiveness.

#### Encourage Vulnerability From Your Employees

**Encourage team members to speak up.** Remind team members that the more complicated the project, the more open dialogue becomes essential. If team members aren’t expressing their concerns, there is no way to build a web of support.

**Create activities that promote honest feedback.** Invite team members to provide their insight on projects or operations through the development of regular, standardized feedback sessions. The more often you hold these meetings, the more comfortable the team will become. Sharing and delivering vulnerability will become part of the norm.

> **AARS**
> 
> After each mission or training session, members of Navy SEAL teams sit down for an After-Action Review (AAR). AARs are not inherently comfortable as these sessions expose errors in execution and introduce methods through which to improve.
> 
> Each session is structured the same way, with the same questions guiding discussion:
> 
>   * What was our intended outcome?
> 
>   * What actually happened?
> 
>   * What caused those results?
> 
>   * What will we repeat next time?
> 
>   * What will we change next time?
> 
> 

> 
> Within these sessions, soldiers are expected to reveal and analyze their own personal failures as well as those of the group. A willingness to express and discuss failure allows for the team to grow stronger and increase preparedness for the next mission or training activity.

**Focus on the first show of vulnerability and the first disagreement within newly formed groups.** When groups first develop, their interactions will likely follow one of two paths:

  * Team members will try to protect their egos and grow defensive.
  * Team members will show vulnerability and work together to solve issues collectively.



As a leader, you need to pay attention to these critical moments within new groups. If they begin to lean toward defensiveness, step in and introduce vulnerability into the group by leading through example.
