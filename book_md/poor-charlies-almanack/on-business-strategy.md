## On Business Strategy

Even though Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett don’t operate businesses themselves (they are famously hands-off and leave management to their business leaders), they do base their investment decisions on the strength of a company. They therefore have strong opinions on what makes companies successful over the long term.

### What Makes Companies Successful?

According to Munger, outlier business success often results from the combination of some of these factors:

  * Extreme focus on maximizing or minimizing one or two variables. For example, Costco focuses on driving volume and lowering prices, to the exclusion of many other factors obsessed over by typical retailers.
  * Positive feedback loops, so that success begets further success. These often produce nonlinear results as the combination of multiple multiplicative factors.
  * Strong, consistent execution over many factors. For example, Toyota executes well on many aspects of manufacturing, marketing, and capital allocation.
  * Riding a rising wave that adds tailwinds even to an otherwise strong company. For example, Oracle rode a wave of improving technology and adoption of technology by businesses.



### Moats and Competitive Advantage

Munger and Buffett consider the **primary factor of a great business to be an enduring competitive advantage** —what they call a “moat.” Like a moat protecting a castle, the competitive advantage allows a business to resist being made obsolete by competitors or changing markets.

To highlight the frenzy of competition, Munger points out that of the 50 most actively traded stocks in 1911, only one company—General Electric—survived as an independent, meaningful company. The forces of new technology, fierce new competitors, and shifting management are formidable and can drive companies out of business.

Berkshire Hathaway thus counsels its companies to widen their moats every year. This doesn’t necessarily mean earning more profits each year, but rather growing a company’s strategic position to weather the long term.

Under certain conditions, businesses with large moats can increase prices dramatically without cutting volume, and thus increase earnings dramatically. This happened with Disney in the 20th century. For decades Disneyland priced its tickets very affordably. Then the managers realized it was underpriced—it was a unique experience unlike any on Earth; people don’t consume it that frequently, so they’re not as worried about racking up high costs. So Disneyland raised its prices, and attendance maintained steady levels, leading to sudden profits.

(Shortform note: The ideas of competitive advantage were formalized by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter. For more details, read our guide to Understanding Michael Porter.)

### On Competition

Munger speaks further about competition in two respects—competition between rivals, and how new technology changes competition.

#### Competition Between Rivals

An interesting phenomenon in business is that some industries see a healthy level of profits amid reasonably friendly competitors, while others see fierce pricing battles and evaporated profits.

An example of the latter is the airline industry, which has been perennially unprofitable. Because airline seats are mostly seen as a commodity by customers, competition operates on the basis of pricing, which drives competition progressively toward lower and lower pricing, which in turn erases profits.

In contrast, Munger points to the cereal industry as surprisingly healthy. Despite the presence of major players like Kellogg’s and General Mills, as well as generic supermarket brands, it appears that companies can still healthily exist and earn profits. Munger explains this in a few ways:

  * Cereals aren’t a pure commodity—people are willing to pay higher prices for certain brands, which allows the more recognizable brands to command higher prices and earn more profits.
  * There might also be less intense rivalry for market share. If a certain player wanted to dominate in market share at all costs, it could lower prices and evaporate its own profits. In turn, other players would be forced to follow suit, and the entire industry’s profits would collapse. That this doesn’t happen in certain industries likely means the players are playing nice with each other and implicitly agreeing not to destroy the market in this way.



Munger notes that while insurance may seem like a commodity business, it’s not completely—people buying insurance have to evaluate the longevity of the insurer and the likelihood that it’ll pay out when it’s expected to.

#### Creative Destruction through Technology

Technology evolves so quickly that a new technology can make an entire industry obsolete within years. In the early 20th century, there were entire industries built around horses—saddlemakers, ferriers, and so on—that were wiped out when the automobile came along. Businesses are often unable to control the development of such technologies, and so they need to adapt to the new technology or risk being destroyed.

At times, technology won’t be a risk to a company but rather improve its operations. However, this type of facilitating technology doesn’t automatically mean it improves the company’s profits. New technology that becomes accessible to everyone is quickly adopted and becomes table stakes; no company has a meaningful edge over the other, and all the value gets passed down to the customers. In contrast, if you own a proprietary technology that no one else has, you can develop a meaningful moat.

**When you see a new technology, evaluate whether it’s going to help you or kill you.**

Berkshire Hathaway is famously allergic to investing in hot new technologies like software or pharmaceuticals, instead preferring to invest in businesses they understand deeply. Said Buffett about the Internet: “Change, as in the case of the Internet, can be the friend of society. But it is the absence of change that is often the friend of the investor. While the Internet will change many things, it will not likely change the brand of gum people chew. Charlie and I like stable businesses like chewing gum and try to leave life’s more unpredictable things to someone else.”

### Design Good Systems with Incentives

The incentives in business operations make a big difference in how people behave. People are prone to getting whatever they can out of a situation. With poorly-designed incentives, people will behave in ways that run counter to your intentions.

People get used to sloppy conditions quickly, so it’s important to stop them quickly when you recognize the problem. Munger cites a friend with a manufacturing business that suffered from extensive fraud in workers’ compensation, which raised the cost of premiums to unsustainable levels. He asked the unions to ask the staff to stop, but they resisted—by then, everyone was doing it and benefiting from it, and it was seen as free money. The friend closed down the plant and moved to Utah, where the Mormon population seemed to be much more honest, and the workers’ compensation costs dropped precipitously.

At times, **the right incentive scheme can seem unfair**. Munger shares a rule in the Navy—if you’re in charge of a ship and you run it aground, your naval career is basically over. It doesn’t matter what the reason was. This isn’t fair because it punishes officers whose ships run aground through no fault of their own, but the benefits outweigh these costs—officers are more careful than they otherwise would be if the rule weren’t this way. Munger feels the same way about compensation for stress in workers’ comp—while there are legitimate stress injuries, the current system invites so much abuse that society would be better off if compensation for stress were removed.

### On Pros and Cons of Scale

Businesses often seek to grow larger because there are advantages to scale. These include:

  * Efficiency: The more volume you process, the more efficiently you process the volume, and your costs per unit decrease.
  * Complex systems, when running well, become a large moat.
  * Winner-takes-all aspects: In certain industries with flywheel effects, the largest player continues to grow fastest and ends up dominating the industry. For example, in publishing, the largest newspapers got most of the circulation, which drives most of the advertising dollars, which then drives even more circulation.
  * Social proof: When everyone is using your product, then the marginal customer becomes more likely to use your product.



Munger points to chain stores as an example of a dominating business model. Larger stores get large purchasing power, which lowers merchandise costs. A larger headquarters means smart staff members who can specialize in buying in certain niches and thus make smarter decisions. And more stores means more experiments that can be run simultaneously to learn more about the market.

Contrast this with a single store operated by a single proprietor, which is in the inverse situation. This person lacks buying power, so merchandise costs a lot; she has to make lots of purchasing decisions across many categories, which likely means worse decisions. It’s difficult for this store operator to compete.

A fan of growth, Munger is skeptical of antitrust, noting that every business tries to take their success to achieve even greater success. “It’s hard for me to see why Microsoft is sinful to do this. If it’s a sin, then I hope all of Berkshire Hathaway’s subsidiaries are sinners.”

However, **scale can also come with its own disadvantages** :

  * Inability to specialize and explore niches
  * Bureaucracy: Large organizations can become slow to make decisions
  * Corruption: Oversight becomes more difficult, and people within an organization may condone each other’s corruption—”I won’t bother you if you won’t bother me.”



### Trademarks and Branding

The value of trademarks and branding to society is that it gives a strong incentive to preserve the reputation of the brand. Trust in a brand can be lost instantaneously after a scandal or a massive product recall. Therefore, brand owners are likely to invest in product quality, which then means consumers can trust that when they buy a brand name, they’re likely to get quality.

Munger tells an example of how the Carnation food company was attempting to buy the trademark of unrelated company Carnation Fish. The owner of the trademark refused to sell, and ultimately the larger Carnation company capitulated and gave a surprising offer—they would donate time from their food inspectors to make sure Carnation Fish had spotless operations. The value of protecting the Carnation name was so important that the company was willing to invest in similarly named companies it didn’t even own.

(Shortform note: Read more about the value of brand names in our guide to Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell.)

### How to Build a Trillion Dollar Company

In one speech, Munger poses an interesting challenge—how would you grow a trillion dollar company from scratch?

This isn’t a hypothetical question. He adds more specifics: It is 1884, and you are given 2 million dollars. How do you grow it to be a 2 trillion dollar company? Your company name must be Coca-Cola, and you must create a non-alcoholic beverage business.

He uses this as an example of **explaining a company’s success from first principles** , which can in turn improve your management and decision making. Here’s Munger’s approach.

Use math to size the problem:

  * This beverage must succeed worldwide to get the scale needed.
  * By 2034, there will be 8 billion consumers. Each consumer must drink 64 oz. of water per day. If you capture half the market of beverages, and each person drinks 16 oz. of Coca-Cola a day, we can sell 2.92 trillion eight-ounce servings in 2034.
  * Then, if you net 4 cents per serving, you’ll earn $117 billion.



Consider major factors that affect the business over time from 1884 to the 21st century:

  * The dollar will depreciate.
  * Purchasing power will rise, probably by at least 40x over 150 years.
  * Consumers’ desire to improve their drinking experience will rise.
  * Technology reduces the cost of creating the product.
  * Working backwards, the purchasing power change implies that in 1884, we need just 0.1 cent per serving of earnings.



To have such a large business, commanding a quarter of all beverage consumption, a lollapalooza of multiple supporting factors is required. These include:

  * Conditioned reflexes: Seeing the Coca-Cola brand must trigger a response of consumers to purchase. This can be done by psychological conditioning:
    * The drink’s sweetness provides value in calories and appeals to our evolutionary desires for food.
    * The drink provides stimulation through both sugar and caffeine.
    * A cool drink provides welcome relief to cool someone down, especially in hot temperatures.
    * Advertising associates the brand with positive things like happiness and family.
    * Carbonate the water to elevate it, like champagne.
  * Social proof: The more universal consumption is, the more acceptable it is, and the better the effects of consumption.
  * Advantages of scale
    * Mass advertising improves the economics by driving more demand for the product.
    * Larger distribution networks increase availability and make overhead more efficient.
    * Ubiquitous availability in every restaurant and store makes it harder for competition. If a competing product is never tried, it has no chance at creating a competing habit.



Start with no brainer decisions and facts:

  * You must trademark Coca-Cola, since you’ll never make enough selling generic beverages.



Set up logistics and distribution to get your product to customers:

  * Provide a syrup to fountains and restaurants, who supply their own carbonated water
  * Provide completed carbonated beverages in containers. This means you’ll need bottling plants worldwide.



Invert, always invert. What don’t you want on the path to building a massive company?

  * Avoid an aftertaste that gets people to stop drinking, so that people feel comfortable drinking liters of your beverage.
  * Don’t lose your trademark value. Customer trust can be lost in an instant. Be fanatic about product quality, presentation, and reasonableness of prices.
  * At scale, avoid making huge and sudden changes in flavor. This would eradicate the Pavlovian conditioning and cause a loss reaction, which would allow competitors to swoop in and replicate the flavor. (Coca-Cola ignored this idea when launching its failed New Coke overhaul in 1985).



There are many more aspects of Coca-Cola’s success, but this should suffice for a demonstration. The point to this exercise is that **most people, even having observed Coca-Cola for most of their lives, cannot explain the success of Coca-Cola**. Furthermore, recent executives could not understand the fundamentals well enough to predict the failure of “New Coke.”

To illustrate the utility of this thinking, Munger points to another failure of General Motors. Based on consumer surveys and its well-refined design processes, it decided to eliminate the fourth door in a truck that would seat five people. This ignored basic tenets of what people liked in cars—ease of use and traditional formats.

In general, in times of duress and need to change, don’t suddenly forget the fundamentals of the situation. Your new strategy may destroy what got you to your successful position in the first place.

### Sample Business Problems

To illustrate his principles, Munger likes giving riddles. Here are a few—after each question, we’ll put answers in a new line so you can muse on it yourself.

#### Business from First Principles

At the time of his speech, Berkshire Hathaway had recently opened a furniture and appliance store in Kansas City. At the time, the largest such store in the world was selling $350 million worth of goods annually. This new Kansas City store opened and immediately started selling over $500 million per year. Its parking lots were full from day one.

What caused this store’s immense success?

To begin, would this be a low-priced budget store or a high-priced premium store?

A premium store would not be able to sell this much volume on day one in a non-major city. It has to be a low-cost budget store.

Next, is it likely to be a small store or a big store?

Surely to sell $500 million of goods, it needs to be a big store.

And what advantages does a big store size have?

It has unrivaled selection.

Thus, the answer is clear—the store must be a low-priced store with a massive physical footprint and unprecedented selection.

Why hasn’t this been done before? The answer suggests itself—because it’s such a big store, it requires a big initial investment, and until Berkshire Hathaway came along no one was willing to try it.

#### Increasing Volume by Increasing Prices

Typically, increasing prices reduces sales volume. But**how can you _increase_ volume by increasing prices**?

1\. Luxury goods: Raising the price can improve the product’s ability as a ‘show-off’ item. In other words, if the utility of the good is to show one’s status, then raising the price increases the utility of the good. Further, people will frequently assume that the high price equates to a better product, and this can sometimes lead to increased sales.

2\. Non-luxury goods can take advantage of this too. As above, a higher price connotes higher value, an assumption the buyer accepts. This can especially apply to industrial goods where high reliability is an important factor.

3\. Once you raise the price, you can use the extra revenue in legal ways to improve the company, like making the product work better or improving the sales system.

4\. Alternatively, you can raise the price and use the extra revenue in illegal or unethical ways, like bribing purchasing agents. (Munger notes that he likes this answer the most but never gets it).
