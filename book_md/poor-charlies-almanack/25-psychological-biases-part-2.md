## 25 Psychological Biases: Part 2

### 11: Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial

#### What It Is

Denial is denying that an objective truth exists because it causes pain.

It’s often mixed up with love, death, and chemical dependency

Denial can possibly be helpful in these situations:

  * If the objective truth is not available, and you need denial to persevere
  * If the common wisdom is incorrect, and denying it helps you make better decisions



#### Why It Evolved

Avoiding pain probably helped people continue to survive in emotionally difficult situations.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

If the truth exists and you refuse to accept it, denial can only worsen your decision making.

Denial compounds consistency tendency and sunk cost fallacy. Say you’ve lost a lot of money in a bad venture.

  * Denial tricks you into thinking the situation is better than it really is.
  * The sunk cost fallacy prompts you to put more money after bad.
  * Self-consistency makes you behave with inertia so it’s harder not to behave differently than you have.



#### Examples

  * Denial is the first stage of grief, suggesting it’s part of a coping mechanism.
  * Substance abusers tend to deny they have a problem as they further deteriorate.



#### Antidotes

To make the truth less painful, try exposure therapy to the truth. The more you repeat the truth, the less painful it’ll become.

Become comfortable with accepting mistakes. Then facing the truth won’t be as painful.

### 12: Excessive Self-Regard Tendency

Also known as: the Lake Wobegon effect, the endowment effect, the Dunning-Kruger effect, homophily

#### What It Is

You tend to like yourself a lot. This also causes you to like everything about you too much:

  * You overestimate your abilities and think you’re more competent than you are.
  * You overvalue your possessions. Once given an item, you value it more than you did before receiving it.
  * You like your decisions more after you’ve made them.
  * You like people who are like you (homophily).



#### Why It Evolved

Believing yourself to be competent and valuable can boost confidence, which helps spur action. In contrast, having constant self-doubt would be crippling.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Combined with doubt-avoidance tendency, your overconfidence makes you pick rash decisions that aren’t as good as you believe. Then, denial, inconsistency avoidance, and excessive self-regard tendency make you think the decision is great and not worth changing.

People who are excessively self-confident may do more harm than good.

Homophily collects people who think alike, which tends to breed groupthink.

  * Corrupt departments will select for people who fit the corruption, and over time the behavior will be deeply entrenched and very hard to change.



#### Examples

  * The Lake Wobegon effect—in surveys of people on common abilities like driving, the majority of people believe they’re above average, which is of course mathematically impossible.
  * In gambling, if you can’t pick your own numbers, gamblers play much less frequently. The presumption that a gambler has personally picked good numbers is a big part of the appeal.
  * If you think you’re pretty smart, you may more easily fall for scams if you think, “there’s no way a smart person like me would fall for scams, thus this isn’t a scam.“
  * In stock market cycles, people enter the market thinking they’re smarter than the average investor, which often turns out to be untrue.
  * Many hiring interviewers overestimate their ability to pick good performers from face-to-face interviews.



#### Antidotes

Force yourself to be more objective when thinking about yourself, the people close to you, your property, and your decisions.

  * Use a checklist to see if any psychological tendencies apply, and ask yourself questions about your objectivity.



Justified pride is fine. It’s even necessary in many fields—pilots need to be confident in landing planes, and surgeons need to be confident in their handiwork.

Confronting excessive self-regard in other people: other people may think they’re not at fault, but you can’t accept excuses for poor performance.

  * A child steals candy and says he’ll replace it later. His father says, “Son, it would be better for you to simply take all you want and call yourself a thief every time you do it.”
  * Unfixed bad performance tends to be self-repeating and creates a bad culture. Create a fair, meritocratic, demanding culture.



### 13: Overoptimism Tendency

#### What It Is

People tend to believe things will work out.

“What a man wishes, that also will he believe.”—Demosthenes

#### Why It Evolved

Hope spurs action. If you’re optimistic that you’ll survive and a food source is right around the corner, you’ll continue trying to survive.. In contrast, a pessimistic depression dampens the very behaviors that would encourage survival.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Denial of bad news and overoptimistic ignorance of risk factors leads to poor decision-making.

#### Examples

People buy lottery tickets and overestimate their chances of winning

#### Antidotes

Habitually use probability math in your decisions. Your mental heuristics for chance are not adequate, the same way that your intuitive golf grip is nowhere as effective as the unnatural ones now used by professionals.

### 14: Deprival-Superreaction Tendency

Also known as: loss aversion, sunk cost fallacy, near-misses

#### What It Is

We hate having things taken away from us. Being deprived of things ignites a strong counterreaction.

We feel losses more strongly than gains. Losing $10 causes a stronger reaction than gaining $10 does. (Shortform note: read more about prospect theory in our summary of Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

If you almost get a reward and then have it jerked away, you feel as though you’ve had the reward the whole time and had it taken away, even though you never actually got it.

  * For example, near-misses in gambling (like pulling two 7’s and a lemon in a slot machine) make you feel like you had the prize to begin with, then lost it.



We overweigh losses that are near to us—someone worth $10 million will regret losing $100 from his wallet, but not a 0.5% loss in his assets that amounts to $50,000.

#### Why It Evolved

Having resources was critical to survival. Losing resources threatened survival, and a strong reaction prevents making the same mistake again.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

We overreact to the threat of a loss.

  * Both Munger and Warren Buffett dislike open auctions, since they make you feel like you’ve almost won and stir you to keep bidding beyond the price you originally wanted to pay.
  * In business, having things taken away may misguide your strategy. For instance, you might be worried about competition taking your market share, when the real prize to focus on is a new market people haven’t fought for yet.



A dog may bite the hand that feeds it but takes away food. Likewise, you might dislike someone who otherwise treats you well but occasionally takes something away from you (like an employer who takes you off a project).

Deprival superreaction synergizes strongly with inconsistency avoidance. The greater the investment in your venture (sunk cost), the greater the deprival reaction will be.

  * For example, your business may be doomed and require heavy changes that would rescue it, such as upending people’s livelihoods or depriving yourself of a way of life. This causes a strong deprival superreaction as well as a tendency to keep inertia in what you’re doing, so you end up not making the necessary changes.



(Shortform note: Denial may be a defense against deprival superreaction. For instance, say your spouse passes away; the deprival superreaction would be extremely crushing, and denial might protect your psyche through this loss, gradually exposing you to the truth over time.)

#### Examples

  * Charlie Munger once bought 300 shares of an oil company at $115 each with cash. He was offered another 1,500 shares but he didn’t want to liquidate any other assets to get the cash needed, so he refused. Later, Shell bought the company for $3,700 per share. He learned the lesson—if he felt that the stock was at a good value, he should have paid more at that value and ignored his deprival reaction.
  * Workers often object to decreases in salary, since it represents a pure loss. However, this often requires that companies close or fire people rather than renegotiate salaries downwards.
  * Gamblers have a passion to get even once they suffer a loss. This passion grows with the size of the loss.



#### Antidotes

To avoid problems with relative losses, calibrate your losses in true absolute terms, rather than relative terms. For instance, losing a $100 bill from your wallet is far less impactful than a bad habit that costs $2,000 a year or a 1% loss on a large investment.

To avoid triggering deprival reaction in people when you need to take things away from them, build an extreme culture of courtesy and respect.

### 15: Social-Proof Tendency

Also known as: bystander effect

#### What It Is

You think you’re in independent control of your actions, but in reality you do what you observe from other people. You think their thoughts and you mirror their actions.

This is triggered most easily in times of puzzlement and stress.

It applies to both action and inaction. If other people aren’t doing anything you tend not to do anything either.

#### Why It Evolved

Social proof tendency helps maintain social cohesion by encouraging a normative behavior. If everyone shares in cooperative behavior that helps overall survival (such as bathing), then the whole group benefits.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

In general, when the crowd is wrong, mirroring their actions is bad for you.

  * A company that doesn’t have a clear independent strategy will tend to follow the crowd, which thins its competitive advantage.
  * During an emergency, people might sit around and do nothing. (Shortform note: The Kitty Genovese effect is named after a woman who was stabbed outside her apartment and called for help, but dozens of witnesses who heard her screams neglected to do anything, possibly because they didn’t see anyone else doing anything.)



In stressful situations, people tend to make rash follow-the-crowd decisions. For instance, during stock market booms and busts, people unwisely react according to how the market behaves. This synergizes with deprival reaction and doubt avoidance—people don’t want to lose their money, and they have great anxiety from doubt, so they act rashly to soothe their doubt.

Social proof can also trigger cycles of bad behavior. For instance, social proof can be coupled with envy/jealousy tendency and deprival superreaction. (Shortform example: Think of frenzied shopping behavior during Black Friday mobs, when people envy the goods that other people have and don’t want their own goods taken away.) Social proof justifies and magnifies the bad behavior.

#### Examples

We do simple daily actions by following the crowd and not thinking about it.

  * People arriving at a football game get to the entrance by following the crowd.
  * People who enter elevators turn to face the direction everyone else is facing in.
  * Advertising featuring admirable people makes the product appear more attractive in our minds.



Social proof can have more significant effects:

  * A company’s board of directors can sit idly by during a problem if they see no one else on the board taking action.
  * Serpico syndrome: in a corrupt organization, a lone dissenter will be harassed by everyone else for not conforming to the corruption.



#### Antidotes

Be an independent thinker. Use a checklist to see if the countervailing theory is correct. Learn how to ignore other people’s behavior when they are wrong.

As a society, stop bad behavior before it spreads, and glorify good behavior.

To stop the bystander effect when you need help, don’t ask a formless crowd for help. Point to someone specific and ask for something.

### 16: Contrast-Misreaction Tendency

Also known as: Contrast effect, anchoring, boiling frog syndrome

#### What It Is

You tend to think in terms of relative contrast, rather than absolute numbers.

  * As a physical experiment, put one hand in a bucket of cold water and the other in hot water. Then after some time, put both hands into the same bucket of lukewarm water. The hands will feel very different—the bucket that was in the cold water bin will feel scorching, while the hot water hand will feel cool—even though the bucket is actually at the same temperature.
  * A real estate agent may show you three overpriced, bad houses, and then a final normal-priced normal house. By contrast, the last normal house looks fantastic to you, but if it were shown to you first, you wouldn’t have thought much of it.



You don’t easily detect small, imperceptible differences because the contrast is small. However, these accumulating differences can make a huge difference over time. This is also known as the boiling frog syndrome, after the idea that a frog placed into a heating pot of water won’t detect anything wrong and will eventually be cooked alive.

#### Why It Evolved

Detecting contrasts between items may be a simpler form of cognition than thinking about the absolute values of each. This helps you recognize danger faster (for instance, detecting a tiger’s pattern against grass).

#### How It Can Be Harmful

You often make decisions based on relative value, not absolute value

  * If you’re buying a car that costs $60,000, buying a $1,000 upgrade might not seem like a big deal. But if you were to buy some other product worth $1,000, you’d think long and hard about it.



The boiling frog syndrome lets one small slip happen at a time, which can lead to a drastic situation.

  * Alcoholism is a slippery slope that makes one additional drink per day seem like not a big deal.



#### Examples

  * In negotiations, you might come in with a fixed idea of what you want, but small deviations away from it may draw you away from your goal without your realizing it. (A skilled negotiator employing anchoring and reciprocity tendencies can manipulate you further.)
  * It’s easy to obsess over small changes in things that don’t make a huge difference—for instance, a $5 per month increase in a service you like may trigger a strong reaction, even though it amounts to just $60 a year. 



#### Antidotes

Be aware of when you’re comparing two items or situations. Think about the absolute value of the item rather than what you’re seeing in comparison.

  * When buying a car, think about the absolute cost of each individual upgrade and whether you’d buy it if it were presented to you alone.
  * In negotiations, keep a fixed idea of your breaking point and don’t accept a deal that deviates from it.



### 17: Stress-Influence Tendency

#### What It Is

Stress prompts faster and more extreme reactions.

Light stress can slightly improve performance, such as on tests.

#### Why It Evolved

When a tiger jumps at you, you don’t want to be sitting and thinking about what to do. You want to react quickly, even automatically, to resolve the situation. Normal stressful situations fall on that spectrum of stress.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Stress causes you to rely on faulty heuristics rather than methodical thinking.

Stress amplifies other biases:

  * Social proof tendency: there’s no time to think, do what everyone else does.
  * Deprival superreaction: my stuff is being taken away! Quick, attack.
  * Reciprocation, Kantian fairness, Disliking/hating tendency: as in road rage—someone’s acting unfairly and taking away my time; I hate this person; I want to unleash my fury on this person; I’m stressed and I don’t have time to ponder whether this is a good idea.



Extreme, prolonged stress can lead to mental breakdowns and a persistent rewiring of the brain.

#### Examples

The scientist Pavlov experimented with stress in dogs. He would put a dog in a cage and flood the cage until there was barely any air left, imposing a great amount of stress. This caused a prolonged behavior change where the dogs started disliking the handlers. Repeated exposure to stress caused a persistent change in behavior.

Interestingly, he couldn’t reverse a breakdown except by reimposing stress.

There might be an association between mental strength and strength of rewiring: the dogs that were hardest to break down were also the hardest to return to their pre-breakdown state.

#### Antidotes

During a stressful period, try to maintain your calm. Think about how much time you have to react and what happens if you don’t act before then. You may have more time to think than you expected.

When you’re calm, use checklists to think through your decisions.

### 18: Availability-Misweighing Tendency

Also known as: Availability heuristic, what you see is all there is

#### What It Is

Your brain works with what’s available to you and doesn’t think as hard about what’s missing. This applies broadly to facts, memories, and concepts (you don’t think about what evidence you’re missing), and emotions (you don’t think hard about whether it’s wise to feel a different emotion).

#### Why It Evolved

We have a limited capacity to remember, recall, and think, so we jump to what’s easily available. (Shortform note: Possibly, availability bias helps to increase weight on the most recent places you found food, and not the place that worked a year ago.)

#### How It Can Be Harmful

By using only what’s recently available, you ignore other important data that would have helped you make a better decision.

Availability-misweighing amplifies other biases, mainly in misjudging the small amount of information that is available to you:

  * Stress influence: You have to make a decision fast, and the easiest information to recall is what’s available.
  * Contrast misreaction: The most recent change and the most visible change is emphasized.
  * Social proof: When you’re in a crowd, you get a massive cognitive input of seeing crowds of many humans behaving together. This crowds out independent thought and makes it harder to see that there are alternatives.



#### Examples

  * Economists tend to support arguments that produce reams of data, rather than fuzzier concepts that are true but hard to prove. Thus, it took decades for the concepts in behavioral economics to arise, even though they were fairly intuitive in retrospect.
  * “When I’m not near the girl I love, I love the girl I’m near.”
  * When giving a speech, providing vivid imagery helps persuade your listeners by providing an available image and memory.



#### Antidotes

Seek information that is not readily available to you—find a new type of person to talk to, or invert your beliefs and read about perspectives you disagree with.

Use a methodical decision-making process: Put all the evidence you have available in front of you, then weigh them appropriately.

  * Extra-vivid and memorable information should be de-emphasized.
  * Disconfirming evidence should be emphasized, because you have a tendency to ignore it (per inconsistency avoidance tendency).
  * “An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.”



### 19: Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency

#### What It Is

All skills attenuate with disuse.

Skills that are trained to fluency will be lost more slowly and, even if lost, will come back faster with new learning.

#### Why It Evolved

All neural circuits have the tendency to decay over time if unused. This is probably useful for brain efficiency, since unused circuits are pruned to make way for more useful ones.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

If you don’t practice flexible thinking and exercise your mental models, you risk becoming a one-dimensional thinker. You’ll fall prey to man-with-a-hammer syndrome, where you approach every problem with the same blunt tool.

#### Examples

  * The pianist Paderewski said that if he failed to practice for a single day, he’d notice his performance deteriorate. After a week, the audience would notice it too.



#### Antidotes

Continuously practice the skills you can’t afford to lose, much like fighter pilots in simulators.

  * Munger likes using a checklist to recall important skills and concepts.



Learn important skills to fluency so you can better recall them later.

### 20: Drug-Misinfluence Tendency

#### What It Is

There are substances like alcohol that are addictive and make you feel deceptively happy.

#### Why It Evolved

The brain has a normal, healthy adaptability to its inputs, such as habituation (a repeated stimulus requires larger doses to have the same effect). Drugs amplify the normal behavior of the brain.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Drugs are destructive for cognition, and addiction is destructive to life.

#### Antidotes

The best decision is to not even get started with addictive drugs.

(Shortform note: Programs like Alcoholics Anonymous employ a good number of the psychological effects expressed here, such as reciprocation tendency and social proof. Read more in our summary of the main text of Alcoholics Anonymous)

### 21: Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency

#### What It Is

Old people find it harder to learn new skills.

However, some old people remain proficient by intensely practicing old skills. You can see this in a bridge or checkers tournament.

#### Antidotes

Continuous thinking and learning, done with joy, can delay the inevitable decline.

### 22: Authority-Misinfluence Tendency

#### What It Is

Man was born mostly to follow leaders, with only a few people doing the leading.

Hierarchies in society arise that support this tendency.

People tend to follow instructions from authority, even blindly.

#### Why It Evolved

A tendency to obey authority and the hierarchy may improve social cohesion, which in turn improves survival. A few orders given from the top, if followed by everyone, may be better for society.

Well-chosen authorities may be good exemplars for behavior. The crowd’s replicating the habits of the powerful or successful may improve survival.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Authority limits the individual’s decision making, which is bad when the leader is wrong, or when the leader’s ideas are misunderstood.

Authority misinfluence is amplified by:

  * Stress influence: Confusing situations like emergencies or economic recessions increase obedience to the leader’s guidance.
  * Doubt avoidance: Being in doubt is stressful; following a leader’s orders blindly is easier.
  * Social proof: When a few people start following a leader, the rest flock to the crowd.
  * Contrast misreaction: Small gradual changes in an authority’s orders can cause a drastic deviation in behavior over time.



#### Examples

The famous Milgram experiment showed the tendency of people to obey authorities. The setup: the subject is assigned the role of a teacher; his role is to administer shocks to a learner when the learner makes mistakes. The voltage is increased with each mistake, ending at levels that would cause serious damage or death. (In reality, no shocks were given; pre-recorded messages of pain were played at different shock levels.) If the subject demurred from giving shocks, the experimenter would step through four statements in order:

  * Please continue.
  * The experiment requires that you continue.
  * It is absolutely essential that you continue.
  * You have no other choice; you _must_ go on.



If the subject refused to go on after these four statements, the experiment would end. The majority of people didn’t get this far; they delivered a final 450-volt shock three times. (Shortform note: Read more about the Milgram experiment here.)

Outside of the laboratory, the same effect has real-world consequences:

  * Hitler led a nation of believing Christians into supporting genocide.
  * Many CEOs remain in control of companies far longer than they should.
  * (Shortform example: In 2014, a South Korean ferry capsized. The captain asked the passengers to stay in their cabins and await further orders, which never came. While the captain escaped, 300 passengers (mainly high school students) died.)



#### Antidotes

Be careful whom you appoint to power. This figure will be hard to remove, since people listen to authority.

As usual, in a stressful situation, control your reflexive reactions, follow a checklist, and verify the leader’s judgment is sound before making a decision.

If you default to thinking, “well this (policeman, professor, manger, president) couldn’t possibly be wrong,” examine your thinking. Come from the perspective that all people universally have biases, and authority figures may at times be less reliable than your personal thinking..

### 23: Twaddle Tendency

Also known as: Dunning-Kruger effect

#### What It Is

Twaddle means “foolish speech or writing.” Some people tend to pour out twaddle while others are doing serious work.

#### Why It Evolved

Ideally people know their area of competence and don’t stray outside it. But people with excessive self-regard may project themselves as more confident or knowledgeable than they are. When these people are in authority positions, they may get more credence than they deserve.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

When other people twaddle, believing twaddle from other people can lead to bad decisions.

When you twaddle, you overstep your circle of competence. You may delude yourself into taking on something you’re not ready for.

#### Examples

Earlier we gave an example of bee dances: When a bee finds nectar, it returns to the hive and does a dance to tell the hive where to find it—how far to go in what direction. A scientist decided to test the limits of this system and put nectar straight above the hive. In normal situations, nectar is never above the hive (flowers don’t grow in the sky), so the bee doesn’t have natural programming to signal this.

So what does the bee do? Ideally, it’d just sit there and do nothing. But instead, the bee dances a crazy, incoherent dance. The other bees see this dance and misinterpret where the nectar is, and so this single confused bee throws off the entire hive.

Many people are like the confused bee—they answer questions outside their circle of competence. Even when they know they’re confused, they try to bluster and pretend they know what they’re talking about.

#### Antidotes

Know your circle of competence. If you’re outside of it, gather more information before making a decision.

Says Munger: “The principal job of an academic administration is to keep the people who don’t matter from interfering with the work of the people that do.” Don’t hire twaddlers who get in the way of real work.

### 24: Reason-Respective Tendency

#### What It Is

When given correct reasons on why you should do something, you work and learn better.

#### Why It Evolved

People innately enjoy accurate cognition. You see this in how gratifying puzzles and games are to play.

Having a consistent logical argument is logically more persuasive in itself.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Hearing illogical reasons can be just as persuasive as logical reasons.

  * In an experiment, people lined up at a copy machine to make copies. Giving someone a fake reason—that you need to skip ahead in line because you need to make copies—makes people comply just as much as giving a logical reason (that you’re in a rush).



Reason-respective tendency amplifies other tendencies:

  * Doubt avoidance: a bad reason is better than no reason at all.
  * Authority misinfluence: An authority is already persuasive by virtue of her position. Bad reasons given by authority can be more persuasive than they should be (as in the Milgram experiment). They surpass the threshold for compliance



#### Antidotes

As a leader, think through the reasons you’re doing something before giving orders. Communicate those reasons for doing something: think through Who, What, Where, When, and Why.

As a follower or thinker, keep asking yourself, “why?” Justify the reasons you give yourself logically (and use a checklist to check your decisions).
