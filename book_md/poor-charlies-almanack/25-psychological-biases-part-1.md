## 25 Psychological Biases: Part 1

Our brains, like much of our bodies, are biologically optimized to deliver results with efficiency. The brain often employs shortcuts to make decision making easier and faster. Often these shortcuts are well-serving, like when your eyes detect the shape of a predator in the bushes before you consciously perceive it. But often these shortcuts also obscure the truth and lead to dysfunctional thinking. Even worse, people can take advantage of these shortcuts and manipulate you.

Charlie Munger mastered his understanding of these shortcuts. Through his reading in psychology and his real-world experiences, he assembled **25 psychological tendencies** that tend to mislead humans.

(Shortform note: What Munger calls “tendencies” are also commonly known as “cognitive biases.” You can read more about biases in our book guides to _Influence by Robert Cialdini_ and _Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman_.)

One warning: **simply being _aware_ of these biases is not an adequate defense against them**. For important decisions, Munger runs through a full checklist covering all of these biases, crossing each one off to make sure he’s not affected by the bias.

For each tendency, we’ll cover:

  * What the tendency is and why it evolved as a part of natural behavior
  * Other names for the tendency
  * How the tendency can be harmful
  * Examples of the tendency
  * How to overcome the tendency



(Shortform note: In his original speech, Munger treated the biases unevenly, so we’ve filled in the gaps with examples from his other material and from general psychological research.)

### 1: Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency

Also known as: incentive-caused bias, agency cost

#### What It Is

Self-interest drives human behavior. If someone receives rewards for doing a behavior, they will do that behavior again and again.

Research shows that once a behavior is conditioned, a random distribution of rewards keeps the behavior in place the longest—think a slot machine rather than a fixed, predictable payment like a salary.

Rewards are also known as incentives. Common incentives include money, friendship, sex, and advancement in social status.

People, institutions, and society often design incentive schemes to promote certain behavior. However, people tend to game all incentive schemes to maximize rewards for themselves, even if it violates the intent of the incentive scheme and comes at the expense of the system.

#### Why It Evolved

The brain has a simple algorithm: “Repeat behavior that works.” Here, what works is what gives the person rewards. Why would the brain evolve any differently?

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Incentives cause bias, consciously or subconsciously. If you have an incentive to think a certain way, you will find it hard to think any other way.

Because people will maximize their rewards within any incentive scheme, **poorly designed incentives cause bad behaviors**.

  * For example, if a surgeon is financially rewarded for each gallbladder she takes out, she’ll tend to take out gallbladders, regardless of whether the patient actually needs it taken out.



If people start acting badly because of an incentive scheme, they won’t see themselves as bad people. Instead, they’ll rationalize the bad behavior in a way that preserves their integrity.

  * For example, the surgeon above won’t think, “I’m getting easy cash by fraudulently excising gallbladders.” Instead, she’ll think gallbladders are the source of all evil, and any doctor who loves her patients will take out every gallbladder she can.



Bad behaviors become intensely habit-forming when they are rewarded.

#### Examples

Munger cites a number of cases where properly designed incentives cause the right behavior:

  * Package shipper Fedex had trouble getting all their packages processed in late night shifts. They tried a lot of management tactics, to no effect. Finally, they changed the pay model from pay per hour to pay per shift (workers wouldn’t get paid until they finished processing all the packages). Magically, the productivity problems disappeared and all the packages were processed on time.
  * Government contracts used to be awarded on a “cost-plus” basis—whatever the vendor quoted, the government would add a percentage to allow for profits. Naturally, this caused vendors to embellish their quotes. The government switched to fixed-fee contracts, where vendors are paid a fixed amount regardless of their costs—immediately, the costs for each contract plummeted.
  * Munger discussed a native European tribe that killed the last warrior to line up in his place. “No one enjoyed fighting this tribe.”



There are also cases where warped or missing incentives cause bad behavior:

  * Expert advisors often recommend things that benefit themselves. Says Munger, “I have never seen a management consultant’s report that didn’t end with the same advice: ‘This problem needs more management consulting services.’”
  * Munger notes that the capitalist free market promotes brutal competition between participants, which allows the smartest, most efficient participants to survive. In contrast, non-profit or government environments have employees paid fixed amounts with no incentives to be more efficient, causing a steep loss of efficiency.



#### Antidotes

Don’t reward behaviors you don’t want. Don’t design incentive structures that are easily manipulated.

For any incentive scheme, apply audits to check for good behavior.

  * Cash registers deter employee theft.
  * Misbehaving employees should be publicly punished to deter future misbehavior.



When getting advice from advisors, be healthily skeptical, especially of advice that benefits the advisor.

  * Learn the basic elements of your advisor’s trade so you can sniff out bad advice.
  * Double check, disbelieve, or replace much of what you’re told.



Employers can behave poorly as well. To limit employer bad behavior:

  * Allow formation of unions to protect workers.
  * Apply regulation to rein in bad behavior.



### 2: Liking/Loving Tendency

Also known as: halo effect, association fallacy

#### What It Is

Humans tend to like and love things and people. In particular, they have an affinity for their mothers, much like goslings attach to whatever is there at birth.

When you have an object of affection, you tend to ignore their faults and comply with their wishes. You like people, products, and actions that are associated with your object of affection.

This also works in reverse—a quality you admire in someone _intensifies_ the feeling of liking and loving that person. This can build extreme feedback loops—you might naturally like someone, then you like their character traits, which in turn intensifies your admiration for that person and ignorance of their faults.

In return, people like _being_ liked and loved.

#### Why It Evolved

As a child, being emotionally attached to your parents promotes your learning and safety.

More broadly, people who like each other tend to stick together, thus promoting social cohesion and cooperation.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

If you like someone or something enough, you can ignore its real faults and problems.

In extreme cases, your affection for something can be so strong that you harm yourself to attain what you love.

Because you want to be loved yourself, you pursue paths that make other people admire you, rather than the optimal choice for yourself. This includes making popular but wrong decisions as a manager, or pursuing a respectable career path that you dislike.

#### Examples

  * Advertising famously associates products with popular figures. If we like the people in the advertisement, then we transfer some of that affection to the product.
  * Warren and Charlie both liked Warren’s uncle, Fred Buffett, the grocery store owner they both worked for as children. In turn, they appreciated his character traits, like his work ethic, and adopted the traits for themselves.



#### Antidotes

To correct for liking bias when considering something else, invert—what do you _dislike_ most about the object of your affection? What are all the ways a person is unlikable?

To correct for your own desire to be liked, explicitly recognize your desire to be liked, and control for that in your decision making.

For society in general, put good, admirable people in situations where people are prone to like or love, like teaching.

### 3: Disliking/Hating Tendency

Also known as: reverse halo effect

#### What It Is

In direct contrast to liking tendency, humans _also_ tend to dislike and hate things and people.

  * For someone or something you dislike, you ignore its virtues.
  * You dislike people, products, and actions associated with what you dislike.
  * You distort facts to facilitate your hatred—you ignore positives and harp on the negatives.



#### Why It Evolved

It’s possible that the dislike of an “other” group promoted resource seizing or conquest of other tribes, and thus enhanced survival.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Disliking someone can cause you to ignore the full facts (like the positives of a person), which distorts your decision making.

  * In business, if you dislike your competition, you may underestimate their strengths; in reality, they may be able to defeat you handily.



Sometimes businesses dislike each other so much that they fixate on competition, rather than growing the pie together or existing the market entirely. This occurs because the emotional reaction to hating is so strong.

If you start off disliking someone, a vicious cycle can result—you ignore her virtues and obsess about her weaknesses, which causes you to further dislike someone and thus further ignore her virtues.

Rifts between people who dislike each other can progressively widen until there is no common ground, and agreements are harder to achieve. Inconsistency-avoidance tendency keeps this further entrenched.

#### Examples

  * Negative political advertising between opposing parties showcases how strongly people can dislike each other.
  * Munger notes that when the World Trade Center was destroyed, many Pakistanis concluded the Hindus did it, and many Muslims concluded the Jews did it. At times, there is a natural tendency for groups to dislike each other.
  * As an exercise, pick anything you strongly dislike, and see how many good things you can say about it.



#### Antidotes

Invert, always invert—what can you find to like about an object of your hatred? How can you come to accept this thing you dislike?

Respect your competitors not as incompetent idiots but instead as people who are highly competent with many virtues, whom you will respect and target with your own strengths and virtues.

### 4: Doubt-Avoidance Tendency

#### What It Is

Doubt is painful, causing puzzlement and stress. When you feel doubt, you reach a decision more quickly than a fully considered decision would take.

If you’re already on a path, then plodding down your current path is psychologically easier than doubting the path and potentially causing upheaval. This is further strengthened by inconsistency-avoidance tendency.

#### Why It Evolved

In stressful situations, like facing off against a hungry tiger, doubting your actions for too long can get you eaten.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

To remove doubt, you can make poorly considered decisions.

A vicious cycle can result—if you start off on a bad track, then you can cause yourself more stress, which in turn causes you to make more poor decisions.

#### Examples

  * If your company’s core strategy is failing, it’s hard to reverse course. Proper actions, like pivoting a company and letting go of employees, introduce doubt. The easier thing is to just perpetuate the action.



#### Antidotes

Before making decisions, schedule deliberate delays. Jury trials require careful deliberation before reaching a final decision. For your own decisions, “sleep on it.”

In stressful situations, give yourself the luxury of patience. Warren and Charlie are content to sit idly for a long time until they see a great deal. Having a larger resource buffer (as with more money or time) helps you avoid panicking in emergencies.

### 5: Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency

Also known as: confirmation bias, cognitive inertia, status quo bias, cognitive dissonance, sunk cost fallacy, system justification

#### What It Is

People are reluctant to change. This applies to personal behavior, beliefs, relationships, and commitments.

Once someone believes something, it’s typically hard for them to change their mind.

  * “The human mind works a lot like a human egg. When one sperm gets into a human egg, there’s an automatic shut-off device that bars any other sperm from getting in.”
  * Repeated exposures to the same belief reinforces it.



Behaviors are also hard to change. Anyone with a bad habit knows how hard changing behavior is, even when they know the habit is bad.

Behaviors and beliefs have an interesting way of reinforcing each other.

  * If you make big sacrifices in pursuit of a belief, this will intensify your devotion to that belief. How this works: your brain thinks, “I wouldn’t have made this big sacrifice if I _didn’t_ think this way. So since I made a big sacrifice, I must _really_ like this thing.”
  * If you act in a way that conflicts with an existing belief, you change your beliefs to accommodate the new behavior.
    * If you dislike someone, doing a favor for him will make you like that person more. Benjamin Franklin famously employed this technique, asking small favors of people who disliked him. Since disliking Franklin would be inconsistent with doing him a favor, people who did favors for him ended up liking him more.
    * Being forced to harm someone makes you dislike that person.



#### Why It Evolved

The brain optimizes energy efficiency. If you keep the same behavior and don’t question it, your brain conserves space and can make faster, simpler decisions.

On a social level, maintaining consistent behavior preserves social cohesion by maintaining social roles and responses. People stay loyal to their roles as citizens, soldiers, teachers, physicians, and so on, and other people can trust in their consistency.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Inconsistency-avoidance tendency locks in a behavior or idea, even if it’s bad for you. If you start off making a bad decision caused by other biases, then you can get locked into that decision.

  * For example, say doubt-avoidance tendency causes you to make a rash, bad decision. Inconsistency-avoidance tendency then perpetuates that bad decision, and you keep making bad decisions.
  * For example, say disliking tendency causes you to start disliking someone. Then, to minimize inconsistency and to avoid changing your mind, you see progressively fewer virtues about the person and more you dislike about the person, causing you to hate him more.



Because of how strong inconsistency-avoidance is, habits that form early can become a person’s destiny. For instance, pushing beliefs on children (such as political or religious beliefs) can be permanently damaging.

#### Examples

  * People tend to hold onto stocks for too long, whether they’ve risen or dropped in value.
  * Hazing rituals as initiation rites into groups strengthen the tie within the group. The new entrant thinks, “there’s no way I would have gone through that if I weren’t really into the group.”
  * In prisons, guards sometimes treat prisoners like animals, which causes retaliation from prisoners. To make their beliefs consistent with their actions, guards feel like they must hate the prisoners. This causes worse behavior and retaliation, and in turn perpetuates the cycle.
  * Even geniuses aren’t exempt from biases. Says Munger, “an older Einstein never accepted the full implications of quantum mechanics.”



#### Antidotes

Because of how strong inconsistency-avoidance is, the best way to avoid getting locked into bad habits is to avoid bad behaviors to begin with. Don’t start smoking or gambling, particularly in response to doubt or a problem (like unhappiness). An ounce of prevention is a pound of cure.

If you want to change your beliefs, force yourself to act in behaviors that contradict your beliefs. You will then have to correct your beliefs.

  * If you hate a political opponent, force yourself to know and like someone who follows the opponent. This will help you see the virtue in the other side and correct your hating tendency.
  * “Fake it til you make it”—picture the kind of person you want to be, and act like that person would. For example, think, “I’m the type of person who likes waking up and exercising.” If you act like this person would, your behavior will change your prior self-belief so that you eventually believe you become the type of person you want to be.



To avoid retrenching in your position, consider counterarguments to your position before making decisions. In fact, you should actively seek out opposition to your favorite ideas.

  * Jury trials force listening to both sides before making a verdict.
  * Stress-test your ideas with a trusted group of thinkers.



### 6: Curiosity Tendency

#### What It Is

Humans tend to be curious, even more so than monkeys and mammals.

Curiosity helps prevent bad consequences from other psychological tendencies. If you’re curious about what you’re missing, you can overcome biases like inconsistency-avoidance or liking tendency.

#### Why It Evolved

Curiosity likely helped early humans discover new food sources and other things that promoted survival.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Curiosity can be exploited by commercial products (Shortform note: like never-ending feeds in social media apps like Facebook or Tik Tok). These dopamine rewards in conjunction with inconsistency-avoidance tendency make the habit hard to extinguish.

#### Examples

Athens developed math and science out of curiosity, while the Romans focused on the practical engineering of mines, aqueducts, etc.

### 7: Kantian Fairness Tendency

Also known as: the Golden rule

#### What It Is

Humans follow behaviors that, if followed by all others, make the overall society benefit everybody.

  * Example: Letting people go first at stop signs and one-way bridges.



When such courtesies are withheld, the mistreated parties get very upset.

  * Example: You get angry when someone cuts in line.



#### Why It Evolved

When people reciprocate helpful behaviors with each other, everyone’s survival is benefited.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Excessive fairness can create systems that incentivize poor behavior.

  * Charlie mentions that workplace injury compensation schemes reward fraudulent injuries. He suggests having no workplace injury compensation, period.
  * Paying everyone the same amount regardless of output leads to productivity stagnation. Over time, productivity is dragged down to the lowest common denominator.



If you see someone violating Kantian fairness, you can hate or dislike them without understanding the underlying motives.

#### Antidotes

Design incentive schemes that leave fairness out of play and reward productivity.

  * In the Navy, if you run your ship aground, you’re dismissed as an officer. This isn’t fair in all circumstances, but it certainly prevents ships from being run aground.



### 8: Envy/Jealousy Tendency

#### What It Is

Envy is wanting something that someone else has.

Jealousy is fearing that what you have will be taken away.

#### Why It Evolved

Humans need food to survive, and seeing someone else have food if you don’t have any makes you want to take the food for yourself. In turn, having food makes you worry that it’ll be taken away by someone else.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

In conjunction with disliking/hating tendency, envy can lead to resentment and hate.

Even if other people act out of envy or jealousy, these are seen as childish emotions to have, so it’s taboo to accuse others of it when trying to resolve disagreements. Thus the problem goes unsolved.

“It is not greed that drives the world, but envy.”—Warren Buffett

#### Examples

  * Many people feel angry at the unequal distribution of wealth in capitalist society.
  * Siblings get jealous about their resources and attention from parents.



#### Antidotes

Kantian fairness tendency opposes the tendency to feel envy or jealousy.

Generally, be happy with what you have rather than calibrating to other people.

### 9: Reciprocation Tendency

Also known as: the foot-in-door technique.

#### What It Is

Humans reciprocate both favors and disfavors (or harm) done to them.

For example, psychological experiments show that asking someone for a huge favor (and getting rejected), then asking for a smaller favor increases the compliance rate, compared to asking for the small favor right away. This is because asking for a smaller favor looks like you’re making a concession, and the other person is willing to reciprocate.

  * In a specific example, asking people to supervise a group of juvenile delinquents on a zoo trip for one afternoon gets 1 out of 6 agreements. In contrast, asking people to supervise the group weekly for 2 years gets a 0% acceptance rate, but then lowering the request to just one afternoon of supervision gets the rate up to 50%.
  * The Watergate scandal purportedly began with such a reciprocation. One subordinate in the Republican Party pitched an extreme plan to scandalize the other party that consisted of prostitutes and a yacht. The plan was rejected; the subordinate conceded and asked merely for a burglary of the DNC, and the attorney general went along.



Reciprocation for disfavors done to you is also known as retaliation.

  * If we’re all of the same species, shouldn’t we help each other survive instead of retaliating against each other? Scientists who study ants find that different colonies fight each other, even if they’re of the same species. This suggests that there is no general genetic algorithm that lets people turn the other cheek just because it might help the species survive.



#### Why It Evolved

Reciprocating good behavior allows for group cooperation. Reciprocating bad behavior serves as a mutual deterrent from either party behaving badly.

#### How It Can Be Harmful

Your tendency to reciprocate favors can be exploited by manipulators. They’ll demonstrate a small favor to you, then ask for a big concession from you. For example, a car salesman might give you a free cup of coffee, which subconsciously prompts you to spend thousands of dollars more. This can be especially abused if you’re buying with someone else’s money, like an employer or the government, and thus won’t be as tight with your purse strings.

On the other side, harmful behaviors can be reciprocated to extremes, as in warfare. If one side adopts a take-no-prisoners attitude and kills every other enemy combatant, the other side will quickly adopt the same posture.

#### Examples

Examples of reciprocating good behavior:

  * Economic trade uses both self-interest and reciprocation.
  * Wars sometimes have bizarre pauses in fighting, when one side shows a favor to another.
  * Much religious behavior tries to reciprocate favor from the gods. Examples include a general emphasis in many religions on good deeds, or Aztec sacrifices.



Examples of reciprocating bad behavior:

  * Acting on road rage is reciprocating a perceived Kantian unfairness, such as when someone cuts in front of you.



#### Antidotes

To reciprocate good behavior more:

  * Feel guilt. Guilt arises from the conflict between self-interest and the tendency to reciprocate good behavior.
  * Look to please someone else first, rather than to be pleased.



To avoid retaliating:

  * Train yourself to defer reaction. You can always tell the person off tomorrow, if it’s such a good idea.



To avoid getting exploited for reciprocating favors:

  * Don’t let employees accept any favors from vendors.
  * Be cognizant of exploitative favors, like how car salesmen treat you, and try to discount that behavior (cynically, think, “he’s only doing this since I’m giving him money.”) Also, go into the negotiation with a hardline price so that little tricks don’t sway you.



### 10: Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency

#### What It Is

When two items are placed close together, the qualities of one item transfer to the other.

“You won’t see Coke advertised alongside some account of the death of a child.”

#### Why It Evolved

Associating rewards (food) with certain items that provide rewards (a landmark boulder, a big tree, a certain tribe member) helps survival.

Likewise, associating pain (illness) with neighboring items (vomit, feces) helps avoid those items

#### How It Can Be Harmful

The association between two items may be illusory.

  * A gambler who falsely associates winning with what he wore that day may develop silly superstitions, when the outcome is random.



Common associations can lead to harmful stereotypes that distort the truth.

  * People may generally discount old people as having low mental function; while this may be true in many cases, there are also plenty of counterexamples.



Persian Messenger syndrome happens when you kill the messengers who bring bad news, making the association between messengers and bad news. The messengers then learn to run and hide, instead of delivering bad news. (Munger notes CBS Chairman William Paley suffered from this habit, which caused him to live in a cocoon of unreality.)

Oddly, if you’re in a bad situation and being helped by someone, you might associate your misfortune with that person and thus dislike them.

  * Munger had a landlord friend named Glotz who gave below-market rents and college fellowships to his tenants. When he moved to tear down the building, a tenant rebuked him—“Glotz doesn’t need any more money. I know this because I was supported in college by Glotz fellowships.”



#### Examples

  * People associate high prices with quality, often because high-quality goods are more expensive. However, this opens the path to manipulation, where a low-quality good is deliberately sold at a high price to give the illusion of quality.
  * In advertising, attractive people are commonly used to feature a product.



#### Antidotes

When trying to unpack why something is successful, look for confounding factors that might distort your appraisal.

Don’t kill the messenger; reward her for bringing in problems early.

  * Berkshire Hathaway has a motto: “Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is only the good news that can wait.”



Combat classification stereotypes by remembering that the average does not determine the case in front of you.

  * Remember “the fellow who drowned in a river that averaged only eighteen inches deep.”
