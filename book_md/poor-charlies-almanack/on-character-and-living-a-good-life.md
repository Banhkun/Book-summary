## On Character and Living a Good Life

In all, Charlie Munger is said to be a man of solid character—hard-working, humble, and always learning. In his speeches, he talks often about the traits leading to a happy and productive life. We’ve synthesized the main themes here.

### Key Points of His Biography

The book has a brief biography of Charlie Munger. Here are bullet points:

  * Charlie grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, sharing the hometown with Warren Buffett. He worked for Buffett’s grandfather in his grocery store; Warren worked there a few years later.
  * Charlie liked raising hamsters and traded them with other kids. This was early practice in negotiating.
  * In high school, Munger was captain of his high school’s varsity rifle team.
  * He enrolled in University of Michigan to study math, but in 1943 left to serve in the military during World War II. 
  * He started his career as a lawyer. He was admitted to Harvard Law School without a bachelor’s degree and graduated in 1948.
  * He had 3 kids with his first wife Nancy Huggins, whom he divorced in 1953. His son Teddy died of leukemia soon after at the age of 9. He met Nancy Barry and married in 1956.
  * After law school, he joined a law firm, then founded a law firm in 1962, then built an investment firm called Wheeler, Munger, and Co. Over the years of 1962 to 1975, Munger’s firm generated annual returns of 19.8%, compared to 5% for the Dow.
  * Charlie returned to Omaha when his father died and met Warren Buffett at a dinner party. Buffett convinced Munger that law was a bad use of his talent.
  * Munger joined Berkshire Hathaway after deciding he didn’t want to manage funds directly for investors, and instead to build equity through a holding company. He liquidated Wheeler, Munger, and Co. in 1976. He had shares in Blue Chip Stamps and Diversified Retailing, which then converted into Berkshire Hathaway stock.



### How to Live Happily

  * Have low expectations.
  * Have a sense of humor
  * Surround yourself with the love of friends and family.
  * Figure out the lifestyle that you want most. You might indeed work eighty hours a week for fifteen years to make partner at a law firm, just to get the right to do more of the same. But if you don’t, this might not be the right life for you.
  * To get what you want, try to _deserve_ what you want.
  * Avoid self-pity. It’s counterproductive and doesn’t change your situation. If you don’t feel self-pity, you’ll have an advantage over many people, since it’s a common response. Munger had a friend who carried a stack of business cards, and when he heard a self-pitying comment, he’d give the person a card; the card read, “Your story has touched my heart. Never have I heard of anyone with as many misfortunes as you.”
  * Be around people you admire. Don’t work under someone you don’t want to be like.
  * Work hard. Munger likes the word “assiduity” because it informally means, “Sit down on your ass until you do it.”
  * Anticipate trouble. You’ll better know how to avoid it.



#### How to Live Miserably

Since one of Munger’s favorite strategies is to invert, think first about how to live miserably, then avoid doing that.

  * Ingest chemicals that alter your mood or perception to feel better.
  * Envy other people for what they have.
  * Resent people and hold grudges.
  * Be unreliable so no one depends on you.
  * Don’t learn from other people’s mistakes. Make every mistake yourself the first time.
  * Be as non-educated as you possibly can. Have zero curiosity to learn and improve.
  * When you get into a real battle in life, give up at the first opportunity.



### Moral Character and Honesty

Munger cares a lot about reputation—the reputation of Berkshire Hathaway, of its owned companies, and of himself. He desires integrity from people he works with and managers of companies he wants to acquire. Companies that have a trusted brand name have a competitive advantage that can persist over time. Trust takes a long time to build, and an instant to vanish.

  * “When you borrow a man’s car, you always return it with a full tank of gas.” People notice these little things.
  * Track records are important, and if you develop one in an integral trait like honesty, you’ll have a big advantage in the world.
  * You should be able to make plenty of money without getting anywhere close to the line of legal trouble. Often you’ll make more money by doing the right thing.
  * What’s the best way to have good friends and relationships? By deserving good friends and relationships by deserving it yourself.
  * “It's hard for an empty sack to stand upright.”—Benjamin Franklin
  * “Trickery and treachery are the practices of fools that have not the wits enough to be honest.”—Benjamin Franklin



#### Don’t Cheat

  * Warren Buffett hates CEOs who manipulate their financial statements with tricks like adjusted earnings and not counting stock as compensation. “A CEO who, as his company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, “What is two plus two?” The answer that won the assignment, of course, was, “What number do you have in mind?”—Warren Buffett, 2016 BRK shareholder letter
  * “If you mix raisins with turds, you’ve still got turds.” No accounting standards or degree of auditing can prevent unscrupulous managers from conducting fraud.
  * Munger hates the idea of adjusted earnings. “Every time you see the word EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization], you should substitute the words “bullshit earnings.”



### Charlie’s Parenting Style

Munger’s children contributed quotes in the book. They comment on his nature—hard-working, perpetually reading, and absent-minded. But they speak well of his lessons on character, good decision making, and discipline. All seem grateful for the parenting.

His son, Charles Munger Jr. shared a teaching strategy that Munger used. He told a parable, where someone faced an ethical problem. He gave two endings, a good version where someone chose the right path, and a downward spiral tale, where someone chose the wrong path and suffered an endless series of catastrophes. One tale involved a manager who had made an accounting mistake that resulted in big losses. In the correct version of the story, he went to his boss and told him about the mistake. His boss understood, thanking him for admitting to the mistake and forgiving him, also noting that had he tried to hide the mistake, he would have been fired immediately.

### Benefits of Old Age

Old age comes with declining physical health, but it comes with increased wisdom and comfort of a life well lived.

  * In the Trojan war of mythology, Agamemnon in the war on Troy "never once wished for ten more men with the strength of Ajax but, instead, wanted ten more with the wisdom of Nestor.”
  * “The best Armour of Old Age is a well-spent life preceding it; a Life employed in the Pursuit of useful Knowledge, in honourable Actions and the Practice of Virtue: in which he who labours to improve himself from his Youth, will in Age reap the happiest Fruits of them; not only because these never leave a Man, not even in the extremest Old Age; but because a Conscience bearing Witness that our Life was well-spent, together with the Remembrance of past good Actions, yields an unspeakable Comfort to the Soul.”—Cicero



### Work Hard on Good Work

Success doesn’t come without hard work.

  * Munger thinks that passion is more important than natural talent or brain power. Berkshire has many companies with people who are fanatics about their business.
  * Munger and Buffett are both famous for reading a lot. But reading isn’t enough—you need to have the courage to choose the right ideas and do good things with them.
  * Munger believes that McDonald’s is one of the most successful educational institutions in the world. It provides first jobs to millions of young people, many who have trouble in traditional education, and teaches them a valuable lesson—show up daily and do good work to succeed.
  * Munger once collaborated with a construction firm with two partners who made a simple agreement—”split the work equally, and when we’re behind, we will both work 14 hours a day, every day of the week, until we’re caught up.” Naturally, they succeeded and were admired.
  * "Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learns thoroughly.”—19th century biologist Thomas Henry Huxley



It’s also important to do meaningful work. An admirable person works on outcomes that she will not survive to see.

### Constant Learning

Munger and Buffett are both famous for their curiosity and their voracious reading.

  * “**In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time — none, zero.** You’d be amazed at how much Warren reads — and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I’m a book with a couple of legs sticking out.”
  * Munger’s friends note that he wants to understand everything to a fundamental level, to know what makes something tick.
  * **“You need to have a passionate interest in why things are happening.** That cast of mind, kept over long periods, gradually improves your ability to focus on reality. If you don’t have that cast of mind, you’re destined for failure even if you have a high I.Q.”
  * “Curiosity, concentration, perseverance, and self-criticism.”—Einstein
  * Spend each day trying to be a little smarter than when you woke up.



By reading, Munger learns new ways to see the world and gains new tools to solve problems with. This can mean discarding his previous favorite ideas.

  * **“When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool?”**
  * “If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.” –Epictetus



Munger is a particular fan of biographies. He likes tying a field’s big ideas to the real people who developed them. You can learn economics better if you think of Adam Smith as your friend.

#### How to Learn

Simply spending a lot of time learning won’t produce the best results. Ideally, you optimize _how_ you learn.

Munger believes that **the best lessons are learned through figuring things out yourself** , not from being spoonfed information.

  * “It’s kind of fun for it to be a little complicated. If you want it totally easy and laid out, maybe you should join some cult that claims to provide all the answers. If you figure it out and do the outlining yourself, the ideas will stick better than if you memorize ’em using somebody else’s cram list.”
  * People ask Munger often for the secrets to success. He finds this question a sign of a feeble mind and never wants to make it easy for the listener. Instead, people should derive their own tools for success—their checklists and character traits—and train them for the rest of their lives.
  * “It is not the possession of truth, but the success which attends the seeking after it, that enriches the seeker and brings happiness to him.”—Max Planck



#### Interdisciplinary Learning

Earlier we discussed Munger’s insistence on multidisciplinary learning. He argues that the way fighter pilots are trained is an exemplar for multidisciplinary learning overall. It includes six components:

  1. He gains a formal education that’s broad enough to cover everything needed in piloting.
  2. He gains a fluency of knowledge not just to pass academic tests, but to execute flawlessly, even in emergency situations.
  3. He’s often made to think in forward (what he wants to happen) as well as in reverse (how to avoid the outcomes he doesn’t want.
  4. He prioritizes his training time by focusing on the most important aspects to minimize damage. These most important aspects are trained to fluency.
  5. Checklists are mandatory to prevent errors and omissions.
  6. Even after initial training is complete, continued maintenance is mandatory. He uses the aircraft simulator to prevent atrophy of skills and to remember how to react to rare but critical problems.



Interdisciplinary learning enables problem-solving that crosses disciplines and allows for unconventional solutions. For example, suppose two old ladies inherit a shoe factory that makes branded shoes and have all sorts of business problems in quality control, supply chain, and management. How do you advise they solve their problem?

  * The typical answer is to hear their problems, then write up pages of consultation on how each one can be solved.
  * The correct answer is to advise they sell the company, because the problem is way out of their league.



(Shortform note: In a similar problem, in a Stanford MBA class, students were given $10 and told to maximize profits from it, then present for 10 minutes on what they did. Many students thought literally about the problem, using the $10 to buy cheap goods like water bottles and to resell them. Some clever students realized that the real value of their project was their time, which they sold by standing in line at restaurants and such. The winning team sold the 10 minute slot to a company who wanted to hire MBAs.

These problems might be solved by inverting the problem. For the two old ladies, how would you maximize the value to them at the end of the day? For the MBA problem, what are all the assets that you have available, and what can you do with them? What if you had $0 instead of $10?)

### Focus

Munger’s children and friends noted his ability to focus on the problem at hand. When he concentrates on a problem, he won’t even acknowledge someone who comes into his room.

Focus helps in business management too. General Electric CEO Jack Welch inherited a business that played in far too many fields, an approach he rejected: “To hell with it. We’re either going to be #1 or #2 in every field we’re in or we’re going to be out. I don’t care how many people I have to fire and what I have to sell. We’re going to be #1 or #2 or out.” (Shortform note: Steve Jobs would do the same to Apple when he returned, killing the many forms of unsuccessful devices to focus on only a handful, including the original iMac.)

### Partnering

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger’s partnership is one of the most famous in the business world. They both have nice things to say about each other.

Buffett considers Munger an invaluable ally who tests his own thinking: “Look for someone both smarter and wiser than you are. Ask him not to flaunt his superiority so that you may enjoy acclaim for many accomplishments that sprang from his thoughts and advice. Seek a partner who will never second-guess you nor sulk when you make expensive mistakes. Look also for a generous soul who will put up his own money and work for peanuts. Finally, join with someone who will constantly add to the fun as you travel a long road together.”

Munger joined Berkshire Hathaway as a second-in-command rather than an equal partner. Given that he had run his own investment firm before joining, others were surprised, but he didn’t mind it. “There are some people that it is okay to be a subordinate partner to...there are always people who will be better at something than you. You have to learn to be a follower before you become a leader.”

A funny story: Buffett would often call Munger to discuss a deal, and Munger would often respond in shock, pointing out any number of risks. After discussing them through, Buffett would usually admit that Munger was right and turn down the deal. But once in a while, Buffett would say that he was going to go forward with the deal anyway. And at some points, Munger would show how he really felt when he responded, “Warren, if you do it, could I have a percentage of it?”
