## Miscellaneous Ideas

To conclude the book guide, we’ll cover a variety of topics mentioned through _Poor Charlie’s Almanack_ that didn’t fit cleanly into the previous chapters.

### Being Persuasive

If you want people to do something, often asking them to do it won’t get the best results. You may have to **take a more oblique path, especially leveraging the psychological biases we covered**. We’ll cover two examples.

First, Munger gives the example of Captain Cook, who knew his sailors suffered from scurvy. He learned that Dutch ships had less scurvy, and also noticed that they ate lots of sauerkraut (which, possibly unknown to him, contained vitamin C). But tough, ornery English sailors were unlikely to eat sauerkraut, given the rivalry with the Germans and Dutch. Cook also knew he couldn’t tell them to eat sauerkraut to prevent scurvy, since this would tip them into thinking the voyage would be so long they had to mutiny instead. So he relied on social proof and exclusivity—he gave sauerkraut to the officers’ table only, but not to the main crew. The crew looked on enviously, until Cook relented, allowing the crew to eat sauerkraut one day a week. Soon he had the entire crew eating sauerkraut happily.

Second, suppose you’re advising clients who are prone to breaking laws and committing fraud. You have two typical options: 1) decide to quit and not work for him any further, 2) decide that you’re not morally culpable given that he’s doing the cheating, and acquiesce to work for the sake of your mortgage. Instead, Munger argues for a more convincing third option—appeal to his self-interest. Tell him that he can’t commit his widespread fraud without other people knowing about it, and so he’s making himself vulnerable to blackmail and scandal, which will ruin his company, his money, and his family. Appealing to self-interest can often work far better than rationalization.

(Shortform note: For more on appealing to a person’s self-interest, check out the advice in the classic How to Win Friends & Influence People.)

Psychological tricks like this can be powerful, but there is a line at which it can become immoral. And if you do this too transparently, using tools that the other person is aware of, he won’t trust you again.

### Problems with Soft Sciences

Munger believes that the most fundamental disciplines—say, math and physics—are much more rigorous than the soft sciences like economics and psychology. The soft sciences tend to be unorganized in their thinking and relish in complexity instead of elegant fundamentals.

Munger argues that soft sciences should integrate the ethos of hard sciences:

  * They should rank disciplines in order of fundamentalness, and use them in that order.
  * They should try to explain things in the fewest fundamental principles possible.
  * If the existing principles don’t explain the phenomena, new principles can be devised, but they should first be reconciled with the old principles or the old principles should be disproved.



#### Problems with Economics

For all its achievements, the field of economics has several key problems that limit their ability to explain the world.

  * It has what Munger calls “physics envy”—economists crave precision in their models and predictions, which leads to questionable principles like the idea that agents behave perfectly rationally in markets. They also overuse the statistical techniques they learn.
  * They thus tend to ignore elements of real human behavior, such as biases and vices. For instance, envy is a strong reason people spend money, and yet there is no way to integrate envy into economic models.



(Shortform note: The field of behavioral economics was a major effort to mix human psychology into economics and explain why people don’t act rationally in many situations. Read more about behavioral economics in our guide to Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

#### Problems with Psychology

Psychologists have described a lot of useful ideas in biases and behavior, but the ideas tend to be isolated in siloes rather than unified in elegant models. As Munger says, psychology is in a state “like electromagnetism after Faraday, but before Maxwell —a lot has been discovered, but no one mind has put it all together in proper form.”

Part of the problem is that psychology, in an effort to become a rigorous, respected discipline, engages in narrow, specific experiments that test a single idea so that the experiments are repeatable. This, however, ignores the complexity of real situations that involve multiple factors, like in Munger’s lollapaloozas.

Another problem is that Munger, to put it bluntly, believes that psychologists simply aren’t the smartest academics. The really talented people pursue hard fields like physics and math. After all, why would a very talented person with her choice of fields pick psychology, a field where the effects awkwardly grow weaker as people learn more about them (as in the case of biases)? Furthermore, what of the troubling idea that people are often happier when believing things that aren’t true?

### Munger’s Sense of Humor

Throughout his speeches, Munger shows his wry sense of humor, which allows him to state otherwise controversial opinions in palatable ways. Here’s a sample of quotes (read the full speeches for more):

  * “I'm right, and you’re smart, and sooner or later you'll see I’m right.”
  * On the importance of math: “If you don’t get this elementary, but mildly unnatural, mathematics of elementary probability into your repertoire, then you go through a long life like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.”
  * “The fun never stops. I suppose that it does stop eventually when you’re drooling in the convalescent home at the end.”
  * On investing in new technology: “The company that needs a new machine tool, and hasn’t bought it, is already paying for it.”
  * On hiring professors with extreme political ideologies: itit “made regain of objectivity almost as unlikely as regain of virginity.”
  * “I don't use formal projections. I don’t let people do them for me because I don’t like throwing up on the desk.”
  * On accountants who set up an incentive structure that rewarded destructive lending practices: “These people became the equivalent of an armored car cash-carrying service that suddenly decided to dispense with vehicles and have unarmed midgets hand-carry its customers’ cash through slums in open bushel baskets.”
  * “To say accounting for derivatives in America is a sewer is an insult to sewage.”
