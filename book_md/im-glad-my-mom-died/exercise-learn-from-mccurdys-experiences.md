## Exercise: Learn From McCurdy’s Experiences

 _I’m Glad My Mom Died_ describes behaviors associated with many mental health issues and psychological conditions, from hoarding to narcissism to alcohol use disorder. Consider how to apply McCurdy’s experiences with these problems to your own life.

* * *

Do you recognize yourself or anyone you know in any of the patterns of behavior McCurdy describes (for example, excessive drinking, binging and purging, or frequent emotional outbursts)? If so, describe the specific behaviors you’ve observed in yourself or others.

What have you learned about these patterns of behavior from reading this guide (for example, causes, effects, terminology, or symptoms)?

What will you do differently in reference to these behaviors as a result of reading this guide (for example, stop shaming yourself when you make a mistake, stop trying to change an emotionally abusive friend or family member, go to therapy, learn to set boundaries, or try journaling your feelings)?
