## Introduction | Chapters 1-2

_The Go-Giver_ by Bob Burg and John David Mann is a business parable that contradicts the notion that to be successful in business you need to be a go-getter, a competitive hard-charger focused on getting new clients and making ever-bigger deals. Instead, the authors contend you should**make _giving_ rather than _getting_ your first priority in business and in life—and success will follow**. Becoming a “go-giver” means giving value to others, not as a strategy or _quid pro quo,_ but as a way of leading a satisfying life.

In the parable—in which a mentor puts a frustrated go-getter on the true path to success and fulfillment—the authors explain why and how to become a go-giver by practicing the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success.

(Shortform note: To help readers navigate the story without losing sight of the principles, we’ve summarized the storyline, main characters, and five laws at the beginning for easy reference. A chapter-by-chapter summary and exercises then follow.)

### The Storyline

Joe, a go-getter at Clason-Hill Trust Corporation, was having a bad third quarter. He lost a contract that was up for renewal and failed to land a new account he had hoped for. As a last-ditch effort to gain an edge, he scheduled a meeting with a wealthy business consultant, who he hoped would help him connect with and influence clients.

The consultant, identified only as Pindar or The Chairman, shared his counterintuitive “trade secret” for success: **the more you give, the more you have**. He agreed to teach Joe how to practice it via Five Laws of Stratospheric Success on the condition that Joe apply each law the day he learned it. Each day for a week, Pindar arranged for Joe to meet a successful person who embodied one of the laws of success. Day by day, Joe found the lessons changing his life in ways he never imagined.

### The Five Laws of Stratospheric Success

  1. **The Law of Value** : How much more you give others in value than you receive in payment defines your worth.
  2. **The Law of Compensation** : Your income depends on how many people you serve and how well you serve them.
  3. **The Law of Influence** : Your influence (social capital) is determined by the extent to which you put others’ interests first.
  4. **The Law of Authenticity** : The most important thing you can offer is yourself.
  5. **The Law of Receptivity** : For effective giving, be open to receiving.



### The Characters

**Joe** : a go-getter at Clason-Hill Trust Corporation who was struggling to meet his quarterly goals.

**Gus** : Joe’s senior colleague at Clason-Hill, who served as a sounding board. He also turned out to be the mysterious character in the story known as “the Connector,” who brought the other characters together in profitable deals.

**Carl Kellerman** : a corporate broker who was looking for the right firm to handle a big account. Joe desperately wanted the account but didn't get it.

**Neil Hansen** : a competitor of Joe’s who got the Kellerman client account.

**Jim Galloway** : a lawyer representing a multinational company whose contract with Joe’s company was up for renewal. Because Jim’s client decided to switch to a firm with stronger overseas connections, Joe lost the account.

**Pindar** : a wealthy, connected business consultant known as The Chairman (his full name isn’t given), who taught Joe his formula for success.

**Rachel** : Pindar’s personal chef, who served the numerous business associates who came to his home. With Pindar’s help, she laid the groundwork to start her own business, Rachel’s Famous Coffee.

**Ernesto Iafrate** : the owner of commercial real estate and a hugely successful chain of Italian restaurants, who started as the owner of a hot dog stand. He embodied the Law of Value.

**Nicole Martin** : a former elementary school teacher, now CEO of Learning Systems for Children Inc., a global maker of educational software. She embodied the Law of Compensation.

**Sam Rosen** : a financier and owner of Liberty Life Insurance and Financial Services, who helped the other characters finance their businesses. He embodied the Law of Influence.

**Debra Davenport** : the city’s most successful seller of residential and commercial real estate. She embodied the Law of Authenticity.

### The Trade Secret

Joe’s first meeting with Pindar occurred on a Saturday at Pindar’s impressive stone mansion overlooking the city. They conferred over a cup of “Rachel’s famous coffee,” served by Pindar’s personal chef Rachel. Joe complimented the excellent coffee and Pindar noted that he’d been encouraging her to open a chain of coffee shops because her coffee was too good not to share. Joe responded that Rachel could “make a killing” by selling her coffee.

However, Pindar replied that he had a different definition of success. He’d been talking about Rachel “sharing” her coffee, which was different from making a lot of money from it. **While there’s nothing wrong with making money, it’s not what makes you successful**. Instead, he said, his “trade secret” for success was giving.

Joe, like most people, was getting things backward—people wrongly strive to get something before giving something. This is as foolish as wanting to get heat from a fireplace before adding logs, or wanting interest from a bank before making a deposit. Pindar argued that instead, successful people focus on giving—and that creates success.

When Joe commented that focusing on giving would encourage people to take advantage of you, Pindar observed that you get what you expect or focus on. Most people see the world as a competitive, dog-eat-dog place, where people may treat you politely, but everyone is out for themselves. When they expect conflict or expect people to take advantage of them, that’s what happens. However, if they focus on the best in people, others’ negative behavior has less impact on them. In other words, **people have a big say in what happens to them**.

Joe was skeptical but also intrigued, and Pindar promised to share his Five Laws of Stratospheric Success, starting the next day with the Law of Value. They would meet with a major real estate entrepreneur, who would explain it.
