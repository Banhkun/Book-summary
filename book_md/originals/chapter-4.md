## Chapter 4: Fools Rush In - Timing, Strategic Procrastination, and the First-Mover Disadvantage

This Originals chapter deals with three loosely related themes on the benefits of waiting: procrastinating, the myth of first-mover advantage, and innovation at older ages.

**The Creative Benefits of Procrastinating**

The consensus around productivity states that procrastinating is a disease that should be stamped out, that we should always plan our work on timelines and get a head start.

But **procrastination is useful to avoid too early of a commitment to an idea**. If you lodge a problem in the back of your mind and give it time to marinate, you attack it from a variety of angles. You consider it in relaxed states, free from time pressure, which allows divergent thinking (hence the pattern of coming up with best ideas in the shower or on the toilet). You make incremental progress by testing and refining different possibilities.

By procrastinating, you also allow for greater input from your colleagues. If you decide early and set a strict timeline, there’s little strategic flexibility.

Then, as you near the deadline, you assemble the breadth of options you’ve considered, and then you can then focus down on the best one.

Importantly, for procrastination to have these creative benefits, you need to be intrinsically motivated to solve the problem. Procrastinating when you hate the problem and feel little urge to solve it likely doesn’t end up with better ideas.

(Shortform note: You might also get the best of both worlds through structured creativity - enforce a timeline of activities that will take you to your deadline, but force yourself to have midpoint brainstorming to broaden your possibilities.)

**The Myth of First-Mover Advantage**

An entrepreneurial myth is that the first mover will seize the spoils. Businesses that move first should seize brand recognition, gain size quickly, and ward off new entrants. The myth is also confounded by its truth in select industries, like patent filing priority and academic publications, both requiring novelty.

The data suggest otherwise **\- “pioneer” companies failed at a rate of 47%, compared to “settler” companies at 8%**. Furthermore, pioneers captured just 10% of market share, compared to 28% for settlers. (Shortform note: To be specific, from the original paper, failure means the end of sales for a product. It wasn’t clear if the market share was only for surviving pioneers, or also included failed pioneers (thus counting as 0% share).)

Settler companies benefit from the path that pioneers pave, by:

  * Improving upon the technology of pioneers. Settlers often don’t just imitate the pioneer - they introduce something novel that causes customers to switch over. Instead of exploring broadly about what the customer wants, the settler can focus more narrowly how to provide superior quality and value.
  * Being able to strike when the timing is right. **Pioneers introduce a new concept, but the world may not yet be ready for it.** Settlers can nurture that same concept and unleash it when the conditions are more hospitable.
  * Avoiding the overcommitment of pioneers. With no one to guide them and the first-mover-advantage myth propelling them, pioneers are tempted to overextend to seize market share and ward off new entrants. However, this can cause them to overestimate the market and prematurely optimize, eventually leading to death. 
  * Avoiding getting entrenched in the status quo and responding better to shifting customer preferences.



Further, the types of people that start pioneer vs settler companies may differ. Pioneer founders may tend to be excessively risk-seeking and impulsive. **Risk-controlling entrepreneurs may have better chances**(remember from Chapter 1 how many famous founders started their companies while employed in their day job?)

Notable exceptions to this are businesses that are protected from new entrants by patents, and businesses that benefit from network effects. (Shortform note: But remember that even Facebook was a latecomer to the social network scene, toppling earlier Myspace and Friendster.)

**Innovation at Older Ages**

Is it impossible to innovate at older ages? Grant argues, it depends on what type of innovation you practice.

Innovation seems to happen in two modes: conceptual and experimental.

_Conceptual innovators_ resemble the stereotypical brilliant young mathematician, who comes up with a groundbreaking insight. Conceptual innovation tends to happen earlier in age since the youngster is unfettered by custom and dogma. They have fresh perspectives. However, age becomes a curse. **As this person gains experience, her thinking becomes more codified.** She becomes part of the establishment, unable to regain the plastic radicalism of her youth. Einstein opposed the new disruptive theory of quantum mechanics in his later age.

_Experimental innovators_ instead solve problems through trial and error, tweaking continuously and improving. Instead of setting out on a single plan, experimenters have no end goal in mind, and may stumble on great ideas. This benefits from time, since you’re able to generate a greater count of ideas and experiments as you age. (This echoes Adam Grant’s earlier point about coming up with great ideas by generating more ideas prolifically.)

Experimental innovators are more likely to continue innovating at older ages.
