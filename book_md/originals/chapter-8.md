## Chapter 8: Rocking the Boat and Keeping it Steady - Managing Anxiety, Apathy, Ambivalence, and Anger

When espousing original ideas, you’ll face opposition, setbacks, and anxiety about failure. How do you best cope with this?

The final chapter of Originals teaches a variety of tactics to manage uncertainty and anger. The better you can manage your emotions, the more effectively you’ll push your original ideas.

**The Benefits of Pessimism**

People seem to deal with stress and uncertainty in two ways - strategic optimism and defensive pessimism. Strategic optimists reinforce the belief that things will work out; defensive pessimists predict the worst that could happen in excruciating detail.

The popular belief is that optimism is preferable, but studies suggest that defensive pessimists do not perform worse than optimists. Despite having more anxiety and less confidence, **pessimists visualize all the things that could go wrong, and by controlling their risk, they feel in control**. They don’t become paralyzed by fear - once they’ve imagined the worst, they’re driven to avoid it. In a state of anxiety, uncertainty is actually worse than fear or failure. If you want to sabotage a defensive pessimist, just make her happy.

More subtly, optimism and pessimism are optimal with different levels of commitment. When uncommitted to a particular action, defensive pessimism can be destructive - you visualize the failure conditions and can paralyze. It’s better to be optimistic about your chances and reconsider the reasons you’re doing it. Once you’ve committed to an action, it’s better to think defensively and confront them directly.

**Framing Your Emotions**

Anxiety and excitement provoke the same sympathetic nervous system responses - elevated heart rate, shaking, faster breathing. How you feel about it can change your performance.

In short, telling yourself “I am nervous” makes you perform worse than when you tell yourself “I am excited.” The former reinforces that you’re afraid and applies the brakes. The latter recognizes your uncertainty, but propels you forward.

**Strength in Numbers**

When working on controversial ideas, there is strength in numbers. “The first follower transforms a lone nut into a leader.”

No one wants to be the lone dissenter, castigated by all. In the famous Asch experiments, people who worked independently made errors was less than 1%. When confederates unanimously gave the wrong answer, 37% of responses became incorrect. 75% of participants gave at least one incorrect answer. But when a single confederate dissented, the error rate dropped down to 5.5 %.

Make people feel less alone when supporting an unpopular idea. In dictatorship overthrows in the Middle East, dissenters guarded their opinions, scared of being disappeared if they became too public vocally. To combat this:

  * The rebellion strategists used public symbols of closed fists to give the impression that other rebels existed, even if they weren’t publicly visible.
  * Instead of outward public dissent, they organized peaceful protest signals, like turning their lights on and off at a predetermined time, or carrying their TVs in wheelbarrows. 



**Outsourcing Inspiration**

When communicating the vision of your company or organization, **bring in the people affected by your work, rather than relying solely on the company leaders**. An experiment related to college fundraisers showed that bringing in a student who benefited from scholarships raised motivation and funds raised significantly.

Similarly, when the Skype founder stressed the need for video calls on a tight timeline, the team questioned the technical feasibility and felt anxious. But they framed the problem around connecting people. Each week they brought in people whose lives were made possible only by Skype - a couple who rekindled their relationship, a serviceman who was with his family virtually over Christmas. This transformed anxiety to excitement.

**Miscellaneous Tactics**

**Strike Urgency:** People don’t just need a reason to act - they need a reason to act _now_. Environmental campaigns were more successful when they conveyed a sense of urgency. Without urgency, people won’t make the needed sacrifices.

**Hijack Loss Aversion:** Loss aversion is an irrational bias toward weighing losses of an amount more heavily than gains of the same amount. Instead of presenting your arguments as gains, message them as potential losses. For instance, for climate change, emphasize not the gain of sustainable energy, but rather the loss of millions of homes through coastal elevations.

**Red Team Attacks** : Instead of directing people to come up with innovative ideas to defend the company, direct them to imagine they’re outsiders hellbent on destroying the company. This shifts their mindset to consider the most vulnerable attack positions, rather than making incremental improvements on what already exists. This also triggers loss aversion energy, making them realize the potential for losing the company.

**Emphasize What’s Wrong with the Present:** To drive people out of apathy, cultivate dissatisfaction or anger at the current state of affairs. Make the gap between the status quo and what-could-be as large as possible. Great orators employ this technique. In loss aversion terms, this makes it a guaranteed loss.

**Controlling Anger:** Anger is a powerful motivator. How do you best channel it - do you vent, redirect, or slow down? Adam Grant suggests that venting - like hitting a punching bag while imagining your target’s face - causes you to obsess over the target of your anger without making any headway on feeling better. Merely distracting your anger - like hitting a punching bag without picturing the face - or taking 2 minutes to sit quietly are more productive. Even better, focus on the victim of the injustice (if it’s not you) - fight on behalf of other people to rid injustice and create a better system.
