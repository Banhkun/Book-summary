## Chapter 3: Out on a Limb - Speaking Truth to Power

Once you have an idea, you’ll likely need to bring other people onboard, whether as investors or teammates. How do you become most persuasive?

**First, you have to earn status to exert power.** Status is earned through real contributions, credibility, and reputation. Earning status gives you “idiosyncracy credits,” or the latitude to deviate from norms.

  * (This also seems to work in reverse - college professors who dress casually are accorded more authority than those who don’t. A student infers that the casual professors have earned their idiosyncracy, whereas the formal dressers need to work harder to compensate for lack of authority.)



In contrast, if you try to exert power without status, you will be resented as speaking out of turn. You’ll also be punished, since you challenge others’ authority and they seek to put you back in your place. (An interesting study shows that research subjects who are told their peer looks down on them make the peer do more degrading tasks, compared to those who are told their peer admires them.)

Second, **if you’re likely to get a skeptical, defensive reaction, try powerless communication**. Many people, when threatened, try to bluff their way through it. They flash badges of authority, present only the best evidence, and hide their weaknesses. This actually evokes the opposite reaction - you feel like you’re trying too hard, and you must be hiding something.

Instead, do the opposite - **express doubt and _highlight_ weaknesses**. Tell your audience why your idea might fail; signal that you don’t know everything. This makes listeners more receptive to your ideas because:

  * It lowers their defenses. Hostile listeners are aware that someone is trying to persuade them, and unbridled optimism seems too sales-y and dishonest. If you attack yourself, the listener is content that his points are addressed and is put into a more constructive mindset.
  * It makes you appear smarter. Presenters who don’t explicitly consider counter-arguments seem to have done only a cursory analysis. By pointing out possible weaknesses, you don’t look naive.
  * You seem more trustworthy. You seem honest and modest, instead of a trickster trying to deceive the audience.
  * It puts the listener in a position to help, not to attack. Seeing weaknesses automatically makes one consider how to overcome them. Furthermore, the listener is biased to like her own favorite solutions to the ideas, making the weaknesses seem more surmountable.
  * It itemizes the weaknesses. If you show your 8 greatest weaknesses and only 2 of them seem really serious, it doesn’t seem like a bad situation after all - “there are only 2 weaknesses!” 
    * This is more effective than focusing on just your 1 big weakness, since the listener is left wondering what other problems lurk under the surface.
  * Through recency bias, it becomes harder for the listener to come up with novel weaknesses. The ones you’ve presented are fixated on.



Third, **speak to the top and bottom of the totem pole.** People in different social levels have varying receptivity to new ideas. People at the top have a secure enough position that they can tolerate risk and champion new ideas. People at the bottom have little to lose and much to gain from joining high-risk, high-reward projects.

In contrast, **middle managers are the most conservative**. They’ve fought their way up to where they are and want to keep going; a fall back down to where they started is painful. They’ll be less willing to rock the boat.

(Similarly, if you seek the best ideas from people, get them from the top and bottom of the pole.)

Similarly, **bias toward communicating with disagreeable people**. Despite being less pleasant to work with, disagreeable people speak their mind and are more open to new ideas. They care more about improving the organization than about ignoring its shortcomings. They are less likely to care about personal status and see new ideas as threats. Agreeable people tend to do the opposite.

Finally, **expose the new idea repeatedly**. When you’ve thought about an idea endlessly for days, you lose the ability to empathize with a first-time listener. **You underestimate how much exposure is needed to get a new audience to buy into your ideas.**

Instead, repeat your idea over and over again. Studies suggest that liking continues to increase over 10-20 exposures. **Exposures are more effective when short and mixed with other ideas.** Furthermore, delay the initial introduction of the idea and its evaluation - pitch an idea briefly to your boss on Monday, then ask for feedback at the end of the week.

Why does this work? **Repeated ideas become more familiar, and more familiar ideas provoke less defensive reactions.** Repeated ideas are also easier to recall, and because of recall bias, people are more receptive to things they can recall more easily. (Studies show that senior managers undercommunicate critical ideas by a factor of 10.)

> **Supporting Example**
> 
> In this chapter of Originals, Adam Grant uses the experience of Carmen Medina in the CIA. As a young employee, she was an early advocate of Internet-based intelligence sharing, but this was rejected for security concerns. With her career at risk, she decided to take a less risky job in information security. Here she built credibility by getting the job done and earned idiosyncracy credits. She found support at the extremes of the totem pole - a champion in her manager and young ambitious recruits who were excited by the mission. She exposed the idea multiple times by writing short commentaries. Eventually, she was given the resources to start a CIA wiki, and it became a widely used tool.
> 
> Females and racial minorities have special trouble when presenting new ideas - they're more expected to keep to their place and seen as violating gender/race stereotypes when bucking the trend. To counteract this bias, it's most effective to be viewed as espousing an idea on behalf of someone else or the mission, not for oneself. It's also more important for minorities to earn status before exercising power.
> 
> The silver lining: when minorities do earn status, they seem to earn a reputation premium over white men, since they are assumed to be unusually talented to overcome the barriers to earn their spot.

Fun fact: in Apple, the Macintosh team granted an annual award to one person who challenged Steve Jobs. This was a good way of promoting speaking truth to power and getting good ideas from everywhere.
