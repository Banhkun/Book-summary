## 1-Page Summary

Idea generation

  * To generate good new ideas, **the most important factor is to generate lots of ideas**. Some of them will naturally be good. Don’t try to perfect a few mediocre ideas. 
    * Edison had thousands of patents and Mozart had thousands of pieces, only a handful of which are broadly remembered today.
  * As a habit, question why things are the way they are, and how they could be better. This lets you see the world in a different way and spot great ideas.
  * Broaden your experiences and look to orthogonal fields for inspiration. This facilitates lateral thinking and avoids incremental improvements on what you already know.
  * You’re a terrible judge of your own ideas. You overestimate your abilities. Instead, **test your ideas with believable colleagues, and with your target audience**.
    * Colleagues have the benefit of domain expertise without a personal stake in your idea.
    * Listen to the feedback you get - don’t get defensive or biased.
  * Procrastination has benefits of avoiding premature optimization. If you lodge a problem in the back of your mind and give it times to marinate, you attack it from a variety of angles and mindsets.



Executing on a new idea

  * First-mover advantage is largely a myth. Companies tend to overestimate the value of novelty, and underestimate the value of taking an existing idea and making it better. 
    * “Settler” companies have the benefit of learning from “pioneer” companies’ costly mistakes, like creating products that customers don’t want.
    * Notable exceptions are where network effects and intellectual property (like patents) apply.
  * Originals don’t necessarily take extreme, uncontrolled risks - rather, they build a balanced risk portfolio, with one foot rooted in stability and the other with more radical risks.
    * For example, many entrepreneurs kept their day jobs while working on their new ideas in free time.



Building new ideas in organizations

  * To push an unpopular idea through an organization, you need to have earned sufficient status and “idiosyncracy credits.” Without this social currency, others will resent you for exerting power without having earned the authority.
    * If you don’t have the status to push an idea through with force, don’t overcompensate by projecting confidence. Instead, practice powerless communication. You’ll lower the listener’s defenses, seem more trustworthy, and appear more analytical.
  * To recruit people, speak to the top and bottom of the totem pole. Senior people are confident in their status and willing to take risks; newcomers are able to take high-risk high-reward bets.
    * Middle managers have too much to lose and are thus conservative.
  * Repeat your idea over and over again. The more familiar it becomes, the easier it becomes to swallow.
    * Don’t build up to a single massive presentation with an immediate vote at the end. Instead, leak the idea in bits and pieces, 
  * To build a movement around a new idea, it needs to be radical enough to stand for something and attract strong missionaries, but not be so radical that it alienates the bulk of potential followers.
    * Grant argues that if “Occupy Wall Street” had instead been branded “the 99%,” it would have had much more enduring success due to less extreme tactics.



Nurturing new ideas in organizations

  * Groupthink stifles new ideas and dissent. Groupthink can originate from a calcified culture that is overconfident about its beliefs; punishing actively dissenting voices and relying on confirmation bias.
  * Encourage culture values of surfacing non-consensus opinions and transparency.
    * Bridgewater and Ray Dalio’s Principles are a good model for this.
  * To have more constructive disagreements, don’t _assign_ a devil’s advocate. These people aren’t fully sincere when arguing the other side, and the opposition knows it. Instead, _discover_ the true devil’s advocate to push the other side.



Childcare

  * To cultivate originality in children, lower the number of rules you enforce, and justify the rationale behind the rules.
  * Generally, lower-born children _tend_ to be more rebellious and original. 
    * This stems from niche selection (older children take the achievement, rule-abiding niche, and younger children differentiate by breaking the mold) and from parents relaxing their rules as they gain parenting experience.
    * However, variation among individuals and environments usually outweighs the general population-level trends, so this is certainly not prescriptive.
  * Notably, child prodigies tend not to be hugely influential. They’re very good at mastering the rules of the game, but not good at inventing totally new games.
