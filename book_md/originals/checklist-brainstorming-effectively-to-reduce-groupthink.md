## Checklist: Brainstorming Effectively to Reduce Groupthink

Refer to this checklist the next time you need to practice brainstorming.

  * Stress how the group shouldn’t be overconfident about their position. Try to feel like an underdog, and be worried about what you’re missing.
  * Don’t worry about restricting criticism - dissenting opinions are useful. 
  * Discover true believers for the opposite side. Invite them to the discussion, instead of just assigning a devil’s advocate.
  * Force the group to rank order the alternatives, instead of just picking the best one.
