## Exercise: Establish Your Voice

One of the most important aspects of writing is establishing a voice. Use Handley’s advice to create a strong voice for your writing.

* * *

First, identify the purpose of your writing: What are you trying to accomplish with this piece, what’s its main idea, and why should it matter to your audience?

Now, list four adjectives that describe how you want your audience to hear you. Consider things like how formal you want to sound, whether or not you want your voice to be humorous, and how much emotion you want it to have.

Finally, elaborate on those adjectives by turning them into descriptive sentences about your voice. Write one sentence for each adjective. (A sentence might be: “I’m intelligent and can help my reader overcome their challenges.”)
