## 1-Page Summary

All of us have to write, whether it be for work, school, or communication. Fortunately, writing is more of a skill than a talent, and we can implement techniques to improve our writing in any format. In _Everybody Writes_ , **Ann Handley offers a comprehensive guide to writing everything you need to write in today’s business world.** The book’s main focus is on writing for marketing purposes, but many of the principles can be applied to other types of writing as well.

Ann Handley is a bestselling author, speaker, and digital marketer. Alongside fellow writer and marketing consultant C.C. Chapman, Handley has co-authored another book about content creation and marketing, _Content Rules_. _Everybody Writes_ was originally published in 2014, and this revised and expanded edition was published in 2022.

This guide will first discuss what makes for high-quality writing, exploring how to make your writing useful, creative, and reader-centric. We’ll also look at how to create a brand voice and adapt it to different formats. Finally, we’ll look in-depth at Handley’s recommended process for writing the best content for every situation. We’ll also supplement Handley’s advice with tips from other writers and examine the psychology behind why Handley’s tips are effective.

### What Makes Good Writing?

In the age of the internet, words (specifically, written words) are our means of connecting with the world and other people. **Handley says that great writing comes from the following three ingredients: its usefulness to your audience, its foundation in creativity or data, and its connection with your audience.**

(Shortform note: In _On Writing Well_ , William Zinsser also argues that good writing comes from three elements, but the elements he identifies are simplicity, clarity, and identity. While Handley also recommends simple and clear writing that conveys a unique voice or identity, she sees these as smaller elements that align more with general writing rules than with the main ingredients for high-quality writing.)

Handley emphasizes that if any of these is missing or insufficient, your writing won't be high-quality. Let’s look at each ingredient in turn.

#### Usefulness to Your Audience

Handley points out that **your writing must help your reader in some way.** Your content should be clear and specific, and it should let your audience know what problem of theirs you’re going to solve.

(Shortform note: In _To Sell Is Human_ , Daniel Pink argues that helping your audience identify their problem or need is more important than solving it. He says that if they already know what their problem is, they can solve it themselves without buying your product, but if you work with them to identify the problem, the audience will be open to using your solution. Applying this to Handley’s advice, consider writing content that attracts readers who have a specific problem rather than focusing solely on offering a solution.)

Before you start writing, establish the purpose of what you’re writing by identifying 1) what you’re trying to accomplish, 2) what the main idea is, and 3) why it matters to your audience (also known as the “so what?” factor).

For example, say you’re writing a product description for a new supplement your company is selling. What you’re trying to accomplish with this content is to convince people to buy the product. The main idea will be what the product is—say, a supplement for relieving muscle tension and pain. Why it matters to your audience, then, is that they can improve their overall health and mobility by using your product.

(Shortform note: You may recognize some of these tips from your high school English teacher’s instructions on how to write a good thesis statement. Many of the lessons you had on writing essays can be applied directly to your marketing writing as well. For example, as you may have learned in high school, you should make your main idea and “so what?” factor specific, assertive, and accurate.)

#### Grounding in Creativity and Data

In addition to being useful to your reader, your writing should be creative _and_ factually accurate. According to Handley, writing that’s creative stands out more to the reader than writing that’s purely clinical because creative writing evokes emotions, which connect to readers more than rationality does. To evoke emotions, write so that **your reader can see themselves reflected in your content.** You can do so by telling your reader a story or appealing to their senses like sight and smell.

Using our supplement example, you could include a success story in your marketing about a grandfather who was suffering from chronic muscle pain and found relief using your product. And, as a result, he was able to play with his grandchildren again.

(Shortform note: If your background is in creative writing, you may feel uniquely equipped to imbue your marketing writing with creativity, but you should be aware of some pitfalls. Creative writers often learn to tell their own stories in their writing, but in marketing your goal should be to tell the reader’s story, or one they can easily relate to. You should also write with the intention of receiving some kind of response from your reader—whether it’s clicking on a link on your website, purchasing your product, or subscribing to your newsletter—so your writing should call the reader to action in some way.)

Handley particularly recommends using stories in your writing because these evoke emotions in your readers. Humans are better at remembering evocative stories than remembering data or concepts, so a good story will make your brand more memorable to your reader and thus make your marketing more effective. Stories also have the power to change the way we think and behave by appealing to us emotionally.

(Shortform note: Storytelling is one of the most useful and essential tools in marketing because stories are humans’ most natural way of learning and making sense of the world. Stories connect us to each other, stimulate our imaginations, and allow us to experience events and contemplate ideas within our own minds. You can use them to attract the audience you want, appeal to their specific needs and interests, and convey your message or the solution you’re offering in a way that feels real and personal.)

Handley cautions, though, that the persuasiveness of stories doesn’t mean you should neglect rationality in your writing: **Your writing also needs to be based on facts and accurate data to reach your audience.** Handley points out that a brand’s writing presents them with a great opportunity to build credibility and trust with customers. But done poorly, writing can also destroy a brand’s credibility. Because of this, she suggests that brands should hold themselves to higher standards of credibility even than journalists, embodying a devotion to truth, consistency, duty, and a willingness to share knowledge with everyone.

Your product description for your muscle pain supplement will be more compelling if it includes a description of how the supplement works or statistics about how many people found relief from it. On the other hand, if it’s filled with obviously false science or fails to explain what the supplement actually does, your reader will write you off as not credible and not buy your product.

(Shortform note: Because the accuracy of your writing is essential to your credibility, and your credibility is essential in reaching your audience, make sure the sources you’re getting your information from are reliable. Reliable sources are up-to-date, written by people with expertise on the topic, and as unbiased as possible, among other things. You should also consider the source’s platform—a peer-reviewed online journal is more credible than a social media post.)

#### Connection With Your Audience

The final ingredient of great writing is a strong connection between your writing and the audience. Your writing must feel like it’s written by a human who relates to and understands the audience. This will build a stronger relationship with your customer and make your brand seem more accessible.

(Shortform note: Human connection is an important facet of good communication in general, not just writing. In _TED Talks_ , Chris Anderson makes some of the same recommendations as Handley, such as using stories, but he also adds that you can connect with your audience through humility and vulnerability. If what you’re saying seems egotistical or holier-than-thou, your audience will feel like you don’t care about them, and they’ll have no reason to listen to you.)

Handley explains that the best way to connect with your audience is to**make your reader or customer the protagonist of your story**. Your writing should center around them. The reader (not your boss or your editor) decides if your writing is good and if it accomplishes what you intended, so you need to advocate for your audience and write to their needs.

To do this, find out what your audience needs and wants, what’s important to them, and why they do what they do. Offer something in your writing that makes the reader feel represented. Returning to our supplement example, if you’re targeting people suffering from chronic pain, acknowledge ways pain interferes with their lives: They can’t pursue active hobbies like skiing or running, for instance. Show them that you want to help them become more active or reduce their pain.

(Shortform note: In _Building a Storybrand_ , Donald Miller offers a detailed outline of how to create a story that stars your reader. Begin the story with the protagonist discovering a new desire or need—this can be based on what you learn from your audience, as Handley proposes. Next, your protagonist must come upon an obstacle to fulfilling that need, and your brand—also a character in the story—offers them assistance. End by providing a call to action—for example, to buy your product—and explain the negative consequences of not taking that action, along with the positive consequences of answering the call to action.)

### How to Develop Brand Voice

The three elements we just discussed make any type of writing good. But to write good marketing material, **you must also hone and convey your brand’s voice**. A strong brand voice offers an identity for the customer to align with, and it can be the deciding factor when customers are choosing between you and your competitors.

A strong brand voice also tells your customers about the culture of your business and what type of clientele you’re looking for. Ideally, your voice will appeal specifically to the customers you want and will signal to those you don’t want that you’re not a good fit for them.

(Shortform note: Since your voice needs to appeal to your target customers on a personal level, write as though you’re having a conversation with the customer, and use language that makes them feel welcome and close to your brand. If you’re not yet sure who your target customers are, consider researching your target audience. To do this, you can use online tools like Google Analytics or monitor how your customers interact with your social media.)

To create a brand voice, Handley says you’ll first need to identify what type of voice your brand needs. Consider how formal you want to sound and how much emotion and humor you want to infuse. Come up with a few adjectives for how you want your voice to sound, such as “energetic,” “down-to-earth,” “instructional,” or even “zany.” Choose specific, meaningful words that give you a strong sense of what you want your voice to be. Then flesh them out into elaborative sentences that describe your voice and reflect your brand.

For example, if you identify “silly” as one of your adjectives, you may elaborate with the following sentence: “We want our reader to feel free, relaxed, and in touch with their inner child when they read our writing.” This description then becomes a feature of your brand voice.

(Shortform note: In addition to identifying how you _do_ want your voice to sound, experts recommend that you identify how you don’t want it to sound. It may be easier to start with that and use your “don’ts” to identify your “do’s.” They also recommend studying your best-performing or most brand-defining content and using that as a guide in creating your voice. If you’re still struggling to form your voice, study other successful brands and see what tips you can get from their voices.)

Once you’ve determined your ideal voice, create a style guide—a written compilation of the rules and principles for maintaining your brand voice—for your brand. You might be the writer who creates this voice, but it’s unlikely you’ll be the only one who ever uses it. Be sure to document the guidelines for your brand voice so that other writers or future writers can adopt it and keep your brand’s voice consistent over time. You can base your style guide on an existing one to save yourself time.

(Shortform note: If you base your style guide on an existing one, consider choosing the guide that best matches your brand’s purpose. One of the most commonly used style guides is MLA, which provides detailed guidelines for citations but not much on writing mechanics and is usually used for academic writing. APA style also features citation guidelines but is more geared towards scientific writing, and it _does_ include writing mechanics. For more commercial writing you may consider Chicago style, which includes mechanics plus two different methods of citations. But for most marketing purposes, the go-to is AP style, which includes mechanics and also guidelines for cultural and news topics.)

#### Tools for Establishing Voice

You can establish your voice using tools like humor and analogies, Handley explains. **If you choose to add humor to your voice, it should be relatable and reveal a common interest your audience shares with your brand, which can build loyalty.** For example, if your company makes sporting equipment, a joke about baseball is likely to have broader appeal to your audience than a joke about something unrelated, like parenting.

(Shortform note: There is scientific evidence that people can remember information better when it is presented humorously or accompanied by humor, and this effect is even stronger when the humor presented is directly related to the information you’re learning. However, most brands are hesitant to use humor when engaging with customers out of fear of saying the wrong thing and being “canceled.” The best way to infuse humor into your brand without alienating customers is to know your audience and appeal to their values.)

Another way to use your voice is to create strong and relatable analogies. **Analogies can help clarify or explain ideas, make your writing more memorable, and convey a lot about your brand.** If your purpose is to market a new type of antivirus software, for example, you could compare your product to the body’s immune system, explaining that they both identify and attack harmful intruders.

(Shortform note: Not only can analogies help define your brand and clarify your message, they can also provoke your audience to think more deeply and in different ways about your brand. Analogies promote _lateral thinking_ , which reframes your brand in your audience’s minds and invites them to think about your offering from different angles. This, too, will make your brand stand out from competitors and stick more in your audience’s memories.)

Identify areas where there could be confusion in your writing and use analogies to clarify your meaning. Analogies can be particularly helpful for presenting and explaining data or demonstrating scale. For example, if you have a statistic about 40 million people, you could help the reader understand that number by describing it as “around the same number of people who live in California.” Handley recommends that you avoid clichés and come up with your own analogies that connect to your audience.

(Shortform note: Handley writes that analogies can be particularly useful in helping your audience understand scale, such as very large numbers that are difficult to conceptualize. Understanding scale is an important part of information literacy in general. Some argue that while we consume daily news about catastrophes affecting large groups of people, we fail to understand the scale of those catastrophes and thus fail to understand their true impact. Drawing comparisons in such articles—like through analogies—can help readers grasp the severity of such events.)

### How to Adapt Your Writing to Different Formats

The book’s ideas are mainly focused on business and marketing writing, but this is still a very broad category. **Handley emphasizes that the content you create will vary depending on the format and your intention as a writer.** The writing you’ll use in emails to bosses and colleagues will have different rules than writing an email to your customers, writing a social media post, or writing a script for a video.

(Shortform note: Handley suggests that your format will determine your content, but be aware, too, that your content will determine your format. Much of business writing falls into four categories, each with a different purpose: informational writing designed solely to convey information, instructional writing designed to teach the reader how to complete a task, persuasive writing designed to sway your reader’s opinions or beliefs, and transactional writing designed to elicit a response or interaction from your reader. Each of these purposes has its own distinctive goals and audiences, which will determine which format is right to deliver that particular message.)

In all of these types of writing, Handley recommends keeping your brand voice consistent. However, your _tone_ may need to shift to match what you’re writing. If you’ve established a cheeky and irreverent brand voice on your website, for example, you would still want to avoid cracking jokes when responding to a customer complaint. If you have a laid-back and easygoing voice on your social media, you should still include a strong call to action in an email newsletter.

(Shortform note: The tone you adopt can have a significant impact on your brand’s connection with your audience, particularly on how much trust they have in your brand. Research shows that using an inappropriate tone of voice—for example, writing too informally or humorously about mundane or serious topics—reduces customers’ trust in a brand, which makes your brand less desirable to them.)

Let’s look at some common formats and how to adjust your writing for them.

#### Social Media

Social media requires a new and different type of writing, writes Handley. The point of social media is connection, so you’ll want to take on a tone that’s inviting and friendly, even if your voice on your website or in your emails is more formal and detached. Use your social media profile to establish your public image and connect with your customers in a personalized way.

(Shortform note: In addition to personalized interaction, social media lets companies reach customers on a potentially massive scale. This makes social media a great opportunity for brands, but it does come with certain risks. The scale of social media can cause just a few bad posts to damage your brand’s reputation, and posting sensitive information about your company’s inner workings or practices can lead to information breaches or endangering employee safety.)

#### Video

Like social media, video is a relatively new medium whose writing guidelines differ significantly from most other writing formats. Rules of grammar are far less important, Handley says, as your customers won’t be reading your writing but hearing it out loud. In writing a script for a video, story becomes even more important and useful, and you should rely heavily on visuals to communicate that story. Also write your script as it’s going to be read—with commas and ellipses to indicate pauses or trailing off, for instance—so that it doesn’t sound like the subject is reading straight from a script.

(Shortform note: Video tends to be the best-performing online content and appeals strongly to younger audiences. In fact, research shows that much of Gen Z uses the video-only platform Tik Tok as their primary search engine, giving brands a unique opportunity to reach that younger demographic through video content. If your target audience is people under 30, video may be your best tool for reaching them.)

#### Commenting on Social Causes

According to Handley, research suggests that consumers respond well to brands that take a stand on social issues. However, you should always approach these topics with awareness and sensitivity—otherwise you may accidentally harm your brand if readers don’t interpret your post the way you intended, or if your brand doesn’t work toward solving those issues in practice.

> **Unexpected Viral Responses to Burger King’s Tweet**
> 
> A well-intentioned post about a social cause can have devastating effects if it’s not executed properly—which can happen if, for example, your audience reacts in a way that supports the opposite of your intended message. In 2021, Burger King received massive backlash in response to a tweet they posted on International Women’s Day that said “Women belong in the kitchen.”
> 
> Though they posted follow-up comments on the tweet explaining that they were trying to draw attention to the lack of female representation in the culinary industry, the first tweet is the one that got the most engagement. This created an environment in which many commenters felt comfortable posting misogynistic comments in unironic support of Burger King’s tone-deaf message. Before posting, consider whether your message may be misinterpreted or hijacked by people looking to offend.

### How to Write

Now that you know what elements to include in your writing and how to write for different formats, let’s cover the practical writing process. Handley frequently reiterates that there is no single correct way to create content, but she offers tips and processes to help you get started and, more importantly, get into the habit of writing.

#### Make Writing a Habit

Handley first recommends that you **make writing a daily practice.** Most of us already write on a regular basis, whether it’s emailing for work, posting on social media, or journaling. However, we may not be writing to the best of our abilities when we do these things, and better writing produces better results. The key to improving your writing is to do more of it.

(Shortform note: Handley doesn’t give a recommendation for how much time each day you should spend on writing, but a good rule of thumb is to write for about an hour each day—though you may want to start out with 15-30 minute sessions at first and then work your way up to longer sessions.)

Handley recommends a strict daily writing routine and says that missing days lessens your motivation to write. She recommends practicing writing in whatever form works best for you, whether it’s a journal where you jot down a few sentences about your day, using writing prompts, or doing stream-of-consciousness writing (writing down thoughts and feelings as they come to you).

(Shortform note: If you struggle to write every single day, you may benefit from collaborative settings designed to help you get into or stay in the habit. In _On Writing_ , Stephen King suggests that things like writer’s workshops and classes can connect you with other talented writers and provide you with a structure to keep your practice consistent.)

Handley also advises that you identify what time of day your writing is the strongest and write at that time every day. If you’re a morning person you may want to begin each day with writing, but if you find that your voice is strongest in the evening or even late at night, write then. She also suggests slowing your writing down by using pen and paper instead of typing on a computer so you can process what you’re writing more deeply.

(Shortform note: Some experts disagree that writing by hand is better for your practice than writing on a computer. As Handley says, you should tailor your writing practice to your own needs. Making writing a habit is easier if it’s fun and engaging. If you dread sitting down with a pen and paper, you’re much more likely to procrastinate or make excuses for not writing each day.)

#### Draft 1

Once you’ve made writing in your preferred format a daily habit, you'll be better practiced for the writing you have to do for other purposes. Handley describes a writing process that begins with **identifying what format you want to write in, what purpose it will serve for the audience, and what structure will best fit your piece.** It can help to make a list of everything you want to cover and then see how you can best organize these ideas.

(Shortform note: The steps Handley lists are often included in guidelines for how to write an outline for a piece of writing. Whether or not to outline your work—and how detailed you make your outline—is a matter of personal preference, but outlines can help you form and follow a roadmap for what you’re creating and can be particularly helpful in collaborative writing. Consider whether you want to create a thorough outline of your work before you begin drafting, but always be willing to change the outline as needed.)

Next, gather any information from outside sources that you may need, and be sure to cite them when you write. In selecting sources to use, try to find primary sources instead of secondary. Secondary sources might have hidden biases or misinterpretations, and getting your information straight from the primary source prevents you from perpetuating these and makes your writing more credible.

(Shortform note: While primary sources are ideal for gathering information like raw data, secondary sources can be useful for synthesizing information from multiple sources or establishing background information. As long as you assess your secondary sources for reliability, you don’t need to avoid them entirely, and you may find them just as important as your primary sources depending on what you’re writing.)

Additionally, try to find recent sources for facts and data, as information can change rapidly, and you don’t want to misrepresent any facts in your piece. Keep track of your sources as you go and create formal citations as needed. If you try to do all of this at the end of your writing process, you may forget what information you got from other sources and accidentally plagiarize them.

(Shortform note: Many people who are caught plagiarizing claim that it was accidental, and sometimes it is, but more often it is a matter of negligence. Accidental plagiarism may include things like mixing up citations between sources or failing to cite a fact because you assumed it was common knowledge. However, repeated plagiarism of the same source or failing to sufficiently rewrite information from a source is negligent. Mistakes are often unavoidable, but negligence is not, and citing your sources as you go is one of the easiest ways to avoid negligence.)

Next, draft your piece—**Handley recommends writing four drafts.** The first is your rough draft, which she emphasizes will _not_ look good. This draft is just about getting your ideas on the page (or the screen), and you don’t need to spend time focusing on things like correct grammar or complete sentences. Once finished, she recommends stepping away from this draft for a while before coming back for the next one.

(Shortform note: The idea of writing anything that doesn’t immediately look good can be frightening and discouraging, especially if your ultimate goal is to share the writing with others through publication. Instead of expecting to write a bad draft, some experts suggest thinking of this as writing an easy draft. If you hit an obstacle, try asking yourself what would make this next step easy. Your draft will still be rough, but it may be easier to motivate yourself if you reframe it as easy rather than bad.)

#### Draft 2: Editing

**Once you’ve written a first draft, the next step is to begin editing it.** Eventually you’ll need to have someone else help edit your work, but at first, you’ll edit on your own.

There are different types of editing, including what Handley calls _developmental editing_ , or editing on a larger scale, and _line editing_ , or detailed editing. The editing process includes applying writing “rules” to your piece, but Handley emphasizes that the rules are secondary to your purpose, and that you can always break the rules if it suits your piece. Let’s look at each type of editing.

(Shortform note: Breaking the rules of writing can be a tricky proposition. As with most rules, you must understand the rules of writing to break them well. The reason we have the rules is to make language easier to understand, so if your rule-breaking muddles the meaning of your writing, you should correct them. However, intentional, controlled rule-breaking can add style and personality to your writing.)

Large-scale editing involves confirming that you’re conveying your main idea and purpose clearly and logically and that your piece has a strong lead-in to grab the reader’s attention. Also make sure that all information on both the paragraph and sentence level is necessary to the whole piece and cut anything extraneous. Finally, identify anything that’s been left out, such as missing research or logical connections.

(Shortform note: To make large-scale editing on your own work easier, try approaching it as if someone else wrote the piece and you’re editing for them. It may help to print out the writing so you won’t feel tempted to make edits as you go—save those smaller notes for detailed editing. Take only light notes as you read your piece, and afterwards, write up your overall impression and suggestions as an editorial letter for yourself.)

Detailed editing involves making sure that every word conveys something important and cutting words that don’t. Handley recommends being particularly wary of fluff words like “very” and “potentially,” and any other adverbs that don’t add real meaning. Clichéd phrases such as “When all is said and done” should be used sparingly and only when they add something meaningful.

(Shortform note: As you’re examining your writing on such a detailed scale, make sure you don’t accidentally edit out your brand voice. Consider pausing frequently during the process to realign yourself with your voice.)

##### Grammar Rules

Handley offers a wide array of grammar rules to follow at your own discretion. She specifies that **the rules you learned in school don’t necessarily apply to writing as a brand.** Sentence fragments, one-sentence paragraphs, splitting infinitives, and ending sentences in prepositions are all fair game for your writing as long as they're used strategically and don’t interfere with the reader’s ability to understand what you’re saying.

Here are some specific grammar guidelines she proposes you consider:

  * **Use active voice over passive voice.** Active voice refers to a sentence phrasing in which the subject of the sentence is performing—as opposed to receiving—the action. The active phrase “Clients need help” is better than the passive “Help is needed by clients.”
  * **Avoid buzzwords.** Buzzwords like “innovative” and “synergy” are popular in business writing but don’t add much meaning.
  * **Avoid excessive jargon.** Jargon, or language specific to your field, should be used in moderation and only as much as your reader can reasonably understand. Terms like “arithmetic underflow” or “smarketing” will confuse the average reader.
  * **Write in the present tense and second person.** Show the reader that you’re focused on them right now by avoiding past or present tense and using “you” often.
  * **Make every word count.** Combine weak words or phrases into stronger single words, like changing “our output went up very suddenly” to “our output spiked.”



(Shortform note: Excluding the last one, the above bullet points relate to style rather than correct or incorrect grammar and usage. Your style will vary depending on the medium and genre you’re writing. In particular, writing rules for fiction are often more flexible than other writing—tense and person, for example, will depend entirely on the author’s choice. However, rules like writing in active voice, using words your audience will understand, and making every word and sentence count will apply to most fiction writing as well as nonfiction.)

> **Who Came Up With the “Rules”?**
> 
> Many of the “rules” Handley lists are taught in schools, but they may not be as set in stone as we might think. In fact, if you trace them back to their origins, you’ll find that many of these rules developed from individuals’ critiques of the use of the English language. These critiques, however, went against the way the language was actually used.For example, the rule against splitting an infinitive came from 19th-century writer Henry Alford. He didn’t actually say it was incorrect to split an infinitive, but rather that he didn’t see any need to do it even though it was a widespread practice.
> 
> Ending a sentence in a preposition is also commonly understood to be grammatically incorrect, but it’s actually perfectly acceptable. This misconception likely came from a few writers in the 17th and 18th centuries who wanted English grammar to match up more closely with Latin, but since English is a Germanic language and not a Romance language, they were just making up rules without a linguistic basis.
> 
> Language rules are also constantly changing. Language rules eventually conform to how we use language, not the other way around, so if we use a word or grammatical structure enough, it becomes technically correct. Ultimately, the purpose of language is to convey meaning, so as long as you’re getting your meaning across effectively, the rules arguably don’t really matter that much.

#### Draft 3

Once you’ve done your large-scale and detailed editing for draft 2, you can move on to draft 3. **Draft 3 is when you'll focus on your connection to the audience.** Handley recommends imagining one specific individual as your reader and switching perspectives with them. Read through your piece as this reader, identify what misunderstandings or questions they have, and make sure they can see themselves in what you’ve written.

(Shortform note: In addition to identifying questions and confusions, switching places with your reader will help you orient your writing toward them and away from yourself. As we’ve previously discussed, whatever you’re writing, you’re writing it to _serve_ the reader. It can be tempting to craft writing that satisfies you—florid, convoluted writing using your favorite words, for instance—and putting yourself in your reader’s shoes can help you avoid that temptation.)

#### Draft 4

**Finally, draft 4 is when you'll add style and voice to your piece.** This includes things like humor and figurative language. Here, Handley emphasizes that you should write in second person and make sure your sentences and paragraphs read quickly and clearly. Cut any sentences or words that slow the pace of the piece. She also suggests using things like bullet points, visuals, and blank space to make the piece more visually appealing.

(Shortform note: While Handley says to cut items that slow your writing’s pace, slowing the pace might not always be the right move. You can alternatively strategically manipulate the pacing of your piece to maintain reader engagement. A reader might get bored with a piece that maintains the same speed throughout, but you can use heavier words or sentences to change up the pace, keep them interested, and draw their attention to important ideas.)

#### The Final Edit

Once your fourth draft is finished, it’s time to **ask others to help with your editing.** The author recommends first running the piece through an AI editor to catch mistakes you may have missed and resolving those before sending it to your human editor.

A human editor should be someone you work with long-term who understands not only the basic rules of writing but also your unique style and voice. Ideally, your editor will be able to identify errors, fact-check, and rephrase and rewrite while maintaining your voice.

(Shortform note: Depending on your situation, you may also have the opportunity—or obligation—to edit your work as a group. This can improve your piece since you’ll have more people looking at it, but you also run the risk of lots of disagreements or semantic arguments. To minimize these, make sure everyone in the group understands the purpose of the piece and your brand voice, and that they know their own roles in the process—who is the writer, who are the reviewers, and who has the final say on edits.)

Before publication, **Handley also recommends that you read your final draft out loud** to catch any errors or places where the phrasing could be tightened up. Then, review it visually to make sure it’s digestible for the reader in whatever format they’re taking it in. Huge blocks of text will be unappealing to someone reading your piece on their mobile device, and using white space and plenty of visuals makes it easier to read.

(Shortform note: Handley suggests reading your piece out loud to yourself, but there are also benefits to reading it out loud to another person: Having an audience as you read can help you be more aware of your audience’s perspective, and it makes you more likely to notice areas that sound clunky enough to be worth changing.)

Finally, once your work has been published, let your attachment to it go. After it’s published, your work doesn’t belong to you anymore: It belongs to the public. If you have regrets about the final product because it wasn’t quite what you wanted it to be, take it as a lesson for next time. And finally, congratulate yourself! You’ve just accomplished something great.

(Shortform note: Sometimes your biggest regret from a piece of writing is having to get rid of something you worked hard on or really liked from your earlier drafts—killing your darlings, as the saying goes. However, the reason you had to let those go was that they were _your_ darlings, meaning they served you and not the reader. As Handley says, published writing is for the reader, so if you had to put your favorite parts on the chopping block, don’t feel bad. Remember that doing so was a gift to your audience, and keep those treasured pieces for yourself.)
