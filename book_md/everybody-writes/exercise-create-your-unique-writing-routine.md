## Exercise: Create Your Unique Writing Routine

Handley’s tips are intended to be adapted to your unique writing needs and preferences. Use her advice to create your own writing routine.

* * *

First, consider your writing needs. What type of writing do you do the most? What aspects of that writing do you feel you need to improve?

Next, consider how you can write more effectively: What motivates you to write? When do you find it easiest to write? How long can you spend writing before you lose your motivation?

Now, set a daily routine based on your findings above. Note below what time of day you’re going to write and what method you’ll be able to do consistently—for example, journaling, writing prompts, or stream-of-consciousness writing. Each day, make it a habit to write for at least ten minutes, and try not to miss a day. Soon, you should see your writing improve dramatically.
