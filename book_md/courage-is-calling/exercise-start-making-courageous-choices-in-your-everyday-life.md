## Exercise: Start Making Courageous Choices in Your Everyday Life

Holiday asserts that the path to a courageous life starts with making small, brave decisions every day. Reflect on how you can start incorporating courageous actions into _your_ everyday life.

* * *

Describe an action or a decision you’ve been avoiding because you’re afraid. (For example, you might fear having a difficult conversation with a friend, visiting a new country for the first time, or asking for a raise.)

Now, describe the likeliest consequences of you continuing to avoid the thing you fear. (For example, your friendship will struggle, you’ll regret missing a chance to travel, or you’ll continue making less money than you deserve.)

What’s one step you can take toward overcoming your fear? (For example, you might prepare a script for talking to your friend, book a plane ticket, or set up a meeting with your boss.)
