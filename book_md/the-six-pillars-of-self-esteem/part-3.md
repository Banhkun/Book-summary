## Part 3: How External Factors Influence Your Self-Esteem

You’ve now learned what you can do to improve your self-esteem. Although Branden emphasizes that self-esteem starts with your own behavior, he also examines the role that external factors play in supporting or diminishing self-esteem. In Part 3, you’ll learn about how the culture you grow up in influences your self-esteem.

### How Culture Influences Self-Esteem

Branden discusses how every culture influences the self-esteem of its members—to both their advantage and disadvantage. In this section, you’ll first learn why self-esteem is a _universal_ need, regardless of whether a particular culture supports it. Then, you’ll learn how cultures affect the self-esteem of their members—and how cultural values that support or discourage self-esteem affect the overall health of societies.

While Branden acknowledges that self-esteem is a recent Western concept, he argues that **_everybody_ needs self-esteem, regardless of culture**, because you need self-esteem to _survive_ : You only feel capable of handling the fundamental necessities of life—which you must in order to survive—if you have healthy self-esteem. Similarly, unless you feel you’re intrinsically worthy, you won’t, for example, take the actions necessary to protect yourself—and in this way, you’ll damage your ability to survive. (Shortform note: One Finnish study casts doubt on Branden’s argument. It found that low self-esteem did not increase mortality rates—only hopelessness did.)

Additionally, **every culture affects the self-esteem of its members** by instilling particular beliefs that affect how they view the world, thus impacting their self-esteem. Individuals often aren’t aware of these cultural beliefs—but even when they are, Branden argues, it’s impossible to avoid the influence of these beliefs.

(Shortform note: In _12 Rules for Life_ , Peterson argues that our perception of humanity as a whole also influences our self-esteem. Since humanity has repeatedly revealed its propensity for evil—for instance, through atrocities such as the Holocaust—it’s become much easier for us to hate both humanity as a whole and ourselves (presumably for being part of the fundamentally “evil” human race).)

As an example, Branden points to two traditional Western beliefs regarding gender roles. First, Branden notes, women were historically deemed subservient to men. The ways in which this belief manifests in modern society continue to damage women’s self-esteem—even __ the ones who don’t consider themselves subservient to men in any way. (Shortform note: In _The Confidence Code_ , Katty Kay and Claire Shipman explain that these beliefs manifest in schools: Girls are encouraged to be well-behaved, which discourages confidence-building behavior and may thus damage self-esteem.)

Second, Western men are taught to judge their worth by how well they provide for their families. This belief damages men’s self-esteem by teaching them to derive their worth from a _service_ they _provide_ , not from their _intrinsic worth_ as human beings. (Shortform note: Psychologists warn that men may develop an “Atlas Complex" and believe that they must provide for everyone until they buckle under the pressure—which damages their health and relationships.)

Branden argues that **two types of cultures are particularly unsupportive of self-esteem**.

First, _group-minded cultures_ , which Branden calls “tribal cultures,” prioritize the needs of the group over those of its members. By their nature, these cultures deem the individual unimportant—and so self-esteem is unimportant, too. (Shortform note: People from group-minded cultures can still _have_ healthy self-esteem, but it often stems from factors Branden doesn’t believe indicate self-esteem. For example, one study found that young members of some group-minded cultures derive self-esteem from fulfilling societal expectations.)

Second, cultures that are both _religious_ and _authoritarian_ have proven to be unsupportive of self-esteem throughout history. Such cultures, Branden points out, regularly punish various expressions of self-esteem. For example, they punish anybody who dares to assert themselves by expressing a different point of view. However, the fact that these cultures don’t value certain pillars of self-esteem doesn’t diminish the pillars’ importance for members of those societies: Asserting yourself is still important even in religious, authoritarian cultures.

(Shortform note: The fact that many people go to great lengths to assert themselves in religious, authoritarian cultures despite the dangers of doing so supports Branden’s contention that expressing yourself is critical to your self-esteem. In Burundi, where people in gay relationships may be fined or jailed, young lesbians sometimes wear a secret symbol of their sexuality in public.This symbol allows them to find other lesbians with whom they can be themselves and take a break from hiding their sexuality—a self-rejecting behavior that likely damages their self-esteem.)

#### How American Culture Impacts Self-Esteem

Not every culture has such a straightforward relationship with self-esteem. Branden notes that **American culture has elements that both support and are detrimental to self-esteem**. On one hand, the Declaration of Independence enshrines personal freedom, which demonstrates how Americans value the individual—not the group. Similarly, Americans of previous centuries had to pave their own economic way instead of relying on the community—which required the capability and worthiness that are integral to self-esteem. On the other hand, other cultural aspects—like the gender roles described above and the legacies of slavery and discrimination against Black Americans—are harmful to self-esteem, especially among certain segments of the population.

(Shortform note: In _Sapiens_ , philosopher**** Yuval Noah Harari argues that such cultural contradictions are beneficial. America’s contradicting attitudes and actions related to self-esteem—for example, that the Declaration of Independence enshrined personal freedom _when_ slavery was legal in the United States—lead to cognitive dissonance, which occurs when we simultaneously hold multiple beliefs that are incompatible with one another. Cultures continually attempt to resolve contradictions like these in their myth, which leads us to examine and progress beyond them, allowing for a more creative and dynamic species.)

Furthermore, since the foundation of the United States, Americans have always come from many different cultures. As a result, they’ve always __ had many _different_ cultural beliefs, some of which carry over from cultures that don’t value self-esteem. Therefore, American culture has always included values that support self-esteem, and others that are harmful to self-esteem.

(Shortform note: In _Outliers_ , Malcolm Gladwell describes how a single culture in the American South simultaneously supports and harms self-esteem. The American South is a culture of honor, in which your self-worth (and sometimes your livelihood) is based on your reputation, so you’re more likely to fight if it’s challenged. On one hand, a culture of honor harms your self-esteem because it prioritizes external validation. On the other hand, a culture of honor values self-assertion, which supports self-esteem.)

Branden warns that today, **elements detrimental to self-esteem are starting to dominate American culture** and leading to various social problems. In the mid-20th century, ideological movements like nihilism, moral relativism, Marxism, and epistemological agnosticism spread amongst American academics. As a result, academics started to teach several ideas that Branden deems anti-self-esteem. For example, they taught that nobody can know what constitutes reality, so our minds are unimportant and unreliable. They also taught that nobody can control their behavior, so nobody can take credit nor be held accountable for their behavior.

(Shortform note: Branden’s rejection of mid-20th-century ideological movements likely reflects the objectivist philosophies he learned from Ayn Rand. For several years, Branden ran a business teaching Rand’s objectivism, which centers on the idea that reality exists whether you can perceive it or not. In contrast, the movements Branden names—nihilism, moral relativism, Marxism, and epistemological agnosticism—all fall broadly under the umbrella of postmodernism, which argues that reality is essentially unknowable and a conceptual construct.)~~ ~~

These ideas created a populace who started to believe that they were victims who were _owed_ more. This ideology also influenced the systems Americans created—which, Branden argues, explains the rise in various societal problems over the latter half of the 20th century. For example, Branden contends that modern welfare systems don’t effectively fight poverty _because_ they teach the poor that their poverty is out of their control. As such, the poor believe that improving their economic situation is impossible and thus don’t _try_ to improve their lives.

(Shortform note: Branden’s emphasis on personal responsibility for your economic situation ignores the reality that many people face systemic inequities—even within the welfare system—that make it harder for them to improve their lives. For example, prior to 2021, even the maximum benefits from the government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) couldn’t cover moderately priced meal costs in 96% of US counties.)

To resolve these problems, Branden asserts, **Americans—and every culture—must instead uphold and fight for the elements that support self-esteem**. The increase in social issues in modern America _proves_ that cultural values that are anti-self-esteem decrease the self-esteem of its members and thus harm them. Instead, Branden argues, cultures should instill values that support each pillar of self-esteem; this will not only raise individuals’ self-esteem but also create a healthier, happier society.

(Shortform note: The logic of Branden’s argument is faulty: The corresponding rise of anti-self-esteem cultural values and social issues does not prove that those values _caused_ those social issues. In _How to Lie with Statistics_ , journalist Darrell Huff**** explains that there are several other ways to explain the relationship between two factors. For example, it’s possible that both factors are effects of some _other c_ ause, or that they correlate merely due to chance.)
