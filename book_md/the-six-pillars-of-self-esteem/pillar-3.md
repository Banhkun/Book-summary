## Pillar #3: Take Responsibility

Branden’s third pillar of self-esteem is to practice self-responsibility, or take responsibility in all areas of your life. In this chapter, you’ll learn what taking responsibility is, why it matters, and how you can facilitate it.

### What Is Taking Responsibility?

Branden explains that **when you take responsibility** , **you take ownership of your life, behavior, and well-being.**

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson argues that taking responsibility will make you happier because you’ll feel empowered even in the worst situation.)

Specifically, Branden argues, you understand and practice the following:

**1\. You are responsible for reaching your goals.** You understand that only _you_ can develop and implement a plan to achieve your goals, and only _you_ can ensure your __ schedule reflects your commitment to those goals. You also know that it’s your job to ask for any help you need. (Shortform note: To effectively schedule the tasks that support your goals, try the six-level model of prioritizing that productivity expert David Allen suggests in _Getting Things Done_.)

**2\. You are responsible for your behavior.** You understand that _you_ choose every action you take. (Shortform note: In _Goals!_ , Brian Tracy writes that it's important to learn that any change you want to make in your life is entirely up to you. This means that you have to free yourself from a sense of entitlement, a victim mentality, and hypersensitivity to other people's opinions.)

**3\. You are responsible for how you relate to others.** You don’t shift blame—if you claim to act some way because somebody else is unreasonable, you’re shirking your responsibility. You also understand that it’s your job to clearly communicate your message and to ensure that others understand it.

(Shortform note: You may struggle to take responsibility for your behavior and relationships if you’ve experienced trauma that affects either. Keep in mind the distinction that _The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck_ author Manson points out: You are not to blame for everything that happens to you, but you are responsible for how you respond to it.)

**4\. You are responsible for your happiness and self-esteem** , which are totally in your control. You don’t depend on others—like your parents or spouse—to provide it. (Shortform note: In _Designing Your Life_ , Silicon Valley innovators Bill Burnett and Dave Evans recommend a technique you can use to exercise greater control over how you feel about your life: Plot out several ways of living that you might enjoy, pick one, then let go of the options you didn’t choose instead of agonizing over them.)

Branden adds that **taking responsibility involves facing life _actively_ rather than _passively_ , **which manifests in the following.

**1\. You are productive.** You understand that you must achieve independence by working. So you ask yourself: What can I do? How can I improve my current state? (Shortform note: If you struggle to improve your productivity because you dislike your job, try redefining work as any activity you do that aligns with your values, purposes, and dreams, as Joseph R. Dominguez and Vicki Robin do in _Your Money or Your Life_. Accepting that you may never get paid for what you truly want to do gives you both the freedom to pursue it without worrying about pay and the motivation to find a different job that funds your true interests.)

**2\. You think independently.** You analyze others’ opinions, only repeating them if you believe and understand them. (Shortform note: While Branden primarily warns against automatically accepting others’ opinions, in _How to Read a Book_ , educators Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren add that automatically criticizing others’ opinions is also harmful. If you criticize an author without first fully understanding them, you’re not having a conversation that can lead to learning, because you’re not actually criticizing the author’s argument.)

**3\. You look for solutions** instead of waiting for instructions. (Shortform note: To find an effective solution to any problem, _The Oz Principle_ authors recommend pinpointing the root of the issue so you’re not wasting your time on superficial aspects.)

### Why Taking Responsibility Matters

Branden contends that taking responsibility is essential both to self-esteem and to your general well-being: If you don’t take responsibility, you won’t feel like you control your life—so you can’t feel capable or worthy, which self-esteem requires. For example, if you don’t take responsibility for your finances as an adult and instead rely on your parents to fund your life, you won’t feel like you can do things they dislike—so you won’t feel capable or worthy of living according to your own desires.

> **Codependency: What Happens When You Don’t Take Responsibility**
> 
> Counselor Melody Beattie’s description of codependency—when someone becomes so obsessed with someone else that they lose sight of themselves—demonstrates how not taking responsibility can harm your well-being and self-esteem. In _Codependent No More_ , Beattie explains that codependent people often take responsibility for others but never for themselves—which leads them to neglect their own well-being. And although Beattie doesn’t explicitly connect not taking responsibility with damage to your self-esteem, she does recommend improving your self-esteem to become less codependent—which suggests that taking responsibility would improve your self-esteem, too.

Additionally, **you only act to raise your self-esteem if you understand that your self-esteem is your responsibility**. Since Branden believes that your self-esteem depends on your behavior, he rejects the notion that you can develop and maintain self-esteem through external sources _regardless_ of your behavior. For example, even if your parents instill in you high self-esteem, you might act in ways that contradict the six pillars and diminish your self-esteem. If you don’t acknowledge that you’re in control of your self-esteem, you won’t behave in the ways necessary to raise and sustain it.

(Shortform note: One life coach lists several warning phrases that may indicate that you’re holding others responsible for your self-esteem, such as “If only” or “It’s their fault.”)

More generally, if you don’t take responsibility, you risk never improving your life. Branden contends that some people who aren’t self-responsible wait for someone to come save them instead of fixing their own lives. But this person never appears, so their lives never improve.

(Shortform note: Even if someone _does_ show up to save you, it may not improve your life. Psychologists coined the term “white knight syndrome” to describe people who try to “save” their romantic partners by fixing all their problems. But white knights often engage in harmful behaviors, like controlling their partner under the pretense of helping them.)

Finally, Branden argues, **taking responsibility compels you to treat others well**. When you recognize that you have ownership over your choices, you also recognize that _others_ have ownership over _their_ choices. Therefore, you don’t treat others as tools for accomplishing your goals: If you want them to do something, you give reasons that appeal to _them_. For example, if you ask your parents to babysit your kids, you frame it as an opportunity for them to spend time with their grandkids—and you don’t get mad if they have other plans instead.

(Shortform note: One _Harvard Business Review_ writer found that accepting others’ ownership over their choices ultimately benefited her. When she asked someone for help with her research, they refused—but they offered to introduce her to someone who might be interested. Since the writer was flexible and agreed, she ultimately got the help she needed.)

### Exercises to Facilitate Self-Responsibility

To take more responsibility in your life, Branden recommends a nine-week sentence completion program.

Every weekday, follow the instructions listed below. Then, each weekend, review your answers and write six to 10 answers to the following: “If any of what I wrote this week is true, it might be helpful if I…”

**Week 1:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what taking responsibility means to you, how you feel about taking responsibility for yourself, and what happens when you do or don’t take responsibility for yourself.

**Week 2:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what happens when you do or don’t take responsibility for your goals, what would happen if you took responsibility for your relationships, and in what ways you occasionally behave passively.

**Week 3:** Create and answer three sentence stems addressing what would happen if you took more responsibility for ideas your parents taught you and for your acceptance or rejection of those ideas, and what would happen if you were more aware of the ideas that drive you.

**Week 4:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what happens when you do or don’t take responsibility for your happiness, and what happens when you do or don’t take responsibility for who you choose to spend time with.

**Week 5:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what happens when you do or don’t take responsibility for what you say to others, what happens if you grow more aware of what you say to yourself, and what happens when you take responsibility for what you say to yourself.

**Week 6:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing the ways in which you increase your helplessness, depression, and anxiety, and what happens when you take responsibility for the behaviors that increase your helplessness.

**Week 7:** Create and answer five sentence stems addressing what happens when you take responsibility for the behaviors that increase your depression and anxiety, what would happen if you felt prepared to face your responsibility, what you have trouble acknowledging, and what happens when you take responsibility for how you live.

**Week 8:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing the situations in which you feel like you’re taking the most or least responsibility, and what would happen if you could live for yourself and ignore others’ expectations of you.

**Week 9:** Create and answer four sentence stems addressing what would happen if you admitted that you could alter your own life, what would happen if nobody could save you from your own life, what would happen if you took responsibility for your life, and what you’re starting to notice.

> **Alternative Ways to Facilitate Self-Responsibility**
> 
> In addition to Branden’s sentence-completion exercises, there are several practices you can do to encourage greater self-responsibility in your life.
> 
> One method is to tell yourself different stories about why you’re not acting in service of goals. If you’re not self-responsible, you’ll tell yourself BED-time stories: You’ll **b** lame others, make **e** xcuses, and practice **d** enial. Such stories give you an excuse to do nothing to improve your life. If you find yourself using phrases like “If only” or “I will when X happens,” you may have fallen for such stories.
> 
> To take responsibility, replace these stories with **OAR-** some stories: Take **o** wnership of your choices, hold yourself **a** ccountable, and take **r** esponsibility. Since you’ll likely struggle to change your thought patterns, consider also getting help from a mental health professional.
> 
> Another way to encourage greater self-responsibility in your life is to stop complaining. Complaining is a form of evading responsibility because you focus on the negative circumstances around you. Instead, when bad things happen to you, focus on the positive by asking yourself, “What’s the lesson in this?” Alternatively, you could also take responsibility by trying to fix the situation in some way.
> 
> A third strategy is to be present. By paying more attention to your thoughts, you’re more likely to notice when your thinking evades responsibility—and when this happens, replace these thoughts with ones that _take_ responsibility instead.
