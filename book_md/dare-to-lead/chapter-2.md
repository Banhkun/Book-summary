## Chapter 2: Choosing and Practicing Your Values

**Grounded confidence requires that you have strong values, which makes the second skill of brave leadership, choosing and practicing your values, particularly important.** If you don’t have clear values guiding you through vulnerable situations, it’s very easy to make decisions outside of your integrity. Either you let the voices of critics take control and make decisions you don’t necessarily agree with, or you avoid vulnerability by doing what’s most comfortable instead of what’s right.

We’ll discuss the process of clarifying your values and ensuring they’re put into practice, and then we’ll explore how to effectively carry that process into your organization.

### Choosing & Practicing Your Values

As a leader, your first step should be to make sure that you’ve clarified your _own_ values—these will be your guide in making tough decisions, taking risks, and showing your team how to face vulnerability. When choosing your values, consider what your innermost self holds most important in life. Your values should be so defined and clear that acting in line with them doesn’t feel like a conscious choice—they’re simply who you _are._

The tricky part of choosing your values is that you need to narrow down to just _two core values_. **If you have too many values, they become meaningless feel-good words, rather than principles that guide your behaviors and intent, and that fuel your ability to commit to things you hold important.** For example, “family” may not be one of your two values, but “connection” is. Therefore, connection is at the center of how you make decisions about and within your family. Because possible values are so varied—understanding, wealth, gratitude, recognition, career, joy, diversity, growth—it might be easiest for you to first cut down to ten values that you feel are important, and then narrow down to two from there.

(Shortform note: there are many “value lists” online that can help you with exploring the full range of possible values and finding those that you identify with most.)

Be careful to choose values that you _truly_ identify with. Don’t choose your values based on who other people want you to be (“You should work on your patience”), or choose values that have been assigned to you (“I taught you that family is the most important thing”).

Once you’ve chosen your values, make sure you are regularly practicing them. To help with this, you can make a set of guidelines for each of your values. This is a rubric that you can check in with occasionally, to make sure that you are acting with integrity and that your actions represent who you really are. For each value, think:

  * What are several behaviors that support this value?
  * What are behaviors that I would consider to be outside this value?
  * Can I think of a particular moment of integrity, when I was especially living my values?



Before bringing the values conversation to your team members, realize that there’s no separation between your “personal values” and your “professional values”—your values are your innermost guide, regardless of setting. However, it’s possible that _your_ values won’t necessarily be aligned with _your organization’s_ values. If both sides have clarified values, these different value sets can navigate one another, rather than be at odds with one another. For example, your value of “accountability” isn’t the same as your organization’s value of “collaboration,” but by continually holding yourself accountable for mistakes, you make for a healthier collaborative setting.

### Choosing & Practicing Your Organization’s Values

Brave leaders bring the values conversation to their organizations for three reasons:**clear values establish trust and understanding, they guide the actions and behaviors of team members, and they open up vital conversations about privilege**

Firstly, knowing someone’s values gives you a great deal of insight into their motivations and the reasoning behind their decisions. Having this insight establishes stronger connections and trust between team members. For example, if a team member regularly pushes back on your trendy new ideas, it’s easy to assume they don’t trust your judgment. In a conversation about values, they reveal that one of their core values is _authenticity_ —this reveals that they aren’t distrustful, but that they’re focused on ensuring that ideas are brand authentic, not just bandwagoning.

Secondly, defined values of an organization can be translated into behaviors and skills which can be modeled, evaluated, and improved. Without the tangible aspect of behaviors, organization values risk being too nebulous to be actionable—they become meaningless feel-good words.

  * **Unclear values:** At X Corp, we care about quality, collaboration, sustainability, knowledge, balance, and community—these are all worthy values, but they have no driving focus. When it comes to tough decisions, there’s no evident “right thing to do.”
  * **Clear values:** X Corp’s values are “balance” __ and “knowledge.” To practice balance, we have a “no work emails on the weekend” policy. To practice knowledge, we require that everyone comes to the weekly marketing meeting with a question, or a tool or skill to share. 



Translating values into value-supporting behaviors provides clear guidelines of how you expect your team members to work together, make decisions, and show up to their work. Furthermore, they show you who’s on track, who needs help, and who deserves recognition for their integrity. When thinking of behaviors to model your organization’s values, ask yourself:

  * What are value-supporting behaviors I expect from my team members?
  * What behaviors are not aligned with our organization’s values?
  * Which team members deserve recognition for their continuous value-supporting behaviors?



The third reason for clarifying organization values is that strong values can support innovative organizations in the discussion around privilege. This discussion is usually swept under the rug because people fear saying the wrong thing, but it’s vitally important to understanding the ways in which your organization supports or excludes diverse perspectives. Brave leaders, knowing that their role is to build an organization that supports diverse perspectives, lean into this conversation, depending on their values to push them through the fear and discomfort of saying or doing something wrong.

#### Clear Values Improve Feedback

**Teaching and practicing strong values is especially important for the process of giving or receiving feedback.** Often, feedback can be hard to hear and drives you to shut down or act defensively. When you bring your values to the table, however, you can rely on them to direct your emotions and reactions in the more productive direction of gaining insight and figuring out the way forward.

When _giving feedback_ , think about how you want to bring yourself and your values into the conversation. For example, if one of your values is courage, you can enter the conversation with the commitment to be honest and respectful, instead of defaulting to the comfort of polite half-truths. If your second value is teamwork, you might offer to come up with an improvement plan for your team member, rather than leaving them to figure it out alone.

When _receiving feedback_ , it’s helpful to adopt a value-supporting mantra or behavior, such as “I have the courage to at least sit here and listen” (courage), “Paying attention will make me a better teammate” (teamwork), or “I’ll ask questions and fully understand” (curiosity).

These mantras and behaviors ensure that you show up to the conversation in such a way that you can find value in any feedback you receive. This is important because feedback usually doesn’t happen under perfect circumstances. Instead, you’ll usually find yourself in one of three situations: 1) receiving feedback from someone who doesn’t know how to give it, 2) receiving feedback from someone skilled, but whose intentions aren’t clear, or 3) receiving feedback that catches you off-guard.

  * **When receiving feedback from someone who doesn’t know how to give it** , remember that there is something valuable in what they are saying. Showing up to the conversation led by your values lets you find those valuable parts, and leave the rest behind.
  * **When getting feedback from someone with unknown intentions,** remember that people giving honest and constructive feedback usually have your best interests in mind. While the feedback might be hard to hear, your values push you to come to the conversation ready to learn and make improvements.
  * **When getting feedback that catches you off-guard,** remember that it’s okay to take a break to consider the feedback, and come back later with your thoughts. Instead of letting you shut down and escape the conversation, your values push you to stay open to the feedback, and show up to the conversation again once you’ve collected your thoughts.
