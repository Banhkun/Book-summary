## Exercise: Examine Your Bad First Draft

Practice the process of unraveling a bad first draft in order to separate the facts of a situation from your insecurities and biases.

* * *

Think of a recent time where you made up a story and worst-case scenario to explain what was happening. Describe the story you told yourself. (Ex. Jack didn’t say hello to me this morning. He must be upset about that typo I made in his presentation. I bet he’s going to take me off that new project.)

What parts of your story are factual, and what parts did you make up? (Ex. Fact: Jack didn’t say hello. Made up: He’s upset at me. He’s going to take me off the project.)

What assumptions are you making about the other person in your story? (Ex. I assumed that being upset was the only reason Jack didn’t say hello, but maybe he was in a rush, or forgot.)

What underlying feelings do you think contributed to the story that you made up? (Ex. I feel embarrassed about the typo. I’m insecure about my ability to do this new project.)
