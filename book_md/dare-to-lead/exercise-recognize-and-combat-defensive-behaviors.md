## Exercise: Recognize and Combat Defensive Behaviors

Practice spotting defensive behaviors in your organization and taking steps to discourage them.

* * *

Describe a recent situation where one of your team members resorted to a defensive behavior (such as perfectionism, criticism, or overcompensating to prove their worth).

How do you think that you may have inadvertently rewarded or modeled this behavior (for example, let an always-right team member interrupt in a meeting, or sent work emails on the weekend)?

What action can you take to discourage this behavior (for example, telling the always-right team member to ask more questions, stop answering weekend emails)?
