## Chapter 4: Developing Failure Resilience

The fourth courage-building skill is developing failure resilience—that is, the ability to get up, dust yourself off, and move on after something goes wrong. This is an essential skill for leaders to teach, because people are more likely to take risks and try new ideas when they’re confident in their ability to recover from any setback.

Unfortunately, many leaders teach failure resilience _after_ a failure has already happened. Imagine teaching a skydiver how to land once they’ve already hit the ground—you’ll be dealing with a lot of broken bones and a long recovery. In the same way, if you don’t teach your team members how to “land,” you’ll end up wasting time recovering from problematic behaviors—such as covering up mistakes, blaming others, or perfectionism—that are based in the fear of failure. **Brave leaders teach the steps of failure resilience from the very beginning of the onboarding process—this normalizes failure, and signals that team members will be supported, not shamed, when (not if) it happens.**

Teaching failure resilience is more important now than ever, as millennials and GenZ enter the workforce. These generations are often not well-equipped to handle setbacks, due to being overprotected by their parents. Because their parents focused on paving the road _for_ them, instead of preparing them for the bumpy road, they haven’t been exposed to the risk of failure and are prone to reacting defensively to any failures, real or perceived.

**Productive responses to failure require the two components of failure resilience: 1) recognizing and questioning your emotional response to failure, and 2) unraveling the story you create around failure**.

### Recognizing and Questioning Your Emotional Response

As with shame resilience, the first step of failure resilience is recognizing and questioning your emotional response to failure. It’s not important to know _exactly_ what you’re feeling. You just need to know that your emotions have been triggered in some way. Failure responses can take many forms—physical or mental—and are very specific to you. You might feel generally overwhelmed, or like you have a pit in your stomach. You might feel like crying or find yourself unable to stop replaying a conversation in your head.

If you know your specific failure response, you can identify when it’s happening—this should cue you to take a moment to think about the _source_ of your emotions. What happened? Why are you reacting to it negatively?

This first step of consciously slowing down and thinking through your emotions is vital to a productive failure response. If you don’t have your emotions in check, they’ll drive you to defensive behaviors. **Those who recognize and think through their emotions can _respond_ thoughtfully __ to failure instead of _reacting_ negatively _._** However, instead of facing their vulnerability and doing the hard work of engaging with their negative emotions, most people choose the easier route of pushing those emotions aside or onto other people.

#### The Risks of Refusing to Engage with Negative Emotions

If you refuse to slow down and think through your negative emotions, you risk having them manifest in ways that are not aligned with who you are. There are six common ways that emotions are mishandled: 1) blowing up, 2) replacing hurt with anger, 3) numbing, 4) bottling up, 5) over-positivity, and 6) refusal to engage.

  1. **Blowing up:** Instead of engaging with negative emotions, you keep them bottled up. They build up pressure until a failure triggers you to completely blow up. This destroys the trust of those around you, who are left wondering if you’ll take out the next failure on them, or if you can be trusted with risky ideas.
  2. **Replacing hurt with anger:** Because it’s much easier to acknowledge external anger than internal hurt, you react to failure with anger, blame, and excuses aimed at those around you. 
  3. **Numbing:** You let your negative emotions drive you to anything that soothes or lets you forget them, such as food, alcohol, or gambling. This is dangerous not only because it can lead to addiction, but also because you can’t choose which emotions you numb—you’ll end up numbing _all_ of them, even the positive ones. 
  4. **Bottling up:** Instead of engaging with your negative emotions, you push them down and let them amass. While this might work in the short term, in the long term this will manifest as anxiety and depression, physical pain, breakdowns, or insomnia. 
  5. **Over-positivity:** You reject negative emotions, instead putting on a show of positivity: “I feel great, everything is fine!” This chips away at trust—if you’re “never” angry, upset, or sad, your team members don’t feel that you’re sincere, and they fear that the cheery façade will blow off at any moment. 
  6. **Refusal to engage:** You try to control your negative emotions by refusing to engage emotionally with others, fearing that you will get “stuck.”**** Once you engage, you can’t go back and pretend your feelings don’t matter, but you can’t move forward because it might open a bigger mess of emotions. Instead of giving you control, this thinking makes you feel powerless. 



Beyond helping you avoid emotional mishandling or a knee-jerk reaction to failure, this moment of sitting with your emotions allows you to create _calm_ , a natural remedy to the anxiety that comes with failure. Getting a handle on this anxiety in the workplace is especially important because unmitigated anxiety is contagious and quickly becomes the driving force behind your team’s behaviors. It usually shows up among team members as _overperformance_ or _underperformance._ Overperformers micromanage, take over, and get too involved in others’ business, making others anxious about the quality of their own work. On the other hand, underperformers shut down or ask others to take over, adding to others’ workloads and creating anxiety about their abilities.

**Brave leaders demonstrate how to slow down emotions and channel it into spreading calm instead of anxiety in stressful moments.** Take time to reflect and ask questions, or purposely speak slowly and calmly during emotionally-charged conversations. Once calm has been created, you can successfully move onto the next step of failure resilience—unraveling the story you’ve created about your failure.

### Unraveling the Story You Create About Failure

Thinking through the failure and what _really_ happened is important because in response to failure, your brain naturally makes up a story to explain what happened. Unfortunately, this story is almost never true—instead, it’s pieced together by incomplete information, and usually concludes with a worst-case scenario.

It’s very hard to resist piecing together incomplete information to make a story, because patterns and connections coming together gives your brain a jolt of dopamine. You’re _wired_ to look for and invent connections and patterns in the absence of complete information. Imagine that a colleague spoke to you curtly. You’d likely immediately think, “Jane is being short with me today, I must have done something to bother her.” Your brain invented a connection between your actions and Jane’s tone—whereas if you’d gotten full information you would have known that she’s exhausted because her daughter was up all night, and her tone wasn’t intentional.

These stories usually conclude with a worst-case scenario because doing so gives you the opportunity to preemptively protect yourself. Imagine your boss emails you, “We need to talk.” You think he’s upset about a report you turned in late and is going to yell at you or even _fire_ you, so you avoid speaking to him all day. It turns out he just wanted to talk about the new intern’s performance. By protecting yourself against the imagined worst-case scenario, you’ve wasted the day harboring anxiety and avoiding a meeting.

#### Handling Your Own Bad First Drafts

In order to stop your brain’s story—the “bad first draft”—from driving unproductive behaviors, you need to look at it objectively with the goal of unraveling it. **First, you need to question the story you’re telling yourself, because it’s built from your insecurities and biases rather than from facts**. When examining your bad first draft, you should question what you know about yourself, the other person in the story, and your hidden emotions.

  * **What you know about yourself:** What do you _actually_ know about the situation? What parts are you imagining?
  * **What you know about the other person:** What assumptions are you making about the other person? What questions can you ask them for clarification?
  * **What you know about your hidden emotions:** What is under the surface of my reaction? Are there insecurities or biases contributing to my story?



**Secondly, you need to talk about your bad first draft in order to reveal the holes in your logic.** In this step, it’s helpful to use the phrase, “The story I’m telling myself…” This lets you express your feelings while inviting the other person to tell their side of the story. This step untangles the story, leaving just the truth—either your failure is imagined or exaggerated, or it becomes a concrete problem you can now address.

For example, you suggest an idea in a meeting and notice that your colleague Anne looked at another colleague before rejecting your idea. You assume they’ve been talking about you behind your back, and think your ideas are stupid and not worth discussing in meetings. After the meeting, you say to Anne, “You looked at Cheryl before you said no to my idea. The story I’m telling myself here is that you two have been discussing my ideas and don’t think they’re worth your time.” Her response will probably take one of two forms:

  * Option A (most likely): She responds, “Not at all. We’re working on a similar idea that we have to keep under wraps for now. I was just making sure she and I were on the same page.” By talking through your story, you get complete information about what happened and realize you invented a worst-scenario connection.
  * Option B (unlikely): She says, “Yes, that’s right.” While this might sting a little at first, ultimately it opens up the opportunity to have an honest discussion about her thoughts.



#### Handling Your Team’s Bad First Drafts

Bad first drafts are damaging enough in personal failures, but they become worse in the workplace. Bad first drafts spread easily in work environments, where people tend to believe their own stories and retell them as truth. These stories warp over time, and they breed insecurity and uncertainty. Just think of how easily “There will probably be massive layoffs at the end of the summer. No one told me but I can just feel it” can be repeated and warped into, “There _will_ be massive layoffs in August.”

**A brave leader recognizes that bad storytelling is more likely in times of uncertainty, change, and failure and gets ahead of it**. You can accomplish this by inviting your team members to share their bad first drafts with you and with one another. This is most effectively done aloud—when incomplete information and worst-case scenarios are expressed, their missing logic becomes apparent.

Hearing your team’s stories and working with them to separate fact from fiction is an opportunity for you to improve your communication style moving forward. This exercise exposes where you’ve left information gaps in which imaginations and insecurities were able to run wild. Moving forward, you’re likely to continually speak to your team with transparency and give as much information as you can, in order to avoid further bad first drafts.

This exercise is also valuable because it presents the opportunity to name and grapple with the problem _itself_ , instead of with all the misinformation around it. Instead of dealing with everyone’s fears of layoffs, you can simply say, “It’s true that our organization will undergo a lot of changes this summer, and it’s normal to be anxious. Currently, there are no layoffs planned and I will keep you updated if that changes.”

While this process of untangling bad first drafts will take some extra time on your part, recall that not spending a bit of time addressing your team’s stories now will result in a lot of wasted time fixing defensive behaviors in the future.

### Using the Courage Toolbox

When you lean into all four courage-building skills—facing vulnerability, choosing and practicing values, building trust, and developing failure resilience—you gain control over how difficult situations affect you and the members of your team. The four courage-building skills develop your ability to approach risk and failure productively, instead of reacting to them defensively and falling into behaviors that hold you back from the creativity, collaboration, and ideas that are crucial to keeping up with today’s demand for innovation.
