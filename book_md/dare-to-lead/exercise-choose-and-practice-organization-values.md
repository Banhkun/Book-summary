## Exercise: Choose and Practice Organization Values

Identifying value-supporting behaviors makes it easier to teach and evaluate values, and spot opportunities for improvement.

* * *

Choose two core values (such as connection, equality, authenticity, kindness, or loyalty) that drive your organization. Recall that it might be easier to list ten values that are _important_ and then narrow down to the two that should drive decision making and behavior.

Describe two behaviors that you’d consider to be value-supporting. (Connection: showing empathy to a colleague in a tough situation; equality: taking part in an inclusivity workshop.)

Describe two behaviors that you’d consider to be _against_ the values of your organization. (Curiosity: refusing to ask questions during a meeting; teamwork: taking full credit for a project they didn’t do alone.)

Describe a situation in which you saw a team member’s behaviors were in line with one or both of your organization’s values.
