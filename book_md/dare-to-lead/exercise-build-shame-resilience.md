## Exercise: Build Shame Resilience

Shame is a powerful feeling that can drive you to defensive behaviors if you don’t keep it in check by practicing shame resilience.

* * *

Describe a recent situation at work where you felt shame.

The first step of shame resilience is recognizing that shame is happening. What physical symptoms did the shame trigger in you?

The second step of shame resilience is seeing the big picture. Describe a similar tough situation that you’ve seen a team member experience in your workplace.

The third and fourth steps of shame resilience are connecting with others and talking about your shame. Think of someone you’d tell about this situation, and describe the event and your feelings to them. Remember to express what you need in support.
