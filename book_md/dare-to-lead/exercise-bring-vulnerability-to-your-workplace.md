## Exercise: Bring Vulnerability to Your Workplace

As a leader, you need to debunk the myths of vulnerability in your workplace—and be the first one to model how vulnerability can be allowed.

* * *

Think about how the myths of vulnerability show up in your workplace. What messages do you send about vulnerability? (Example: Risk is considered a weakness, not a brave learning opportunity—team members’ risky ideas are shut down with no consideration.)

How can you try being more vulnerable at work? (Example: Asking for help on projects instead of doing everything yourself.)
