## Exercise: Practice Empathy Skills

You and your team members can diminish shame and defensive behaviors in your organization by responding to shame with effective empathy.

* * *

Think of a time when someone shared shame with you, and you practiced “false empathy.” What was their experience, and how did you respond?

Think of the five elements of empathy (taking perspective, being nonjudgmental, understanding emotions and communicating your understanding, mindfulness). How could you have better responded, to demonstrate that you were willing to connect with them?
