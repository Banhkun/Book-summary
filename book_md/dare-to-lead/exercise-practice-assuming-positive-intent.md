## Exercise: Practice Assuming Positive Intent

You can build trust with your team members by assuming positive intent and rethinking how your actions may be getting in their way.

* * *

Think of a recent situation where a team member fell short of your expectations and you made a negative assumption about their intent.

Now rethink the situation, assuming the team member was trying their best. What other factors could explain why the team member fell short? How might your actions have gotten in their way?

Moving forward, how will you change your actions to avoid getting in the way of their work? Remember: assuming positive intent should reveal opportunities to clarify guidelines, set boundaries, and close skill/knowledge gaps.
