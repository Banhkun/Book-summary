## Chapter 1.3: Lowering Your Defenses

Often, leaders try to engineer vulnerability out of their work cultures because they believe that it will make their team members more efficient and less susceptible to emotions. **In fact, when organization members aren’t given the opportunity to face their vulnerability and think through their emotions, they allow their ego to take control and become _more_ susceptible to emotional reactivity. **The ego will adopt any behavior that might protect it from being bruised by negative emotions such as embarrassment or shame.

Leaders and their team members usually resort to one or several of 16 defensive behaviors—in this chapter, we’ll walk through how these behaviors present themselves, how they hold back your team, and how brave leaders take steps to discourage them and solve their sources.

### Behaviors to Avoid Difficult Emotions

#### Defense #1: Numbing Difficult Feelings

When prevented from engaging with negative emotions, team members may escape their feelings with numbing agents such as drinking, shopping, over-scheduling, gambling, and so on. Besides the obvious risk of addiction, this threatens their mental health because it’s not possible to choose _which_ emotions are numbed. Positive emotions are numbed along with the negative.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by regularly checking in with their emotional needs and finding healthy outlets for negative emotions, and teaching their team members how to do the same. This can be taught as a simple shift in thinking: rather than, “How can I make these feelings go away?” have your team members try, “What is the _source_ of how I’m feeling?” This shift replaces the need for a numbing vice with the choice of an appropriate comfort. For example, a team member might feel angry and indulge in a bottle of wine to cope. But if she were to explore the source of the feelings—she’s feeling irritable at the end of a hard day and needs some calming alone time—she can choose a more comforting outlet like putting on some favorite music and cooking a nutritious meal.

#### Defense #2: Avoiding Difficult and Awkward Situations

People tend to put off difficult or awkward situations—such as asking for a favor or facing a conflict—because the vulnerability of these situations is uncomfortable. It might feel easier to avoid the discomfort, but in the end, this avoidance is mentally exhausting and a waste of time. After all the time and energy spent, the difficult situation _still_ needs to be dealt with.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by showing their team members how to mentally prepare themselves to directly face vulnerable situations. This simply involves taking a moment to ask yourself: “What feelings are driving me to avoidance? What can I control? What do I need to accept is out of my control?” Walking through these questions provides clarity about the situation—the resulting sense of calm, rather than anxiety, makes the situation easier to face. Without this mental preparation, they’ll continue practicing avoidance, but this only leaves them prone to being caught by the situation when they’re emotionally and mentally unprepared for it.

### Behaviors to Prove Self-Worth

#### Defense #3: Overcompensating to Prove Worth

Team members who feel insecure about their value or place within your organization will often overcompensate to prove their worth. Overcompensation can present as the need to be right, or the pursuit of validation rather than self-improvement. Often, overcompensating team members slow down their colleagues by pushing themselves into projects where they’re not needed or their skillset isn’t helpful.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by giving positive feedback to their team members and reminding them of what particular value they bring to the organization. When team members feel secure about their worth, they focus on improving within their unique skill set rather than hustling for everyone’s attention and validation.

#### Defense #4: Attaching Self-Worth to Productivity

Team members insecure with their inherent value might attach their self-worth to their productivity. They’re _too_ hard-working, never taking a break for anything they deem “unproductive,” such as vacations or hobbies. This over-productivity is often damaging—our brains require downtime in order to learn new things, exercise creativity and innovation, and simply rest. If a team member is never “off,” she’s putting herself at very high risk for depression, anxiety, or burnout. Furthermore, over-productive attitudes are contagious among colleagues and spur everyone to overwork themselves—leaving you with a team of burnt-out, undercreative people.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by setting healthy boundaries among their team members. Start this process by setting boundaries for yourself, such as, “I won’t reply to emails on the weekend.” These boundaries should be extended to your team members—if _you_ don’t want to receive weekend emails, you shouldn’t be sending _them_ weekend emails. Once you’ve demonstrated your commitment to your boundaries, encourage your team members to make their own.

If you have team members who brag about exhaustion, or working through their time off, be careful not to reward them—this can be obvious, as with praise for hard work, or subtle, as with engaging with their overproductivity and allowing them to work during their time off. Instead, talk to these team members and emphasize your expectation that they prioritize downtime. Explain why downtime is important to them and the organization as a whole, and help them set healthy boundaries.

#### Defense #5: Suppressing Authenticity to Fit In

In a work culture based on the status quo and “fitting in,” team members might feel that they need to suppress their authentic selves in order to be respected and heard. Naturally, this calls into question the authenticity of their colleagues—who are likely _also_ suppressing their authentic selves—and diminishes trust. Furthermore, a lack of diversity in an organization prevents the discovery of the new perspectives and ideas essential to a thriving innovative culture.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by committing themselves to the inclusion of diverse perspectives.**** You can start by becoming more aware of your privilege and biases. Ask yourself: “Does everyone on my team look like me? Does everyone have the same background? Is there anyone I overlook in meetings because they’re not the same as everyone else?”

This line of questioning can be tough. It’s hard to see what prejudices you might be unconsciously holding, but you need to rely on your commitment to brave leadership to acknowledge and work against these blind spots. If you find that there are team members whose perspectives and ideas you favor, spend time recognizing the efforts and value of those you tend to overlook.

#### Defense #6: Looking for Self-Worth Externally

Team members with no sense of self-worth often try to fill the space with power or validation by taking credit for work or ideas that aren’t theirs, comparing themselves to others, and needing to be right all the time. These behaviors inhibit innovation and learning, confidence-building, and the ability to recover from setbacks.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by reminding those team members displaying a lack of self-worth of the unique value they bring to the organization. If you don’t address the self-worth problem directly, your team member will continue holding themselves—and the organization—back by avoiding any risk of failure and trying to prove that they’re never wrong and better than everyone else.

### Behaviors to Keep Others at a Distance

#### Defense #7: The “Kill Or Be Killed” Mentality

Unhealthy work cultures pit team members against one another—in these environments, any show of vulnerability is seen as failure. This mentality is toxic to innovative settings because it’s void of meaningful collaboration and self-improvement, instead focused on gaining approval.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by rewarding those who show vulnerability and collaborate, not compete, with others. You can accomplish this by identifying team members who ask for feedback on their ideas, ask for help from others, and are transparent about their mistakes. Reward these team members with recognition for their commitment to self-improvement—meaningful recognition depends on the team member, but it can look like a shoutout at a meeting, a promotion, or a shift in focus onto more meaningful projects.

#### Defense #8: Cynicism and Sarcasm

In response to negative emotions, team members might put up a snide, detached, or suspicious front that lets them avoid engagement with these feelings or with other people. This approach of cynicism and sarcasm usually turns work relationships sour, because it stirs up feelings of anger, resentment, and confusion. Other people might distrust them—“What does she really mean when she’s saying ‘great work’?”—or they might become distrusting of others—“My colleague is purposely slowing down this project to make me look bad.”

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by rewarding clear communication while refusing to allow or engage with cynicism or sarcasm. With the knowledge that team members usually resort to cynicism and sarcasm when they’re hiding feelings like fear or inadequacy, you can open up an honest conversation with them about the difficult emotions they’re dealing with.

#### Defense #9: Criticism

Team members who feel inadequate or afraid often criticize others as a way to shift negative attention from themselves onto someone else. Unmitigated criticism is toxic in an innovative culture, because the fear of backlash or ridicule stops team members from contributing ideas or breaking the status quo.

When trying to weed criticism out of your organization, you need to listen carefully—criticism isn’t always obvious. There are two ways that people veil criticism: clinging to the past and the royal “we.”

  * Clinging to the past usually sounds like, “We’ve always done it this way.” Mentioning how things have always been done doesn’t _sound_ like criticism, but it still expresses that an idea isn’t worth thinking about. 
  * The royal “we” presents the opinion of an unknown majority, such as, “We don’t think that’s the right strategy for this project.” By pretending that their comment is the opinion of _everyone_ , the critic escapes the pressure of having to expose his __ own opinion to feedback.



**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by counterbalancing criticism with contribution. You can easily achieve a healthy contribution and criticism balance by establishing a new policy stating that team members can’t criticize without offering their own point of view or idea.

#### Defense #10: Abusing Power Dynamics

Power is not inherently dangerous, but it becomes dangerous when it’s used to protect a higher-ranked minority while disadvantaging the majority. This protection of the minority causes resentment and resistance among the majority. Yet, the cycle never breaks—as members of the disadvantaged minority are promoted to higher levels of power, they begin to feel that they have more value than those at the bottom. They choose to abuse their power to benefit themselves and their perceived higher value.

**Brave leadership combats this behavior** by reassuring their team members that they all have power, at any level. This stops the abuse of power at higher levels, because people aren’t given the idea that they’re somehow more valuable. It also calms the resentment at lower levels, because people are no longer being disadvantaged by abuse of power, and understand their agency and value in organization. This can be accomplished by reminding team members at all levels that they possess three types of power: power _with_ , power _to_ , and power _within_.

  * **Power _with_ : **Team members are reminded of the larger purpose of their work, which pushes them to support one another and collaborate in order to maximize their collective power.
  * **Power _to_ : **Team members are given the freedom and power to exercise their skills and knowledge as they see fit.
  * **Power _within_ : **Team members are reminded of their unique value and power, and are subsequently able to appreciate the skills and knowledge of others without feeling threatened.



### Behaviors to Avoid Failure & Mistakes

#### Defense #11: Perfectionism

Team members resort to perfectionism to protect themselves from the embarrassment and shame that come from experiencing failure, being criticized, or not living up to the expectations of others. Perfectionism prevents team members from taking on challenges and risks that foster progress and learning, which are crucial to an innovative culture.

Perfectionism is an ongoing cycle that worsens over time—they try to be perfect, inevitably fail, and conclude that it was because they weren’t perfect enough. As the cycle continues and failures inevitably pile up, the team member takes smaller and smaller risks so that they can achieve perfection _every_ time.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by having open and honest conversations with their teams about the drawbacks of perfectionism, and present the idea of _healthy striving_. Perfectionism is external and focuses on the perceptions of others—it looks like, “What will people think of me and my work?” On the contrary, healthy striving is internal and focuses on self-improvement—it looks like, “How can I be better?”

#### Defense #12: Needing to Be Right

Insecure team members might feel that their value lies in being right all the time. This presents as refusal to admit mistakes, rejection of others’ answers, and making up answers instead of saying, “I don’t know.” This behavior pulls down everyone who needs to work with the always-right team member, for several reasons. Firstly, they’re likely to cover up their mistakes, which creates distrust and misinformation. Secondly, their “ _my_ way is the _only_ way” mindset leads to poor, ego-based decision making. And thirdly, team members who need to be right are usually in constant conflict with anyone who disagrees with them.

As a leader, it’s possible that you’re exacerbating this problem by valuing certain people as “always right,” which takes away the power of other, less tenured people to contribute diverse ideas. Imagine that someone who’s an expert in their field joins your company. Six months in, she has yet to contribute to a _single_ meeting because your company’s culture dictates that only the ideas and opinions of long-term leaders are valued. You’ve missed out on valuable insight and discussion by creating a culture that discredits new perspectives.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by having an honest conversation with the always-right team member about their issue, and offering suggestions for improvement. For example, you could say, “I appreciate that you always have answers to problems, but I think you should work on asking good questions as well. Developing curiosity and thinking critically is what will help you thrive on this team.”

Furthermore, you should recognize team members who are committed to learning—they ask questions often and admit when they don’t have an immediate answer. By recognition for these behaviors, you can demonstrate to your team that there’s no value in always _being_ right, but rather in continued effort to _learn_ to do things right.

### Behaviors in Conflict With Brave Leadership

**When identifying defensive behaviors in your organization, don’t forget to look in the mirror. While the first 12 defenses focused on team member behaviors, the next 4 will focus on behaviors that ego-driven leaders are susceptible to.**

#### Defense #13: Refusing to Celebrating Achievements

Joy is wonderful to have, but it can be lost at any moment. Because of joy’s vulnerability, we can feel vaguely threatened by it, and respond by refusing to engage with it—thinking that doing so will protect us from inevitable disappointment or hurt. Refusal to engage with joy usually shows up in two different ways in the workplace:

  * Teams hesitate to celebrate their accomplishments or take a breather before moving on to their next challenge. There’s a fear that the moment they let their guard down, something bad will happen. 
  * Leaders hold back from giving positive recognition to their team members for a job well done. They fear that praise might be misunderstood as permission to stop striving for improvement.



If your team members never have the opportunity to rest or feel pride in their work, they will quickly become burned out and disengaged from the work.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by acknowledging that something bad might happen or their employees may stop striving, and then choosing to celebrate the achievements of their team anyway. When you recognize your team members’ efforts and achievements regularly and sincerely, they usually don’t become complacent. Instead, recognition increases their engagement and satisfaction with their work.

(Shortform note: To learn more about how recognizing and celebrating your team’s “moments of pride” can boost their engagement and motivation, read our summary of The Power of Moments.)

#### Defense #14: Controlling Instead of Leading

Leaders that feel insecure about their ability to lead a team often try to wield their power in a controlling manner. There are two main behaviors that controlling leaders resort to:

  * The first controlling behavior is **micromanaging** —you over-structure the work of your team and shave their projects down to mundane to-do lists. Anyone who doesn’t follow your instructions exactly is punished. Controlling your team in this way erases the big-picture context of their work and stifles creativity. If your team isn’t motivated by their interest in the work, but rather by fear of punishment, they’ll disengage and underperform.
  * The second controlling behavior is **holding onto authority while pushing responsibilities off onto team members** —you hand off tasks to your team members without ensuring that they have the authority to accomplish said tasks. Their inevitable failure to deliver causes you to assume that they can’t be trusted. As a result, you start giving them smaller, mundane tasks and adopting an “I’ll just do it myself” attitude about larger tasks. This causes resentment for both parties—they’re resentful about being punished for something out of their control, and you’re resentful about only being able to trust yourself. 



**Brave leaders combat the first controlling behavior** by giving their team autonomy and reminding them of the larger purpose of their work. You can do this by sharing your hopes and vision for the organization, and explaining what you’re working toward. Correct your reliance on fear-based motivation by recognizing and rewarding work that’s moving in the right direction, instead of punishing work that’s “wrong.”

**Brave leaders combat the second controlling behavior** by thoroughly discussing expectations and capabilities with team members. These discussions should have the goal of clarifying _exactly_ what a successfully finished task looks like. This allows you to identify where responsibility and authority might be misaligned, and reassess each person’s responsibilities.

Imagine telling a team member, “I need the ad mockup for the meeting at 4.” If your team member has the space for discussion, they have the opportunity to ask, “What do you need _exactly_? Just the one mockup?” At this point, you may realize that you actually need two versions of the ad with two different themes, and copy for each—a much different result than you’d originally asked for. Now, your team member knows exactly what needs to be done, and where their lack of authority will get in the way. They say, “To get it done by 4, I’ll need you to tell graphics it’s priority. We’ll also need a short meeting at 2 to approve the images and copy.”

If you’d left the conversation at “I need the ad mockup by 4,” you would have ended up with an incomplete ad mockup, or a result far below your true expectations.

#### Defense #15: Using Fear and Uncertainty for Control

In times of uncertainty, leaders might weaponize fear to their advantage instead of talking through the emotions with their teams. For example, a leader of a company dealing with financial troubles might use the threat of layoffs to motivate team members to work longer hours for no increased pay. In the short term, fear is a strong motivator, but in the long term, it will manifest as a number of defensive behaviors we've explored, such as numbing, perfectionism, and unmitigated criticism.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by supporting team members through fear and uncertainty without using it to their advantage. As we explored in the myths of vulnerability, you can effectively communicate about uncertainty to your team by acknowledging fear, giving as much information as you can, and creating a space for discussion. This relieves your team, reducing their defensive behaviors, and builds up their trust in you, which is a strong long-term motivator.

#### Defense #16: Collecting Accolades, Instead of Giving Them Out

In the early stages of your career, it’s okay to keep tabs on the “gold stars” you receive for work well done, or for improving skills. This is useful for discovering your self-worth and knowing what value you bring to the workplace. However, insecure leaders who continue focusing on getting validation even after they move up the ranks are distracted from the goal of leadership. They should be giving out validation and helping team members understand their value.

**Brave leaders combat this behavior** by committing themselves fully to the work of leadership and the advancement of their team. When you transition into a leadership role, you need to reorganize your priorities. You should no longer be focused on gathering validation for yourself, but rather focused on recognizing the work of your team members, reminding them of their unique skills, and looking for ways to help them reach their potential, such as with networking or work opportunities.
