## Chapter 1.2: Having the Courage to Start Hard Conversations

Leadership naturally demands that you engage in difficult conversations where you give and receive feedback, or bring up emotional issues that your team is facing.**** These conversations often stir up fear and uncertainty—you can’t control how they will go, and often they depend on a great deal of emotional exposure.

It’s tempting to shy away from the uncertainty of these conversations. **Facing vulnerability, however, grants you the courage to approach these conversations with honesty and clarity—your guiding principle in difficult conversations should be that it’s kind to be clear, and unkind to be unclear.** This ensures productive conversations that foster learning and give you necessary insight to best serve your team.

First, we’ll look at how this principle should guide feedback sessions, and then we’ll discuss how you can depend on clarity of language to open conversations about difficult or awkward emotions.

### Giving and Receiving Clear Feedback

Often, people give feedback that is polite, but dishonest. Their argument is that giving polite feedback is the nice thing to do—but the real motive isn’t so altruistic. In fact, people give polite feedback because it’s easier and more comfortable for _them_. Dishonesty allows them to avoid the discomfort of telling someone they’re not performing to their standards.

**Dishonest, polite feedback is unkind because it’s unfair—the recipient receives no indication that they need to improve, yet they’re held accountable for their lack of improvement. Moreover, it wastes time and creates frustration as the same unaddressed problems continue to crop up.**

The natural remedy to this issue is to start giving direct, honest feedback. Be aware that doing so might be a difficult adjustment to your team if you’ve created a culture where polite but dishonest feedback is the norm. To avoid having your team shut down or get defensive in response to this new type of feedback, volunteer yourself as the first honest feedback recipient.

Go into this first feedback session with two goals in mind: to model a thoughtful response to hard feedback and demonstrate honest feedback’s productive outcome. You can open the feedback session by asking your team how you can better lead them. They will likely default to “nice and polite,” so be prepared to suggest areas of improvement and ask about their experiences working with you—ask for specifics, and keep pushing until you receive an honest answer.

Once you have feedback to work with, your session should have four parts: 1) be curious, 2) take a step back, 3) question your motives, and 4) share your thoughts.

  1. **Be curious.** It’s easy to get defensive and push back or shut down when hearing about your problems. Resist this instinct by asking for clarification. 
  2. **Take a step back.** Ask for time away to think about what’s been said, consider how it’s made you feel, and figure out what the root of the issue might be. Be careful in how you present your need for some space. Many people speed through the discomfort of negative feedback, wrapping up the conversation with a vague and dismissive “Okay, I’ll think about that.” Knowing this, you can avoid sending a dismissive message by clarifying that you want time to think through the problem so you can come back and continue the conversation with your findings.
  3. **Question your motives.** Ask yourself what could be motivating your behavior—what is the _real_ problem?
  4. **Share your thoughts.** Come back to the team and share your thoughts. This is an especially vulnerable step—it’s difficult to expose the emotional issues causing your behavior. It would be much easier and more comfortable to put the blame elsewhere, but your brave leadership role is to be as honest as possible. Exposing the root of the problem allows your team to help you think of productive solutions. 



#### Example: Feedback on Time Management Skills

Your team tells you that you lack time management skills and that you keep asking your team to accomplish projects on impossible deadlines. You ask them to tell you more about how your tight deadlines affect them and their work, and take notes. You thank them and ask for a follow-up meeting the next day after you’ve had some time to think. In your follow-up meeting, you share your insight: when you set tight deadlines, you are usually feeling anxiety that a competitor will “do it first,” and you are thinking of multiple projects and deadlines that you haven’t communicated to your team. The problem isn’t time management—it’s anxiety and lack of communication. Your team comes up with a solution—when new projects are put on the table, everyone writes down how long they think the project will take and how it should be prioritized alongside current projects. They then share their estimates as a group and create deadlines and priorities that work for everyone.

### Talking About Difficult Feelings

Beyond honest conversations surrounding feedback, brave leaders need to engage in honest conversations surrounding difficult or awkward emotions. **These conversations are necessary to a thriving work culture—if you don’t invest time in them, you will end up wasting time addressing problematic behaviors that team members rely on to cover up their difficult emotions.**

These conversations require the vulnerability of _using the right language._ In workplaces, language is usually sanitized and disconnected from the very real emotions that team members experience and need to work through

Brave leadership doesn’t allow team members to fall back on describing “easy” emotions to avoid their true, difficult emotions. Brave leadership puts the correct language to the feeling, and it allows space for discussion. This is much easier said than done—using the right language can make people feel _very_ emotionally exposed, which is uncomfortable for both parties.

Once you open up these honest conversations around emotions, you need to be brave enough to stay in the discomfort that comes with them. You can best do this by simply listening, resisting the temptation to talk away the discomfort or come up with answers. By allowing space and silence in the conversation, you let people discover the true core of their emotions and behaviors by themselves.

For example, Colonel Dede Halfhill of the Air Force regularly opens honest conversations with her airmen about their emotions. She started the practice years ago, when her airmen started asking to slow down operations because they were tired. In response, she told them about a study she’d read that showed that high levels of loneliness often manifest as exhaustion. This prompted an honest discussion about loneliness in the Air Force and her methods of support. Consequently, Halfhill stopped giving isolated time off for exhaustion and started focusing on connection and inclusion.

**Honest conversations are difficult, but crucial to serving your team members and getting ahead of the emotions that often manifest in defensive behaviors that are toxic to innovative cultures.**
