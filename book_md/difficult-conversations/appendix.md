## Appendix: Ten Common Questions About Difficult Conversations

The authors included a list of 10 common questions they receive about _Difficult Conversations_ , and how they’d respond to these questions.

### Q1: Is Everything Relative?

Q: Are you saying everything is relative? Aren’t things sometimes _true_ , and aren’t people sometimes _wrong_ about their opinions?

A: Facts are facts. Everything else is everything else.

Facts aren’t relative — but **it can be hard to distinguish between what’s fact and what’s subjective.** You can measure facts and verify them. But opinions, judgments, values, assumptions, interests, predictions — these are all subjective and are not facts. It’s crucial during a difficult conversation to be able to distinguish between facts and everything else.

For example, if you get a $30 bill at dinner and leave a 15% tip of $6, it’s a _fact_ that you’ve done the math wrong: a 15% tip would be $4.50. However, if you’re at dinner with someone who leaves a 15% tip and you tell them that 20% tips are the appropriate amount, that’s an opinion, not a fact. Even if you’re opinion is based on a survey that says 20% is the usual amount that people tip — the survey is a fact, but your judgment is still subjective

People also disagree about what is true. No matter how true we think someone is, someone else in the world will feel completely different. Maybe instead of wondering whether there are absolute truths, we should wonder whether humans are even capable of perceiving absolute truths. Our existence is subjective in and of itself: maybe the only absolute truth we can be sure of is that _there are no truths we can be absolutely sure of._

The more passionately we feel about things, the less likely we are to view people who disagree with us as three-dimensional human beings. But ask yourself how you would feel if the reverse was true: If someone else thinks your views are evil, do you think they’re acknowledging the complexity of who you are as a person? Do you think the information they receive about you and your views is fair, balanced, and empathetic, or do you think it’s shallow, sensationalized, and simplified? This might make you realize you’re being narrow-minded.

### Q2: What About Bad Intentions?

Q: What if the other person _is_ trying to lie, bully me, or ruin the conversation to get what they want?

A: Sometimes people _do_ have bad intentions. However, remember that you can’t control how someone else behaves. You can only control how you respond to their bad intentions.

**Don’t reward their bad behavior by giving over.** Bowing out of the conversation to avoid the difficulty will only reinforce that their behavior pays off, and they’ll keep doing the same thing whenever they want something.

**Don’t respond by falling to their level.** You’ll ruin your own reputation by doing the same thing they’ve done. A lie in response to a lie just makes you both liars.

**Do try to understand why they’re behaving that way.** Though some people do have bad intentions, most people have reasons and justifications for why they behave certain ways. Only once you understand where they’re coming from can you begin to persuade them that there are other ways to deal with the issue.

When all else fails, **name the dynamic and spell out the consequences.** Make it clear that you understand what they’re doing and clarify what that is, and then talk them through how it’s impacting you and what you’re going to do if they continue to behave this way.

### Q3: Difficult People

Q: Aren’t some people _actually_ more difficult to deal with? What about mental illness?

A: Some people are absolutely more difficult to deal with than others, whether there’s mental illness in the picture or not. The communication skills you’ve learned in this summary will still help you deal with even the most difficult people.

#### Mental Illness

Remember that, similar to the last question, **mental illness often has its own logic that is beyond the victim’s control.** **They’re not deliberately trying to frustrate others.**

For example, someone suffering from OCD feels like they _have_ to complete certain routines or there will be negative consequences. Even if the consequences are imagined, completing the rituals is their attempt to protect themselves. This is a logical thought pattern.

Remember that you cannot control how other people act, and you can’t guarantee an outcome when dealing with other people.

#### What to Try for Difficult People

**Clarify that you’re trying to _help_ them, not _fix_ them.** People want to be understood, acknowledged, and cared for — if they feel like you’re trying to fix them, that implies that they’re broken or bad, and they’ll probably get defensive despite your intentions.

**Go for a “Big Reframe.”** If you’ve listened, you should have a decent idea of what’s underlying the difficult behavior, and you can try to bring a big picture idea into the conversation that speaks to that issue.

  * For example, your aunt might complain incessantly about your mother. You might agree that your mom can be difficult sometimes (we all can be), but then remind your aunt that your mother loves her, and you know she loves your mother, and that’s important to remember. This acknowledges your aunt’s feelings, then shifts the conversation to an empathy focus instead.



**Remember that people have their blind spots.** If you have an employee who’s gotten negative feedback about her combative demeanor at work, it’s possible that your employee doesn’t know what constitutes combative behavior, and isn’t aware of when she’s behaving that way. This is why it’s crucial to **make sure people have all the information, especially the information missing from their story**.

**Focus on the alternate view and its implications.** Especially when people get wrapped up in whether something’s true or not, ask them to think through what it would mean if the opposite view _was_ true?

**Remember that aggression usually stems from fear.** It’s easy to be upset with someone when we think they’re mad for no reason; it’s harder to be upset with someone if you assume they’re acting out of fear.

**Speak to joint contribution.** People aren’t difficult in a vacuum — acknowledge what you might have contributed to the situation in the hopes that this might cool them down and help them open up to an understanding of their own contribution.

Finally, remember that**patience and persistence go a long way in difficult conversations.** If you know someone’s difficult, set aside more time to talk with them. The more you can keep a level head, the more productive the conversation can be. The more mental prep work you’ve done on your own end before heading into the conversation, the more persistent you can be with someone who needs bigger pushes to get to breakthroughs.

### Q4: What About Bosses?

Q: What about people who have all the power in a situation, like bosses?

A: It’s true that in some situations one party will have much more say over the outcome of a difficult conversation. In these situations, **focus on the power of influence over action**.

You can’t fire your boss, but she can fire you. Acknowledging up front that your boss has the power to make the decision might actually make her more open to hearing your ideas — she knows this isn’t a conversation about whether you get to do something or not.

**Make sure you’re coming from a place of requesting — and clarify how it benefits your boss.** “I’ve been thinking that X change might have a positive impact on Y output. What would you think about a change like that?” A statement like this is a request that your superior consider something, and might make them more receptive to your suggestion.

**Listen to your boss.** This is an especially good tip for bosses who seem to shut everything down right away. Ask questions, try to learn what’s influencing their decision, and listen to what they have to say.

#### Reluctant or Abusive Bosses

If your boss is unenthusiastic about talking to you, try these steps:

  * **Get on your boss’ calendar for the necessary amount of time.** Hit-and-run conversations won’t help.
  * **Start from the third story and clarify why your boss should _want_ to talk about it.** “I’d like to discuss how we raise issues in the workplace, since I think the current method is negatively affecting team morale and productivity.”
  * **Get your boss’ advice on how to deal with your boss.** The best person to turn to for information on your boss is your boss. “I’d like to discuss the best way to proceed if we disagree in a meeting. What’s your advice?”
  * **If your boss thinks talking about issues is a sign of weakness or incompetence, do your research and prepare your materials beforehand.** Make your boss the last line of defense in solving the issue, and make sure you demonstrate you’ve exhausted all other resources.



If your boss gets verbally, emotionally (or physically) abusive:

  * **Deal with them only when you have to**. Develop other relationships at work. Avoid triggering your boss whenever possible.
  * **Familiarize yourself with formal channels and protective structure in your organization.** HR might be able to help, or if you’re a member of a union you can file a formal complaint. Several workers or departments at your company can unite to bring up the issue.



### Q5: I’m the Boss, Do What I Say

Q: What if _I’m_ the boss or parent — can’t I tell my employees or children what to do?

A: You absolutely can. It’s a common misconception (and a frustrating one to the authors of the book) that _Difficult Conversations_ says you shouldn’t make decisions or execute them, all you should do is listen, that everyone has to agree before you can move forward. This is not true.

The authors place such importance on listening because **failure to listen is a far more common mistake than failure to decide and assert.** Simply telling people what to do only works in some scenarios. But sometimes, ordering people around won’t be successful — that’s when this information comes in handy.

One thing authority figures can do to reduce the need for difficult conversations is to **clarify when something is a command and when it’s something else.** Be clear about when you are making a decision and telling someone what that decision is.

Then also be clear when you are doing something else. Because you’re the authority figure, you set the expectations for interactions. Be clear when you’re:

  * Consulting someone to get their input and factor it into your decision.
  * Collaborating with them or negotiating with them, and hoping to decide together.
  * Delegating the decision to them (and consequently leaving it up to their judgment).



We said in previous chapters that listening and asking questions is the best place to start from — but**questions only help us when we want to learn, while statements help us when we need to convey information.**

  * If you know you’re firing an employee, don’t bring them in and ask how they think the job is going. You have a clear purpose, and that is to fire your employee. But you can deliver that news upfront (refer back to Chapter 14 about delivering bad news) and still use the principles in this book to have a productive conversation in the aftermath of the statement.



### Q6: Is This Approach Too American?

Q: This is an American approach to conversation. Can it work in other cultures?

A: While cultures may vary in terms of how they handle difficult conversations, the authors of the book found that **the structure of difficult conversations remains the same around the globe.** Difficult conversations in any culture are always about what happened, the feelings involved, and each person’s identity.

But every culture has its norms of how to approach difficult conversations. The principles in this summary can be applied and filtered through your own cultural norms to help you be clearer and more direct in difficult conversations.

Additionally, because of the growing multinational context of our world and business cultures, **the principles learned here can help people from different cultures be more sensitive to their impact on each other and more communicative about their intentions and feelings** , leading to more effective and productive conversations across cultures.

### Q7: Phone and Email Conversations

Q: What should I do in conversations that aren’t face-to-face? Or even in phone calls?

A: Email and text messages deprive us of many key elements for effective communication: facial expression, vocal intonation, body language. They also don’t allow for interruption or interaction, or clarification in the moment. They’re distinctly one-sided.

Though we tend to think of these forms of communication as less emotional, the opposite is true: **these forms are actually more challenging precisely _because_ they’re still emotional and lack the aforementioned information. **Does that exclamation mark suggest excitement or sarcasm? Are these words in all caps because the person’s communicating anger or emphasis?

#### Tips for Reading Emails or Texts

Keep in mind that **you don’t know exactly how they intended things to come off** — better to assume they had good intentions than bad.

If you find yourself getting emotional reading an email or text, **stop reading**. This is the luxury of impersonal communication — we can put it away at any time.

**Call them or schedule a meeting to respond**. Remember that the difficulty with emails or texts goes both ways. If you send an email or text back, they can misinterpret what you have to say. Trying to resolve issues over text or email turns into a vicious cycle, and rarely gets anywhere productive.

#### Tips for Writing or Responding to Emails or Texts

**Be extremely explicit about your intentions, reasoning, and emotional states if appropriate.** The more you can contextualize what you’re writing, the less chance there is for the receiver to misinterpret your words.

**Let someone know if it’s going to take you awhile to respond.** Better to send a short “I’ll respond to this email in a few days when I’m not traveling anymore” note or something similar to ease the other person’s mind. Silence can cause people to assume you’ve had a bad reaction or that you don’t care.

**Check in about intentions if possible.** If you receive an email or text that leaves you unsure about how someone meant something, ask them to clarify what they intended before responding.

If all else fails, **ask for missing information, more thoughts, or rationale.** You can try to have a difficult conversation over text or email, but you’ll need to try the same steps — find out where they’re coming from, and learn as much as possible before you form your response.

### Q8: Emotions in the Workplace

Q: Should people really bring their emotions into the workplace? Shouldn’t business be about merit and productivity?

A: Humans have emotions; there’s no way around them. People have emotional reactions, even at work — maybe even _especially_ at work since we pour a fair amount of our lives into it. **Ignoring feelings or casting them out of the workplace is not only inadvisable, it’s nearly impossible.**

But there are more appropriate and less appropriate ways to handle them and address them at the workplace.

Here are a few pointers on sharing your emotions:

  * Make sure your workplace benefits from your sharing emotions.
  * Find the appropriate time, place, and context to share them.
  * Sharing your emotions emotionally by crying, yelling, or throwing fits is generally unprofessional, and can make you look out-of-control. Discussing your feelings maturely and with some distance will be more productive.



As a recipient of emotions, **the main fear about allowing emotions into the workplace is that the only way to deal with someone’s feelings is to give them what they want.** But addressing emotions in the workplace can 1) prevent them from overwhelming people at work and 2) favoring acknowledgement over “fixing” the feeling.

  * Example: Your employee is mad about not getting a promotion, and if she brings it up, the only option you have is to give her a promotion to quiet her down. False. If you hear her out about her anger, it can lead to a conversation about what she’s expecting and why versus how she’s performing and other influential factors. Instead of fixing her anger, this option acknowledges it and uses it for learning and understanding.



### Q9: It Takes Too Much Time

Q: Who’s actually got the time to do this in real life?

A: No one. We’d all rather be doing anything else than struggling to learn about our annoying neighbors and why their dogs won’t stop barking. Difficult conversations are difficult — they’re emotionally exhausting, uncertain, and unappealing.

But life comes down to spending your time better. **In situations where difficult conversations are needed, you’re most likely already spending time and energy on the issue.** If we added up all the time we spend on issues complaining, replaying scenes in our head, and lying awake at night, the reality is that having a difficult conversation would probably save us time in the long run.

The more you practice the principles from this book, the faster and more adept you’ll get at having difficult conversations and the less time you’ll spend on them.

### Q10: I Can’t Get Past the Identity Conversation

Q: I go back and forth between thinking I’m perfect or thinking I’m horrible, and I can’t seem to break out of that binary identity conversation. What should I do?

A: The Identity Conversation is the intersection of our natural wiring, past experiences, and how we interpret information. For the time being, we can’t change our wiring and we can’t change what’s happened in the past — but **we can change how we interpret information, and what stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and our experiences.**

**Our identities are usually formed by our relationships to other people** , but then they become second nature to us. And people don’t respond particularly well to change: if you’re the peacekeeper in your family and then suddenly start creating conflict by expressing your personal desires, chances are high that you’ll get negative feedback from your family, and feel pressured to return to your old identity. Personal issues we face are usually products of this warped identity experience.

  * For example, a middle child who gets rewarded for keeping the peace between her family members has an identity practically forced on her — she’s the peacekeeper. She grows into an adult whose friends cherish her ability to solve problems or stay calm during stressful situations, but she finds it hard now to express her own desires or any strong emotion.



#### Tips for Working on Identity

**Explore where the identity came from, and reevaluate it.** Sometime in your life, something or someone taught you to be the way you are. Who was it? What was the situation? What were the benefits of learning that way to be?

When we say you can change the story you tell yourself, there’s a limit on how much you can healthily do this. Processing your experiences and changing your story about them isn’t about creating new, fake stories to take their place. It’s about **contextualizing the events that created this identity, acknowledging that we’re more complex than any one identity, and in some cases mourning for the way things played out.**

  * (Shortform example: The middle child can’t make herself into an only child who got whatever she wanted whenever she wanted — but she can discover that her parents were less than stellar at handling conflict and all too happy to let her do it, that it isn’t any one person’s responsibility to keep the peace for everyone else, and that she maybe had to grow up too quickly as the peacekeeper to enjoy her childhood.)



Remember that **humans are complex and flawed**. We’ve all been lazy, and we’ve all been motivated. We’ve all shown strength and weakness. In fact, over the course of a day we exhibit thousands of opposite and contradictory behaviors.

**We can help broaden our identity by creating positive experiences in the direction of our weaknesses.**

  * For example, if you know you have a hard time taking criticism because you’re a perfectionist, try on the identity of someone who loves learning from feedback. Ask your boss or colleagues to give you constructive feedback so that you can practice this other identity. If you genuinely try to be someone who loves feedback, you’ll probably feel more positive about it and learn more from it.



**Ask people to hold you accountable and reinforce behaviors you want to develop.**

  * Be upfront with your boss that you have a hard time taking criticism, and that if you seem like you’re getting defensive, he can remind you that you’re working on learning to love feedback as an opportunity to learn. You can also ask him to verbally reinforce you if he notices you accepting feedback and learning from it.



Lastly, **treat yourself with empathy.** Life is hard. We make mistakes. The more we can accept ourselves for the whole picture of who we are, good and bad, and forgive ourselves, the more balanced we’ll feel about ourselves and the more opportunities we’ll have for growth.
