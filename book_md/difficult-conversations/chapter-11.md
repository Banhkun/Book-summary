## Chapter 11: Controlling a Difficult Conversation for a Better Outcome

In an ideal world, everyone you enter into a difficult conversation with would have read this book and can deftly and productively handle the conversation. But that is rarely going to be the case.

More often, you’ll enter into a difficult conversation with someone who does all the wrong things. Your goal is understanding, theirs is being right. You acknowledge contribution, they blame.

You can still have a productive difficult conversation with someone who hasn’t read this book — you do it by **leading the conversation**. There are three “power moves” that can help you lead the conversation in spite of the other person’s lack of cooperation: reframing, listening, and naming the dynamic.

### Reframing

Reframing is **listening to the other person’s contributions and translating them into more helpful ones.** It usually uses the Three Conversations as the translation categories.

Reframing helps keep a conversation on track when the other person is heading down a destructive path, and helps you translate negative statements into useful ones. And it almost always works: anything the other person says, you can usually reframe it as a helpful contribution to a learning conversation.

You can reframe:

  * Facts or truths as differing stories.
  * Accusations as impact and intention.
  * Blame as contribution.
  * Judgments as feelings.
  * Comments about what’s wrong with you as insight into what’s happening to them.



Some examples of how to reframe:

  * “It’s all your fault” can be reframed as “I know I’ve contributed to the issue — we both have. Instead of focusing on whose fault it is, can we explore how we both got here?”
  * “I’m not a bad neighbor” can be reframed as “I don’t think you are either, and I hope you don’t think I’m a bad neighbor. I think we disagree about how this issue should be handled, and I think even good neighbors sometimes disagree on how to handle things. I’m hoping we can work together to make sure both our concerns are addressed.”



Though a single sentence can’t turn a whole conversation around, hopefully, these examples give you an idea of how to reframe constructively.

You can also **use the And Stance to help reframe issues between you and another person.** This can help you incorporate the other person’s perspective and still share your own.

  * For example, a mother reacted badly to her adopted daughter wanting to find her birth mother: “You won’t find what you’re looking for and you’ll just get hurt.” The daughter can use the And Stance to reframe this comment: “You might be right, I might put a ton of time and energy into it and not find anything, or find something that upsets me, _and_ I still feel like I have to try. Here’s why…”



### Listening

**As discussed before, listening** allows you to understand the other person’s perspective, which will always be constructive for you.

Most of us assume that listening is a passive role, but it can be very active. When you listen, you get information that is crucial to directing the conversation. If they get emotional, listen and acknowledge their feelings. If they refuse to accept your version of the story, paraphrase what you’re getting from their story and ask them questions about their perspective. If they accuse you of something, try to understand where they’re coming from before you defend yourself.

If you get overwhelmed in a conversation, or if you aren’t sure how to proceed, ask them questions, and listen.

### Naming the Dynamic

Naming the dynamic is essentially bringing into the conversation what’s happening _in_ the conversation. It allows you to **articulate the trouble spots of the conversation** , and is especially useful when the other person won’t follow your example and hogs the conversation.

Naming the dynamic can help clear the air between you by cutting to the core of what’s going on in the conversation in the present. However, it can also take the conversation off course, and can sometimes escalate tension — so **it’s probably best to use it as a last resort**.

Here are examples of naming the dynamic constructively:

  * Self-sabotaging: The other person could be bringing up an issue when they don’t have time to talk about it. You could say, “I’ve observed that we always run out of time whenever we get into this conversation. Could we set aside a designated hour when we can really sit down and focus on this?”
  * The other person refuses to hear your side of things. You could say, “I’ve tried three times now to say what I felt, but you keep talking over me. I’m not sure if you’re aware you’re doing it, but I’m getting frustrated. If there’s something important you’re saying that I’m not understanding, please share what it is. Then I’d like to be able to finish what I’m trying to say.”
  * The person says they’re fine when they’re clearly not. You could say, “I’m noticing that I ask you if you’re feeling hurt, and you say no, of course not — but then you behave like other people behave when they’re hurt or mad at me. It seems like we should try to figure out what I’m doing that’s upsetting you, or we won’t get anywhere.”
  * The person gets upset even when you express things healthily. You could say, “The last few times I’ve expressed what’s important to me, you’ve gotten angry and I’ve felt a little threatened. I’m not sure why. If what I’m saying is angering you, then I’d like to hear why it’s upsetting to you. If you’re trying to scare me into changing my mind, that’s not going to work. I really want to know what’s upsetting you, and I’d like us figure out how to talk about this so that I don’t feel intimidated.”
