## Chapter 6: The Identity Conversation

**The Identity Conversation is an internal conversation about who we think we are and how we see ourselves.** It’s what you’re saying _to_ yourself _about_ yourself. This is probably the most nuanced and difficult of the What Happened components.

**Difficult conversations threaten our identity — who we think we are. The Identity Conversation is about what’s at stake _for us_ in a difficult conversation.** The anxiety we feel when we think about approaching a difficult conversation is at least partially because these conversations can shake our idea of ourselves.

  * If you see yourself as a good person, for example, but you have to fire someone at work, they probably aren’t going to see you that way, which will challenge how you see yourself.
  * Think about asking for a raise. As you prepare for the meeting, questions are flying through your mind, consciously or unconsciously. What if your boss says no? What if she has _good reasons_ for saying no - because you’re not as competent as you think?



There are three core identity questions that give us anxiety during difficult conversations:

  1. **Am I competent?** We all like to think we are — so if you’re the person getting fired, your boss is suggesting that you are _not,_ in fact, competent.
  2. **Am I a good person?** Most of us see ourselves as the heroes in our own stories — but if you’re breaking up with your partner unexpectedly, they might say a lot of things that make you feel like you’re a _bad_ person.
  3. **Am I worthy of love?** We all hope to be loved and accepted — so if you share with your mother that you feel hurt when she never asks about your life and she responds negatively, that reaction makes you feel like you might not deserve love.



In difficult conversations, when other people react in ways that challenge our identities, it can throw us off balance and make us feel panicked, shut down, depressed, or fearful — and those emotions continue to play out in our own heads as the difficult conversation continues.

There’s no way to circumvent identity issues — **all of life is about grappling with who we are.** We are going to lose our balance in difficult conversations over identity issues. After difficult conversations, we might even need to mourn aspects of our identity the way we would mourn a loved one who died.

But **there are things we can do to recognize what our identity issues are, cope better once our identity has been challenged, and think objectively about ourselves.** All of this will help us manage the Identity Conversation more easily.

#### Spotting Identity Issues

We’re usually not aware when identity issues come up in difficult conversations. We know we feel hurt or embarrassed or anxious, but we don’t know why — then sometimes, we blame these feelings on the other person, as though they’re “making” us feel that way.

**Start observing what things knock you off balance in conversations** , difficult or otherwise. Ask yourself why. What facet of your identity is at risk? What would it mean if the thing you fear was _true_?

### All-or-Nothing Identities

**The major difficulty most people face is that they view their identity as all-or-nothing.** I’m either all good, or all bad, right or wrong, nice or mean, helpful or selfish — no in-between. If I’m a good person, that means I’ve _never_ done anything bad in my life.

**No human is all-or-nothing, period.** All-or-nothing makes our identities particularly unstable, since everyone has done good and bad things in their life, or been competent in some cases and incompetent in others. When we view our identities as all-or-nothing, we’re only left with two courses of action when something contradicts how we see ourselves:

  1. **We deny it outright.** We have an all-or-nothing _positive_ view of ourselves, and any negative criticism gets immediately dismissed. We focus only on why negative feedback is false or incorrect. Denial requires energy because it provokes the question we fear might be true - “I’m actually a bad person all the time.”
  2. **We take it as true and exaggerate it.** We let someone else’s feedback define us and determine how we see ourselves. We have an all-or-nothing _negative_ view of ourselves, and tiny mistakes snowball into negative absolutes about ourselves. You might be on time 99% of the time — but if you show up late once, you tell yourself, “I can _never_ do anything right.” Of course, this negative absolute is objectively untrue.



Neither of these options is a healthy way of responding to information that challenges our identity.

**The goal is for us to feel _grounded_ in our identity:** aware of the complexities, and open to new information. To become more grounded, we need to do two things:

  1. Learn about which identity issues are important to us so we can be aware when they come up in conversation.
  2. Learn healthy ways to integrate new information about our identities — which requires us to let go of all-or-nothing thinking.



### Developing a Grounded Identity

The best thing you can do for yourself and your Identity Conversation is to **adopt the And Stance about your identity.** Humans are complex. No human is perfect, and no human is worthless — yet those are often the only options we feel we have. The And Stance lets us acknowledge the mixtures that we are, and allows for us to maintain an identity throughout our actions, whatever they are. You can be a good person _and_ you can have to fire someone. You can be a good person _and_ hurt someone’s feelings. **We’re constellations of positive and negative qualities: the more complex we allow ourselves to be, the sturdier we’ll feel in the face of identity issues.**

There are three things everyone can start to accept about themselves:

  1. **We will make mistakes.** There are no perfect people. We fear making mistakes because we’ll look weak or incompetent — yet **the most competent people are the ones who can admit their mistakes and correct them.**
  2. **Our intentions are complex.** As we previously discussed, we almost always have personal motivations and intentions that are more than just good or bad. 
  3. **We _have_ contributed to the issue.** Issues aren’t created by one person alone, but by the friction between two (or more) people.



### Regaining Balance in a Difficult Conversation

Conquering identity issues is about learning to regain our balance once we’ve been knocked off our feet in a difficult conversation. Here are four things you can do to help you keep and regain your balance.

#### 1\. Let Go of Controlling Their Reaction

One of our major anxieties over difficult conversations is that the other person will react badly to what we have to say. We’re already vulnerable, and we feel like a negative reaction from someone will be too much to handle. Or we don’t want to hurt other people and withhold what we want to say. Sometimes, **self-protection is involved** : if you have to fire someone, you don’t want them to feel bad, but that’s mainly because _you_ don’t want to feel bad.

Wanting to avoid hurting someone else and wanting to protect our own feelings can lead us to sometimes deprive the other person of their reaction. When we break bad news to someone and they get upset, our first reaction is to say something like, “You’ll be fine, it’ll be fine, it’ll blow over.” The other person might hear, “You’re not allowed to be upset over this” instead.

**Let the other person know everything you need them to know _and_ give them the space to feel how they’re going to feel.** This way, you have control over what you _can_ have control over — what you say — and they have control over how they react.

#### 2\. Prepare Yourself for Their Response

Before the conversation, **imagine them responding in the worst possible way**. Then ask yourself what that would say about you, how you’d feel, and how you might respond. Preparation will lower your chances of being surprised or caught off-guard, and it will also help you make peace with the worst possible outcome.

#### 3\. Use the Future as a Barometer

Will you care about this in three months? What about 10 years? This thought can give you comfort that you’ll eventually feel better. Most things we spend time worrying about are not things we’ll think of on our deathbeds.

This can also help guide you in tough moments. Imagine looking back on this difficult time. What do you hope to have learned from this experience? What advice would yourself from the future give you about how to handle it?

#### 4\. Bring Up Identity Issues Explicitly

Not every identity issue needs to be brought up with others, but some do. Bringing the identity issue to the surface can help both parties deal more efficiently with the difficult conversation at hand.

For example, a question like this can both share how you’re feeling and get to the heart of what the other person is thinking: “It sounds like this conversation is about whether I’m a good spouse or not. Is that how you’re feeling?” Your spouse now understands you’re hearing this conversation as a potential judgment on a big identity issue.

#### If You’re Overwhelmed

Remember also that **you can always take a break during a difficult conversation.** If you feel like the identity issues are too overwhelming, ask to take a break to think about what the other person has said. Even a short break might help.

If you’re overwhelmed, you won’t be able to participate in the conversation as effectively. Excuse yourself and take some quiet time to reflect. Check yourself for denial or exaggerations. What’s the worst thing that could happen, and what can you do to turn the situation around?

Remember that **the _other_ person’s identity has also been implicated**. They’re going through the same thing you are. You can help them by reminding them that identity isn’t all-or-nothing. Remind them of positive things between you or about the situation.

Lastly, **ask for help.** There are some identity issues that we can’t deal with on our own. Most of us view asking for help as a show of weakness — but think about how you feel when a friend asks for help. Most likely, you appreciate when someone you care about asks for help, and appreciate the chance to do something for them. Why should you be any different? Asking doesn’t mean you won’t be disappointed or let down — we don’t always get the help we ask for. But asking does give people you care about the chance to come through for you.
