## Introduction to Difficult Conversations

_Difficult Conversations_ was written by members of the Harvard Negotiation Project, whose goal is to establish and circulate conflict resolution strategies. The first book published by the HNP, _Getting to Yes_ , has been massively successful since its publishing in 1981. While _Getting to Yes_ focuses on effective strategies for traditional negotiation, _Difficult Conversations_ applies the “Harvard Method” more broadly to everyday disagreements. Negotiations happen in everyday life, and people don’t seem to want to have them. Or, more troublesome, things get worse when people _do_ talk about the issues they’re facing. This is where _Difficult Conversations_ comes in.

At their core, everyone is the same: we all have our own thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, and every day we interact with other people who have their own thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. **Sometimes our thoughts conflict with someone else’s thoughts, or feelings with feelings, or perceptions with perceptions — that’s when difficult conversations arise.**

Difficult conversations aren’t an anomaly you can solve once and be done with. Difficult conversations are a constant throughout life, at work, at home, and in the world. We never outgrow them, or get a promotion that saves us from them, or meet a person who’s so perfect for us we never have to have them.

**Difficult conversations, if we engage in them successfully, are the mark of a healthy relationship in any realm** , where people walk away with a better understanding of each other, a stronger sense of trust, and an experience they’ve struggled through together and survived. In fact, the success and survival of any relationship, business or personal, depends on the ability of those involved to master difficult conversations.

### Where You Can Use This Summary

**Change requires difficult conversations** , and a major reason some organizations and— relationships— fail to adapt is that the people in them eventually have to have these difficult conversations, and they don’t have the skills to handle them.

**In business** , the principles you’ll learn in this summary are required just to maintain business as usual. Competition these days requires businesses to increase in size and scale — many successful businesses are global — while also adapting less hierarchical practices for the sake of flexibility.

Due to this increase in pressure, businesses have also spent the last two decades trying to cut costs, so much so that there isn’t much left to cut. According to the authors, performance and the ability to manage conflict efficiently are going to determine professional success for the next 50 years.

**But this book is useful for literally everyone.** Parents can benefit from this book, and so can kids. Spouses, partners, landlords, tenants, neighbors, team members, employees, colleagues, patients, doctors — _everyone_ can use it. The principles in this book can make a marriage stronger, and can turn workplace disagreements in any realm into opportunities for innovation.

First, we’ll cover what difficult conversations are and what makes them difficult. Then we’ll discuss the parts of a difficult conversation, and the common mistakes we make in each part. Finally, we’ll go over how to begin and proceed with a difficult conversation for the best outcome.

### A Note on Our Summary

_Difficult Conversations_ is an excellent read and extremely useful. For our summary, we focused on extracting the principles you can put into use. The full book has extensive examples of the principles in practice — if you’re someone who learns best through situational examples, it would be well worth reading the whole book after you finish the summary.

We’ve regrouped ideas and chapter organization into a sequence that we believe is clearer than the original book’s.
