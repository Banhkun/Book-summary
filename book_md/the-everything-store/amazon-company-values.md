## Amazon Company Values

Throughout the historical narrative, the book also discusses company values that Jeff Bezos tirelessly emphasized to his team. We’ve compiled the most important company values here, with representative quotes and anecdotes illustrating the value in action.

### Customer Obsession

Bezos is known for his relentless focus on customer satisfaction.

“**Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.** They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.”

  * Early in Amazon’s life, a publisher executive is angry at Amazon customer reviews, suggesting Bezos doesn’t understand his business is to sell books, not trash them. Bezos disagrees: “**we don’t make money when we sell things. We make money when we help customers make purchase decisions.** ”
  * Bezos edits press releases, speeches, and shareholder letters to remove anything that does not speak simply and positively to customers.
  * In 1996, on sharing customer data: “Mr. Bezos knows his customers will erupt in outrage if he turns over their files to other marketers. The Web, he notes, is the ultimate word-of-mouth medium: ‘If someone thinks they are being mistreated by us, they won't tell five people -- they'll tell 5,000.’ “ WSJ
  * In 1998, Amazon rolled out a comparison-shopping feature so customers could search for any product, even if Amazon didn’t carry it.
    * This was eventually axed since executives disliked having customers leave, but today Amazon still allows ads for outside retailers, wanting to build a reputation as a trustworthy resource for giving customers the best deal.
  * Early on, Barnes & Noble was the giant that promised to quash them. Bezos told staff: “You should wake up worried, terrified every morning. But don’t be worried about our competitors because they’re never going to send us any money anyway. Let’s be worried about our customers and stay heads-down focused.”
  * In negotiation meetings with Toys R Us in 2000 to become Amazon’s exclusive toy supplier, Bezos made a show of **keeping one chair open at the table, “for the customer.”**
  * New product ideas need to be written in the form of a mock press release, starting with what the customer would see and hear about, and working backwards.
  * When a user gets an embarrassing email about sex lubricant, Bezos is willing to shut down the entire profitable email channel. “We can build a $100 billion company without sending out a single fucking e-mail.”
  * Amazon uses its massive power to cut better deals with suppliers, hurting those businesses but in the belief that low prices make products more affordable to Americans.
    * “Amazon isn’t happening to the book business. The future is happening to the book business.”



#### Dogfooding Services

Amazon has a history of spinning out services that were initially used only internally, or by dogfooding products that are sold to the public. It believes that if it can build a service that is good enough to satisfy internal Amazon demands, it’ll be good enough for the outside public.

  * In 2006, Amazon launches Fulfillment by Amazon: “we had built such a good service that people were willing to pay us to use it.”
  * Amazon teams use Mechanical Turk internally to review customer uploaded photos and check Block View images.
  * Engineering groups were told to use AWS while the services were still immature.



### Huge Long-Term Ambitions

Bezos and Amazon are known for thinking huge and having galaxy-sized ambition. They then execute it with dogged determination and boldness.

“Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. [In contrast,] leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.”

  * From initiation, Bezos imagined an Everything Store where the entire Earth’s catalogue was accessible to anyone.
  * When hiring Walmart distribution exec Jimmy Wright in 1998, Bezos wanted a distribution system 10x larger than it currently was, not just in the US but also the UK and Germany. He wanted a system that **“will handle everything but an aircraft carrier.”**
  * In the toy season in 1999, Bezos insists on spending $120 million to stock every toy imaginable. They eventually end with a lot of surplus inventory.
  * When building the AWS S3 service, Bezos said,**“this has to scale to infinity with no planned downtime. Infinity!”**
  * Brad Stone: “the future of [Amazon] becomes easy to predict. The answer to almost every conceivable question is yes.” Will Prime become same-day shipping? Yes. Will Amazon one day run its own delivery? Yes. 
  * “We are genuinely customer-centric, we are genuinely long-term oriented and we genuinely like to invent. Most companies are not those things. They are focused on the competitor, rather than the customer. They want to work on things that will pay dividends in two or three years, and if they don’t work in two or three years they will move on to something else. And they prefer to be close-followers rather than inventors, because it’s safer. That is why we are different. Very few companies have all of those three elements.”



#### Boldness

  * Bezos: “Physically, I’m a chicken. Mentally, I’m bold.”
  * In its first letter to shareholders: “We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions.”
  * To eBay and Amazon board member Cook: “We’re going to win, so you probably want to consider whether to stay on the eBay board.”



#### Speed

  * “Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.”
  * During the IPO process, Bezos wasn’t allowed to speak to press for 7 weeks. “I can’t believe we have to delay our business by seven years,” magnifying the calendar time by the speed of Internet evolution.
  * In 1999, when accounting worried about Amazon’s profitability, Bezos insisted on customer experience and was skeptical of profitability projections. “If you are planning for more than twenty minutes ahead in this kind of environment, you are wasting your time.”
  * When developing the Kindle e-reader, Kessel asks Bezos what the deadline for the product would be. Bezos: “You are basically already late.”



#### Long-term Focus

  * Ignoring stock prices. “You don’t feel thirty percent smarter when the stock goes up by thirty percent, so when the goes down you shouldn’t feel thirty percent dumber.”
  * The compensation packages spread the signing bonus over 2 years; grant RSUs over 4 years, but 5% at the end of the 1st year, 15% their second year, and 20% every 6 months over the final 2 years. Further grants vest over 2 years and are also backloaded.
  * Blue Origin’s motto: Gradatim Ferociter, “step by step, ferociously.” Their coat of arms has tortoises, invoking the story of the tortoise and the hare.



### Breaking Away from Tradition

Even among groundbreaking technology companies, Amazon is lauded for its continuous innovation and breakthrough ideas. Powering this is a constant push to rethink how things are done, never accepting the status quo without further questioning.

“Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by ‘not invented here.’ As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.”

  * Bezos called Amazon the **“unstore,” unbound by traditional retail rules**. It had limitless shelf space; personalization for every customer; allowed negative reviews; placed used products right next to new ones.
  * At some companies, strategic arguments are based on “doing things as we’ve always done them.” Not at Amazon - if the proposal doesn’t reason from first principles, it’s rejected. People who insist on the “traditional” style of thinking don’t last long.
  * In 1997, Bezos wanted to conduct annual reviews of advertising agencies to make them compete for Amazon’s business. An Amazon marketing exec explained the industry didn’t work that way - he didn’t last long.
  * In its relationship with suppliers, Amazon considered minimum advertised price (MAP) to be a relic of old business. It violated this by hiding prices in the shopping cart and allowing third-party sellers to list lower prices, leading to a torturous relationship with Wusthof.
  * As a company grows larger, it starts viewing its own internal practices as tradition. Bezos dubs this the “**institutional no** ,” or internal resistance to unorthodox moves.
    * He asks each director to share an example of the institutional no from her past.
  * Longtime CIO Rick Dalzell: **“He is bound only by the laws of physics. He can’t change those. Everything else he views as open to discussion.”**
  * Bezos: “Point of view is worth 80 IQ points.”



#### Disagree and Commit

  * **Bezos abhors social cohesion and consensus, preferring to have ideas banged against each other violently to arrive at the truth.**
  * “Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting.” But “once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.”



#### Regret Minimization Framework

  * On leaving D. E. Shaw in 1994: “I knew when I was eighty I would never think about why I walked away from my 1994 Wall Street Bonus. I knew I might regret not having participated in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a revolutionizing event.”



### Frugality

Jeff Bezos is famously frugal. Unlike technology companies that dote lavishly on their employees, Amazon is stingy. It believes that in the cutthroat low-margin world of retail, it needs to push for every possible advantage to reduce prices for customers.

“Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.”

  * Amazon’s first office was the garage of Bezos’s Seattle house, with desks made out of $60 doors from Home Depot. The door-desks are still a common office fixture and a symbol of frugality.
  * Bezos made employees pay for parking and required all executives to fly coach. When flying on a private plan, he made a point of saying, “The company isn’t paying for this, I am.”
    * His lieutenants carry this forward. Author Brad Stone had dinner with a senior Amazon exec, who picked up the bill and tore up the receipt, saying “The company is not paying for this.”
  * At their early office building’s coffee stand, Bezos made a show of getting his loyalty card punched and handing his free drink to a colleague.
  * When a new hire joins the company, she gets a backpack with a power adapter and laptop dock. When she resigns, she’s asked to hand in all that equipment - including the backpack.
  * Bezos drove a Honda Accord in the 2000s and reportedly continues to drive a Honda minivan. Reportedly he was often dropped off by his wife (before their divorce), who also personally delivered their four children to school.



### Relentless Work Ethic

  * “You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon you _can’t_ choose two out of three.”
  * Bezos expects employees to work tirelessly to build a lasting company and increase the value of their ownership stakes.
  * At D. E. Shaw, Bezos kept a sleeping bag in his office, “as much a prop as it was actually useful.”
  * Bezos refused to subsidize bus passes, not wanting employees to leave work to catch the bus. He’d rather them have cars there so there was no time pressure to go home at the end of the day.
  * At an all-hands meeting: “The reason we are here is to get stuff done, that is the top priority. That is the DNA of Amazon. If you can’t excel and put everything into it, this might not be the place for you.”
  * “If you’re not good, Jeff will chew you up and spit you out. And if you’re good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground.” - Employee
  * The media has reported on deplorable fulfillment center conditions. Security monitors workers to discourage stealing; employees have 6 strikes (like calling in sick and arriving late) to be let go; Amazon made clear unionizing was not tolerated; insufficient cooling caused some workers to be hospitalized.



#### Energy and Conviction

  * John Doerr: “I walked into the door and this guy with a boisterous laugh who was just exuding energy comes bounding down the steps. In that moment, I wanted to be in business with Jeff.”
  * “He was so convinced that what he was doing was basically the work of God.”
  * Bezos on motivation: “I’m very motivated by people counting on me. I like to be counted on.”



#### Missionary vs Mercenary

  * Bezos: “I would take a missionary over a mercenary any day. One of those great paradoxes is that it’s usually the missionaries who end up making more money anyway.”
  * Joy Covey, former CFO: “Personal wealth was never discussed or really thought about. I see companies these days where thoughts of exits are foremost in the minds of top management...this value will infect the decision making down to the smallest choice by the most junior employee...Jeff attracted people like me, who really need to work on things they can internalize and adopt as mission, who poured their hearts and souls and best efforts into building Amazon. Jeff’s style always read as completely pure, focused on the best outcomes for Amazon and our customers.”



#### Discouraging Celebrations

  * Early on, Bezos disliked when employees closely tracked the number of daily purchases. When they had its first $5000 order day, Bezos rejected a party: “there are a lot of milestones coming and that’s not the way I want to run things.”
  * During their IPO, he asked employees not to over-celebrate the moment or obsess over the stock price.
  * In January 2002, when Amazon posts its first profits, a publicist wants to frame some positive news articles. Instead, Bezos wants to frame negative stories like the Amazon.bomb cover, so employees remain scared.



### Ability to Dive Deep

Bezos is renowned by his staff for being able to dive into minute details of the business.

**“Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.”**

  * Bezos reportedly has the ability to comment insightfully on topics he has no prior training in.
    * In a discussion about algorithms to optimize picker movements, a five-engineer team presented their work over 9 months. Bezos read the paper, said “you’re all wrong,” and started writing on the whiteboard. Said an engineer: “Everything he put down was correct and true.”
  * He dove into a distribution problem dealing with batch sizes and packaging, impressing a consulting professor in willing to be there ”with his sleeves rolled up, climbing around the conveyors with all of us.”
  * When hiring Udi Manber, an algorithms expert, Bezos asks him to describe a new algorithm he invented. Manber later said: “He not only fully understood it, but did it faster than most people. I did not expect that from a CEO. It would have taken me a month to explain it to most senior Yahoo people.”
  * (Shortform note: one of Steve Yegge’s famous posts about Amazon describes Bezos as “so goddamned smart that you have to turn it into a game for him or he’ll be bored and annoyed with you.”
    * “For years he’s had armies of people taking care of _everything_ for him. He’s had a general’s view of the industry battlefield for ten years. Not only do you have more time than anyone else, and access to more information than anyone else, you also have this long-term eagle-eye perspective that only a handful of people in the world enjoy. So he’s really, REALLY good at reading presentations.”
    * Yegge proposes deleting every 3rd paragraph in your narrative so that Bezos has to fill in the blanks and avoid being bored.)



### Retailing Strategy

#### Virtuous Cycles

  * Early on, they believed that the larger the company got, the lower the prices it could exact from book distributors, and the more distribution capacity it could afford.
  * In their first shareholder letter: “Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital.”
  * Later in 2001, meeting with Jim Collins, they come up with a renewed virtuous cycle: lower prices leads to more customer visits, leading to more sales, which leads to better returns on fixed costs, which allows further lowering of prices. More customer visits also led to more third-party sellers, which increases selection and thus increases more customers.



#### Broad selection

  * The early advantage of Amazon was its huge catalog of obscure titles that no physical bookstore could possibly stock. 
  * Bezos wanted to build confidence in customers that Amazon could stock anything they wanted, making Amazon the first place they’d look.
  * In 1999 Bezos had aggressive ideas, like the Alexandria Project (get 2 copies of every book ever printed); and Project Fargo (get one of every product ever manufactured and store it in a distribution center).
  * When Amazon expanded to toys in 1999, Bezos insisted on stocking every possible toy and spending $120 million. (They end the year with a huge toy surplus.)



#### Learning from Partners, then Beating Them

  * Amazon Marketplace launched to some concerns about competing with third party sellers who might undercut Amazon. However, Bezos understood that if someone else knew how to sell more cheaply than Amazon, Amazon should let them and figure out how they did it. They did this for jewelry, which was a more complicated category than expected.
  * Amazon uses pricing bots that crawl competitors’ prices and adjust Amazon’s prices accordingly.
  * (Shortform note: Amazon now manufactures its own branded goods like batteries and USB cables, no doubt fueled by its immense dataset on the bestselling, most profitable goods.)



#### Branding

Bezos recognizes the power of branding and establishing how Amazon is perceived in the customer’s mind.

  * Bezos insisted on reporting of the company as Amazon.com
  * He saw the IPO as a global branding event.
