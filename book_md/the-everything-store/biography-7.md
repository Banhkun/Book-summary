## Biography 7: Amazon, the Giant

In this period, Amazon’s retail flywheel gains formidable momentum, and its experimental projects start yielding fruit.

August 2005: Bezos meets with Zappos execs (Tony Hsieh, Alfred Lin, Michael Moritz, Nick Swinmurn) and announces the intention of acquiring Zappos.

  * Zappos has become synonymous with buying footwear online. It boasts sales growing from $8.6 million in 2001 to $70 million in 2003 and $370 million in 2005.
  * Amazon has not done this well in footwear. **Zappos has built strong relationships with brands like Nike, which fear Amazon for being a discounter and brand destroyer.** Amazon’s website also is not suited for listing variations among a single good - it lists different colors, sizes, and widths all as separate items with separate web pages.
  * The cultures between the two companies are somewhat similar.
    * Zappos is obsessive about customer experience, promising free 5-7 day delivery and trying to meet 2-day delivery. Customers can return items up to a year after the purchase. Customer center calls can take as long as needed, and customers sometimes enjoy hours-long calls.
    * Hsieh believes that everyone should take below-market compensation to work at Zappos because of the great internal culture.
  * Amazon execs believe Zappos could be acquired for $500 million, but Bezos imagines paying just a fraction of this.
  * Zappos desires to remain independent. **Bezos goes to war, building Endless.com as a separate site dedicated to shoes and handbags.**
    * This is the same time Amazon is spending heavily on the Kindle and AWS, so the board is wary of Amazon spreading itself thin and overspending.
    * Amazon CFO: “How much money do you want to spend on this?” Bezos: “How much do you have?”



November 2005: Amazon launches Mechanical Turk, a service allowing hiring of humans to perform low-cost, hard to automate services like image recognition and data categorization.

  * The name comes from an 18th century chess-playing automaton that appeared to play chess independently but actually concealed a man inside.
  * The service comes from an investment Bezos made in the late 1990s in Cambrian Ventures, an incubator founded by founders of Junglee (which had been acquired by Amazon). The founders patent a method of coordinating groups of people worldwide to offer human intelligence tasks, inspired by Napster and the power of networks. When the company fails, Bezos acquires the patent and develops Mechanical Turk in Amazon.
  * As is now typical in Amazon services, before release to public customers, Turk’s first customer is Amazon. Turk is first used internally in Amazon to have humans review book scans and check uploaded product images.
  * (Today, Turk is not a huge part of the company, but it’s emblematic of the orthogonal technological innovation Amazon attempts in this period.)



**March 2006: Amazon relaunches Amazon Web Services, this time offering S3, SQS, and EC2.**

  * Andy Jassy, Harvard MBA and anomalously not an engineer, leads the effort. He previously shadowed Bezos, sitting in on every meeting and acting effectively as chief of staff.
  * The vision statement: “to enable developers and companies to use Web services to build sophisticated and scalable applications.” Jassy: **“We tried to imagine a student in a dorm room who would have at his or her disposal the same infrastructure as the largest companies in the world.”**
  * The board is skeptical. Doerr: “why would we go into this business” when Amazon is already struggling to hire engineers and needs to expand internationally? Bezos: “Because we need it as well” - thus there will be other companies who have this same need.
  * AWS’s business model is novel, allowing customers to pay on-demand for server usage, like a utility. At the time, other server services only allowed for fixed subscriptions regardless of the amount used (eg monthly).
  * Bezos wants to charge 10 cents per hour for EC2, even though 15 cents per hour would allow Amazon to break even. **Bezos suspects lower prices will repel rivals like Microsoft and Google because it would depress their margins.**
  * Author Brad Stone argues that AWS “helped lift the entire technology industry out of a prolonged post-dot-com malaise” and that it enlarged the scope of Amazon’s everything store concept. It makes Amazon a confusing target for Walmart and other retailers, since Amazon is no longer just clearly an online retailer to compete with. It clearly puts Amazon in the realm of a technology company.



2006: Amazon launches Fulfillment by Amazon, letting sellers use Amazon’s fulfillment network to store, pack, and ship their products. In other words, Amazon is storing inventory owned by other companies and handling logistics for them.

  * **“We had built such a good service that people were willing to pay us to use it.”** \- Wilke team member.



December 2006: Endless.com launches as the Zappos competitor. They compete with Endless on pricing and customer service.

  * Endless offers free overnight shipping and free returns, clearly losing money but designed to make Zappos bleed. Zappos matches Amazon’s free overnight shipping.
  * Recall that shoe manufacturers were wary of working with Amazon, fearing that they would ruthlessly discount their shoes. Amazon is in an awkward position, trying to undercut Zappos with price while promising brand name companies they won’t cut prices too much. 
  * Amazon adds a $5 bonus to free overnight shipping.
  * Zappos places advertisements on the plastic shoe bins in airport security. Bezos is alarmed: “They are outthinking us!”
  * Despite Amazon’s volleys, Zappos grows further up to $1 billion in sales over the next few years, but the financial crisis hits them, making fundraising harder and lowering consumer spending.



April 2007: Amazon announces surprisingly strong Q1 results, with quarterly sales reaching $3 billion, growing 32% YoY compared to ecommerce at 12%. Its stock gains 37% in a week.

  * This suggests Amazon is stealing customers from other ecommerce companies and from physical retailers.
  * The flywheel effect of Prime and Amazon’s growing power is becoming clearer.
  * **eBay meanwhile is fading** \- customers prefer convenience and certainty, not wanting to wait 7 days to figure out if his bid for goods of questionable quality has won. eBay releases its fixed-price product too late. Amazon surpasses eBay’s valuation for the first time in almost a decade, and that year reports more sales than Barnes & Noble and eBay combined.
  * **Regardless, Bezos drives forward: “to be a $200 billion company, we’ve got to learn how to sell clothes and food” - like Walmart.**



November 2007: Bezos introduces the Kindle at a press event, after 3 years of development in Lab126.

  * **He releases a bombshell: digital versions of books will cost $9.99.** He models this after Apple’s 99-cent iTunes song, believing that customers expect to pay less for a non-physical book.
  * Publishers are blindsided, not having known about the price beforehand. They feel betrayed, after having partnered with Amazon to digitize their books for months. Physical retailers are scared, believing that customers will abandon physical books for e-books.
  * Rightly, they fear Amazon will accrue even more negotiating leverage.



December 2007: The housing crisis causes a wide recession, destroying many retailers while Amazon is gaining momentum

  * Circuit City goes bankrupt in 2008. At its peak, it had 700 stores and $12 billion in sales. Then Best Buy and Walmart ushered in self-service shopping and big-box stores. Circuit City is caught flat-footed, with its large, expensive salesforce and being distracted spinning out CarMax and DVD-rental system DIVX.
  * Borders goes bankrupt in 2011. Over Amazon’s history, Borders was content to let Amazon run its online business and chose to focus on its physical stores. It perceived Amazon as “just another catalog - a version of Lands’ End.”
  * In September 2009, Brad Stones writes “Can Amazon be the Wal-Mart of the Web?” Walmart tries to counter Amazon’s growth, lowering prices on ten new books to $10 each. Amazon matches the price within a few hours.**This price pressure would have been terrifying to Amazon 10 years ago - but now Amazon can easily withstand such losses.**



February 2008: Amazon sells its DVD-rental services in the UK and Germany to Lovefilm.

  * Years earlier, Amazon had watched Netflix and attempted to replicate it in geographies Netflix hadn’t yet entered. But local companies were already there, and the cost to acquire customers was higher than Amazon expected.
  * Amazon becomes the largest shareholder in Lovefilm, and watches from the sidelines as Netflix moves away from sending discs in the mail to streaming. (In 2011, more action will happen with Lovefilm.)



July 2009: Amazon announces the acquisition of Zappos for $900 million.

  * After a long and painful war of attrition, Zappos ultimately loses.
  * Zappos investor **Michael Moritz had watched Amazon destroy eToys a decade earlier and knew what it takes to compete with Amazon. Zappos doesn’t have it.** “The hiring was too slow, the engineering department was not good enough.” Zappos’s Las Vegas location made recruiting difficult.
  * Zappos founders Hsieh and Lin also see that many Zappos employees had lost their wealth in the housing crisis, and the only thing of value they hold is Zappos stock. An exit would give them a payout, so the founders feel emotional pressure to sell at that time.
  * In a welcome video to Zappos employees, Bezos records an 8-minute video introducing Amazon. Ironically, he says “we pay attention to what our competitors do, but it’s not where we get our energy or motivation.”



2009: Amazon approaches Quidsi, owner of Diapers.com, and announces they are ready to invest in the childcare market (diapers, formula, strollers) and that Quidsi should think about selling to Amazon. This is the Zappos story, playing out again.

  * Quidsi was founded in 2005 by Marc Lore (later founder of Amazon competitor Jet.com) and Vinit Bharara. At the time, e-commerce retailers hadn’t yet approached diapers since the product feels bulky and low-margin.
  * Quidsi makes the business work by reducing shipping costs, matching goods to the smallest possible box (with a range of 23 possible sizes) and building warehouses right outside major cities to use cheap ground shipping.
  * They watch Amazon closely, calling Bezos “sensei” in private.
  * After Quidsi’s rejection of Amazon’s offer, Amazon drops prices by up to 30% on diapers and other baby products. Quidsi changes their prices and watches Amazon move in lockstep, as a result of automated pricing bots.
  * Quidsi’s growth slows, and investors are reluctant to invest further. Quidsi founders approach Walmart for acquisition, but the price isn’t high enough.
  * In September 2010, they meet with Amazon. **While the founders are locked up in that meeting, Amazon announces Amazon Mom in a press release.** Diapers become available for under $30 with Amazon’s Subscribe & Save, while costing $45 on Diapers.com.
  * Finally, Quidsi waves the white flag. Bezos wants to make sure they don’t lose the deal to Walmart and Amazon offers $540 million.
  * Walmart counters at $600 million. Amazon suggests if they take the offer, Amazon will drive diaper prices to zero, destroying Quidsi’s economics and threatening to force the deal with Walmart fall through. **They accept and announce the acquisition in November 2010.**
  * (Shortform note: apparently partially fueled by revenge for Amazon stealing his baby, Marc Lore later founds Jet.com, which is positioned as an Amazon competitor and ultimately sells to Walmart for $3 billion.)



Fall 2009: Two years after the Kindle releases, Amazon commands 90% of the digital reading market and releases the Kindle 2. Publishers are terrified.

  * **Any publisher that doesn’t follow Amazon’s pricing terms gets cut off in product listings, its wares becoming available only through third-party sellers.**
  * Two major publishers try to delay e-book releases until months after the hardcover versions come out. Consumers react poorly, giving these titles poor reviews on Amazon. Even without Amazon exerting explicit pressure, its status as the central shopping destination is unbeatable leverage.
  * Amazon is experimenting with allowing authors to self-publish their works in Kindle, giving them 70% royalty on sales. Amazon has control over so much of the chain that it can cut out publishers entirely.
  * In response to all this,**5 major publishing houses** representing a large fraction of books sold - Penguin, Hachette, Macmillan, HarperCollins, and Simon and Schuster - **collude with Apple to address Amazon’s $9.99 problem.**
    * They agree to switch to an agency model, wherein publishers would become retailers and set their own prices (between $13-15) and Apple would act as the broker and get a 30% commission. Apple receives a guarantee that other retailers wouldn’t undercut it on e-book prices.
    * In Jan 2010, Apple introduces the iPad and the new e-books.
  * **Amazon’s countermoves:**
    * In response, Amazon blocks Macmillan books for a weekend. This attracts the ire of press and customers - directed toward Amazon - and they reluctantly reverse.
    * Ironically, the pricing collusion actually raises Kindle profits, since Amazon holds most of the e-book sales and is forced to charge more for e-books. Amazon takes advantage by lowering Kindle device prices to as low as $79.
    * Amazon approaches smaller publishers, warning they have insufficient leverage to pull the same move, and threatening to stop carrying their books if they tried.
    * Amazon sends a white paper to the FTC and DOJ suggesting there was an illegal conspiracy. The DOJ sues 3 years later, in 2012.



**2010-11: Amazon’s size makes it a more attractive target for regulators for sales tax.** They battle with states and other retailers to avoid state sales taxes.

  * In April 2008, NY state passes legislation to expand the definition of tax nexus to include affiliate websites that took commissions for passing customers to an online retailer, thus making that retailer have a presence in the state. Amazon and Overstock sue, but they lose.
  * IL, NC, RI, TX and other states follow the same strategy. In response, Amazon severs ties with affiliates in each state.
  * To attack Amazon, Walmart, Target, Sears, and other retailers form a coalition to back a new organization called the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, pushing for the vitality of small retailers. This is ironic given the size of these retailers. But given that the retailers have physical presence in states and are taxed, they believe Amazon has an unfair advantage as an online retailer, and they want to try to hamper Amazon as they can.
  * Amazon continues efforts to try to avoid establishing tax nexus, like rigid restrictions on what traveling employees could do in certain states, and setting up fulfillment centers as subsidiaries of Amazon with no revenue. It uses fulfillment centers as leverage to combat state legislation - threatening to close the Texas fulfillment center makes the governor veto the bill; TN delays the bill when Amazon offers to build 3 new fulfillment centers in the state.
  * Amazon pushes for a federally controlled state tax (which as of 2018 has still not had meaningful traction). 
  * Ultimately in 2012, Amazon negotiates accommodations to allow staying tax-free for a few years, in exchange for putting fulfillment centers in each of Texas, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and California.
  * Ever the chess player, **Amazon uses this seemingly costly requirement to its strategic advantage - it builds fulfillment centers close to large cities, empowering next- or same-day delivery** , AmazonFresh, and Amazon Lockers.
