## Amazon Management Tactics

A number of Amazon’s management practices have become well known. Here is a profile of the ones mentioned in the book.

#### 6-Pagers, Narratives

Bezos dislikes Powerpoint for allowing people to “hide between bullet points” and avoiding complete expression of thoughts. Instead, he requires people to write presentations in prose. New product releases require a mock press release, to start with what the customer would see and work backward. Meetings start with everyone reading the document for 15 minutes.

#### High Hiring Bars

“Each hire should raise the bar for the next hire, so that the overall talent pool is always improving.”

All participants in the hiring process give one of four ratings: strong no hire, inclined not to hire, inclined to hire, strong hire. A senior interviewer, called a “bar raiser” talks to the candidate last and makes a final judgment on the hire. These are employees who have proven themselves to be intuitive recruiters of talent.

Amazon’s 1994 hiring ad: “You must have experience designing and building large and complex systems, and you should be able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible.”

#### Two-Pizza Teams

Employees should be organized into autonomous groups of fewer than ten people, such that they could be fed with two pizzas. Amazon believes larger groups have stifled communication and slow down decision-making.

Stretching the limits of autonomy, Bezos challenged teams to propose its own “fitness function,” a linear combination of metrics that showed its value generation (like rate of marketing email opens * average order size generated). After some backlash in the awkwardness of setting one’s own metrics, Bezos backpedaled on this.

#### Communication is a Sign of Dysfunction

Bezos likes decentralization, autonomous working units, and independent decision making. He knew that top-down management as in Microsoft slowed decisions and stifled innovation.

Bezos believes teams should figure out how to communicate _less_ , not more. Coordination among people wastes time, and the people closest to a problem should be solving them without discussing them.

Bezos hated seeing TVs mounted in a conference room as signs of clumsy communication. He had them removed and left the mounts hanging for years, “like a warlord leaving the decapitated heads of his enemies as a symbol.”

Around 2003 Bezos stopped having 1-on-1 meetings with his reports, thinking these are more often filled with trivial updates and politics rather than brainstorming and problem solving.

#### Meeting Cadences

Operating reviews are done twice a year, over the summer and after the holiday season. Teams draw up 6-page documents spelling out their plans for the year ahead. Every doc contains a few tenets at the top, principles that guide the hard decisions.

Once a week on Tuesday, departments meet with managers to review data. The executive team questions every number and asks why things happened.

Once a week on Wednesday, the weekly business review happens run by Wilke. Sixty managers gather to review their departments, talk defects and forecasts.

Bezos doesn’t attend these meetings and doesn’t have 1-on-1s.

#### Prizes for Embodying Values

Amazon gives physical prizes when employees embody Amazon’s values. These include:

  * Bias for action: Just Do It award
    * During a 2000 earthquake, as Bezos and execs were huddling under a conference table, someone poked his head out, retrieved his laptop, and checked to see if Amazon.com is still live. Bezos liked this tendency to action.
  * People taking action to lower prices for customers: Door-desk prize



#### Recognizing Employees

Despite his frugality and insistence on work ethic, Bezos recognizes people when they perform.

He has thrown parties for long-lasting lieutenants, like flying friends and family of Shel Kaphan and Rick Dalzell to Hawaii.

When recruiting, he loops in the families of executives, like writing a CFO candidate and his wife a 2-page letter about the impact they could make at this juncture for the Internet.

#### Consistent Jeffisms

Bezos repeats stories and principles endlessly, leading his staff to call these “Jeffisms.”

This repetition is a calculated strategy. It pounds the drum around the principles that everyone in the company needs to embody.

He often tells stories of Amazon’s early days, everyone shipping books on the floor late at night and barely running the servers off the house’s power.

### Bezos’s Temper

Jeff Bezos is well-known for his short temper and willingness to point out when someone has done something dumb. This is less an official company tactic and more a personal trait described often in the book.

  * Bezos dislikes when an employee doesn’t have the right answer, tries to bluff the right answer, takes credit for someone else’s work, engages in politics, or shows frailty in the heat of battle.
  * In a press conference announcing toy selection, Amazon has tables with piles of merchandise representing a broad selection. Bezos is unsatisfied with the size of the piles: “Do you want to hand this business to our competitors? This is pathetic!”
  * In response to an executive who requested business-class flights: “That is not how an owner thinks! That’s the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard.”
  * To an exec after a proposal: “If that’s our plan, I don’t like our plan.”
  * “Do I need to go down and get the certificate that says I’m CEO of the company to get you to stop challenging me on this?”
  * “Are you lazy or just incompetent?”
  * “I trust you to run world-class operations and this is another example of how you are letting me down.”
  * After reviewing the annual plan from supply-chain team: “I guess supply chain isn’t doing anything interesting next year.
  * To a supply-chain team causing software bugs leading to lack of recognizing revenue: “You’re a complete fucking idiot. I have no idea why I hire idiots like you at the company.” (paraphrased)
  * To a Kindle 2 presentation team: “I don’t know if you guys don’t have high standards or if you just don’t know what you’re doing.”
  * When he gets a personal email of a subpar customer experience, he forwards it to the responsible party, with an ominous “?” single question mark. People know he’s ready to explode, and they rush to solve it and explain how it happened within a few hours.
  * In the 2000 holiday season, the VP of customer service assured Bezos the customer phone wait times were under a minute without offering proof. In response, Bezos dialed the service number over speakerphone and fumed as they waited for an unbearable 4.5 minutes.
  * His lieutenants have also been characterized as having a short temper.
    * Jeff Wilke, now CEO Worldwide Retail, also seems to explode at times. He had daily conference calls with general managers and required them to know daily facts - how many orders had shipped, the number of trucks waiting outside. Once when asked about how many trucks were at the warehouse, a manager seemed to look out the window and started counting “one, two, three…” - Wilke exploded.
    * Kal Raman, head of hardline businesses, would yell at buyers if Amazon’s prices were higher than competitors’ or if they ran out of inventory. “Can I have some of what you’re drinking so I can feel good about your business too?” He left within 2 years.
  * Bezos has a mission that he wants to see accomplished, and anyone who impedes progress is an obstacle.
    * “It may very well be that the absolute intensity of drive and focus is essential and incompatible with all of the nice management thought about consensus and gentle demeanor.” - Joy Covey, former Amazon CFO
  * Bezos seems aware of this and reportedly has gotten coaching. In a meeting, he called a team stupid and told them to “come back in a week when you figure out what you’re doing.” Then he took a few steps, froze, and added, “But great work, everyone.”
