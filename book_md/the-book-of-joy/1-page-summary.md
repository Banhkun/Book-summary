## 1-Page Summary

_The Book of Joy_ , written by Douglas Abrams, documents a week-long conversation between Archbishop Desmond Tutu and His Holiness the Dalai Lama about the nature of joy—what it is, why it matters, and how we can find it. The conversation, facilitated by Abrams, took place in 2015, leading up to the celebration of the Dalai Lama’s 80th birthday.

While Tutu and the Dalai Lama come from different cultural and spiritual backgrounds, they’re both known for their ability to speak to a universal human experience. Tutu, who passed away in 2021, was best known for his civil rights work during the South African Anti-Apartheid Movement, activism for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. The Dalai Lama is a Buddhist monk and the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He speaks internationally about the plight of Tibet and the core tenets of Buddhism. In addition to publishing his most well-known book, _The Art of Happiness_ , the Dalai Lama has published dozens of books on Buddhist teachings, meditation, and what it means to lead a meaningful life.

_The Book of Joy_ is a window into the long friendship between Tutu and the Dalai Lama and a practical guide on how to live more joyfully, even in a world full of suffering. In this guide, we’ll begin by defining joy and discussing why it matters before outlining practices that Tutu and the Dalai Lama offer as tools to bring more joy to your life. We’ll also explain why suffering doesn’t prevent you from feeling joy and sometimes even leads you directly to it. Throughout the guide, we’ll point to scientific research that supports the strategies Tutu and the Dalai Lama suggest. We’ll also supplement their advice with that of others who have tackled the same questions, including Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl and philosophers such as Aristotle.

### Defining Joy

We’ll start by defining joy before discussing why the practice of joy is a worthy pursuit for ourselves and for others.

According to neuroscience research, joy is one of only four basic human emotions. The other three are fear, anger, and sadness—all emotions that can cause suffering—**making joy the only emotion that explores what is good and satisfying about the human experience**. Joy can cover a broad range of positive experiences, including pleasure, amusement, contentment, excitement, relief, wonder, bliss, pride, and gratitude.

> **How Many Basic Emotions Are There?**
> 
> The four-emotion model is based on neurocircuitry research revealing that fear, anger, sadness, and joy are all associated with distinct patterns of physiological and neural activity. For example, anger is associated with increased arousal and activation in regions of the brain involved in threat detection and aggression, while sadness is associated with decreased arousal and activation in these same regions.
> 
> However, there’s ongoing debate in the field of emotion research about the exact number of basic emotions, with some researchers arguing in favor of alternative models with more or fewer basic emotions. For example, studies of human facial expressions suggest that there are at least seven basic emotions: anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise.

While many of us may conflate joy and happiness, Tutu and the Dalai Lama make a clear distinction between the two. They explain that **joy, unlike happiness, is not dependent on external circumstances**. Instead, joy depends on the attitude we adopt in those circumstances. Joy is a state of being, or way of looking at the world, unaffected by the ups and downs of life.

(Shortform note: The definition of joy as a state of being closely aligns with the Greek concept of _eudaimonia_ as outlined by Aristotle in _Nicomachean Ethics. _Aristotle argues that eudaimonia, a long-term sense of contentment and well-being, is the “ultimate good” and the purpose of human life. He contrasts this with the idea of _hedonia_ , or the blind pursuit of pleasure, however fleeting.)

According to Tutu and the Dalai Lama, **the purpose of life is to alleviate our own suffering through the discovery and practice of joy.** While they agree that suffering is inevitable, they offer joy as a path through suffering. Throughout their conversation, Tutu and the Dalai Lama discuss how joy not only offers an antidote to personal suffering, but creates a virtuous cycle of well-being in which your pursuit of joy not only benefits you, but also your friends, family, and community. Their joy will inevitably increase your joy, and so the cycle continues.

> **What’s the Purpose of Life?**
> 
> Philosophers have long debated the purpose and meaning of life. Some philosophers, like Aristotle or Epicurus, came to similar conclusions as Tutu and the Dalai Lama, suggesting that the purpose of life is to find freedom from suffering through the pursuit of joy.
> 
> Others, like Immanuel Kant, may have agreed that lasting happiness can’t depend on external circumstances; but Kant came to a different conclusion, suggesting that the purpose of life is the ongoing pursuit of the highest moral good.
> 
> Finally, philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre adopted a more existentialist view, arguing that there’s no inherent meaning in life. Nietzsche believed that individuals must create their own meaning in life through self-discovery, while Sartre emphasized the importance of personal authenticity and the rejection of external, imposed values.

### The Core Values That Lead to Joy

In the previous section, we clarified the definition and importance of joy. Next, we’ll introduce the attitudes and actions that will help you experience joy on a daily basis.

Tutu and the Dalai Lama explain that to experience true joy, **you must first understand that your joy doesn’t depend on your external circumstances.** People often think that they’ll feel joy when their circumstances change—when they find a partner, have the perfect job, or finally own a house. This is the modern myth of happiness—the more you own or the more you accomplish, the happier you’ll be. In fact, the opposite is true. Focusing on external sources of happiness doesn’t lead to a more joyful life, but to great disconnection from other people and an increased attachment to things beyond your control.

(Shortform note: While Tutu and the Dalai Lama emphasize that joy isn’t dependent on external circumstances, some research shows that your circumstances do impact your happiness, but to a lesser degree than most people think. A 2005 study found that 10% of your happiness is determined by life circumstances, 40% by “intentional activity,” and as much as 50% by genetics. Researchers from this study have since revised their original conclusions, acknowledging these percentages oversimplify the issue because people’s circumstances, choices, and biology aren’t isolated factors, but variables that interact and influence each other on a daily basis and over the course of a lifetime.)

Tutu and the Dalai Lama outline eight core values (called the “Eight Pillars of Joy”) that offer a pathway to a more joyful life. Practicing these eight values (perspective, humility, humor, acceptance, forgiveness, gratitude, compassion, and generosity) will help you detach your happiness from your circumstances. Douglas Abrams explains these qualities as if they are each rungs on a ladder; the practice of each quality is a natural step to the next.

> **The Eightfold Path: A Different Path to Joy**
> 
> The eight core values that Tutu and the Dalai Lama introduce are a secular path to a more joyful life; however, they’re informed by both men’s spiritual traditions. For example, the Eightfold Path, a central Buddhist principle, is a similar path to ending suffering. According to Buddhist teaching, by following the principle of the Eightfold Path, you can gradually end suffering and attain lasting peace and happiness through enlightenment.
> 
> The Eightfold Path consists of the following principles:
> 
>   * Right understanding: understanding the Four Noble Truths and the nature of reality
> 
>   * Right thought: cultivating sincere and compassionate intentions
> 
>   * Right speech: speaking truthfully and kindly
> 
>   * Right action: acting ethically and responsibly in your relationships with other people
> 
>   * Right livelihood: earning a living that doesn’t cause harm to yourself or anybody else
> 
>   * Right effort: cultivating wholesome states of mind and overcoming negative emotions and thoughts
> 
>   * Right mindfulness: developing awareness of the present moment and your own mental and physical state
> 
>   * Right concentration: cultivating the ability to focus and develop a deep meditation practice
> 
> 

> 
> While the Eightfold Path doesn’t directly correspond to the eight core values that Tutu and the Dalai Lama outline, both paths emphasize the inevitability of suffering and the importance of occupying yourself with the well-being of others in your pursuit of lasting happiness.

#### Perspective

The first core value is perspective. Tutu and the Dalai Lama acknowledge that **it’s natural to see the world most easily from our own perspective**. However, if we _only_ consider our own interests and experiences, while ignoring everybody else’s, joy will remain out of reach.

(Shortform note: A 2022 study provides new insight into why we see the world most easily from our own perspective. According to researchers, a part of the brain known as the gestalt cortex works to make sense of incomplete or unclear information by filling in the gaps with interpretations based on our memories and experiences. We privilege these interpretations because of our tendency for naive realism—the belief that our own perception of events is more accurate than anybody else’s.)

Instead, Tutu and the Dalai Lama advocate for **the cultivation of a well-rounded perspective** , meaning a wider and more holistic view in which we’re able to look at the world through multiple lenses, not just our own. They add that a well-rounded perspective emphasizes commonality rather than difference, encouraging people to ask not “how am I different?” but “what do we share?” A well-rounded perspective requires the understanding that the world is bigger and more nuanced than you can know through your own experiences, but even so, we all still share the common experience of being human.

(Shortform note: To practice looking at the world differently, you can start by imagining Earth from space or viewing images and footage of Earth from space. Many astronauts have described a dramatic shift in perspective when they look back at Earth for the first time and see the whole planet, undivided by political divisions or national borders. Psychologists call this “the overview effect,” the feeling of awe and deep connection to humanity that astronauts experience on their first flights.)

A well-rounded perspective is a foundational value in the practice of joy because**changing how we see the world changes how we experience it.** For example, say you’re stuck in a self-centered perspective. When someone bumps into you on the sidewalk, you’ll only see them as thoughtless and rude, which will leave you feeling angry or resentful. But, if you practice a well-rounded perspective, you can imagine that the stranger was rushing to help a friend or was simply distracted. Suddenly, you’ll feel compassion, instead of anger, and your experience of the interaction will change.

(Shortform note: As Rolf Dobelli explains in _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , our tendency to blame individuals for their problems is an example of what’s called fundamental attribution error, a cognitive bias that causes us to ignore outside influences on a situation and assign blame solely to the individual. This bias can lead to misunderstandings, misjudgments, and unfair assessments in our interactions with other people. Fundamental attribution error is even more common in individualistic societies, like the United States, where the culture places a greater emphasis on individual identity.)

#### Humility

According to Abrams, Tutu and the Dalai Lama believe that having a well-rounded perspective on your place in the vastness of the world naturally leads to humility. Humility is the understanding that we’re all flawed, and therefore no one is better or more important than anyone else. (Shortform note: If you want to become more humble, Neil Degrasse Tyson suggests starting with the study of astrophysics. In _Astrophysics for People in a Hurry_ , he argues that the vastness of the universe reminds you that people, and especially you, aren’t the center of the universe. In the grand scheme of things, human differences are trivial compared to what we have in common as a species.)

Humility allows you to understand your limited capacity to control the world or address the totality of its problems. Knowing you can’t address these challenges alone will naturally lead you to work more with others and, in doing so, you’ll gain a greater appreciation for our interdependence.

> **Shifting the Paradigm: Independence to Interdependence**
> 
> In _First Things First_ , Stephen Covey argues that our society tends to overvalue independence, always attributing success (or failure) to the individual. While he acknowledges that independence is important, our hyperfocus on independence comes with a cost. An independence paradigm focuses on individual production, which often causes people to neglect their personal needs or devalue time spent helping others or building relationships.
> 
> The paradigm of interdependence, on the other hand, states that individuals can’t live independently from one another. We necessarily rely on each other to live, work, and thrive. Covey suggests that shifting your orientation from independence to interdependence will provide you with greater life satisfaction in the knowledge that you’re contributing to the collective good.

Unlike humility, **arrogance, or the belief that we’re better or more special than others, leads to loneliness.** If you can’t acknowledge your flaws, or your capacity for both productive and destructive behavior, then you won’t be able to form authentic connections with other people. This lack of vulnerability and self-awareness will keep people at a distance. Moreover, if you don’t understand the important role other people play in your life, you can’t appreciate humanity’s interdependence.

(Shortform note: In _A New Earth, _Eckhart Tolle contends that humanity’s arrogance not only leads to loneliness but has also caused immeasurable harm to our species and the planet. He argues that we’re controlled by our egos, which drives us to seek fulfillment through ownership and feeling superior to others. This in turn drives consumerism, war, and environmental degradation. He argues that only by cultivating mindfulness, and becoming aware of the destructive tendencies of our ego-driven behavior, can we save humankind and the planet.)

Tutu and the Dalai Lama clarify that just because you’re not special doesn’t mean that you aren’t important. Every person has gifts to bring to the world. When you’re humble, you can celebrate and share your gifts, while also honoring the gifts that other people bring. (Shortform note: Jen Sincero, author of _You Are a Badass, _claims that everyone is born with a unique and valuable gift. Figuring out what that gift is will give your life purpose and meaning. She offers a few tips to help figure out what this “true calling” is, including trying something new to learn more about yourself and observing what the people around you are doing to notice what excites you.)

#### Humor

When you’re humble, you rarely take yourself too seriously, and it becomes easier to see the humor in a situation or to laugh at yourself. Life is often ridiculous and unexpected. Laughing at it is a recognition of that shared reality.

Abrams explains that, according to Tutu and the Dalai Lama,**humor has the power to improve our emotional and physical well-being.** Like humility, it’s a tool of connection. To joke or play with someone requires that you trust them, so good-natured humor is an invitation for vulnerability and emotional connection. Laughter can also act as a balm for suffering: Studies have also shown that laughter helps alleviate anxiety and stress.

(Shorform note: Not only does humor have the potential to improve your relationships and calm your nerves, but it can also prolong your life, especially if you’re a woman. A 2016 study found that people with a strong sense of humor live longer. Female participants in the study were 73% less likely to die from heart disease and 83% less likely to die from infection, while male participants had a 74% reduced risk for infection. Researchers found no link between humor and decreased risk of heart disease in men.)

#### Acceptance

The unpredictability of life can also be challenging. Like laughter, acceptance is a coping strategy when you’re faced with these challenges. Acceptance is the ability to let go of the desire to change what you can’t control.

According to Tutu and the Dalai Lama, much of our own stress comes from wishing things were different or feeling anger and frustration when things don’t go our way. However, Tutu and the Dalai Lama explain that **you must first accept reality if you have any hope of changing it.** Instead of allowing suffering to cause you greater suffering, you can look for opportunities to learn from it or find greater meaning in it. For example, if you feel frustrated in your relationship with a family member, you can be angry that the relationship is hard. Or, you can accept that the relationship is challenging, and then move past your anger to ask, “How can I improve this relationship?”

(Shortform note: In addiction recovery programs, acceptance is often considered the first step to making lasting change because acknowledging the reality of a situation allows you to begin the process of moving forward. In many cases, people who are struggling with addiction may be in denial about the severity of their condition or the impact it’s having on their lives. By accepting that they need help, people can take steps to change their behavior.)

#### Forgiveness

Sometimes, the things that are hardest to accept are the actions of other people. When you accept reality, you’re more likely to practice forgiveness—the deliberate choice to let go of feelings of anger or vengeance toward a person or people who have harmed you.

(Shortform note: Psychologists emphasize that forgiveness is often a long and difficult process, but they offer some strategies that can make it easier. First, be honest with yourself. To forgive someone, you must first acknowledge your own pain and how it’s affected your life. Next, acknowledge your vulnerability. Anger and resentment often come from a desire to protect yourself, so acknowledging your own frailty can make forgiveness easier. Finally, be humble, and remember that we’re all capable of doing harm—and doing better.)

Forgiveness is a powerful practice because **it breaks cycles of suffering**. If you’re harmed and you choose anger or vengeance, then you’ve chosen to respond to harm by causing more harm; but if you choose forgiveness, you can prevent further harm from happening. For example, if someone says something cruel to you and you say something cruel in reply, then you both continue to suffer. But if you forgive them and offer compassion, you have the opportunity to transform the interaction and interrupt the ongoing suffering.

(Shortform note: Holding onto resentment instead of practicing forgiveness can also cause physical suffering. Studies have shown that people who hold onto resentment and anger are more likely to experience severe depression or post-traumatic stress disorder, or be diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes.)

Yet Tutu and the Dalai Lama emphasize that **forgiveness is not the same as condoning harmful actions**. Just because you choose not to exact revenge for harm done to you doesn't mean you approve of the person’s actions. The Dalai Lama explains that forgiveness requires that you distinguish between the person and their action. You can condemn someone’s actions without condemning the person, maintaining compassion for the person who took the action.

> **Restorative Justice: A Different Way to Address Harm**
> 
> There’s a growing movement to put forgiveness into action at a community-wide level using the model of restorative justice. Restorative justice is a philosophy and approach to addressing harm that emphasizes the importance of repairing harm instead of focusing only on punishment or retribution. This philosophy is based on the principles of respect, responsibility, and relationship-building. It aims to empower individuals and communities to take ownership of the harm caused and work together to find solutions that promote healing, accountability, and reconciliation
> 
> Restorative justice processes typically involve bringing together the people affected by the incident, including the victim, the offender, and anyone else involved, to collectively determine the best way to repair the harm caused and move forward. This can sometimes involve an apology, restitution, community service, or a different form of making amends. Restorative justice has been applied in a range of settings, including schools, workplaces, and the criminal justice system.

#### Gratitude

According to the Dalai Lama, gratitude is accepting and appreciating what exists without focusing on what you wish were different. For example, if your car breaks down, you can suffer in your frustration (even knowing it wouldn’t change anything), or you can shift your perspective and feel grateful for the existence of public transportation, the ability to walk, or that you have a car at all.

When you do feel angry, bitter, or resentful, gratitude can be a powerful remedy. When you focus on what you don’t have, you suffer—but **when you express gratitude for what you have, you feel joy**. So while it may seem that you’re grateful when you’re happy, in actuality, you become happier the more grateful you are.

> **Are There Limits to the Power of Gratitude?**
> 
> Numerous studies have found a direct correlation between expressing gratitude and happiness. One study reported that gratitude not only increases happiness, but overall life satisfaction. Participants who expressed gratitude regularly demonstrated more prosocial behavior, reported higher-quality relationships, and had an increased sense of purpose and meaning.
> 
> However, there are still limits to the power of gratitude. A 2020 analysis of 27 studies on gratitude suggests that the impact of “gratitude interventions” on people experiencing depression is more limited than previously suggested. A positive outlook that requires people to suppress negative emotions and experiences, also known as “toxic positivity,” can cause people struggling with depression to experience greater shame and isolation and ultimately discourage them from seeking help.

The benefits of gratitude also extend to others. When you see the world as lacking, or deficient, you’re more likely to act out of a sense of scarcity. This fear will lead you to act only in your own self-interest. However, when you’re grateful, you see the world as full of abundance, and therefore you’re more willing to act generously toward other people. Studies have shown that those who regularly express gratitude are more empathetic, helpful, and generous toward people in their social networks.

(Shortform note: Although there’s no single neurological connection between gratitude and generosity, some evidence suggests that practicing gratitude can promote generosity. Studies have shown that when people feel grateful, the brain's reward center—the ventral striatum—becomes more active. Thus, people may experience positive emotions, such as happiness, contentment, and satisfaction. For example, a 2017 study found that participants who spent several weeks journaling about what they were thankful for showed greater brain activity in their reward center when they gave to a charity rather than spending money on themselves.)

#### Compassion

In this way, gratitude leads to compassion, the desire to alleviate another person’s suffering. When you’re grateful for what you have, your natural inclination is to turn your attention and concern to other people.

**Science suggests that we’re hardwired for compassion**. While many argue that people are innately selfish and competitive, cooperation has been more fundamental to humanity’s survival. As Tutu and the Dalai Lama reiterate, people are interdependent. We depend on others for survival and happiness; therefore, being invested in other people’s well-being is in our own self-interest.

(Shortform note: While there’s evidence of humans’ innate altruism, it’s hard to ignore the pervasiveness of war, poverty, and conflict in the modern world. Research suggests that while altruism was key to survival in hunter-gatherer societies, the agricultural societies that emerged around 12,000 years ago required greater specialization, which in turn led to more hierarchical structures in communities and an increase in self-serving behaviors.)

Even small acts of compassion, like smiling as you pass someone, are powerful because compassion is contagious. Studies have shown that witnessing acts of compassion inspires others to act more compassionately. Treating your loved ones with compassion will cause them to act more compassionately to the people they know, who’ll then also act more compassionately within their network, causing a powerful ripple effect beyond your own immediate circle.

(Shortform note: One reason why compassion is contagious is that it can activate the brain's mirror neuron system. Mirror neurons are a type of neuron that fires both when an individual performs an action and when they observe another individual performing the same action. The mirror neuron system is thought to play a key role in empathy and social cognition, allowing us to understand and share the emotions of others. When we witness acts of kindness or compassion, our mirror neurons may fire in response, leading us to experience similar emotions and feel more inclined to act compassionately ourselves.)

#### Generosity

According to Tutu and the Dalai Lama, generosity is compassion in action—the moment when you choose to act on your feelings of compassion to alleviate the suffering of others.

**Generosity, acting in service to others, is foundational to our own joy and well-being.** Neuroscience research shows that the reward center in our brains lights up when we help people, and our brain releases endorphins and oxytocin, making us happier _and_ healthier. Research has shown that just _thinking_ about generosity can strengthen people’s immune systems. (Shortform note: The benefits you get from acting generously aren’t dependent on witnessing the impact of your actions. One study found that feeding strangers’ parking meters led to a reported increase in subjective well-being, even though participants didn’t interact with the people they were helping.)

According to Buddhist teaching, there are three types of generosity: material giving (for example, money), freedom from fear (for example, compassion), and spiritual giving (for example, moral teaching). The Dalai Lama also emphasizes that giving your time can be a profound gift of generosity, whether this is volunteering or being fully present when you play with children.

(Shortform note: Research has shown that people who dedicate time to voluntarily helping others are happier than those who don’t. An examination of more than 17 longitudinal studies of over 74,000 participants found that volunteers had a greater sense of life satisfaction and reduced rates of depression when compared to non-volunteers. Researchers observed this trend in participants from over 130 countries, regardless of their economic status.)

Abrams adds that finding your purpose is also an act of generosity. Your purpose, he argues, is the way you choose to contribute to the world, so acting generously can begin with using your strengths to improve the well-being of others. (Shortform note: Not everyone knows intuitively what their purpose is. In _Find Your Why_ , Simon Sinek offers a four-step process to help you think more intentionally about what you’re called to do. He recommends recruiting a partner to help facilitate the conversation. A partner can ask you open-ended questions, identify key themes in your life, and reflect back to you what they hear.)

### The Three Truths About Suffering

In the previous section, we outlined the eight core values that will help you find joy through detaching your happiness from your external circumstances and thinking more about others. However, even if you know the steps you need to take to expand joy in your life, the practice often becomes more difficult when you’re in the midst of suffering. **Many people believe that their own suffering or the immense suffering in the world means they can’t (or shouldn’t) feel joy**. In the next section, we’ll explain why suffering doesn’t prevent you from experiencing joy and how it can sometimes even lead you to greater joy.

(Shortform note: The inability to feel joy in the face of suffering often leads to feelings of despair—a feeling of hopelessness that something is wrong and will never change for the better. People can feel despair about specific parts of their life, like their relationship or job prospects, or despair about their life or the future of the world. For example, in recent years, mental health professionals have seen a rise in what has been coined “climate despair,” an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness to prevent or mitigate the catastrophic impacts of climate change.)

Suffering _is_ inevitable, but Tutu and the Dalai Lama argue that it doesn’t have to affect your overall capacity for joy. They offer three truths about suffering that can help you turn back to joy in the midst of fear, anger, envy, sadness, isolation, and even death.

#### The First Truth: You Can Control How You Respond to Suffering

Much of our suffering is beyond our control. You might suffer because of a natural disaster, war, or an unexpected flooded basement. These are external circumstances that you can’t change. While this type of suffering is inevitable, the Dalai Lama explains that **much of human suffering is avoidable because it’s caused by our emotional response to our circumstances**.

> **Why We Worry**
> 
> Some of our emotional responses are deeply ingrained in our biology. For example, over the course of human evolution, worrying has been critical to our survival as a species. As Daniel Gilbert explains in _Stumbling on Happiness_ , the human brain is excellent at playing out hypothetical scenarios, a skill that’s helpful for identifying potential threats or assessing resource availability.
> 
> However, in our modern world, the threats we face are less black-and-white. We worry about the state of democracy or how technology is affecting our children. Our brain’s attempts to protect us from these more complicated threats often cause us to overanalyze the past or ruminate constantly about the future, resulting in a near-constant state of worry that can lead to depression or anxiety.

The Dalai Lama advocates for cultivating equanimity (what he calls “mental immunity”), the ability to maintain a calm and positive state of mind even in the face of adversity. Cultivating equanimity will help you minimize the internal suffering caused by negative emotions like anxiety, anger, envy, sadness, and loneliness.

(Shortform note: Mindfulness is a powerful tool for cultivating equanimity. According to Bhante Gunaratana, author of _Mindfulness in Plain English_ , mindfulness is the ability to observe your own thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. A regular meditation or mindfulness practice can help you minimize internal suffering by allowing you to ride the waves of your emotional ups and downs without judgment.)

Tutu and the Dalai Lama explain that fear is often the root cause of our negative emotions and therefore the cause of much of our internal suffering. In the next section, we’ll outline some strategies you can use to build up your mental resilience to negative emotions that stem from fear.

(Shortform note: To become more resilient to negative emotions, you must first develop your emotional intelligence, meaning greater awareness and management of your emotions. In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves argue that there are four pillars that make up emotional intelligence: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Cultivating these four pillars will help you process your emotions, manage emotional triggers, develop healthier patterns of thinking and behavior, and, ultimately, become more successful.)

##### Anxiety

**Sometimes fear of what we can’t control leads to anxiety.** Fear and anxiety are similar in that they both involve feelings of worry and unease. However, while fear is a natural emotional response to perceived danger or threat, anxiety isn’t always rooted in reality and can persist even when there’s no real danger. This constant state of anxiety leads to chronic stress which is unhealthy and can interfere with daily life.

(Shortform note: In _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers_ , neurologist Robert Sapolsky explains that chronic stress exists because humans’ stress response developed in response to short-term, physical stress factors like finding shelter or childbirth, but it hasn’t evolved to cope with the long-term sources of stress that are more typical of modern life, like meeting deadlines or planning for retirement. Our inability to cope with ongoing psychological and social stressors has led to an epidemic of chronic stress.)

When your lack of control leaves you feeling anxious, you can remember two things:

First, as Tutu and the Dalai Lama reiterate, the nature of humanity is cooperative. We live in an interdependent society in which we all need and rely on other people. Therefore, with any challenge you face,**you don’t have to solve the problem alone**. (Shortform note: In fact, believing that you can solve a problem alone will likely diminish your chances of success. In _Ego Is the Enemy_ , Ryan Holiday explains that an inflated belief in your own ability will limit your chances of succeeding. Ego, he argues, often leads to failure because it causes people to overestimate their knowledge and skills, underestimate potential threats, and dismiss the potential contributions of others.)

Second, when you experience something that you perceive as a threat, Tutu and the Dalai Lama recommend that you **reframe that threat as a challenge**. Reframing the perceived threat as something that your body and mind are getting ready to overcome is a form of “stress resilience” that will help you avoid the dangers of chronic stress. (Shortform Note: In _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers_ , Sapolsky suggests other strategies to help mitigate anxiety and chronic stress, including creating predictability in your life when you can, establishing a regular exercise routine, and making sure you have a strong social support network.)

##### Anger

**Fear of what we can’t control can also lead to frustration or anger**. For example, if someone you work with is promoted ahead of you, you might respond with anger by venting to a coworker or making unfounded accusations. This anger likely stems from the fear of not getting what you need or the fear that you’re not respected or loved. Like chronic stress, anger is rarely helpful because your emotions overwhelm your ability to think logically. (Shortform note: Many of us think of anger as a loud or violent outburst, but there are multiple types of anger. For example, passive-aggressive behavior can be a manifestation of anger, or anger can be directed inward and take the form of shame or negative self-talk.)

When you find yourself responding to fear with anger, ask yourself “What am I afraid of?” and try to address the root cause of your emotional response. You can also acknowledge responsibility by considering your own role in creating the situation that sparked your anger. It can also help to take a broader perspective, remembering that the person or people you’re in conflict with also have their own fears and values that are driving their actions.

(Shortform note: Some psychologists argue that anger is actually a useful emotion, and we shouldn’t be so quick to condemn it. For example, anger can signal a possible threat or the presence of injustice. While psychologists don’t condone expressing anger through violence, they also warn against suppressing the emotion. Instead, they suggest using anger for good, as a motivating force to incite positive change.)

##### Envy

**Our fear can also sometimes manifest as envy.** While social comparison is a natural instinct, envy shows up when those comparisons become a source of unhappiness. We often feel envy when someone has something that we don’t and we’re afraid that we’re somehow lesser because of it. Studies on happiness suggest that “upward comparisons'' (when you compare yourself to someone you think is your superior) are especially detrimental to your well-being.

(Shortform note: Research has found that social media use drives social comparisons, resulting in more frequent feelings of envy. Social media often presents a distorted and idealized version of other people's lives, where individuals only share their best moments, accomplishments, and possessions. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and insecurity for some individuals, as they compare their lives to the seemingly perfect lives of others.)

Tutu and Dalai Lama differ in their opinion on the best way to address envy:

Tutu argues that envy is natural and that you should accept these emotions when they arise without feeling guilty. He suggests that you can counteract envy by practicing gratitude for what you already have, using envy as motivation to achieve your goals, or questioning why you’re envious in the first place.

The Dalai Lama, on the other hand, identifies envy as a negative emotion that you can and should avoid before it even arises. Envy, he explains, is born out of consumer culture. So if you focus more on the acquisition of experience and knowledge rather than material items, you are less likely to suffer from envy. He also recommends the Buddhist practice of _mudita_ , or sympathetic kindness—celebrating the successes and happiness of others. The Dalai Lama emphasizes that joy is not a limited resource, and someone else’s joy should increase your joy, not diminish it.

> **Is It Possible to Suppress Negative Emotions?**
> 
> Several studies have explored the impact of suppressing negative emotions. A 2009 study of individuals undergoing treatment for addiction and alcohol abuse found that participants who attempted to suppress alcohol-related impulses thought about alcohol more often. A similar study found that attempts to resist negative emotions led to an increase in self-destructive behavior.
> 
> Psychologists suggest that even if you manage to avoid thinking about negative emotions during the day, your subconscious mind may still actively dwell on them at night. For example, some studies have found that participants who were told to suppress unwanted thoughts were more likely to dream about whatever they attempted to suppress.
> 
> According to some psychologists, we may struggle to avoid negative emotions because they’ve been crucial to our survival. Pain, anxiety, fear, and even envy can alert us to potential health issues, threats to our well-being, or issues in our relationships.

#### The Second Truth: Suffering Is a Universal Human Experience

According to Tutu and the Dalai Lama, the second truth to accept is that **suffering is inevitable and universal**. Every person experiences suffering, whether it’s the loss of a loved one or the trauma of war. In response to suffering, we often feel negative emotions like sadness or loneliness. However, recognizing the shared experience of suffering can be a balm against it because suffering is one of the things that connects us to other people.

(Shortform note: Viktor Frankl, a survivor of a WWII concentration camp and author of _Man’s Search for Meaning_ , explains that suffering is a subjective experience, meaning that there’s no objective measure of suffering. Whether you’ve lost your eyesight or your beloved childhood dog, you’ve suffered. Therefore, you can empathize with anyone’s experience of suffering, regardless of what their suffering looks like, or whether or not it’s the same as yours.)

##### Sadness

Sadness is often a source of suffering. However, Tutu and the Dalai Lama explain that while **sadness and joy may seem like polar opposites, they’re actually inextricably linked.** Sadness is often the direct route to empathy and compassion because grief and loss allow you to more clearly see your need and affection for other people. It’s often during periods of sadness or experiences of loss that we reach for one another for comfort or solidarity. Psychologists have found that mild sadness has a number of benefits, including better judgment, increased motivation, and greater generosity and well-being.

(Shortform note: Susan Cain delves into the relationship between joy and sadness in her book _Bittersweet_. She argues that bittersweetness, the feeling of longing or sorrow, helps us transcend personal and collective pain and build closer relationships with one another. When we refuse to acknowledge sadness, she explains, we run the risk of inadvertently causing harm, further isolating ourselves or others.)

Tutu and the Dalai Lama suggest finding meaning and purpose in your sadness. For example, when a loved one dies, use it as inspiration to be more intentional about living in ways that honor their memory. Grief can also act as a reminder of the richness of love. If you didn’t care deeply for someone, you’d feel nothing when they’re gone. Sadness reveals the depth of our capacity to love. (Shortform note: People living with depression often struggle to find or identify a sense of purpose. Psychologists recommend that if you’re feeling lost, it can help to do something for someone else, however small. For example, do a chore without being asked, call someone to check in, or give a stranger a compliment.)

##### Loneliness

According to Tutu and the Dalai Lama, sadness and loneliness often go hand in hand. The world is facing an epidemic of loneliness, which is further fueled by a culture of materialism that values production over connection, love, friendship, or community. (Shortform note: The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated existing problems of social isolation and loneliness. Although the death tolls declined and many countries lifted their emergency declarations, immunocompromised people have continued to struggle with isolation, even after many of their friends and colleagues transitioned back to normal life.)

Understanding that suffering is universal can empower you to approach people with compassion and openness. Every person experiences suffering; therefore, regardless of a person’s actions, you have the opportunity to feel closer to them by showing compassion for the ways in which they’re suffering. (Shortform note: If you’re feeling lonely, start with self-compassion. Studies have shown that self-compassion—being kind to yourself—decreases loneliness, while self-judgment and negative self-talk lead to increased feelings of loneliness.)

#### The Third Truth: Suffering Can Lead to Insight or Opportunity

Suffering has the potential to leave you bitter or resentful, but if you choose to find meaning in your suffering, it can also give you the opportunity to grow. Tutu and the Dalai Lama argue that compassion and generosity of spirit rarely come without suffering. For example, if you’ve experienced what it’s like to be physically impaired, you’re more likely to feel compassion when someone else has a similar experience.

(Shortform note: If it feels impossible to find meaning in suffering, outside intervention can help. One study found that caregivers, such as nurses, who regularly interact with the suffering of other people, can help patients derive meaning from their pain by supporting them to construct a narrative around it. By listening to a patient’s story about an illness or injury, nurses can help them reflect on the experience and draw meaningful conclusions that improve the patient’s experience.)

When suffering truly feels pointless, Tutu and the Dalai Lama counsel to remember that **suffering often leads to joy.** They explain that joy is not the antithesis of suffering—it’s what comes after suffering. Experiencing something hard allows you to better appreciate moments of joy. For example, when you’ve experienced a temporary physical ailment, you’re even more grateful when you regain your health and mobility.

(Shortform note: The theory that people grow as a result of traumatic experiences, sometimes referred to as post-traumatic growth, is based on research on people’s self-perception of how they responded to trauma, with little evidence pointing to concrete changes. One systematic review of the research suggests that people grow in response to positive and traumatic experiences, suggesting that perhaps it’s human nature to evolve over the course of a lifetime, regardless of the quality of life experiences.)

Tutu and the Dalai Lama acknowledge that humanity’s fear and anxiety around death may be one of our greatest sources of suffering. Many of us live in fear of our own mortality. However, they explain, death is yet another part of life that’s beyond your control. It’s not only natural and inevitable, but necessary. As with other sources of suffering, you can find meaning in death. Knowing that our life spans are limited offers inspiration to live intentionally, in service of others, and, ultimately, in service of joy.

(Shortform note: In _Being Mortal_ , Atul Gawande argues that the modern approach to death stems from our fear of dying and ultimately harms our personal and societal well-being. To approach dying better, he argues, we need to reorient our thinking from a future mindset to present mindset. A present-focused mindset, for example, might prioritize the immediate comfort of a patient over ongoing attempts to prolong their life. Refocusing on the present, Gawands explains, will enable us to live more fulfilling lives, right up until the very end.)
