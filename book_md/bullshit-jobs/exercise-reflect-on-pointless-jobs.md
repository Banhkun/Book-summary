## Exercise: Reflect on Pointless Jobs

This exercise will give you a chance to explore Graeber's arguments about pointless jobs and reflect on your own experiences in the workforce.

* * *

Graeber argues that when workers consider their jobs pointless, they're usually right. Have you ever had to do anything at work that you considered pointless? If so, describe the task and explain why you thought it served no purpose.

Graeber explains that when workers consider their jobs pointless, they are referencing a personal standard of the value of work and finding that their current position falls short. Whatâ€™s your own personal standard of value regarding work? Explain in your own words what it means to have a purposeful job.
