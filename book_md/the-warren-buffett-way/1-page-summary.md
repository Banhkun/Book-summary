## 1-Page Summary

To the uninitiated, investing can seem daunting and inaccessible, leading many to either hire professionals to manage their investments or forswear investing altogether. But according to investment professional Robert G. Hagstrom, this mindset can cause you to leave millions on the table. Hagstrom argues that **novice investors should emulate the greatest investor in history—Warren Buffett—so that they too can earn above-market returns.**

In his 2013 book _The Warren Buffett Way, _Hagstrom outlines and explains Buffett’s approach to stock market investing. Hagstrom argues that, rather than simply deferring to financial analysts, investors should follow suit with Buffett and assess companies along four dimensions—their financial prospects, their market value, their business model, and their management—to identify promising companies to invest in. This approach, he suggests, allows investors to find exceptional investment opportunities, leaving them poised to earn exceptional returns.

As the current Chief Investment Officer of EquityCompass, an investment firm that manages over $4 billion in assets, Hagstrom brings years of investing experience into his arguments throughout _The Warren Buffett Way_. Moreover, having written eight investing books geared toward a general audience, Hagstrom makes accessible even the most complicated aspects of Buffett’s approach to investing.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss how Buffett quantitatively analyzes companies, explaining Buffett’s specific metrics for evaluating companies’ market value and finances. Next, we’ll examine Buffett’s process for qualitatively assessing companies, outlining the dimensions along which Buffett evaluates companies’ management and business models. To conclude, we’ll examine how Buffett recommends managing your portfolio, including how to allocate your portfolio and avoid psychological pitfalls. Throughout this guide, we’ll also consider alternative approaches to investing and discuss updates to Hagstrom’s arguments.

### How Buffett Quantitatively Assesses Companies

According to Hagstrom, Buffett recognizes the importance of rigorous quantitative analysis of the companies he considers investing in. In this section, we’ll first outline how Buffett learned to do so from investing legend Benjamin Graham, and then discuss the metrics that Buffett uses to assess a company’s market value and its financial prospects.

#### The Influence of Benjamin Graham

As Hagstrom relates, Buffett was persuaded by the key arguments of Graham’s investing classic, _The Intelligent Investor_ , when studying under Graham at Columbia Business School. In particular, Hagstrom argues that **Graham showed Buffett the merits of _value investing_ , which involves purchasing companies’ stock for less than its true value. **Because Graham developed value investing in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929, its key tenets are diametrically opposed to the reckless speculation that drove the stock market crash–a crash that occurred because investors assumed the stock market could only rise, leading to widespread speculative investing.

To understand this approach to investing, we first need to understand the distinction between a company’s share price __ and its intrinsic value. Share price, quite simply, refers to the _actual_ price of one share of a company’s stock—for example, at the beginning of 2023, one share of Tesla stock cost $118.47.

(Shortform note: One fact that complicates our ability to track a stock’s value is that even on a day-to-day basis, share price is _volatile_ , meaning that it experiences swings. Indeed, most stocks swing approximately one percent in either direction on a given day, while some stocks can even experience five percent swings or greater in a single day.)

Hagstrom notes, however, that intrinsic value is harder to define. We’ll examine how exactly Buffett determines a company’s intrinsic value later in this guide; but roughly put, the intrinsic value of a company’s stock is the _fair value_ of that stock, assuming all relevant information was known. To illustrate, if excessive optimism had led investors to aggressively buy Tesla stock at the start of 2023, rapidly increasing its stock price, then it’s possible that Tesla’s intrinsic value was lower than its share price of $118.47.

For his part, Graham points out that if you buy stock at a discount to its intrinsic value, you’ve gotten a good deal on the stock. Moreover, he argues that because a company’s share price tracks its intrinsic value over the long term, **value investing makes it likely that you’ll profit on your investment as the discounted share price increases to match its intrinsic value**. For instance, if Tesla was _undervalued_ at $118.47, at which point you chose to invest in it, then you’ll ultimately profit when the market adjusts its share price to match its intrinsic value.

(Shortform note: Like Graham, many investors assume that intrinsic value is a real entity, but it bears mentioning that some experts disagree. Indeed, certain economists argue that there is no such thing as intrinsic value because goods are only valuable to the extent that consumers will pay for them. For example, in the case of precious metals like gold and silver, they argue that these metals were valuable historically because we used them as currency, not because they possess intrinsic value. Likewise, they reason that stocks are only valuable to the extent that consumers are willing to pay for them, which means that in practice, stock prices may never actually catch up to their supposed intrinsic value.)

#### How Buffett Assesses a Company’s Market Value

While Graham taught Buffett the general principles of value investing, **Buffett developed his own approach to calculating intrinsic value to find companies that are undervalued**. In this section, we’ll examine how Buffett determines a stock’s intrinsic value by establishing a _company_ ’s intrinsic value and then translating this value into a _margin of safety_ when he invests.

##### Metric #1: Intrinsic Value

As mentioned previously, a stock’s intrinsic value is roughly its fair value. According to Hagstrom, however, Buffett refines this definition by starting with the **company’s intrinsic value, which is its expected net income over its lifetime, deducting an appropriate discount rate**.

Though Hagstrom doesn’t specify how Buffett calculates a company’s expected net income over its lifetime, he clarifies that Buffett seeks companies that historically have had consistent earnings growth because it’s easier to estimate future earnings for such companies. Next, after estimating a company’s future earnings, he discounts that figure by the long-term government bond rate.

(Shortform note: Buffett discounts expected earnings by the long-term government bond rate to account for the _time value of money_ —the idea that a fixed amount of money in the future is worth less than that same amount of money today because you could invest the money received today. For example, if you received $100 at the beginning of 2023, you could invest it in a ten-year treasury bond at 3.79% interest, leaving you with $145 by the beginning of 2033. This means that, in effect, $100 given to you at the beginning of 2023 is worth _more_ than $100 given to you at the beginning of 2033.)

##### Metric #2: Safety Margin

As Hagstrom relates, **Buffett determines a company’s intrinsic value to create a margin of safety when investing** , as he seeks companies whose stock is significantly undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Specifically, he seeks companies whose _intrinsic value per share_ —that is, the company’s intrinsic value divided by its number of outstanding shares—is much higher than their share price on the stock market.

Buffett’s reasoning for seeking a safety margin is twofold. First, because companies’ stock prices over the long term will correspond with their intrinsic value, companies whose stock price is currently undervalued are likely to see their stock rise in the long term. Second, when his investments have a margin of safety, they’re less likely to see their stock prices drop even if their intrinsic value takes a hit since their intrinsic value per share is higher than their share price to begin with.

(Shortform note: In _The Intelligent Investor_ , Graham further argues that you can increase your margin of safety by diversifying your portfolio–that is, by increasing the number and type of companies you’re invested in. After all, if you only invest in one company, then you’re more likely to lose money because all it takes is one company tanking for your investment to fail. By contrast, if you invest in multiple companies across different industries, then you’ll still be able to turn a profit even if some of the stocks suffer a price hit.)

#### How Buffett Assesses a Company’s Finances

Hagstrom notes that, although Graham’s influence is most evident in Buffett’s approach to value investing, it also shaped Buffett’s preference for quantitatively analyzing companies’ finances—typically over a five-year time frame since financial data are volatile on a yearly basis. In particular, Hagstrom explains that **Buffett seeks companies that have a high return on equity, owner earnings, profit margins, and ratio of retained earnings to share value** , metrics that indicate good financial health.

##### Metric #1: Return on Equity

Hagstrom first explains that **Buffett prefers looking at companies’ return on equity (ROE) to assess how efficiently companies generate profits,** though he tweaks several aspects of the standard definition of return on equity to isolate financial factors alone.

Generally, ROE equals a company’s __ operating earnings (its revenue minus operating expenses) divided by its shareholder equity (its assets, such as inventory,__ minus its liabilities, such as debts). For instance, if a company’s operating earnings were $75 million over the course of the year and its shareholder equity were $50 million, its return on equity ($75 divided by $50) would be $1.50.

(Shortform note: Buffett’s definition of ROE as operating earnings divided by shareholder earnings is somewhat atypical–ROE is standardly defined as a company’s net income divided by its shareholder equity. In practice, Buffett’s definition yields slightly higher ROEs, since net income subtracts operating and non-operating expenses from a company’s operating earnings, meaning that net income is less than operating earnings alone.)

However, when calculating ROE, Buffett excludes capital gains and losses, since he wants to **look solely at the business’s performance rather than how well the company has invested its money**. Moreover, Hagstrom notes that Buffett includes the original cost __ of securities that a company owns when examining its net worth, rather than their current market value, so that net worth isn’t affected by external factors such as the stock market’s performance. After all, if a company’s stock holdings rise dramatically one year, increasing its net worth, this could dwarf impressive operating earnings when looking at return on equity.

(Shortform note: When companies own stock in other publicly traded companies, it’s known as _cross-holding_. For example, Buffett’s own company, Berkshire Hathaway, holds stock in several other companies, making it a holding company–a company that doesn’t manufacture goods or services of its own, but rather holds controlling stock in other companies.)

##### Metric #2: Owner Earnings

Next, Hagstrom points out that **Buffett assesses companies’ future earnings prospects using _owner earnings_ , a metric he developed** as an alternative to the more common _cash flow_ , which tends to overvalue certain companies.

Cash flow, Hagstrom notes, is roughly the amount of cash going into (or out of) a company in a given year. Traditionally, it’s defined as a company’s net income plus its depreciation (how much of its assets’ values have been lost), depletion (how much a company spends extracting natural resources), and amortization (the cost of intangible assets, like patents, spread out across their lifespan).

(Shortform note: Depreciation, depletion, and amortization are added back to net income to determine cash flow because they’re _non-cash expenses_. In other words, they initially lower your net income, meaning they have to be added back to net income to calculate the actual cash that is going in and out of your company.)

However, according to Hagstrom, Buffett realized that cash flow fails to include capital expenditures—money used to purchase or repair physical assets, such as heavy machinery in a factory. Because many companies have capital expenditures that at least offset their depreciation, they have cash flows that are misleadingly inflated relative to the actual money going in and out of the company. For this reason, Buffett developed owner earnings, which is simply cash flow _minus_ capital expenditures; this metric, he suggests, is less likely to become overinflated.

(Shortform note: Industries that require costly assets have more pronounced capital expenditures than others. For instance, companies in the automotive, airline, and oil industries all have outsized capital expenditures, as they require expensive factories, airplanes, and oil rigs, respectively. By contrast, companies in the software industry typically have much lower capital expenditures, as software engineers need few expensive assets.)

##### Metric #3: Profit Margins

Though Buffett modifies the definition of return on equity, and outright invents the notion of owner earnings, his approach to profit margins is much more mainstream. According to Hagstrom, **Buffett prefers investing in companies with high profit margins** because high profit margins indicate a willingness to cut unnecessary expenses.

Profit margins are a company’s profit divided by its revenue. For instance, if a company’s revenue were $100 million and its profit were $75 million, then its profit margins would be 75%. Since profit equals revenue minus expenses, Buffett reasons that companies with high profit margins are likely those that cut costs because one natural way to increase profits is to cut extra spending, making these companies ideal investment targets—after all, profitability is closely correlated to shareholder value.

> **Profit Margins and Pricing Power**
> 
> In addition to cutting costs, companies can also increase their profit margins if they have _pricing power_ –the ability to raise prices while maintaining the same level of demand. Often, companies with pricing power offer a unique product with no competitors, allowing them to increase prices without fear of being underpriced by competitors. For example, experts note that Apple has pricing power because the iPhone is often considered superior to all competitors.
> 
> Given the ease with which pricing power allows companies to increase profit margins, it’s unsurprising that Buffett has elsewhere called it the most important factor in evaluating a business–more so than even company management. After all, companies with pricing power are shielded against the harms of inflation because they can simply raise prices, making them resistant to the economic downturns that can sink other companies.

##### Metric #4: The One-Dollar Test

According to Hagstrom, Buffett’s final method for judging companies is whether they satisfy the “one-dollar test.” These are **companies whose market value increases by at least one dollar for every dollar of earnings they retain**.

The one-dollar test, Hagstrom notes, shows how effectively companies use their retained earnings—that is, their net income after paying dividends to shareholders. He suggests that companies that savvily re-invest their retained earnings will see their market value increase proportionately. So, companies whose market value increases by at least one dollar for every dollar of retained earnings are likely those that know how best to reinvest their earnings, making them an attractive investment target.

(Shortform note: Hagstrom doesn’t explain how to apply the one-dollar test in practice. To do so, you first need to calculate retained earnings over a given time frame by subtracting a company’s dividends per share from its earnings per share (its net profit divided by the number of its outstanding shares). Then, you simply compare its stock price differential to its retained earnings to see whether the ratio is at least one-to-one. For example, if a company’s stock totaled $100 billion at the end of 2022 and $140 billion at the end of 2023, yielding a $40 billion difference in market value, then it will pass Buffett’s one-dollar test so long as it retained $40 billion or less in earnings.)

### How Buffett Qualitatively Assesses Companies

While Buffett embraced Graham’s numbers-driven approach to evaluating companies, he was also sensitive to the qualitative factors that underlie promising companies. In this section, we’ll first examine how Buffett learned the importance of certain qualitative factors from Phil Fisher before moving on to discuss the metrics that Buffett uses to evaluate companies’ business models and management teams in particular.

#### The Influence of Phil Fisher

While Graham placed little emphasis on a company’s qualitative aspects, Phil Fisher held that the more subjective aspects of a company could provide valuable investing guidance. According to Hagstrom, **Buffett embraced Fisher’s views on the importance of assessing a company’s _potential_ and _management_ **when deciding whether to invest.

Hagstrom points out that Buffett was persuaded to embrace Fisher’s views by Charlie Munger, the current vice chairman of Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and a longstanding friend.

(Shortform note: Fisher is best known for his seminal work _Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits_ , in which he introduced his “scuttlebutt method” of performing due diligence by speaking with as many people associated with the company as possible rather than only poring over financial reports. In so doing, he suggested that you can develop an edge over the average investor who isn’t willing to do that level of analysis.)

##### Assessing a Company’s Potential

Hagstrom says that Fisher defines a company’s potential as its ability to significantly increase its intrinsic value over the long term. Even if such companies aren’t currently undervalued—as Graham would desire in an investment—Fisher reasons that their share prices are likely to drastically increase over the long term because share price roughly tracks intrinsic value. This prospect makes them attractive investments.

According to Hagstrom, Fisher used two proxies to determine potential: increasing sales and increasing profits. On the one hand, Fisher thought that growth in sales indicated a strong research and development team, as a company’s sales won’t easily increase if it doesn’t continue refining its product. But Fisher also recognized that increasing sales means nothing without increasing profit, since profit most closely correlates with shareholder value. So, he also sought companies that relentlessly cut costs, as cutting costs translates directly to greater profit margins.

(Shortform note: In addition to sales and profits, other experts point out that a company’s potential is partially constrained by its industry. For instance, companies that are in burgeoning industries–like the tech industry in the late twentieth century–are more likely to have high potential, whereas those in languishing industries–like the newspaper industry–will likely have less growth potential.)

##### Assessing a Company’s Management

Along with potential, Hagstrom notes that Fisher valued honest management, since companies with solid business models can nonetheless flounder under shoddy management. After all, self-centered executives are liable to act out of self-interest rather than the interests of the company; for instance, they might pay themselves an outsized salary that cuts into company profits. Similarly, management teams that mistreat their employees can foster resentment which, ultimately, can make the company less successful.

(Shortform note: In publicly traded companies, shareholders themselves have the authority to indirectly appoint new management, as they’re allowed to elect a board of directors that can vote to remove the CEO. However, some experts note that this can unfairly target management, as shareholders often take out their frustrations on CEOs whenever the company experiences any turbulence.)

#### How Buffett Assesses a Company’s Business Model

Returning to Buffett’s approach to investing, Hagstrom contends that Buffett assesses a company’s business model to identify companies with the potential that Fisher seeks. In particular, Hagstrom relates that **Buffett prefers to invest in companies that are _simple_ , _predictable_ , and have a _long-term competitive advantage_** because he can be confident those companies will succeed in the future.

##### Metric #1: Simplicity

First, Hagstrom explains Buffett’s notion that **you should only invest in companies with easily understandable business models.** He argues that by investing in simpler companies, you’re more capable of making savvy investment decisions because you’re better poised to understand developments in the company. After all, if you invest in a company far outside your area of expertise, it’ll be difficult to assess any news that’s relevant to the company’s underlying business.

(Shortform note: Though Buffett’s investment advice is geared toward publicly traded stocks, it can apply to other investment decisions as well. For example, other experts argue that preferring simple, understandable investments is a good reason to avoid cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies, they argue, are rife with uncertainty and confusion, making them difficult to understand for all but a select few investors. Consequently, they contend that most investors should steer clear of them.)

##### Metric #2: Predictability

Additionally, Hagstrom says, **you should prefer investing in companies that are predictable** and have consistently produced the same product. As Hagstrom relates, Buffett’s reasoning for preferring predictable companies is twofold. First, Buffett thinks that companies that pivot frequently and often change their primary product are more prone to blunders because there’s a learning curve whenever you shift products. And second, Buffett holds that companies that have delivered success in the past with one main product are likely to do so in the future, since past success is a good indicator of future success.

> **The Possible Downside of Predictability**
> 
> Though Buffett may be correct that consistency is _generally_ desirable for companies, other experts warn that consistency can be dangerous in excess. For example, in _Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models_ , Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann argue that companies must be willing to adapt to ever-changing societal norms and desires. Consequently, they suggest that companies that are too dedicated to their current business model can fail in the face of societal change.
> 
> To avoid this pitfall, in _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek offers business advice that differs from Buffett’s. Sinek argues that companies should try to anticipate changing preferences so that they can preemptively pivot rather than consistently sticking with one business model. However, it might be possible to reconcile Sinek’s advice with Buffett’s–because Buffett is offering _investment_ advice, he may nonetheless agree that companies should be willing to pivot, even though frequent pivoting isn’t desirable from an investor’s perspective.

##### Metric #3: Long-Term Competitive Advantage

In a similar vein, Hagstrom notes that **Buffett seeks companies with a long-term competitive advantage** as potential investing targets. In short, these competitive advantages are sustainable edges that companies use to remain on top of the competition; for instance, Tesla’s battery supply chain, which is considered superior to competitors’ supply chains, constitutes a competitive advantage. Such companies, Buffett argues, are likely to continue delivering impressive returns to shareholders, making them an attractive investment.

(Shortform note: Elsewhere, Buffett clarifies that a long-term competitive advantage creates a “moat” that shields companies’ profits from potential competitors. Much like a moat protects castles from attackers and thereby stabilizes the castle, he suggests that long-term competitive advantages make companies less susceptible to competition and provide a degree of stability.)

By contrast, Hagstrom points out that **Buffett avoids investing in companies that primarily sell commodities** , which are products that are largely indistinguishable from one another—like gas, gold, and water. Buffett argues that because these companies struggle to develop any advantage over competitors, they’re less likely to deliver the exceptional returns he’s looking for.

(Shortform note: Although companies that sell commodities generally struggle to differentiate themselves, some have managed to do so with great success. For example, Liquid Death—a company that sells bottles of spring water, sparkling water, and iced tea—has become wildly popular because of its ironic branding and committed customer base.)

#### How Buffett Assesses a Company’s Management

Though Buffett recognizes the value of companies with promising business models, he also learned from Fisher that such companies can falter under poor management. Consequently, Hagstrom argues that **Buffett assesses management in terms of their capital allocation, transparency, and resistance to trends** when deciding whether to invest.

##### Metric #1: Capital Allocation

To begin, Hagstrom explains Buffett’s view that because investors seek companies that will deliver a high return on investment, **management should allocate capital in a way that maximizes shareholder value**.

Put simply, capital allocation refers to the distribution of company earnings—in other words, what the company _does_ with the money it earns. Broadly speaking, Buffett holds that companies can either reinvest that money within the company, such as by sending additional funding to promising branches, or use it to pay dividends to shareholders. Crucially, while the second option seems like a natural way to maximize shareholder value, Buffett argues that if companies can reinvest that same money within the company __ to deliver long-term returns that are greater than those dividends, they should do so. Conversely, he recommends that companies pay dividends if they can’t earn shareholders greater returns by investing their earnings internally.

(Shortform note: One traditional way that companies reinvest money internally is by funding _research and development _(R&D) that seeks to learn how to improve existing products and processes while also developing new products. However, experts note that although R&D spending has increased globally, it’s been delivering lower returns since around 2010. These lower returns, they argue, are the result of focusing R&D on short-term gains rather than long-term projects, indicating that companies should instead consider allocating capital to fund long-term R&D.)

##### Metric #2: Transparency

Just like capital allocation can show that companies value their shareholders, transparency is also indicative of shareholder-oriented companies. According to Hagstrom, Buffett holds that **you should invest in companies that are transparent about their finances** rather than those who obscure their failures through convoluted financial reports.

In particular, Hagstrom suggests that deceptive managers are defending their own interests rather than shareholders’, as they prevent shareholders from making well-informed investment decisions. Consequently, you can’t trust managers of those companies to act in your best interests, making them an unappealing investment.

(Shortform note: Moreover, a lack of transparency from management can lead to illegal insider trading–the practice of using non-public information to gain an advantage trading a company’s stock. For example, a CEO might inform management of a pending press release that will lead to a significant stock dip, allowing them to sell their shares ahead of time to avoid losing money.)

##### Metric #3: Trend Resistance

According to Hagstrom, Buffett’s final criterion for evaluating management is its resistance to popular industry trends. Hagstrom writes that **Buffett prefers companies that don’t readily submit to popular business trends** since these trends are often irrational and harm companies’ bottom lines.

As Buffett sees it, management teams often make suboptimal decisions simply because other management teams are doing the same. For example, many company executives relentlessly acquire smaller companies to appear growth-oriented, even when these acquisitions aren’t best for shareholders. So, Buffett holds that companies whose management teams _don’t_ blindly adopt industry-wide trends are a better investment because they’re less likely to imitate others’ harmful decisions.

(Shortform note: Elsewhere, Buffett clarifies that there’s a close connection between companies that succumb to trends and those with poor capital allocation skills; he notes that companies that submit to institutional trends end up allocating capital poorly because these trends often involve spending inordinately to acquire expensive new companies. By contrast, those that resist these trends can more objectively assess how to allocate their capital.)

### How to Manage Your Portfolio

Having seen how Buffett chooses which individual companies to invest in, we’ll now discuss how he manages his broader investing portfolio. First, we’ll examine the key tenets of _focus investing_ , Buffett’s approach that emphasizes focusing on a select group of stocks. Then, we’ll discuss the psychological pitfalls associated with focus investing and how to avoid them.

#### The Superiority of Focus Investing

According to Hagstrom, Buffett departs significantly from the mainstream when it comes to portfolio management. He writes that, while most investors diversify their portfolios broadly to minimize volatility, **Buffett focuses on a select handful of stocks to maximize his chances of above-market returns**.

To see the merits of focus investing, it’ll help to first discuss the main alternative: diversification. Hagstrom notes that investors traditionally prefer diversified portfolios because they supposedly minimize risk—after all, if you have 1,000 stocks represented in your portfolio and one lone stock takes a nosedive, it’s unlikely to cause a catastrophic loss. By contrast, if you only have five stocks in your portfolio, one plummeting stock could cause an outsized loss.

> **How to Diversify Your Portfolio Outside of the Stock Market**
> 
> Although diversification is typically discussed in the context of stock market investing, experts note that investors can diversify their portfolios beyond the stock market. For example, you can invest in:
> 
>   * Bonds, which involve loaning money to governments or private corporations in exchange for a modest return down the road.
> 
>   * Gold, which is generally protected from the volatility of the stock market.
> 
>   * Real estate, which is simpler and can provide a lower-risk investment than many stocks.
> 
> 

> 
> By pursuing these alternative investments, you can better protect yourself in the case of a stock-market crash which can devastate those who have only invested in stocks. For this reason, investing legend John C. Bogle (_The Little Book of Common Sense Investing_) recommends that even the most aggressive investors keep no more than 80% of their portfolio in stocks.

However, Hagstrom points out that Buffett is opposed to diversification for one simple reason—it can only lead to mediocre results relative to the market’s average returns. After all, the more diversified your portfolio is, the more closely its returns will mirror those of the stock market.

Not content with mediocrity, Buffett instead prefers a portfolio consisting of around 10 stocks that he deems exceptional. To show that this approach is most likely to generate above-market returns, Hagstrom cites a statistical simulation showing how hypothetical portfolios of different sizes performed over time. This simulation included 3,000 portfolios of only 15 stocks—the focus group—3,000 portfolios of 50 stocks, 3,000 portfolios of 100 stocks, and 3,000 portfolios of 250 stocks. Hagstrom notes that, of the focus portfolios, over 25% beat the market over a sample 10-year period; by contrast, only 2% of the portfolios with 250 stocks beat the market over that same time span.

Admittedly, Hagstrom concedes that because smaller portfolios are more _volatile_ —meaning they have greater swings in value—they’re also much more likely to deliver _below-average_ returns. However, he suggests that investors can avoid this possibility through Buffett’s savvy stock selection, which he deems far less likely to yield subpar returns.

> **Diversification and the Merits of “Mediocre” Returns**
> 
> Though Hagstrom deems market-average returns mediocre when discussing the argument against diversification, it’s worth mentioning that the average investor _already_ earns far below market-average returns. Indeed, expert analysis reveals that between 2000 and 2020, the average equity fund investor earned only 4.25% annually, while the S&P 500 earned 6.06%.
> 
> Experts contend that investors earn below-market returns for various reasons. For instance, they tend to buy stocks when the market is high and sell when it’s low, leading to worse returns than if they simply held their stocks indefinitely. But, according to Bogle, one particular reason stands out: Many investors invest in actively managed mutual funds with high portfolio turnover, generating inflated trading costs and fees paid to those mutual funds and reducing investors’ returns.
> 
> Consequently, Bogle recommends investing in index funds—funds that track an underlying index, yielding a diversified portfolio—to avoid these costs and enjoy market-average returns. In so doing, you’ll earn more than the vast majority of investors, even though you’ll only be earning the “market average.” So, for investors not yet confident enough to embrace Buffett’s focus investing, index funds are a viable alternative.

##### Focus Investing and Modern Portfolio Theory

It bears mentioning that Buffett’s focus investing is diametrically opposed to the orthodox investing approach in academia– _modern portfolio theory_. In particular, **Buffett rejects portfolio theory’s understanding of market efficiency and risk.**

**View #1: The Efficient Market Hypothesis**

As Hagstrom relates, the cornerstone of the modern portfolio is the efficient market hypothesis (EMH)–the thesis that stock market prices perfectly reflect all available information about a given company, meaning all stocks are fairly priced. Consequently, proponents of EMH reason that investing ultimately boils down to luck, since no amount of analysis will reveal insights that aren’t already baked into a company’s stock price.

(Shortform note: Although Hagstrom and other investors write as if EMH is one simple thesis, economists typically distinguish between several forms of EMH. For instance, only the strong form of EMH states that _all_ information, public or private, is baked into stock prices. By contrast, the weak form of EMH specifies only that all past financial information is baked into stock prices, a more modest claim.)

Buffett rejects EMH, arguing that many investors—himself included—have used focus investing to generate above-market returns, and these returns aren’t just the product of luck. These investors, including Charlie Munger, Bill Ruane, and Lou Simpson, all used similar approaches to investing, centered around Graham’s strategy of finding undervalued stocks. And rather than claiming that the success of this shared approach is a coincidence, Buffett finds it much more believable that EMH is simply mistaken.

(Shortform note: While Hagstrom claims that Buffett’s success could only be chalked up to luck if the EMH were true, another explanation exists: EMH _wasn’t_ true when Buffett began investing, but it’s true _now_. In other words, we might respond that the market _was_ less efficient in the 1980s and 90s, allowing Buffett to find an investing edge through in-depth analysis, but it’s now efficient enough that his analysis is pointless. Indeed, experts argue that the US stock market became significantly more efficient between 1998 and 2010 alone, making it plausible that the market was less efficient when Buffett began investing.)

**View #2: Defining Risk as Volatility**

Because modern portfolio theory holds that investing boils down to luck, it defines risk as volatility, since the more volatile your portfolio is, the more likely that you’ll lose money. Buffett, however, has a different conception of risk when investing: According to Hagstrom, he defines it as the possibility that you’ll be left with less purchasing power than you began with.

(Shortform note: Because portfolios with more stocks spread across different industries are less volatile, modern portfolio theory contends that diversified portfolios are also less risky since they minimize volatility. However, it’s worth mentioning that even the most diversified portfolios can be volatile because the market _itself_ is volatile; for instance, the stock market typically experiences at least one 30% annual drop in a given 12-year period.)

Hagstrom explains that, for this reason, Buffett emphasizes the importance of patience to mitigate risk. After all, if you’ve selected an exceptional stock to invest in, it’s highly likely that its stock price will rise given enough time. By contrast, even if you invest in an exceptional company, your risk will be high if you only hold it for one week since the stock market experiences short-term ebbs and flows.

(Shortform note: In stark contrast to Buffett’s patient approach to investing, some investors engage in _day trading_ —purchasing and selling securities within a single day in hopes of profiting from daily price fluctuations. But experts warn that day trading is exceedingly risky since these fluctuations can generate quick losses.)

#### Psychological Pitfalls to Avoid

Because focus investing leads to greater volatility, it can make you more prone to psychological pitfalls. Hagstrom argues that **to maximize success,** **focus investors must avoid excessive confidence, overreaction bias, and myopic loss aversion**.

**Pitfall #1: Excessive Confidence**

First, Hagstrom argues that **investors need to avoid having excessive confidence,** which leads directly to shoddy investment decisions. This overconfidence bias, he notes, is a general problem; for example, a large majority of people consider themselves above-average drivers, even though only half of all drivers are above-average. When it comes to investing in particular, overconfident investors are liable to invest too heavily in stocks they deem exceptional, leaving them susceptible to large losses if these stocks dip.

(Shortform note: Though Hagstrom cautions against excessive confidence, he doesn’t offer specific actionables for avoiding it. To that end, experts list various strategies for dealing with overconfidence. For example, they recommend specifically asking others to share their views so that you’re exposed to opinions that differ from your own. In a similar vein, they advise seeking out disconfirming information–information that calls your own beliefs into question–so that you don’t hold your views blindly but rather are aware of the counterarguments.)

**Pitfall #2: Overreaction Bias**

Next, Hagstrom argues that **investors must overcome overreaction bias** because it leads them to make imprudent, snap decisions on the basis of recent events alone. Put simply, overreaction bias refers to our tendency to assign too much weight to recently discovered information in our decision-making process.

For example, seniors in high school might decide which college to attend on the basis of a recent shift in college rankings, even though this recent shift is ultimately a small data point. In the case of investing, Hagstrom writes that overreaction bias can lead investors to overemphasize short-term developments—like dips in the stock market, or recent earnings reports—instead of focusing on companies’ long-term prospects. Because savvy investing depends on these long-term prospects, overreaction can lead to suboptimal decisions.

(Shortform note: Overreaction bias is often intertwined with negativity bias–our tendency to weigh negative information far more heavily than positive information when making decisions. In the case of investing, this means that investors are more likely to overreact when presented with negative information, such as a disappointing earnings report, rather than positive information, such as a promising earnings report.)

**Pitfall #3: Myopic Loss Aversion**

Finally, Hagstrom writes that **myopic loss aversion is the greatest psychological obstacle to investors’ success.** As he relates, myopic loss aversion is the combination of loss aversion—the fact that humans are significantly more sensitive to losses than similar-sized gains—with investors’ tendency to chronically check their portfolios. In other words, it refers to an aversion to short-term losses in particular.

Hagstrom suggests that because the stock market experiences inevitable ebbs and flows, myopic loss aversion can deter us from staying the course and investing for the long term, leading us to sell whenever the market dips. Thus, although this approach might save us from short-term losses, it prevents us from reaping the massive long-term gains that investors like Buffett are after.

(Shortform note: It’s natural to think that while myopic loss aversion can harm the average investor’s returns, professionals are less susceptible to it. Yet, one influential analysis suggests that compared to a control group of undergraduate students, professional traders are actually more vulnerable to myopic loss aversion. In turn, these professionals are liable to make irrational decisions that harm their returns in the long run.)
