## Exercise: Evaluate Your Investing Habits

Buffett’s preferred approach—focus investing—runs counter to traditional investing advice, which emphasizes diversification and discourages investors from analyzing companies themselves. In this exercise, reflect on your investing practices to find areas where you could implement Buffett’s advice.

* * *

Buffett’s preferred portfolio includes around 10 stocks. How many stocks have you invested in, and what was your rationale for choosing these stocks?

Of the stocks in your portfolio, choose one. How highly would you rate this company from a quantitative standpoint (that is, in terms of the company’s market value and finances)? For example, this could involve calculating the company’s ROE or finding its profit margins.

How highly would you rate this company from a qualitative standpoint (that is, in terms of the company’s management and business model)? For instance, this might involve assessing the management’s transparency in past letters to shareholders and the simplicity of its business model.

In light of your previous answers, do you think this company is a promising investment? Why or why not?
