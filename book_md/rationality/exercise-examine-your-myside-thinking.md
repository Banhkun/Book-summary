## Exercise: Examine Your Myside Thinking

Consider how myside thinking might be affecting your beliefs or your interactions with others.

* * *

How closely do you consider your political beliefs to align with the people closest to you? Do you associate with people at work or in your personal life who hold significantly different views than you?

Think of a belief you hold that people close to you—friends, family, or coworkers—might not. Would you be hesitant to share this belief? Why or why not?

Think of a time you’ve had a conversation with someone who has different beliefs than you. How might you have dismissed some of their ideas before properly considering them? Are there any aspects of their ideas you might accept if you thought through them more neutrally?

Consider how you might converse with someone you disagree with the next time the subject of your disagreement comes up. How might you respond to some of their arguments, keeping in mind the goal to not irrationally dismiss facts or thoughts that don’t fit your worldview?
