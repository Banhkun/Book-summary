## Exercise: Recognizing Self-Deception

You’re in a state of self-deception when you don’t realize or accept that you’re creating a problem because you have a distorted view of reality. You blame others in order to rationalize or justify your failures. (You’re deceiving yourself about your behavior and motivations.) The book refers to this deluded state as being trapped “in the box.”

* * *

Think of a problem at work in which you were involved. How did the problem develop?

What was your role in the problem?

Looking at your answer to the above question, would you say that you’re “in the box” (your thinking is skewed toward blaming others and rationalizing your role) or “out of the box” (you clearly see what you could have done better)?
