## Exercise: Are You ‘In the Box’?

When you’re in the box, you see only your own interests and have a distorted view of others—you see them as objects or as problems standing in your way. In contrast, when you’re out of the box, you see people as being human like you and having equally legitimate interests.

* * *

Think of an incident recently where you were “in the box” and treated someone (for instance, a family member or a store clerk) as an obstacle or problem. What was the incident?

What did you say or do? How did you feel afterward?

How do you think the other person viewed the incident? If you had considered that person’s view, how would you have handled the situation differently?
