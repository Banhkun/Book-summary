## Introduction

**Self-deception—our tendency to see the world around us in a distorted way—is a common personal and organizational problem** that deserves more attention. It determines how we relate to others as well as how they respond to us. In _Leadership and Self-Deception_ by the Arbinger Institute, the authors explain how self-deception can derail personal relationships and keep organizations and leaders from achieving the results.

**Self-deception, or a skewed view of reality in which we feel others are always to blame, keeps us from solving problems or even recognizing that we have problems**. When we’re self-deluded, we don’t see that _we’re_ often the cause of problems. For example, when a baby learning to crawl gets stuck under a chair, she may push against the chair. Her solution for getting out doesn’t work, and it may make things worse and increase her frustration because she can’t understand that she's creating the problem.

Our self-deception hinders our ability to make good decisions, undermining our leadership effectiveness and happiness.

This book, published by the Arbinger Institute (no authors are named), is about how to solve the problem of self-deception, both in individuals and organizations. Through the fictional story of a new executive joining an unusual company, the book explains how and why self-deception develops and how to counter it.
