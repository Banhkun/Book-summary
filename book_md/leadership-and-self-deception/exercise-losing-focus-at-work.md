## Exercise: Losing Focus At Work

In many organizations, instead of focusing on results, people and departments are “in the box,” blaming and working against each other. This undermines the company’s success.

* * *

To what extent does the above description fit your company?

Who are you “in the box” toward at work (who do you feel is a problem or obstacle)? How do you treat them?

How does the way you treat them affect how they treat you? Are you both causing a vicious cycle?

How would treating them as a person with legitimate needs and interests affect how they treat you in return?
