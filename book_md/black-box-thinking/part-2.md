## Part 2: Learning From Failure Is Advantageous

In Part 1, we explained that learning from failure drives progress, and that human cultures have moved from “divine knowledge” worldviews to a scientific, rational perspective that is developed through errors.

Now we’ll look at why adapting through failure is so effective, and **how learning-oriented institutions learn through bottom-up adaptation**. Syed explains that these organizations often operate in private, performance-focused areas—aviation, athletics, and business—with the exception of the scientific establishment. Further, **these organizations have two things in common: a cultural attitude that enables them to learn from failure, and systems that make use of those mistakes.**

In Part 2, we’ll explore why a learning-oriented system must arise from a culture that embraces errors, and we’ll discuss _how_ to learn from failure. Specifically, we’ll lay out the basic process and three additional techniques that help deal with complex challenges: randomized control trials, incremental development, and insight generation.

### Element #1: The Culture of Learning-Oriented Institutions

Syed contends that **to learn from failure, an organization’s culture must first view it as an opportunity to grow**. This enables individuals and teams to find mistakes and learn from them. This mindset must exist on two levels:

**On the individual level _,_ **you need the _desire to improve_ : to work hard, fail, and try again. You need _tenacity_ to keep going despite numerous mistakes. And you need _humility_ to admit your mistakes and learn from them.

For example, think of the long work it takes to become a professional musician. A cellist spends thousands of hours training her craft by making mistakes, adjusting, and pressing onward.

(Shortform note: In _Tribal Leadership_ , Dave Logan and coauthors argue that in large, corporate workplaces, employees lose motivation and productivity when they feel like cogs in a machine. To build an organizational culture that values strong individuals, Logan recommends helping each individual develop confidence in their abilities. To do this, point his strengths out and give him reasonably challenging tasks that play into those strengths. By completing them, he’ll better appreciate his abilities and may seek additional responsibilities.)

**At the organizational level** , you need an open and fair culture that incentivizes learning from failure. When people feel that they’ll be rewarded for failing upward, they’ll happily do so.

Continuing the previous example, the cellist doesn’t fear messing up in practice because her culture embraces mistakes as part of learning. Her teachers, conductors, and fellow musicians are all masters of failure, so she too feels incentivized to work hard, make mistakes, and get better.

(Shortform note: Syed’s description of an effective organizational culture evokes the Stage 4 cultural stage in _Tribal Leadership_. Dave Logan explains that at Stage 4, teams focus on values, vision, and alignment more than top-down management and control. The tribe judges others’ actions according to those values, allowing for experimentation and failure so long as the mistakes are made in pursuit of their shared vision. This encourages productive mistakes—those which further the tribe’s goals.)

### Element #2: The Systems of Learning-Oriented Institutions

With a failure-embracing mindset in place, you need a system that makes use of failure. Syed argues that this system is the bottom-up method we described in Part 1. In other words, scientists, lean startups, and athletic organizations all _iterate_ to develop theories, products, and skills. Here’s how it works:

**Step #1:** **Take action.** These organizations take action based on their best knowledge so far. As they do so, they gather data. By measuring their operations, they gain feedback to learn from if things go wrong.

Syed explains that this data gathering is the role of black boxes in aviation. Each plane is equipped with two black boxes: One records details of the plane’s positioning, trajectory, and functions (including the landing gear and lights), and the second records human data—such as the conversation in the cockpit.

**Step #2: Analyze failures.** When an error occurs, these organizations analyze what went wrong. Using all the data available, they look for the cause of the error—reflecting on _what_ went wrong and _why_ it went wrong.

For this step, airlines use private investigators who work through all the data from the black boxes. They analyze the circumstances of the crash until they know what went wrong, and they give that information to the airline.

**Step #3: Formulate fixes.** Next, these organizations figure out practical, scalable solutions to the problems identified in Step 2. Then they test these solutions to iron out any flaws before implementing at scale.

For example, after identifying an issue with pilots losing focus after long hours flying, analysts recommended distributing the workload more evenly between the pilot and co-pilot. Airlines tested simple training programs to teach this and implemented them once they’d smoothed out any flaws.

**Step #4: Repeat.** Finally, these organizations integrate what they’ve learned into their systems. Each time they do this, they accumulate a better understanding of what doesn’t work and what does. **Then, they return to step one and keep learning.**

> **Act Fast and Learn Constantly**
> 
> In _The Obstacle Is The Way, _Ryan Holiday outlines a similar method that emphasizes frequent, aggressive action:
> 
>   * **Take action aggressively:** This prevents the procrastination and analysis paralysis that often precedes action. If you don’t act, you won’t get anywhere—so it’s better to act imperfectly than not at all.
> 
>   * **Learn from every failure** : By acting aggressively, you’ll inevitably fail. Accept that it won’t feel great, but it’s better than never learning at all. Focus on _what_ went wrong and _why_.
> 
>   * **Shoot for the moon:** Trial-and-error learning works best in service of huge, “unrealistic” goals. Believe that you can achieve what’s supposedly impossible through incremental improvement, and you’ll be far more likely to succeed.
> 
> 

> 
> Holiday’s methods embody the scrappy, experimental mindset that’s critical to succeed with trial-and-error learning. Without that consistent drive to improve, it’s easy to fall into a rut and stagnate—so aim to develop this _mindset_ alongside these learning _methods_.

Syed argues that this method works so well because it’s not just some human invention, it’s embedded in nature. In fact, it’s how evolution works:

  * Organisms live in the world, _trying_ to survive. 
  * Natural fluctuations (such as storms, droughts, and environmental change) come along, and subject organisms to stress. 
  * Some _fail_(read: die), and therefore don’t reproduce. 
  * In this way, evolution selects for the fittest organisms—in a sense, _adjusting_ the gene pool according to which traits best fit what’s needed to survive. 
  * And the cycle _repeats_ endlessly, continually subjecting life to stress tests, filtering out those that can’t make it, and naturally adjusting the gene pool.



(Shortform note: While evolution-based learning is powerful, we can use it ineffectively. One study on science publishing found that because many academics depend on publication to advance their careers, researchers produce conventional work that doesn’t push boundaries or advance scientific methodology. Publishers reward research that doesn’t rock the boat, so these conventional research labs succeed and spread their methods to trainees. So while natural selection is at play, it selects for the most adaptive behaviors given what’s rewarded—not necessarily the optimal behaviors in an absolute sense.)

**Succeeding with this strategy isn’t easy—you have to fail, fail, and fail some more**. As we discussed above, it takes tenacity, humility, and ambition to slowly adapt your creation according to what actually works.

(Shortform note: Ryan Holiday argues in _The Obstacle Is The Way_ that to make it in our complex, uncertain world, we need to cultivate a deep resilience to hardship. You can do so by resolving to achieve some goal _no matter what_ , and sticking to that commitment at all costs. Repeatedly sticking to your commitments builds long-term resilience into your character. Similarly, Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues in _Antifragile_ that we ought to become not resilient, but antifragile—rather than merely enduring stress, use it to grow ever stronger. Both individuals and organizations can take hardships as lessons to learn—similarly to how muscles grow through the minor injuries of exercise.)

#### Iterate Minimum Viable Products

Syed gives one key example of the iterative process in business: the **minimum viable product** (MVP). To navigate the unpredictable marketplace, lean startups test out their ideas using **stripped-down versions of the potential end products**.

  1. **Test out your ideas by building an MVP** , and see what happens. Imagine that a startup founder wants to create a new social platform that emphasizes empathetic conversation and tight-knit social groups. To test this idea, she could mock up a video that demonstrates how these features would work.
  2. **Launching an MVP gets you feedback** —whether people are interested and, if so, what they do and don’t like about your product. After launching her video, the founder might find that only some social groups are interested, but they have concerns about whether or not social media is right for deeper connection.
  3. **Adjust to that feedback** —the founder’s idea found little support, but she’s only sunk a little time and money into the MVP—as opposed to a great deal of time and money into a full-blown product. Now she can decide whether to explore other options. She’s learned what won’t work and can take her ideas in a new direction. 



> **Test Internally to Validate Ideas**
> 
> While jumping right to action can work, it’s often better to test ideas internally before seeking customer feedback via an MVP. In _Inspired_ , Marty Cagan explains that a software product idea should pass four tests before your company invests in it:
> 
>   * **Value:** A product must provide significant value that customers can’t find elsewhere. Test for a market niche by launching a web page that appears to offer the product idea but leads to an interest form. If many customers click through, that’s a good sign.
> 
>   * **Usability:** If your product is easy to pick up and use, it’s more likely to succeed. Recruit potential users via email, set them up with a prototype of your product, and take note on how they instinctively use it.
> 
>   * **Feasibility:** If your team can realistically build the product, it’s feasible. To test this, simply have your engineers build enough of the project that they’re confident they could finish it (or, build a complete prototype).
> 
>   * **Viability:** When your team agrees that the product will be profitable, it’s viable. Focus on finance and leadership—if you can’t afford it, or it doesn’t fit your business strategy, the product might flop.
> 
> 

> 
> While you can’t ensure 100% certainty about these factors, you can separate a good deal of chaff from the wheat. This way, you avoid investing in ideas that you haven’t validated and improve your chances of success. Further, be sure to tap the whole team’s expertise—a software engineer can speak to product feasibility, but the CEO will better understand whether an idea fits the company’s mission and strategy.

Beyond this basic iterative process, Syed offers three techniques that help to clarify feedback, deal with complexity, and innovate new solutions when marginal improvements no longer work.

#### Technique #1: Clarify Feedback

While iteration à la the MVP is often effective, feedback is sometimes misleading. For example, if you try to test the effect of coffee on college students but give it to _every_ test subject, you’ll have no basis on which to contextualize the results.

To combat this, Syed argues, you need to run a randomized control trial (RCT). By comparing a control group to the test group, you clarify the effect of what you’re testing.

(Shortform note: While randomized control trials didn’t come about until the 20th century, past doctors have used similar testing methods. In 1537, the French surgeon Ambroise Pare inadvertently conducted a clinical trial on wounded soldiers he had treated. After running out of burning oil with which to cauterize their wounds, he applied a substance made of egg yolks, rose oil, and turpentine. The next day, he discovered that the latter treatment worked far better than the oil cauterization—though he didn’t go on to formalize this accidental testing procedure.)

Here’s how an RCT works: Experimenters randomly divide participants into two groups, subjecting one to the experimental variable and giving the other a placebo (or nothing). **The difference between the groups’ results reveals the actual effect of the experimental variable**.

For example, a company developing a nootropic (brain-boosting) supplement would give the real pill to one group and a placebo pill to the other. Then they’d compare the groups’ results to determine the pill’s actual efficacy.

(Shortform note: In addition to using a placebo, researchers should conduct the trial as a double-blind. This means that neither the researchers nor the test subjects know whether they receive the treatment or the placebo. This prevents bias from skewing results: If researchers don’t know who has the treatment, their beliefs about its effectiveness can’t influence how they interpret the proceedings of the experiment.)

After testing, experimenters take the feedback and adjust their theory or product accordingly. Then they’ll repeat, keeping a tight loop between the feedback and the next iteration, until they reach a well-tested result.

Continuing the example, the nootropic company could use the data from testing to improve their product or decide whether it’s ready for the market.

(Shortform note: RCTs aren’t always the right solution, for a few reasons. If your sample size is too small (20 or fewer), the test can’t guarantee a strong effect because outliers can skew the data. Sometimes, an RCT isn’t ethical—for example, a test to determine the efficacy of an individualized tutoring program might favor some students while leaving others behind. Because it’s random, there’s no way to ensure that students with the greatest need receive help. Finally, RCTs only reveal simple causal effects: They can tell you that A → B. But real-world causation is often complex and nonlinear—for example, a pill may reduce your cholesterol while also throwing off your sleep patterns and causing hair loss.)

#### Technique #2: Break Down the Problem

Iteration and randomized control trials often work wonders, but **some problems are too immense, too complex, or lack a viable control group**. If you’re the US president, for example, you can’t run tests on the whole country—nor do you have a second country to act as a control group.

To handle this, Syed explains, you need to **break the problem down into smaller challenges and accumulate small wins**. For example, to fix a struggling economy, you’d first identify the smaller issues: runaway inflation, irresponsible financial speculators, a population crushed with debt, and so on.

(Shortform note: Anthropologists from the University of Georgia explain that throughout history, humanity has tackled societywide issues with social organizations and effective institutions. When bottom-up civilian efforts to fix some issue (like lung cancer) combine with institutional power and connections, we often make progress. In contrast, top-down solutions typically fail, since centralizing power reduces the range of perspectives and skills that people can bring to bear on the issue.)

Continue to **chunk down the problems until you have something small enough to take action on**. Then, start testing ideas. Maybe you test a free financial literacy course in one town, with a similar town as a control, instead of testing on the whole country. If it works, you can try to scale it; if not, you can adjust and try again.

Over time, many little successes accumulate into big results. Maybe the course doesn’t work until the 15th iteration, but that little success can scale and help solve the larger problem. Then move on to the next small problem, and the next, and keep building toward that larger success.

(Shortform note: This technique is visible in the World Bank’s efforts to end extreme poverty, a UN Sustainable Development goal. In a 2018 update, the World Bank outlines the progress they’ve made by breaking down the problem into regions and countries, as well as on specific benchmarks of extreme and lesser poverty. They also break down nonmonetary dimensions of poverty—such as access to clean water, electricity, and education—as another way to handle one chunk of the problem at a time.)

This technique works even better if you gather more data. **Measuring more variables helps you find additional opportunities for small gains and enables you to make more precise adjustments**. For the above example, you could poll people at the course’s end or track participants’ long-term financial well-being after the course.

> **The Origin of the Black Box**
> 
> In 1949, a British airline called De Havilland began flying its new jet airliner, the Comet. This was the first modern passenger jet—but just a few years later, Comets began crashing. By 1954, seven Comets had disintegrated or crashed.
> 
> In investigating the crashes, Australia’s Department of Civil Aviation faced a lack of meaningful data. They had no recordings of flight data—speed, positioning, fuel levels—nor any recordings of cockpit conversations, so they couldn’t deduce the cause of the crashes.
> 
> One Australian researcher, David Warren, realized that if they had such recordings, they could better understand what had happened. Over the next four years, he developed a prototype black box to record flight data and the interactions between crew members in the cockpit.
> 
> His invention caught the eye of British aviation authorities in 1958, and it sparked a movement to integrate black boxes into all civilian airliners. By 1962, Warren had developed a standard model, and his technology soon spread around the world. This step—from having _no_ data on crashes to over two dozen measures of flight data and in-cockpit happenings—enabled significant improvements in airline safety.

#### Technique #3: Find Opportunities to Innovate

Up to a point, you can iterate, test, and break down the problem. But eventually, your efforts will outweigh the gains from each marginal improvement. This is because surface-level iteration improves on an existing paradigm, but it doesn’t fundamentally change it.

To move further, Syed explains that you need to go beyond the “local maximum,” the highest point of improvement for a given paradigm. For example, you can only shoot an arrow so far with a shortbow, so you’d need to develop a new tool to surpass that distance.

(Shortform note: In _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , W. Chan Kim argues that success comes from finding a “Blue Ocean,” or uncontested market. Syed’s “local maximum” corresponds to Kim’s “Red Ocean,” a heavily contested market. To move beyond that obvious, crowded arena, think beneath the surface-level function of products to discover the underlying function. For example, home gym equipment serves the same purpose as fitness classes or a gym membership: To help the user get fit and feel good. Knowing that, you could ask “Is there some untapped approach to home fitness that we could create?”, thus going beyond current conventional options.)

To go beyond the local maximum, **you need to _find_ and _confront_ some unexamined problem in the current paradigm**:

  1. To _find_ an opportunity to innovate, **consider the recurring problems** with technologies you use. For example, a medieval archer might’ve noticed that human-powered shortbows couldn’t reach distant targets. 
  2. Then _confront_ that problem, asking how things could be better. Maybe the archer asked, “What could propel these arrows more forcefully than human muscle?” Now he’s begun to invent the crossbow, and he did it by looking for an opportunity to change things at a deeper level. 



(Shortform note:**** Jordan Hall, public intellectual and co-founder of DivX, terms these oft-unexamined assumptions in our conventional paradigms the “deep code.” For example, the modern workplace has an underlying “code” of sorts that assumes certain features—including hierarchy, centralized leadership, and hourly wages or salaries. But our inherited systems aren’t the only option. When you delve into a paradigm and make _implicit_ assumptions _explicit_ , you reveal the deep code. For example, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are one reimagining of how humans can coordinate and work together, with flatter relationship structures, nonmonetary incentives, and decentralized participation.)

### Shortform Commentary: American Airlines Case Study

To illustrate the process of learning from failure, Syed describes how the airline industry uses black boxes to record, analyze, and improve systems after crashes. We’ll describe American Airlines Flight 587, a 2001 flight that crashed soon after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport.

After hitting heavy turbulence from a preceding Boeing 747 takeoff, the pilot of Flight 587 (an Airbus A300) rapidly swung the plane’s rudder back and forth in an attempt to stabilize it. This created excessive pressure that broke off the plane’s vertical stabilizer (the rear wing). The plane spun out of control, crashing into the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens.

Using data from the black box, crash site inspections, and eyewitness interviews, the National Transportation Safety Board conducted a thorough investigation. In the end, they determined that the pilot’s actions had stressed the vertical stabilizer well beyond its limits.

The stabilizer had handled pressure that exceeded its design specifications prior to breaking—but the pilot shouldn’t have used it so recklessly. Knowing how he reacted from flight recordings, the NTSB concluded that American Airlines’ pilot training gave improper preparation for this situation.

American Airlines had used simulations that put pilots in unrealistically turbulent situations, thereby teaching them to overuse the rudder. To correct this, American Airlines has modified their pilot training program to de-emphasize using the rudder so recklessly.
