## Part 4: Why and How to Embrace Failure

Having discussed the power of learning from failure—and the risks of neglecting to do so—we’ll now look at _why_ and _how_ to create organizations that embrace and learn from failure.

In Part 4, we’ll first explain why learning from failure is morally imperative. Next, we’ll unpack Syed’s redefinition of failure as positive, and we’ll explain his suggestions for changing an organization’s culture and systems to learn from failure.

(Shortform note: _Tribal Leadership_ , by**** Dave Logan et al., explores how to change organizational cultures in more detail. Logan argues that we should view an organization as a collection of tribes and strive to level up the culture of each tribe. The goal is to reach a “Stage 4” tribal culture, where individuals learn from failure, work together, and achieve great things. Throughout this section, we’ll supplement Syed’s work with ideas from _Tribal Leadership_.)

### Failure-Averse Institutions Waste Lives and Resources

In Part 3, we looked in detail at _how_ institutions neglect to learn from failure—but _why_ does this matter?

In short, **Syed argues that the institutional failure to improve is morally irresponsible**. A stagnant institution is a missed opportunity to develop better systems that support life and improve our world. Each time a learning opportunity goes unexploited, progress slows.

(Shortform note: Steven Pinker, author of _Enlightenment Now_ argues that society has advanced in leaps and bounds since the European Enlightenment of the late 17th and 18th centuries. However, Pinker overlooks Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s argument that if civilization progresses solely through reason, our morals will degrade. In his _Discourse on the Sciences and Arts_ , Rousseau points to ancient Athens, where the flourishing sciences and arts led to a society focused on leisure, luxury, and decadence. Advanced scientific knowledge, he says, isn’t intrinsically moral, so if we neglect virtue in favor of scientific progress, we’ll end up with a materially advanced but morally defunct society.)

Flaws in our courts and hospitals also have life-and-death consequences:

  * As we explained in Part 3, preventable errors in the US medical system cause hundreds of thousands of deaths annually—making them the US’s third largest cause of death. (Shortform note: To expand on Syed’s data, The Peterson Center Health System Tracker reveals that, while preventable errors remain problematic, many causes of death have declined: Mortality rates for infant care, respiratory diseases, diseases of the circulatory system, and cancers have all fallen since the 1980s.) 
  * Similarly, the US criminal justice system has convicted an estimated 20,000 innocent defendants since the late 1980s, leaving many to suffer undeserved years—or decades—in prison. (Shortform note: In recent years, exonerations have risen to record levels. But according to a 2017 report by the National Registry of Exonerations, these represent a fraction of the tens of thousands of wrongful convictions.)



Failing isn’t the problem in and of itself. Rather, **the problem is neglecting to learn from those failures**. When organizations fail to report and learn from their mistakes, they perpetuate patterns of failure that put lives at risk.

In contrast to courts and hospitals, the airline industry has learned from the hundreds of lives lost in historical crashes. They analyze the failures, extract takeaways, and implement changes. Because of this, flying is now incredibly safe.

(Shortform note: In _The Art of Learning_ , tai chi world champion Josh Waitkzin argues that we improve only as quickly as we learn from our mistakes. He suggests that if you never repeated a mistake—learning from it after one instance—you’d grow incredibly quickly. While this is difficult in practice, Waitzkin advises that setting aside your ego can help. If we’re too focused on appearing competent or we’re embarrassed to admit mistakes, we’ll never learn.)

We’ve progressed in traditionally scientific and technological areas, but **modern society hasn’t thoroughly implemented rational, trial-and-error adaptation in the domains of _social_ science—such as politics, education, law, and health care.** In these domains, Syed says, we still operate from top-down paradigms that prevent improvement. For example, an economist might assert his theory as truth without testing it—but a molecular biologist wouldn’t do so without hard data to back up her claims.

(Shortform note: While Syed asserts that reason always drives progress, Daniel Schmachtenberger of the Neurohacker Collective says that our technological growth has outpaced our ability to act with wisdom and compassion. When we have technology that enables us to destroy the world (for example, nuclear weaponry), then we must become wise and sane enough to handle that technology. Soryu Forall, teacher at the Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth, agrees: He argues that _power without love and wisdom creates a world of confusion_ and, ultimately, self-destruction. As a solution, he suggests pursuing power, love, and wisdom through mindfulness practice and community building.)

**Syed argues that the discrepancy between industry types is absurd because the social sciences are more complex than the hard sciences**.**** For example, it’s much easier to model physical phenomena, like how a bridge will hold weight, than to model social phenomena, like how children learn and develop. Therefore, recognizing knowledge gaps and learning from failure is even _more_ important in the social sciences.

Furthermore, Syed asserts that the top-down approach can no longer keep up with our changing world. For example, the proliferation of complex online social networks defies traditional top-down modeling, and understanding them requires swift adaptation. As long as we fail to do this, we’ll fail to understand our world and risk lives, resources, and potential.

(Shortform note: Syed seems to agree with the postmodernist perspective that a “metanarrative,” or complete integration of the disparate stories in some domain, is impossible. In other words, there’s no real way to create a top-down model of, say, American society, that fully coheres the myriad of perspectives, cultures, and ideas that compose the tapestry of America. So instead of pursuing totalizing models of knowledge, aim to develop practical understandings that draw from your own experience, learning to navigate what’s right in front of you instead of trying to understand the entirety of the complex, overlapping systems we live within.)

### View Failure as Beneficial

According to Syed, **creating individuals and organizations that learn from their mistakes starts with changing how we think about failure**. By reframing failure as positive and beneficial, we can overcome the fear of erring and start learning from mistakes in our lives and our organizations.

To explain why changing your view of failure is the key, Syed refers to psychologist Carol Dweck’s ideas of “growth mindset” versus “fixed mindset”:

  * People with a _fixed mindset_ believe that ability is set in stone—in other words, you’re good at some things and bad at others, and you can’t change that. 
  * People with a _growth mindset_ believe that ability develops through practice—put another way, you grow by taking action, messing up, and trying again. 



(Shortform note: Whether you have a growth or fixed mindset isn’t all-or-nothing, and it can vary from domain to domain. For example, someone who becomes physically fit through trial-and-error might believe that the same approach wouldn’t work with mathematics or science. In this way, we often kneecap our growth in some areas of life even while growing in others. To avoid this, try taking your growth mindset from a strength of yours and applying it to weaker areas of your life—such as extending your skill in business thinking to emotional intelligence, or vice versa. Both are skills to be grown with the same underlying method: by learning from errors.)

Syed argues that having a fixed mindset correlates with fragile self-esteem. Because failure could reveal your inadequacies, you’ll avoid it for fear of looking foolish or incapable. **Regarding failure, people with a fixed mindset are threatened by failure and do everything they can to avoid it because they see it as a reflection of their self-worth.**

In contrast, having a growth mindset means you understand that **errors are intrinsic to learning.** So you’ll regard difficulties, like a challenging work project or struggling relationship, as chances to learn. **Regarding failure, people with a growth mindset believe failure is to be expected, and it’s a tool.**

(Shortform note: In _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth argues that innate talent doesn’t predict success. Instead, “grit”—resilience and direction—better determines who sticks it out until they reach success, and who drops out early. Like a growth mindset, grit depends on the belief that we can learn from our mistakes. You can develop grit by identifying your natural interests, such as community building or permaculture, and then practicing them consistently, through all the obstacles that you’ll face.)

Syed cites research that measured mindset differences in terms of two brain signals. The “Error Related Negativity” signal (ERN) is the brain’s default reaction to a mistake, while the “Error Positivity” signal (Pe) indicates conscious processing of the mistake.

  * People with fixed mindsets had low Pe signals, meaning that **fixed mindset individuals unconsciously ignore their mistakes**.
  * Conversely, people with growth mindsets exhibited strong Pe signals. A strong signal indicated that **growth mindset individuals consciously acknowledged their mistakes** , and it also correlated with learning from them afterward.



(Shortform note: A 2018 research paper suggests that _intrinsic motivation_ is one key to the neuroscience of growth mindset. This is because individuals with growth mindsets act not to gain external rewards, but from an enjoyment of the learning process itself. In other words, intrinsic motivation drives their behavior. Further, the paper suggests that healthy dopamine functioning is the key neurological factor in intrinsic motivation, thus in growth mindset. When you experience a task as rewarding in and of itself, it means that your brain has associated a dopamine reward pathway with that activity. Growth mindset, then, might come from the coupling of dopamine reward pathways with the learning experience itself.)

### Mindset Determines Organizational Culture

As with individuals, an organization can exhibit a growth mindset or a fixed mindset, and that mindset shapes its culture. Crucially, **an organization’s _systems_ can’t change until its _culture_ does**. Since mindset shapes culture, we first need to change our mindsets.

(Shortform note: In _Tribal Leadership_ , Dave Logan argues that the best way to upgrade an organization is by upgrading its tribes. Each tribe within an organization exhibits a cultural stage, which is composed of particular patterns of language and behavior. The lower the stage, the less effective the tribe. To upgrade your organization, then, is to upgrade your tribe’s cultures. At a higher stage, the mindset is essentially, “work is better when we work together,” a teams-focused attitude that complements Syed’s focus on establishing an organizational growth mindset.)

Syed cites a study that surveyed employees at seven Fortune 1000 companies to determine the general mindset of each organization, and then compared the cultures of the fixed- versus growth-oriented companies.

**Culture #1: At fixed mindset companies, employees reported a culture of fear.** Workers feared retribution for any error, and they would often conceal failures to avoid blame. They noted the same about their colleagues, reporting that people often hid their mistakes, took shortcuts, and cheated to get ahead.

Because of this cultural style, the organizations couldn’t learn from their mistakes. As long as blame and shame followed mistakes, employees felt unable to take creative risks, innovate, and improve their companies.

(Shortform note: Dave Logan notes in _Tribal Leadership_ that a certain kind of boss creates a workplace dominated by fear, apathy, and passive-aggression. Called “evil bosses” by _Dilbert_ creator Scott Adams, they tend to treat lower-level workers as expendable and not worthy of respect or care. Because of this, those workers become disillusioned with work and they can’t be bothered to make productive, focused efforts. Overcoming this involves helping both the manager and the employees improve their language habits and relationship styles, shifting from a “life sucks” mindset to a “we’re great” mindset that promotes teamwork and respectful collaboration.)

**Culture #2: At growth mindset companies, employees reported an open, honest, and collaborative culture**. They trusted that the company would support them if they made mistakes, and they reported that higher-ups saw reasonable risks as “value added,” or as learning opportunities. In short, these companies embraced failure’s role in creativity and learning.

Further, Syed argues that these positive behaviors indicate that the growth mindset companies were well-positioned to adapt and succeed.****

(Shortform note: Effective companies, Dave Logan argues, exist at a Stage 4 tribal culture. At Stage 4, a tribe aligns around their core values and a collectively crafted vision. They also build _triadic_ relationships—three people who all support one another. The values and vision give the team a clear sense of how to make decisions: If a choice would infringe on those values, you wouldn’t make it. The triadic relationships create a stable social and work network that maintains itself—when a conflict arises, the third person can often help to mediate, and all three people have shared values to lean on in tough cases. Altogether, this allows the team to focus on valuable, innovative work.)

#### Handle Mistakes Fairly

**To change an organization’s culture from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset, you need to _handle mistakes fairly._** This creates a culture where employees can trust the higher-ups—the people who decide what happens when mistakes occur.

**Handling mistakes fairly prevents an environment of fear** —as we explained in Part 3, scapegoating causes fear and incentivizes employees to conceal their mistakes. Since this prevents both genuine errors and real negligence from coming to light, the first step is to stop scapegoating.

When scapegoating stops and mistakes can come to light, treat them all justly. **No matter the mistake, fair leadership conducts a thorough analysis of the error** and doles out the appropriate consequence. If the mistake turns out to be genuine, like emailing a report to the wrong supervisor, the employee can learn from it. If the mistake turns out to be negligence, like a surgeon coming into work on cocaine, leadership should mete out an appropriately harsh punishment.

When leadership responsibly investigates errors, employees feel that they can make honest mistakes without fear of retribution. At the same time, punishing real negligence ensures that workers remain diligent and honest, since they know leadership will justly punish unethical behavior.

> **Make Difficult Decisions That Serve the Tribe**
> 
> Oftentimes, leadership must make difficult decisions that aren’t great for every individual involved. Layoffs, budget cuts, and project cancellations often raise hackles, but leaders must make these sorts of decisions.
> 
> In _Tribal Leadership_ , Dave Logan and coauthors suggest that a great leader must understand how to put the tribe first under these difficult circumstances. Acting from the tribe’s core values and shared vision, she might need to put big egos in their place, part ways with employees who no longer align with those values, or shut down stagnating projects.
> 
> The key is to listen thoroughly to the tribe, much like Syed suggests. By paying attention to the range of perspectives people bring to the table, and noticing whether they’re acting in the tribe’s best interests or their own, a leader learns to “sniff out” self-interested individuals who could threaten the tribe’s success. Acting in this way, she maintains the tribe’s trust by showing that she has its best interest at heart, even when she needs to make tough choices.

### Create a Learning System

After changing an organization’s culture, the next step is to change its systems. (Shortform note: Syed offers loose ideas more than practical wisdom. To supplement his thinking, we’ve interspersed commentary from _The Fifth Discipline_ by Peter Senge, which discusses learning organizations.) Syed offers the following four ideas:

**1\. Create better feedback mechanisms** : As we explained in Part 3, feedback enables learning—you can’t see your mistakes without it. Since many organizations lack a built-in error signal, a key step is to create a mechanism to capture that feedback. For example, local governments could hold weekly feedback sessions with community members to learn how they’re doing on a week-to-week basis.

The tighter the coupling between action and feedback, the faster you can learn. This is because more signals means more to learn from. For example, a mayor who coasts through his term won’t learn much—his lack of action precludes the gathering of feedback, and so prevents learning.

(Shortform note: An easy way to gather feedback is to record video of what you’re doing. Josh Waitzkin writes in _The Art of Learning_ that he recorded his tai chi practice sessions to identify mistakes and refine his form. Similarly, imagine recording video of a community meeting, then holding a retrospective with key players to analyze how things went and what you could do better. That way, you can tangibly identify mistakes—for example, maybe your dialogues are dominated by the most extroverted community members—and fix them. In this case, you might explore new conversational modalities that hold space for quieter individuals to express their perspectives.)

**2\. Prototype adaptive systems** : To select for the best learning systems, Syed suggests creating numerous systems and pitting them against each other. This _system of systems_ enables the best individual systems to rise to the top.

Syed describes that the market system mimics natural evolution: Individual businesses compete against each other, and the best survive while the rest “die” (go bankrupt). Those that survive best fit the demands of the modern world. Today, business fitness means agility—and in fact, lean startups (à la the MVP from Part 2) outcompete companies using slower, older ways of doing business. So their style of system is evolutionarily superior in the market environment.

(Shortform note: In 1968, geneticist Kimura Motō proposed his “neutral theory” of gene variation, arguing that biodiversity comes not just from “survival of the fittest,” but also from luck. Chance events can kill off some genes while others survive, such that luck partially determines which variants exist today. Similarly, random chance plays a role in business competition: While “fitness” (such as business acumen, agility, and experience) plays a role, any business can experience significant random events. For example, a key leader could come down sick during an important deal. Or a founder could reach out to a potential investor on a great day, catching that investor in a good mood that helps them work out a great collaboration—largely by chance.)

**3\. Use pilot programs:** In politics, Syed suggests running pilot programs—small-scale tests of policy changes or business ideas that allow you to get feedback safely and inexpensively. Be sure to **set up pilots that mimic real-world conditions**. By staffing them with a mix of experienced and inexperienced employees, you’ll get a sense for how an actual team would perform under your program.. Avoid setting pilots up for success by staffing them with only your best people, tools, and facilities. If you guarantee success, you won’t learn anything.

(Shortform note: In 2019, the US Congress passed the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, which stipulates that lawmakers and federal agencies must begin developing statistical evidence to support policies. While evidence-based pilots were once thought to be too expensive or time-consuming, the rise of agile methods in software engineering and in the broader business world has shifted that attitude. Now, numerous federal agencies, from the FDA to the Department of Labor, have begun running pilots, much like Syed suggests.)

**4\. Use “pre-mortems” to strategize:** Before launching projects, Syed suggests running a “pre-mortem,” which improves outcomes by helping you discover the flaws in a plan before implementing it.

To perform a pre-mortem, ask your team to imagine that the plan has failed completely—your campaign crashed and burned, your product flopped, and so on. Then, work backward by asking what went wrong. Typically, discussing these failure modes enables the team to improve its plan and better avoid failure—in fact, research holds that this predicts the reasons for failure versus success with 30% greater accuracy.

(Shortform note: In _The Obstacle Is The Way, _Ryan Holiday suggests that pre-mortems are also a useful tool for personal growth. Hardships, he says, are inevitable. By expecting that bad things will happen sooner or later, we better prepare ourselves for them. And by actively anticipating what could go wrong (such as with your workday, a date, or a difficult conversation) you improve your chances of success. Specifically, he suggests thinking up as many possibilities for failure as you can, and then creating a contingency plan for each.)

### Case Study: Virginia Mason Becomes a Top-Ranked Hospital

In Part 3, we explained that many hospitals lack the right cultures and systems to learn from failure. But Syed points out that failure-averse organizations _can_ change, as demonstrated by the Virginia Mason hospital in Seattle, Washington.

Like many other hospitals, **Virginia Mason had cultural and systemic flaws that caused undue patient harm**. When Gary Kaplan took over as CEO, he decided to implement an error reporting process, reasoning that it would reduce mistakes.

But the new process fell short—Kaplan had tried to change the system before addressing the culture. Virginia Mason’s culture stigmatized failure, so few employees used the new reporting system. No one wanted to expose their own mistakes, and junior workers didn’t dare report their seniors.

(Shortform note: Dave Logan explains in _Tribal Leadership _that when employees exist at a low-stage tribal culture—similar to that at Virginia Mason—they’re often unmotivated by top-down change. Typically, they view it as a ham-fisted attempt to change “the way things are,” or as management intruding upon their norms. The solution is to change the culture: Learn to recognize your employees’ cultural stage, and then listen, empathize, and build relationships with them and between them. Gradually, you’ll help them feel valued, and in this way you can lift the organization up from the bottom.)

**To overcome the rejection of his reporting system, Kaplan needed to change the culture**. When a woman died in surgery from an avoidable mistake—she received a toxic substance that was mistakenly left next to her medicine in an identical container—Kaplan owned up to the failure. He issued a full explanation and made amends with the woman’s family.

In leading by example, **Kaplan demonstrated to employees that they could own up to mistakes without fear of retribution**. This catalyzed a cultural shift in the hospital, and employees began using the error reporting system.

(Shortform note: Logan also explains that _the tribe follows the leader_ , as demonstrated above by Kaplan _._ The more a tribal leader builds strong relationships and improves trust between him and his team, the more they’ll naturally follow his lead. This is because the tribe respects and values a leader who engages with them as people, not just as workers. Much like Virginia Mason, executives at Griffin Hospital in Connecticut lead their organization to success by catalyzing the culture to improve their systems.)

Reports began to reveal flaws in Virginia Mason’s prescription system and the wristband system used to categorize patients. **Now knowing where the errors lay, Kaplan’s team developed and implemented simple changes** —reducing illegible prescriptions and adding descriptive text to patient wristbands to distinguish their issues.

Working with thousands of error reports, Virginia Mason gained the data to improve errors, and it now ranks as a top US hospital. Along with reduced insurance liability, it has received awards for clinical excellence and providing an outstanding patient experience.

(Shortform note: An organization’s culture must remain strong for it to remain effective. Executives at Griffin Hospital also made systemic changes, using surveys and focus groups to gather data, yet they never ceased to fully involve the lower-level staff. One powerful method they used was to directly engage the staff about their own vision for the hospital’s success. In asking employees—not just _telling_ them—they created a culture that was invested in their shared vision.)
