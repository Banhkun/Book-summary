## Part 1: Failure and Human Development

_Black Box Thinking_ is about learning from failure. Syed argues that **learning from failure drives the growth of large organizations, underpins innovation in business, and helps us become resilient, growth-oriented agents**. Airlines exemplify this mindset and method, using “black boxes” to collect data, analyze crashes, and learn from them.

However, we still fail to learn from our mistakes in multiple key areas—from health care to criminal justice—and this endangers lives and resources.

Matthew Syed is an award-winning journalist, author, and former Olympian for Great Britain’s table tennis team. He’s worked as a journalist for over two decades, and he’s written four books focused on mindset, performance, and growth. Syed also works as a consultant to help organizations build growth-focused cultures and foster continual improvement.

In this guide, we’ll explain _Black Box Thinking_ in four parts. Part 1 introduces Syed’s argument that success comes from failure and explains the history of humanity’s attitudes toward failure. Part 2 explores the institutions that learn from failure—how, why, and the benefits they reap—while Part 3 discusses institutions that neglect to learn from failure and the problems this causes. To end, Part 4 explains how to embrace failure as positive, and how to develop a learning organization.

We’ve clarified and expanded Syed’s ideas with perspectives from _The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization_ , by Peter Senge, and from _Tribal Leadership_ , by Dave Logan et al.—both of which treat organizational development in detail.

### We Develop Through Failure

The core of Syed’s argument is that, as individuals, **we can only improve by learning from our failures.** On the flip side, neglecting to learn from mistakes means that you can’t improve. For example, a dancer who takes every mistake as a chance to grow will get better, while a dancer who ignores or denies her errors will remain static.

This also applies on the institutional level: **Organizations that learn from failures iron out systemic flaws and improve their performance**. Organizations that ignore their mistakes will continue to make them, risking stagnation.

(Shortform note: In _The Art of Learning_ , Josh Waitzkin argues that learning from your mistakes is the key to competitive success. When you make an error, note where you went wrong and shore up that weakness by training yourself not to repeat it. He also recommends actively seeking out opportunities to fail badly and repeatedly, because this humbles you and helps you approach learning with a beginner’s mind. In a way, this is what learning organizations do: They embrace that what they _do_ know is less than what they _don’t_ know.)

From here, Syed argues that **we need to spread failure-based learning throughout modern society**. Neglecting to learn wastes lives and resources, such as the tens of thousands of annual deaths from preventable errors in hospitals and the thousands of wrongful convictions in the court system. (Shortform note: To clarify, Syed bases his argument around the _American_ health care and court systems, though he also cites some examples from the UK’s hospitals.)

Progress—our ability to _develop_ our knowledge, our societies, or our technology—is a hallmark of human civilization. **We develop by learning from failure, but so long as such major institutions neglect this opportunity, we won’t progress as smoothly**.

(Shortform note: Steven Pinker, a Canadian-American psycholinguist, argues in _Enlightenment Now_ that _reason_ is the primary driver of humanity’s progress. He asserts that reason, science, and humanism have yielded longer life spans, better food production, greater wealth, more peace, democracy, individual rights, and more. While Syed doesn’t explicitly define “progress,” Pinker suggests that we should aim to continuously improve human flourishing, in “life, health, happiness... richness of experience.”)

#### The History: Humanity and Development

To contextualize Syed’s argument, we’ll explain how human cultures have related to failure and learning throughout history. (Shortform note: While Syed presents this history in a “coda” after the main book, we’ve chosen to present it first—without the history, it’s less clear why failure-based learning matters. Note that this perspective emphasizes _Western_ history.)

Syed traces the development of human cultures through three broad phases:

  * Ancient past to ~600BC
  * ~600 BC to ~300 BC
  * ~300 BC to ~1600 AD



Let’s look at each phase more closely.

##### Phase #1: Defending “Divine Knowledge” (Ancient past to ~600BC)

Human cultures have always had worldviews—ideas about how the world works—but they haven’t always promoted learning. **When we lived in hunter-gatherer tribes and in the early civilizations that followed, many worldviews were dogmatic and thought to come from the gods** —which meant they weren’t to be challenged.

For example, Chinese paganism holds that the Dragon King (龍王 _Lóngwáng_) controls the rains and the creatures of the seas; no one would challenge this belief for fear of invoking his wrath and losing loved ones at sea.

(Shortform note: While we often hear about the negatives of tribalism, tribes helped humans to cohere, coordinate, and survive for thousands of years. Today, psychologists acknowledge that tribes give people a sense of belonging, a better understanding of their purpose, and a valuable social support network. So while dogmatic beliefs might negatively affect societal progress, they aren’t all bad. Overcoming the negatives of tribalism likely means embracing the positives—forming tribes is in our DNA, whether we like it or not.)

Primarily the “priest class” defended these myth-based worldviews, treating them as sacred and infallible wisdom. In addition, the power elites would suppress dissenters with violence or banish them, Syed says. This kept their “truth” undisturbed from generation to generation.

For example, Jesus of Nazareth—the historical Jesus—was crucified because the ruling Romans saw his novel religious teachings as a threat to their established order (Pagan religion, Roman law and ethics, and so on).

**Because those in power treated alternative perspectives as threats, they lost the opportunity to learn**. In other words, their worldviews remained static because they didn’t acknowledge the possibility that they had flaws.

(Shortform note: While powerful leaders have always had their sycophants, modern echo chambers exacerbate the problem. Because our information streams are often personalized—think your curated social media feeds—and because we surround ourselves with like-minded thinkers, it’s easier than ever to inadvertently avoid alternate perspectives. This causes exactly the stagnation that Syed describes: When nothing challenges the dominant view, a group’s thinking will fall into a rut. To avoid this, actively seek out people who may disagree with you, and read reputable information from both sides of an issue.)

##### Phase #2: Rational Thought Arrives (~600 BC to ~300 BC)

This “divine knowledge” paradigm didn’t last forever. With the dawn of the classical Greek period, thinkers such as Pythagoras, Socrates, and Aristotle developed rational thought. They treated ideas as speculative and developed them through a back-and-forth exchange of differing perspectives.

**Under this paradigm,** Syed explains,**the Greeks embraced errors as integral to learning**. When discourse revealed the flaws in an argument, the thinkers would seek to improve it. In this way, the tradition of dogma began to fall away, and rational, scientific thought began to emerge.

> **Rationality Versus Empiricism**
> 
> Although Syed conflates _rationality_ and _empiricism_ , they’re distinct approaches to scientific thought. Both have their roots in the classical Greek period he describes, and they have long challenged each other on the proper way to establish valid knowledge.
> 
> In short, empiricists hold that all knowledge derives from _external sensory experience_ (our five senses) and _internal sensory experience_ (observation of mental phenomena). In other words, you come to _know_ something by sensing it, and in that way discover the laws of the natural world.
> 
> In contrast, rationalists argue that _reason_ enables us to intuit and deduce concepts that have no basis in sensory reality (_a priori_ knowledge). For example, a rationalist might say that a logical statement, “13 is a prime number less than 22,” couldn’t come from sensory experience. Rather, it’s an abstract formulation of knowledge that depends on intuited insights about numbers and mathematics.
> 
> Rationalists and empiricists tend to agree that some knowledge comes from such abstract reasoning, though other knowledge undeniably comes from sensory experience—for example, you know water and wetness by its _feeling_. If we “both-and” the two schools of thought, it’s clear that both abstract reason and sense-based reason have a place in scientific thinking.

##### Phase #3: The Church Battles Rational Thought (~300 BC to ~1600 AD)

Though rational thought briefly flourished, the Western worldview receded into dogma after the classical Greek period. Syed explains that **the church combined Christian strictures with a dogmatic interpretation of Aristotle’s work, and it punished dissenters**.

This resurgence of the “divine knowledge” paradigm dominated until around the 17th century, when thinkers (Syed chiefly credits Francis Bacon, who helped develop the scientific method) revived the scientific mindset. Though they met resistance—Galileo, for example, was put under lifetime house arrest for challenging Christian cosmology—the rational tradition found its footing and scientific progress resumed.

The work of Galileo, Bacon, and others led into the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries—Europe’s return to rational, scientific thought.

(Shortform note: In any age, the dominant worldview tends to become more or less dogmatic. Today, science is partially guilty of this, as the church was in medieval times. “Scientism” is a quasi-religious view, held by some scientists, that purports science is the only valid way to know things. In “The Folly of Scientism,” Austin Hughes argues that scientism constitutes an attempt to extend the scientific method into areas of philosophy that it simply can’t comment on. This unflinching belief in the ultimate power of science, he says, is much like religious superstition. To counter this trend, he argues—as Syed describes above—that we need a resurgence of reasoned, Enlightenment-style thinking that clarifies the strengths and limitations of scientific methods.)

#### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Learning

Syed describes the “divine knowledge” paradigm as “top-down” learning, while the scientific, adaptive method is a “bottom-up” approach.

##### Top-Down

**The “divine knowledge” paradigm is a _top-down_ approach**: Authorities decree the truth from on high, and it’s not to be challenged. Armchair philosophy exemplifies the top-down approach—a small group of elites with special knowledge build grand, esoteric theories to try and capture the “truth” about something.

(Shortform note: In _Mastery_ , Robert Greene explains that top-down hierarchies lead to conventionalism, wherein people adhere to an existing set of rules, written and unwritten, because to do otherwise is socially risky. By conforming to the group, you ensure that you’ll be conventionally successful. But conventionalism doesn’t lead to meaningful discoveries or innovation, because by definition it doesn’t challenge the status quo. Greene asserts that we need to resist conventionalism by aligning to our own true north, instead of the group’s, and by developing social intelligence to handle doubters until we’ve proven our worth.)

Syed explains, however, that **the top-down approach causes knowledge to stagnate because it goes untested.** Without testing, you can’t accurately map out how things work—the world is too complex to create a perfect theory on the first try. Top-down implementation of Marxism exemplified this problem. For example, Mao Zedong’s 1958 Great Leap Forward was a massive top-down restructuring of China’s agricultural base that disregarded testing in favor of Mao’s ideology. In failing to understand the real capacities of workers, soil, and crops, they caused a massive famine that killed tens of millions.

**Even when tested, top-down theories impede swift adaptation because they’re too complicated to efficiently rework.** For example, Mao’s program demanded massive, widespread action but it was too large to adjust when things started going wrong. Reworking something of that scale takes time, which delays action and wastes resources.

(Shortform note: Mao’s Great Leap Forward was a “five-year plan,” the classic Soviet planning strategy that involves setting fixed goals for economic growth and achieving them through top-down control. Five-year plans have had mixed success—China’s first, for example, succeeded in building an industrial manufacturing base out of a largely agricultural society. Early Soviet plans, on the other hand, caused mass famine in Ukraine due to top-down suppression of farmers and Ukrainian nationalism.)

##### Bottom-Up

Syed asserts that by contrast, **learning from failure is a _bottom-up_ approach**: You take _small steps_ with limited knowledge (as opposed to grand, top-down action), inevitably make mistakes, and adjust accordingly. For example, market economies feature many agents that work bottom-up to build businesses. This allows the economy to grow organically: Each business steps toward success, makes mistakes, and adjusts, until the best succeed and others fall away.

**The key to bottom-up learning is _testing_**. Each time you take action, test whether your knowledge fits the situation or not. For example, a smart business owner validates product ideas through testing—introducing her ideas to potential customers and noting how they respond.

By testing, you learn what won’t work and can adjust accordingly. For example, maybe that business owner found that her product would enter a saturated market with established alternatives. By testing, she’s avoided potential failure and can adjust her strategy according to what she learned.

In other words, **bottom-up learning allows for swift adaptation** , according to Syed. You fail fast and often, building practical knowledge through real-world experience.

> **Undertake a Practical Apprenticeship**
> 
> In _Mastery_ , Robert Greene explains that top-down education (conventional schooling) doesn’t prepare us for the real world because it doesn’t give us practical, real-world experience. To overcome this, he suggests you seek out an _apprenticeship_ : An intense effort to explore your field of interest, develop essential skills, and gain practical knowledge.
> 
> Like Syed, he advocates for an open, experimental mindset. By taking one step at a time into the unknowns of your field, you’ll make small mistakes that you can learn from. Aim to adapt your learning experience to:
> 
>   * **Your own interests:** Like Charles Darwin exploring the natural world of South America and the Galapagos, step fully into your interests and learn through constant engagement with the ideas and questions that challenge you.
> 
>   * **Your field’s established skills:** Just like naturalists established methods for observing, collecting, and analyzing specimens, your field has conventional ways of operating. Learn these through trial-and-error to build practical competence.
> 
>   * **The social reality of your field:** Greene suggests learning how people think and where the power lies, so that you can avoid developing negative work relationships that distract you from your true focus.
> 
> 

> 
> It’s essential to directly engage with these realities, because attempting to understand them via top-down theorizing will never yield an accurate picture. Instead, take advantage of being a beginner: When you’re new, people will understand that you need to make mistakes to adapt to your field.

##### Practice Influences Theory

Building on the importance of testing in bottom-up learning, Syed argues that our standard view of progress—that scientific theories enable technological innovation—is backward. Instead, Syed suggests that**_trial and error experimentation_ leads to _practical know-how,_** which in turn influences theory.

For example, Thomas Edison developed a method of recording sound by experimenting with telegraph technology. Though he lacked precise theoretical knowledge of the invention beforehand, he reached a working phonograph through trial and error.

In the end, **Syed argues that theory and practice reciprocally drive change** in a complex interplay of influence. In other words, **top-down and bottom-up approaches complement one another** , though he doesn’t explain how.

(Shortform note: In _Mastery, _Robert Greene asserts that chance plays a crucial role in scientific discoveries, and he suggests priming your life for such serendipity: Our brains naturally seek out connections between ideas, and we can amplify this effect by surrendering control. When we’re focused, he argues, our attention narrows and reduces the range of ideas we’re engaged with. To counteract this, take two steps: First, widen your information intake to include sources you don’t normally use. This can stimulate new connections. Second, take plenty of time to rest, relax, and engage in casual activities, like sport or music. This keeps your mind flexible and open to new ideas.)

### Where We Are Today

In modern society, Syed writes that **some institutions rely on bottom-up learning, including medicine, the airline industry, athletic organizations** , and some businesses. Meanwhile, others still operate on the “divine knowledge” paradigm—Syed highlights health care and the courts.

In Parts 2 and 3, we’ll examine how he compares and contrasts these two institutional styles. (Shortform note: We’ll use “institution” to refer to an area of society, and “organization” to mean a specific agent within that institution—for example, we have the _institution_ of public health care, and _organizations_ like Griffin Hospital. When we say that an institution neglects to learn, we mean that the organizations within that institution don’t learn, as Syed argues.)

**1\. Learning-Oriented Institutions:** The organizations within a learning-oriented institution (Syed’s “open loop systems”), such as lean startups in the business world, use failures to improve their operations and innovate solutions to tough problems.

For example, a successful football team will hold post-game retrospectives so coaches can reflect with players on what went well and what went poorly. This clarifies what to improve on, using failures as fuel for success.

(Shortform note: In _The Fifth Discipline_ , Peter Senge describes a “learning organization” as an organization where people embrace open-minded thinking, aspire to their creative potentials, and continually learn together. He outlines five disciplines to achieve this: 1) Create a shared vision to align leadership and staff, 2) Use systems thinking to understand your organization holistically, 3) Clarify your existing mental models and stay open to adapting them, 4) Create teams that learn together and embrace honest mistakes, and 5) Help employees develop personal mastery by training the subconscious mind to handle complexity.)

**2\. Failure-Averse Institutions:** The organizations within a perfection-oriented institution—such as hospitals in the health care system or certain political institutions—neglect to learn from failure. This happens because their cultures preclude the acknowledgment and assessment of mistakes. In other words, to admit a mistake was made would damage their reputation, so they bury it. As Syed says, this attitude reflects the “divine knowledge” paradigm and perpetuates harmful, preventable errors.

For example, Donald Trump’s administration routinely expelled dissenters and he denied his fallibility. Since Trump inadvertently pushed away anyone that could’ve helped correct his administration’s missteps, they were unable to operate effectively.

(Shortform note: Mary Trump, the niece of Donald Trump, explains in _Too Much and Never Enough_ that Donald Trump has been enabled since a young age. Through analysis of Trump family history and her own experiences, she argues that he’s behaved poorly for decades and never faced repercussions. Because he’s never been punished for mistakes or wrongdoings, he _can’t conceive_ that he could be wrong about anything, and so he assumes that someone else is to blame. Any institution with a leader who’s so apt to cast blame becomes failure-averse, since any perceived weakness could get you fired.)

#### Two Types of Mistakes

Syed defines two types of mistakes and distinguishes how each type of institution employs or responds to these mistakes.

**Type #1: Inadvertent mistakes.** These occur when you’re aware of the correct answer but, through some accident or misstep, still make the error. For example, a football quarterback can mistime his pass and get sacked, even though he knows to avoid that.

Syed explains that **inadvertent mistakes help us find and improve the flaws in existing systems.** Consider how an inexperienced manager can _inadvertently_ help develop a better team because his mistakes expose opportunities to improve.

(Shortform note: While these “human errors” are often understandable, it’s possible to reduce them and improve your operations. Often, we make more mistakes when we’re under a lot of stress or have to focus for long periods of time. After a while, our performance slips because it’s too hard to keep up an optimal effort. To overcome this, work in a rhythm of focused periods and rest periods. Josh Waitzkin recommends in _The Art of Learning_ that you learn to fully relax, explaining that it rejuvenates you for your next effort.)

**Type #2: Intentional mistakes.** These happen as part of an effort to develop solutions—if you don’t know the answer to a problem, Syed says, trial and error is a great way to find it. For example, car manufacturers have developed more efficient engines by iterating through their less efficient predecessors.

**Intentional mistakes help us innovate creative solutions to tough problems**. You’ll want to make these mistakes when you’re iterating a product idea, developing a theory, or navigating through thorny behavioral changes.

(Shortform note: The Harvard Business Review writes that “deliberate mistakes” can reveal assumptions in your models—for example, an advertising strategy you expect to fail might actually do well. By testing it (even though you anticipate failure and financial losses), you could discover a strategy that goes against your existing assumptions. This matters because we often seek only to confirm our existing ideas. By making deliberate mistakes, you prevent that confirmation bias.)

Although both types are _productive mistakes_ —regardless of why they were made, they provide opportunities to learn and improve—**failure-averse organizations mainly make _inadvertent_ mistakes and fail to learn from them**. Because of this, they remain stagnant and continue to make the same errors. For example, a local political campaign that neglects a key voting demographic, despite repeatedly losing without their votes, will continue to err and lose.

On the other hand, **learning-oriented organizations make both types of mistakes and learn from them**. This enables them to improve their systems over time—for example, the rival political campaign may have noticed where they weren’t getting enough votes, given those areas attention, and done better the next time around.

(Shortform note: The structure of a learning-oriented organization is fundamentally different from that of a failure-averse organization in that the latter is optimized for _performance_ rather than _learning_. The paradox is that learning organizations often perform better than those stuck on set performance goals—because if you continually strive for static goals, instead of learning and shifting your measures as you go, you might never reach them. If you or your organization tends toward static measures of performance, try introducing this learning mindset within a project you can lead: Focus the team on learning from mistakes, rather than achieving set goals.)
