## Exercise: Check Your Ego

Disconnecting from your ego is the only way to access presence, your true self, and inner peace. Use this exercise to practice being present.

* * *

For the next 10 minutes, try to stay entirely focused on being present in what youâ€™re doing. When other thoughts arise, take note of them.

What were the thoughts that started popping in your head?

Did these thoughts employ the tools of the ego (e.g. past or future, fear, or desires)? Explain.

Describe what you felt during the moments when your thoughts were quiet.
