## Exercise: Recognizing Your Pain-Body

Pain is part of the human experience, and every person has a pain-body; it can be triggered by thoughts or actions, and then both spews and feeds on negative energy. In this exercise, you will reflect on your individual pain-body.

* * *

Whatâ€™s a painful experience from your past that is part of your pain-body? This is an emotional scar that gets triggered easily by other events, and then consumes your thoughts and emotions.

Think of a time when something or someone hit a nerve tied to this particular pain. What was said or done that activated that part of your pain-body? And how did you react when it was triggered?

What kinds of situations or conversations are likely to trigger that pain again in the future?
