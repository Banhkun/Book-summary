## Exercise: Accepting the Unpleasant

Highs and lows are inevitable in life, and you must accept both to remain present and be at peace. Use this exercise to work toward accepting something undesirable in your life.

* * *

Describe something in your current life situation that you are unhappy or dissatisfied with.

How have you reacted to this situation so far? Perhaps you have made a plan of action, or felt hopeless and overwhelmed, or looked to others for advice and sympathy.

Is this situation one that you can leave or change? Or is it something you must accept (at least for the time being)?

If you could take action (by leaving or changing the situation in some way), but have not, what do you think is holding you back? Or if you must accept the situation but have not yet, why do you think you are resisting surrender?
