## Exercise: Recognizing Emotions In Your Body

Emotions are your bodyâ€™s physical reactions to your thoughts, both positive and negative. Use this exercise to help recognize the causes and effects of your emotions.

* * *

Think of a recent situation when one external factor (e.g. work, a relationship, an event) caused you to have either a positive reaction that eventually became negative, or vice versa. Describe what happened and how it made you feel.

How did the positive feelings manifest in you physically? What did you feel in your body?

How did the negative feelings manifest in your body?
