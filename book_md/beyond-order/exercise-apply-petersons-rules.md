## Exercise: Apply Peterson’s Rules

While Peterson gives 12 rules and extensive reasoning for each, it’s important to do one thing at a time to get the best results. In this exercise, narrow down the rules that feel relevant to your life and choose one to try.

* * *

Having read through Peterson’s 12 rules, which group of rules feels most immediately relevant to your current life situation? Why? Recall that his rules pertain to personal responsibility, relationships and the world at large, and your existential well-being.

Within the group that feels most helpful or relevant, which specific rules most directly relate to a challenge you’re facing? Briefly write out the challenge, then identify a rule or two that could help.

For each rule you identified in the last question, work out how it applies in your specific context. Briefly, how might you apply or adapt Peterson’s rule to the specific challenge in your life?
