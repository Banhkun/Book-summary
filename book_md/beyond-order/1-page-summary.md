## 1-Page Summary

In _Beyond Order_ , Jordan B. Peterson lays out his philosophy and rules for living a life of excellence in a world of hardship and chaos. Peterson offers 12 rules, centered on ideas of chaos, change, and order, that cover how and why to listen to your conscience, how to find the courage to take responsibility for yourself and your loved ones, and how to show up for life as fully as you can.

Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist and emeritus professor at the University of Toronto, as well as a former associate professor at Harvard. He rose to fame in 2016 for his controversial critique of identity politics and Canada’s Bill C-16, which extended discrimination, hate speech, and hate crime protections to gender-diverse individuals. Peterson is also known for his YouTube-based lecture series on mythology, religion, and psychology, as well as for staunchly supporting free speech, monogamous marriage, and the importance of the Bible to Western culture.

_Beyond Order_ builds on the ideas laid out in _12 Rules for Life_ , Peterson’s 2018 self-help best seller. In this guide, we’ll present his 12 additional rules in three groups:

  * **Group #1: Rules for Personal Responsibility** —why and how to act in your own best interest, commit to a focused path, and become all that you can
  * **Group #2: Rules for Dealing With the World** —why and how to relate effectively to your spouse/partner, your workplace, and the world at large 
  * **Group #3:** **Rules for Existential Well-Being** —understanding the structure of reality, accepting that life is full of darkness, and finding courage and gratitude regardless****



Throughout the guide, we’ll expand on and counterbalance the rules with supporting and opposing viewpoints. We’ll also explain how Peterson fits into the contemporary intellectual landscape, noting adjacent thinkers as well as those who disagree with him.

(Shortform note: Though Peterson began his academic career as a clinical psychologist and Harvard associate professor, he has since become a prominent figure in what’s been called the culture war. Due to his stances on topics such as identity politics, political correctness, freedom of speech, and Marxism in the university system, Peterson is commonly associated with the conservative right. Critics have accused him of perpetuating harmful ideas and supporting the alt-right (a far-right, generally white nationalist movement that emerged in US politics in the mid-2010s), while supporters praise him for speaking up for ideas that go against the grain of mainstream thinking.)

### Group #1: Rules for Personal Responsibility

To begin, we’ll explain Peterson’s four rules that concern personal responsibility, or how you can take control of your life as an individual. We’ll discuss his views on finding meaning in life, how to focus and commit to things, how to act properly, and how to learn from your past. Taken together, these rules convey Peterson’s ideas about how to conduct yourself as a responsible, ethical, and mature member of society.

#### Rule #4: Take On the Burdens of Responsibility

We’ll first discuss Peterson’s Rule #4, in which he contends that**assuming personal responsibility for your life will bring you meaning and fulfillment.**

Peterson argues that meaning in life doesn’t come from happiness, as is commonly believed. That’s because happiness only feels good for a moment or two—and having previously felt good doesn’t help much when life gets tough. In the midst of a dark, difficult experience, that earlier happiness will be just a memory.

(Shortform note: Consider also the hedonic treadmill, a concept from psychology that states that people’s happiness levels tend to revert to a default level. This happens because over time, we get used to things that temporarily increase or decrease our happiness, such as getting a new phone or ending a relationship. Pursuing happiness, then, functions a bit like a treadmill—you’ll always be running in place.)

Instead, Peterson says, **you can find lasting strength and meaning in a life of responsibility.** Taking responsibility for your life will make you strong, committed, and capable—traits that help you find meaning and fulfillment. For instance, you might find that taking responsibility for your bad habits helps you to overcome them, grow more disciplined, and feel better about yourself. Think of taking responsibility as an exercise: The more you practice being responsible, the stronger you’ll become.

(Shortform note: In _Courage Is Calling_ , Ryan Holiday relates personal responsibility to courage, which he defines as _doing the right thing in spite of your fear_. Holiday suggests that even when you’re trying to be responsible, you might make mistakes—and when that happens, courage means being accountable for those mistakes. Thus, responsibility involves some courage: You can’t know exactly what will happen when you start to take on the burdens of your life, but you must do so even if you’re afraid.)

##### Expanding Your Responsibilities

**Once you can handle the weight of your work, relationships, and daily life,** Peterson recommends that you **take on additional responsibilities.** Many people, he says, leave important tasks unattended (at work and at home) or do them poorly. If you take on these missed opportunities, you’ll grow even stronger while also improving your reputation and gaining opportunities to advance in life and work. For instance, your company might announce a time-sensitive project that any employee in good standing can apply to take on. Plenty of your coworkers might pass it up, but you could jump on the opportunity and, in doing so, demonstrate your competence and readiness to work.

(Shortform note: While Peterson gives advice for individual success, businesses that have many tasks left undone might want to think more broadly about accountability within their team. The _Harvard Business Review_ advises that it’s best not to aggressively confront teammates who aren’t accountable, as blame typically leads to arguments. Instead, first clarify your perspective on the issue, and then speak from curiosity rather than stress. Try to understand why someone is missing deadlines or leaving things undone, and look to help rather than blame. After understanding the other person’s perspective, make a plan of action to get them back on track.)

**You can find the work that needs doing by listening to your conscience**. Your conscience is the voice within you that speaks up when you do something bad versus something good. According to Peterson, you can rely on it as an unerring judge of the quality of your actions—of whether you’ve acted in accord with your highest good. Thus, your conscience is an inner instinct for ethical behavior.

(Shortform note: Peterson presents the conscience as an unerring moral guide—however, conscience may not point to any absolute moral truth. Consider that people on both sides of an issue, such as abortion, can conscientiously object to the other side—a doctor can conscientiously object to performing the procedure, and a women’s rights advocate can conscientiously object to anti-abortion laws. Each person’s conscience bears more on their relative sense of morality than any absolute sense (which some argue doesn’t exist at all). The takeaway: Use your conscience as a guide to what’s right relative to your life, but don’t take it as a guide to universally moral or correct behavior.)

#### Rule #7: Commit and Follow Through

While following your conscience may work wonders, doing so is no use if you aren’t consistent. **Consistency,** Peterson argues, **is a necessary precondition of success.** You won’t get anywhere if you don’t commit to something and stick to that path.

To become consistent, pick a direction and stay the course single-mindedly. As you go, you’ll need to confront the trials and challenges of that path. According to Peterson, these challenges will test your commitment and show you what you’re made of. When you give yourself no options but to follow through, that pressure will make you strong enough to handle anything.

(Shortform note: Finding deep, consistent focus is a common theme in self-help. In _Hyperfocus_ , for instance, Chris Bailey discusses how managing your attention is the key to success. Bailey suggests sorting your tasks into a four-quadrant matrix—Unnecessary, Distracting, Necessary, and Meaningful—so that you can cut down on unimportant tasks that scatter your attention. This could also help you measure your commitment to your path—for example, you could track the amount of time you spend in each quadrant to see if you’re avoiding the work that needs doing or confronting it head on, as Peterson advises.)

In fact, Peterson explains, **limitations create freedom.** There isn’t enough time to become everything you might want to be. But if you don’t choose any path, you won’t become anything at all. By instead committing to a path at the expense of all others, you guarantee that you’ll become _something_.

(Shortform note: Even when you do find the right path for you, don’t confuse staying focused with being rigid. As Robert Greene explains in _Mastery_ , we’re all at risk of growing stiff and dogmatic as we grow older. To avoid this, he recommends stretching against the traditional rules and limitations of your path or field (after you’ve first mastered them, of course). Specifically, Greene suggests that techniques such as taking time to be unfocused and practicing free association can help you stay flexible and not fall into a rigid rut that you mistake for your path.)

#### Rule #9: Process and Learn From Your Past

As you grow by committing and following through, you might face obstacles along your path in the form of painful memories of past experiences. These experiences, Peterson argues, linger within us and hinder our growth—but **consciously processing those painful emotions has a cathartic effect that catalyzes further growth**.

As Peterson explains, difficult or traumatic memories are important sources of feedback that we ought to learn from, but too often leave unprocessed. We evolved to learn from negative feedback—burn your hand, learn not to touch hot stoves—and if a memory sticks around, that means your brain has deemed it important enough to learn from. However, when it comes to complex, emotional memories (rather than simple feedback like physical pain) we often lack the tools or skills to process them and instead end up overthinking, worrying, and avoiding them.

(Shortform note: Moreover, human memory is highly fallible, and we often unknowingly change our memories each time we recall them. This is, in part, why difficult memories can grow more painful over time—each time you ruminate over a bad breakup or a financial blunder, you can actually reinforce those painful feelings. Peterson’s suggestion to process these memories, then, means to help you learn from your past rather than suffer it ad nauseam.)

In Peterson’s view, **you can effectively process old emotional wounds by revisiting them and working through them in writing.** Specifically, Peterson advises that you face up to the pain of such a memory and reinterpret it from an adult perspective. To do this, look for ways to reframe the memory rationally, and try to add nuance to the way you understood it when it happened. By doing this, you’ll make sense of what happened, what went wrong, and why. Knowing that, you can derive a lesson from the memory and move past the pain.

For instance, you might’ve had a difficult childhood experience such as being bullied in school, which caused you to internalize a sense of inferiority that you still struggle with. To process your memory, try to reason through it with adult rationality. For example, you might reason that being a child, the bully was immature and didn’t understand how he hurt you. Reframing things like this, you might also reason that the bully’s meanness had nothing to do with you—and that therefore, there was never anything wrong with you. By reframing and thinking through the situation rationally, **you can defuse painful emotions, learn from what really happened, and grow beyond those past emotional wounds.**

(Shortform note: In contrast to Peterson’s emphasis on a rational, cognitive way of processing painful memories and emotions, Bessel van der Kolk argues in _The Body Keeps the Score_ that trauma has a strong physiological component. That is, painful memories don’t just live in our minds—they also consist of suppressed physical sensations and emotions that end up in our bodies. Left unprocessed, they can cause psychosomatic disorders, such as migraines or chronic fatigue, that have no obvious cause. Processing your painful past is therefore important not just as a source of growth, but as a preventative health measure.)

#### Rule #2: Focus Intensely on Becoming All That You Can Be

In choosing to take responsibility, stay committed, and work through your painful past, you’ll still need to know what direction is most worth heading in. In Rule #2, Peterson addresses how to determine what’s worth doing and how to become everything you can. Further, he asserts that **because our world is full of suffering, we’re each obligated to become the best people that we can be.** By doing so, we can help reduce suffering and bring some light to the world.

(Shortform note: In this rule, Peterson’s reasoning is utilitarian in character. Put roughly, utilitarianism is an ethical stance that holds that the right choice in a given situation is the one that results in the greatest good for everyone involved. In other words, utilitarian thinkers are often concerned with reducing pain or suffering while increasing pleasure or benefits. This kind of thinking works well in situations where the variables are easily quantifiable, like economic decisions, but breaks down with more qualitative considerations—for instance, it’s difficult to assign concrete values to art, time, or basic freedoms.)

Becoming all that you can be is possible because, according to Peterson, we live in a reality of boundless _potential_ —the raw material of existence from which we can shape our lives.**** But given this boundless potential, how can we possibly know how to act? Peterson suggests looking to the great stories of the past and imitating the heroes of our myths.

Today, we’ve inherited the great stories that cultures have developed and passed down since the ancient past. Peterson says that **humanity has distilled the essential patterns of right or effective conduct into our myths and narratives** —that is, the ways in which mythological characters act demonstrate the archetypes of conduct that we view as “right” and “wrong.” Think of the “hero” versus the “villain”—you can pick each out from a story based on how they behave.

(Shortform note: Note that Peterson’s perspective here is explicitly Western—that is, it’s based on Western myths and moral views, and Peterson references the Bible. However, other cultures may have different perspectives on the right way to be. For example, Confucianism, a 2,500-year-old Chinese moral philosophy, emphasizes moral virtues such as respect, humility, and loyalty to the family, which contrasts somewhat with the individual hero so prominent in Western culture.)

Primarily, **Peterson recommends that you learn from the hero’s journey**. This is the archetypal journey of the “chosen one” who is called away from home to face a great challenge, overcome the darkness within and without him or herself, and return victorious. For instance, think of the prince who leaves home to slay the dragon and rescue the maiden, or the Jedi who overcomes darkness to save the galaxy.

Peterson contends that the myth of the hero’s journey derives from early acts of human courage.**** Ancient hunter-gatherers had to leave the safety of the tribe and fire, go out into the night, overcome unknown dangers, and return with valuable resources such as food and water. This basic act of courage was necessary for our survival.

(Shortform note: Beyond just the hero’s journey, myths permeate our history and our lives. In _Maps of Meaning_ , Peterson details the broader nature of myths and the roles they play in human life. Chiefly, he argues that mythological thinking helps us make subjective sense of the world and our place in it, whereas scientific thinking helps us determine _objective_ knowledge. We tell stories about the objects around us—a three-foot-long stick fitted with a taut string is a bow, a smaller stick with a sharpened stone head is an arrow—and these stories lend those objects meaning. Abstract the many stories historical humans have told about the world around us—the tapestry of meaning we’ve looked to make from our experiences—and you get myth.)

Given this, Peterson recommends that you imitate these acts of courage. **Draw inspiration from our ancestors, take heart, and face up to the darkness in your life**. Today, our challenges are more abstract than giant snakes—still, we need to confront, overcome them, and grow stronger through those encounters. Peterson contends that in doing so, you’ll transform yourself into a modern-day hero, becoming wiser, more mature, and more competent.

To find the proper heroic motivation, Peterson suggests the following tactics:

  * **Pursue a noble and challenging goal** —something lofty enough to spark courage within you.
  * **Embrace the inevitability of failure** —you’ll almost certainly fail, so get ready to experience and overcome that pain when it comes.
  * **Be willing to fundamentally transform yourself** —accept that shallow changes to your life may not be enough, and dig deep to change how you think, feel, and face the world.



(Shortform note: While Peterson’s framing is very heroic, the sort of courage he speaks to is very ordinary: It means having the integrity and accountability to face up to your life’s everyday challenges. This could be as mundane as building a new habit, becoming more reliable at work, or improving relationships with your friends and family. What Peterson stresses so heavily is that we must take these everyday challenges very seriously, knowing that our lives in fact hinge on the daily decisions we make about how accountable, sincere, and committed we want to be.)

### Group #2: Rules for Dealing With the World

In this next section, we’ll discuss five rules for conducting yourself in the social world. Specifically, we’ll explore Peterson’s perspectives on tradition and change, romantic relationships, chronic stress and your home life, ideological dogma in the world around us, and work situations that compromise your values. **By following these rules, you’ll reduce the friction and difficulties in your interactions with other people and the world at large**.

#### Rule #1: Respect Both Tradition and Progressive Change

Starting with a discussion of the world at large, Peterson argues in Rule #1 that **we should respect our traditional social institutions while also embracing the reality of progressivism and change**. These are complementary forces: Traditions ground us and connect us to the past, while progressive thought challenges and renews facets of society that have stagnated.

According to Peterson, our traditional social institutions are solutions to complex problems that humanity has spent millennia working out: How we can best structure our societies, organize large-scale action such as building cities, live together in a civilized, non-violent way, and so on. Though at times they may seem anachronistic, they serve to keep human civilization in good order.

**At the same time, all traditions are prone to becoming dogma—rigidly following old ideas even when they’ve become outdated.** In time, Peterson says, dogma falls away when progressive thinkers challenge the flaws in an existing status quo and improve upon them. In this way, creative change counteracts the eventual decline of traditional ideas and ways of living.

Peterson argues that since these forces—tradition and change, conservatism and liberalism—work together to keep society balanced and moving forward, we should respect both of them. If one is missing, we risk falling to either extreme:

  * At one extreme, conservatism becomes stagnant and corrupt—unable to handle a changing world. For instance, Puritan fundamentalists didn’t make it to today.
  * At the other extreme, liberalism can lead to totalitarian ideologies that crucify offenders. For instance, Marxist ideas were originally liberal and progressive but gave rise to governments such as the Soviet Union that weren’t so open-minded. 



According to Peterson, **today’s conservative dogmas were once progressive, and today’s progressive ideas will one day become conservative dogma. In the end, both matter.**

> **Hegelian Dialectics and the Evolution of Ideas**
> 
> Peterson’s above argument is reminiscent of the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s notion of dialectics. Hegel explained dialectics as a process through which ideas, concepts, and social systems evolved through conflict and resolution:
> 
>   * The process begins with a thesis, the starting point for an idea.
> 
>   * Then, an antithesis—an idea that conflicts with or challenges the thesis—arises in opposition, and the two ideas clash.
> 
>   * Through this conflict, a synthesis emerges: an idea that combines elements from both thesis and antithesis, producing a resolution to their tension.
> 
> 

> 
> For example, there are various theses and antitheses conflicting between the conservative and progressive parties of US politics: arguments for and against gun rights, for and against women’s rights to abortion, and for and against welfare programs such as universal basic income. If a resolution arises to one of these conflicts, that idea will be a synthesis. The dialectic process would then continue, with each synthesis becoming the new thesis, leading to a continuous evolution of ideas and systems, such as the traditional institutions and progressive ideas that Peterson describes.
> 
> This process of clashing and evolving ideas doesn’t just occur in politics, either. Recently, an antithesis has arisen to challenge the conventional scientific notions of reality and our place in it (that life is a statistical fluke, entropy will turn everything to dust, and humans are essentially tiny and meaningless in the grand scheme of things). In _The Romance of Reality_ , Bobby Azarian argues that in fact, cutting-edge research suggests that life is deeply imbued with meaning, that humans are creative agents with an important role to play in cosmic evolution, and that life is statistically probable. Much as Peterson says, old ideas and dogmas come into conflict with new ones—even in an institution dedicated to finding objective truth.

#### Rule #5: If You Loathe Something, Avoid It

While tradition and progressivism both matter, you’ll sometimes come up against ideas that you just can’t agree with. In Rule #5, Peterson discusses how to handle these ideological conflicts when they start to compromise your sense of what’s right and wrong.

**In life and work, you’ll sometimes find yourself in positions that compromise or challenge your morals.** For instance, you might disagree with workplace policies to ban certain words or impose particular behaviors for ideological reasons. If you accept these situations, Peterson says, you’ll become passive and, over time, suffer from repressed emotions. Specifically, you’ll experience inner emotional conflict and struggle to respect yourself. That is, since you failed to stand up for what you thought was right, you won’t be able to see yourself as morally upright or respectable.

(Shortform note: While Peterson’s advice may help you maintain personal integrity, note that it may put your career at risk. In their 2016 book _The Stupidity Paradox_ , André Spicer and Mats Alvesson explain how the most successful employees are those that conform to company standards rather than challenge them. In fact, employees that push limits, challenge norms, or think outside the box may be seen as problematic. So before you get in an ideological fight with your boss, consider whether you’re financially ready to risk your livelihood.)

**To avoid this fate, equip yourself to combat policies or impositions with which you take great issue.** Peterson recommends two strategies:

  * **Improve your skills.** Find opportunities to build transferable skills so that if your job is at risk, you can pivot your career in a new direction. 
  * **Educate yourself.** Get to know both sides of the issue in question, so that you can voice your qualms intelligently. Develop your own argument so that you can articulate it smoothly.



If you take up the fight and it goes poorly, these strategies will have you prepared to pivot and stay employed. If it goes well, you’ll have honored your inner moral instinct and grown as a person.

> **Be Prepared to Pivot, but First Avoid Entrenching Your Beliefs**
> 
> Peterson’s advice to build transferable skills is supported by experts such as David Epstein, who argues in _Range_ that specialists are a dying breed. Highly specialized skills are less useful in our increasingly complex, fast-paced world. In contrast, generalists—people who build a wide range of transferable skills—may find greater success. Generalists are often more creative and better at solving problems they’ve never encountered, both traits that are valuable to fast-moving enterprises.
> 
> Such preparation may work wonders, but there may be an easier route: Examine whether you’re giving the opposing position a fair shake before you risk your job over an ideological disagreement. In _Think Again_ , Adam Grant argues that we’re all prone to biases and incomplete information, such that our beliefs often stand on shaky ground.
> 
> Given this, reconsidering your stances may expose that what you believe to be right is biased or incomplete. In such a situation, you might choose to listen to the other side and consider whether you might be in the wrong. This can also help you develop self-awareness and intellectual humility, qualities that help you continue to develop more precise, unbiased knowledge.

#### Rule #6: Reject Dogma

If workplace ideologies or stances continue to conflict with your morals, you might find more help in Peterson’s next rule, where he suggests avoiding ideology altogether. In Rule #6, Peterson explains that Western civilization was once founded on traditional Judeo-Christian values and that these values told us our history, culture, conventions, and how to live together civilly. However, modern science and rationalism have diminished belief in God and removed those foundations.

According to Peterson, **the loss of our traditional values left a moral void that scientific materialism has failed to fill**. And while modern materialism hasn’t produced a better system of values, people still need guidance as to what’s meaningful, how the world works, and what we ought to do with our lives.

(Shortform note: One effort to navigate the void of meaning left by the decline of traditional religious society is John Vervaeke’s Awakening from the Meaning Crisis lecture series. Vervaeke, a University of Toronto professor who was a colleague of Peterson’s, gestures toward creating a “religion of no religion” as one part of a solution to the meaning crisis. In other words, he contends that we need a new “metanarrative,” or grand story that explains our history and our place in the universe, in order to live well and morally. Religion used to provide this story, and Vervaeke suggests we do need the meaning-making aspects of religion, but without its superstitious, nonscientific aspects.)

To fill this need, Peterson says, along came the major ideologies of the 20th century. Peterson explains that ideologies are simplistic accounts of how the world works and of what’s right versus wrong. In essence, an ideology 1) declares the cause of all suffering, 2) claims to have the solution, and 3)**** offers the moral high ground to people who join the tribe. For instance, Marxism explained all suffering in terms of class struggle, cast capitalists as the bad guys, and claimed that we just need to redistribute resources to make everyone equal.

However, Peterson says,**ideologies misrepresent the complexity of the real world**. Major problems like human suffering and inequality have complex and historically contingent causes that we can’t easily uncover, and ideologues intentionally obscure this complexity. If you fall for simplistic answers given with righteous conviction, Peterson argues, you risk becoming arrogant and susceptible to manipulation. Specifically, feeling like you have the indisputable moral high ground allows you to condemn those who disagree with you and become resentful of people who think differently.

**To avoid this problem, reject dogma and choose to grapple with the true complexity of the world**. Educate yourself, reading and learning across ideological boundaries. Figure out your own life before you try to tell other people how to live. Over time, you’ll develop your own thinking and become able to deal with larger and more complex problems in the real world.

> **Reject Ideology, Get Gray-Pilled**
> 
> If you want to remain intellectually autonomous, consider the idea of gray-pilling: Constantly exposing yourself to new information, perspectives, and arguments so that you never become too comfortable with what you think you know. This notion is a play on _red-pilling_ , which some internet communities use to mean that you’ve “discovered a hidden, secret truth” and become privy to something most people don’t know.
> 
> Writer and consultant Venkatesh Rao argues that red-pilling is just deceiving yourself into believing you’ve found some final answer or belief system that will solve all your problems. Red pills are typically packaged as hidden truths that you get initiated into, and they tend to function as ideological dogmas—similar to the political systems Peterson describes.
> 
> On the other hand, gray pills are meant to shake things up, challenge your beliefs, and help you stay “intellectually alive.” By regularly seeking out gray pills, you’ll avoid falling into any ideological dead ends. To find them, try these tactics:
> 
>   * Expose yourself to opposing viewpoints, such as political stances you typically disagree with.
> 
>   * Engage in good faith with arguments and stances you typically wouldn’t hold.
> 
>   * Surf social networks such as Twitter to find obscure niches and perspectives that further challenge what you think you know.
> 
> 


#### Rule #10: Actively Work to Keep Your Marriage Alive

Moving away from the broader world and into the home, Peterson asserts in Rule #10 that**monogamous** **marriage is the best way to structure your adult social life**. He argues that as of yet, human societies haven’t devised a better basic social unit than married pairs. With a spouse and family, you have a support system that will always be there for you in our often cold, harsh world.

(Shortform note: While Peterson makes a case for the positive aspects of marriage—emotional support, companionship, and shared responsibility—traditional monogamy may not be best for everyone. Alternative social structures and relationship models, such as non-monogamous relationships, cohabitation without marriage, and chosen families offer different ways of building meaningful, supportive relationships. With divorce rates in the US hovering between 40% and 50%, you might also want to consider the potential legal, financial, and emotional repercussions of a failed marriage.)

**Peterson asserts that once you’re married, you should work hard to make your marriage successful.** To ensure you can do this, he recommends making two commitments:

  * **Take divorce off the table.** If you refuse to give up on the relationship, you’ll find the strength and desperation to make it work. 
  * **Communicate openly and consistently.** According to Peterson, honest communication is the key to a successful relationship. It can be very difficult, so you need to be willing to fight for and negotiate your wants and needs with your spouse. 



Once you’ve committed to making your marriage work, turn to the logistics of daily life.**In conversation with your spouse, hash out all the details about how you’ll live your lives together.** Peterson says that since traditional gender roles hold less sway than before, you’ll need to plan your and your spouse’s roles in detail. This involves how you’ll keep your house, run finances, whether to have children and how to raise them, your work and career choices, who washes the dishes, and so on.

(Shortform note: In _The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work_ , John Gottman discusses steps to take both before and after marriage to ensure success. Chiefly, Gottman argues for developing a deep, genuine friendship with your spouse and maintaining that friendship into and throughout your marriage. To do this, Gottman recommends getting to know your partner in detail, giving and receiving affection, and responding to your partner’s overtures, or bids for connection. With such a connection built, it should be easier to follow Peterson’s principles about handling the mundane, practical aspects of life.)

Since what you do routinely constitutes most of your life, it’s important to get your routines right. Once you’ve sorted out the details, regularly check in with your spouse about how they’re doing and whether they need changes. Consistent communication ensures that you avoid tyrannizing each other.

With your practical matters squared away, Peterson recommends that you plan your romantic life. **While scheduling romance sounds unsexy, it ensures that your love life doesn’t fall by the wayside**. Plan regular date nights, such as dinner at your favorite local restaurant or a walk in the park, and use these times to be fully present with your spouse. Making these efforts will help you remember why you first fell in love, and they’ll sustain your romance over time.

(Shortform note: With modern life as hectic and busy as it is, many people simply have no time for romance, even on a schedule. However, it’s possible to keep romance alive in your relationship by building small habits that allow it to bloom when the time is right. These habits involve cultivating a romantic attitude, getting a sense for romantic timing, and communicating openly and sincerely with your partner. By doing so, you can practice romance with intention, as Peterson suggests, but without necessarily needing to do so on a rigid schedule. Rather, try to find a generally romantic attitude toward life, and let that spill over into everything you do.)

#### Rule #3: Don’t Blind Yourself to Chronic Stressors

Continuing his advice for creating an orderly home life, Peterson argues in Rule #3 that **you shouldn’t ignore chronic stressors, lest they become larger issues.** Daily life is full of tiny, repeating pricks of stress—kids to care for, work colleagues to deal with, imperfect relationships to manage, chores to juggle. If you let these pricks build up, they’ll amount to tons of stress over time.

As Peterson explains, a little thing that happens every day isn’t actually small, because most of your life is made of those routine occurrences. So if your routines regularly prick you with little stressors, that irritation will build up until it bursts.

(Shortform note: Chronic stress is a well-documented condition, and as Peterson says, it can become serious if ignored. Symptoms include aches and pains, fatigue, distractibility, and irritability—each of which can further worsen your ability to deal with the sources of your stress. Fortunately, chronic stress is treatable with exercise, getting plenty of sleep, and/or practicing mindfulness. With a clearer headspace, you might then plan to address the roots of your stress, whether they’re from work, home life, or elsewhere.)

To solve this problem, Peterson recommends that you do the following:

  1. **Acknowledge your chronic stressors.** Take stock of where they are and get clear on why they bother you.
  2. **Find ways to deal with them.** Think of changes you can make to your routines, or prepare to talk with the people contributing to your stress. 



Since these little stressors often involve relationships, Peterson emphasizes that you must get clear about how you feel and communicate that to whomever’s involved. For instance, you might get annoyed daily by your partner’s habit of leaving his dirty laundry around the house. First, _acknowledge_ this stressor and get clear about why it bothers you. Then, find a way to fix it—this could be as simple as speaking to your partner and asking for the change you need.

**By doing this with each of your previously ignored stressors, you’ll clear up emotions that would otherwise fester beneath the surface**. You’ll get to know how you really feel on a daily basis, and you’ll often change your daily life for the better. According to Peterson, the alternative is to accept death by a thousand cuts—daily misery from suppressed emotions that will trouble you and your loved ones unendingly.

> **Address Your Stressors With Nonviolent Communication**
> 
> Peterson isn’t the first to highlight the importance of effective communication in relationships. In _Nonviolent Communication_ , for instance, the authors point to the importance of acknowledging your emotions whilst maintaining compassion for how the other person feels, too. Nonviolent communication has four specific steps:
> 
>   * **Observe** —pay attention to your emotions and the situation while avoiding judgments.
> 
>   * **Express** —state how you feel with a simple “I feel … “ format—”I feel hurt” rather than “You hurt me.”
> 
>   * **Connect** —connect how you feel to a core need, such as autonomy or integrity.
> 
>   * **Request** —ask for something specific to begin addressing your feelings.
> 
> 

> 
> A nonviolent communication might look like, “Son, I heard you drove recklessly in the snow. I feel scared because I need you to stay safe. I’d like to talk together about safe driving.” By communicating this way—gently, clearly, and candidly—you can better avoid arguments and instead have productive, connected conversations.

### Group #3: Rules for Existential Well-Being

In Group #3, we’ll discuss Peterson’s perspective on how to relate to the world at large. These three rules deal with questions of a more existential nature. Specifically, we’ll explain how to stay connected to a higher good, how to avoid growing bitter as life challenges you, and how to find strength and thankfulness in the face of life’s inevitable hardships.

#### Rule #8: Make Space for Beauty in Your Life

Peterson asserts in Rule #8 that **beauty plays a vital role in life: It connects us to the sense of wonder and mystery that we felt as children.** Without making room for beauty, we can lose touch with the mystery of life and the wonder all around us.

As children, we have no problem connecting to beauty. We see the world through fresh eyes, and we can feel wonder everywhere. But with time, Peterson says, we lose this ability to perceive the wondrousness of the world. Instead, we fall into ruts and routines, and we start to take for granted the beauty that still exists all around us. It becomes mundane, drab, and familiar.

There is a way back to that child-like perception, however. Peterson argues that**fine art can reconnect us with the beauty we saw as children**. Great artists retain their child-like connection to wonder and can translate that unclouded perception into art. In other words, they capture what others can no longer see and render it visible to the rest of us. So if you regularly engage with great art, you can find glimpses of that beauty and wonder.

(Shortform note: While Peterson argues that we inevitably lose our sense of wonder, it may be possible to practice feeling wonder through meditation. Some mindfulness techniques work to bring you into the present moment in such a way that you feel awe, wonder, and joy—similarly to how Peterson says that artists and children connect to wonder. Therefore, falling into ruts and routines may be preventable.)

According to Peterson, this is why we’re so captivated by great art even though we often don’t consciously understand it: It reveals to us a depth of beauty that we could not previously perceive.**** So, make room for beauty in your life by getting at least one work of art that truly calls to you. By regularly reconnecting with beauty through that artwork, you’ll stay afloat despite the stresses and struggles of life.

> **More Ways to Connect to Wonder**
> 
> Note that Peterson's perspective on art is somewhat Western-centric and high-society, as he mainly focuses on fine oil paintings. Such art may not be accessible or appealing to everyone, and may not universally help people connect to beauty. Different forms of art may speak more to different people. In exploring the art you’d want in your life, consider not just paintings, but also fine music or theater, great poetry and literature, and critically acclaimed films or visual media.
> 
> There are also other ways to cultivate a sense of wonder and joy in our lives. Spending time in nature, as well as practicing mindfulness and meditation, can both help reconnect us to a child-like sense of wonder and appreciation for the world around us. Ultimately, the key is to remain open and connect to beauty wherever it appears in your life.

#### Rule #11: Resist the Temptations of Frustrated Self-Absorption

In Rule #11, Peterson argues that **we must all avoid slipping into immoral behavior due to frustration with life.** If, instead, you choose courage and listen to your conscience, you’ll grow strong and able to navigate the trials of life. In contrast, acting immorally will lead you astray and distort your sense of right and wrong.

To explain his position, Peterson contends that**** chaos and evil are intrinsic parts of reality—therefore, we’ll all encounter difficulty, misfortune, and suffering in life. And given that life is difficult and often unfair, it’s all too easy to start cheating or cutting corners to get ahead. But **though these immoral behaviors may yield short-term advantages,** Peterson says that **they’ll distort your sense of what is right, good, and true**. Over time, you can even change the structure of your brain such that you lose the ability to act morally in any situation.

(Shortform note: Peterson’s point can apply to organizations as well as individuals. In _Principles_ , Ray Dalio emphasizes the importance of “extreme honesty” to maintaining trust and effectiveness within an organization. In contrast to the short-term benefits of lying and cheating, being extremely honest—and extremely transparent—can make an organization more trusting and efficient, because nobody has to worry about unspoken conflicts, hidden schemes, or other shady behavior.)

Instead of acting immorally when you get frustrated, **accept that reality features both great good and evil. Since you can’t escape either, choose to cultivate gratitude and courage**. Thinking that you’ll escape suffering is arrogant, whereas accepting the bad and giving thanks for the good is realistic and keeps you afloat. Gratitude and courage prevent you from feeling victimized by the world, and they give you the strength to take responsibility and face up to the challenges in your life.

(Shortform note: Following from Peterson's claim that you can distort your brain’s ability to sense right and wrong, research also supports the inverse claim: Individuals who practiced gratitude were found to have stronger neural activity in brain areas associated with moral cognition and decision-making. This suggests that by practicing gratitude and courage, you can train yourself to make better, more ethical decisions.)

#### Rule #12: In the Face of Suffering, Find Thankfulness

Continuing from Rule #11, **Peterson explains that it’s all too easy to become bitter and dissatisfied with life**. Darkness and suffering are unavoidable, and many people end up unhappy with themselves and with life in general. However, falling into despair does you no good and can cause you to act out the darkness within you. This, in turn, will worsen your life and the lives of those around you.

(Shortform note: Research may also support Peterson's idea that our emotions affect those around us. Studies have found that our emotions have a ripple effect on others: When we feel well and healthy, we positively affect the well-being of those around us. Again, this may suggest that the inverse is also true: If we feel bitter and negative, we may also bring down the well-being of those around us, as Peterson says.)

The alternative, Peterson argues, is to **choose gratitude in the face of the great darkness and suffering of life.** This doesn’t mean denying that life is full of suffering. Rather, it means acknowledging the darkness and finding gratitude _despite_ it. Even when life seems bleak, you can look around and focus on what you _do_ have. For instance, you might despair over an investment that went south—however, you probably still have food to eat and a safe home. Thinking like this gives you the strength to go on even during hard times.

(Shortform note: While Peterson's emphasis on gratitude is certainly valuable, this approach may break down in the face of extreme suffering and hardship. For instance, individuals experiencing trauma or intense physical pain may find it difficult to feel grateful for anything, no less their present suffering. Gratitude can help, but cultivating the ability to feel gratitude in the face of great suffering takes time—so avoid beating yourself up if you can't immediately feel grateful for the struggles in your life.)
