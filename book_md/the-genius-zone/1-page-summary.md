## 1-Page Summary

You can spend your time thinking about the things you can control or the things you can’t. Stanford-trained psychologist Gay Hendricks writes that the way to be happy is to let go of the things you can’t control and instead devote your time and energy to things you can change.

**Hendricks recommends living your life in what he calls the “Genius Zone** ,” where you’re expressing your “genius” by doing the things you love to do, speaking honestly and listening mindfully in your relationships, and committing (and recommitting) yourself to expressing your creativity every day. Spending your time in the Genius Zone enables you to live a fulfilling life, one where you’re engaged in the ongoing process of pursuing your creative potential and cultivating joy in your everyday routines.

Hendricks is behind the Hendricks Institute, a learning center for “conscious living and loving,” which he founded with his wife Kathlyn Hendricks. He’s also the author of _The Big Leap _(2009), _Conscious Luck _(2020), _Conscious Living _(2009), and other books. In 2021’s _The Genius Zone_ , Hendricks expands on the ideas of _The Big Leap_ to share more of his strategies for discovering your inner genius and living a more fulfilling life by doing the things you love to do.

In this guide, we’ll explore what the Genius Zone is, what distinguishes the activities that tap into your genius from the other tasks you spend your time and energy on, and why spending time in the Genius Zone makes you feel happier and more fulfilled. Then we’ll examine the methods that Hendricks teaches for getting in touch with your genius and pursuing your full creative potential. We’ll also compare Hendricks’s ideas to other theories on creativity and put them into the context of popular ideas on living a creatively fulfilling life.

### What Is the Genius Zone?

To understand how you can feel happier and more fulfilled by living your life in the Genius Zone, you first have to understand what the Genius Zone is, why it’s special, and how you might recognize it in your life.

Hendricks uses the term “Genius Zone” to refer to the mind-body space that you enter when two conditions are met: **You’re doing what you love to do, and you’re using your skills to make a positive impact in the world** —in other words, it’s the space where you can access your “genius.”

Hendricks writes that when you engage with tasks in your Genius Zone, you devote a deeper level of attention to them, a kind of attention that’s different from what you exercise even when you’re engaged in activities you’re really good at. You’re also able to freely access and express your creativity, pursue your creative potential, and find a new level of fulfillment and joy in your life.

> **How Does the Genius Zone Compare to Flow?**
> 
> Many books on happiness note that focusing on the things you can control and tapping into your creativity can make you feel more fulfilled. In _The Big Leap_ , Hendricks explains that when you’re in the Genius Zone, you can get to the state of “flow” as described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his book _Flow_. Csikszentmihalyi writes that we feel happy when we have a sense of control over our thoughts and feelings. That’s also when we can experience a “flow” state, where we become immersed in what we’re doing and feel a deep sense of purpose and meaning as we work.
> 
> Csikszentmihalyi explains that you’re better able to access this state when you’re working to achieve something that’s important to you. That coincides with Hendricks’s advice to spend your time on activities that will help you make a positive contribution. What Hendricks calls your “genius” equates, in Csikszentmihalyi’s model, to a skill you can cultivate by learning to focus your attention on a task so that everything else recedes into the background.
> 
> Attention is just as crucial in _Flow_ as it is in _The Genius Zone_. Csikszentmihalyi makes the point that your thoughts, emotions, and memories are all shaped by how you direct your attention. Consciously choosing how and where to direct your attention can help you determine how you experience your life (and, Hendricks would argue, how much of it you spend in the state of fulfillment you reach in the Genius Zone).
> 
> The deep level of attention that characterizes flow has empirical evidence behind it, too. Researchers have found that the flow state is produced by an alteration in brain function: Your attention and awareness are heightened, problem-solving becomes almost automatic, and areas of your brain involved in self-monitoring—areas that might normally make you feel self-doubt—are deactivated, enabling you to work creatively and without hesitation.

#### What’s Special About the Genius Zone?

The Genius Zone is a unique mind-body space that you enter **only when you’re working on tasks that align with your particular genius**. Hendricks differentiates the Genius Zone from other zones—the Incompetence Zone, the Competence Zone, and the Excellence Zone—which are characterized by the ability and affinity you have for the tasks in each category.

  * In the **Incompetence Zone** , you spend your time and attention on things that you aren’t any good at. These are tasks you could and probably should delegate to someone else. 
  * In the **Competence Zone** , you devote time and attention to things that you do well, but not better than most other people. There’s nothing special about your skill with these tasks or your enjoyment of them, even though you’re competent at them. 
  * In the **Excellence Zone** , you spend time and attention on tasks that you’re great at but don’t truly love. Though you have a high level of skill at these tasks, they don’t satisfy you. Your skills in this zone are likely in demand (and you may even be well-compensated to use them), but work in this zone doesn’t make you feel fulfilled.



**It’s only in the Genius Zone that you access what Hendricks calls “true creativity** ,” which involves serving yourself and others with your natural abilities—even if they’re not in traditionally creative fields. (Shortform note: There are many ways to think about creativity. One definition comes from _Big Magic_ , where Elizabeth Gilbert defines creativity as a commitment to exploring the gifts that you’ve been given by the universe: the talents, interests, and desires that you need to access if you want to interact with something that’s bigger than yourself.)

The Genius Zone differs from the other zones (particularly the Excellence Zone) because when you’re inside it, you use your creativity to do things that you love and to make a positive contribution to the world. **You can reach a deeper level of creative fulfillment by working in the Genius Zone**.

> **How Can You Decide Where to Focus Your Time and Attention?**
> 
> The areas of competence that Hendricks outlines—the Genius Zone, Excellence Zone, Competence Zone, and Incompetence Zone—correspond to different categories of work outlined by other authors, and Hendricks isn’t alone in advising that you prioritize your tasks and delegate work that doesn’t make the best use of your skills. In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey offers a framework for understanding which tasks are worthy of your time and attention.
> 
> Bailey suggests creating a matrix with four quadrants: Quadrant 1 contains tasks that are unnecessary, unproductive, and not enjoyable. Quadrant 2 comprises tasks that are enjoyable but unproductive, ones that distract you from more important work. Quadrant 3 holds tasks that are productive but not enjoyable. And Quadrant 4 is made up of tasks that are productive and enjoyable but also meaningful, ones that help you achieve your purpose.
> 
> The tasks in what Hendricks calls your Incompetence Zone mostly land in what Bailey calls Quadrant 1 since you aren’t good at them, probably don’t enjoy them, and don’t derive value from them. The tasks in your Competence Zone land in Quadrant 3 because they’re productive (and you’re good at them), but you don’t necessarily enjoy doing them. The same could be said of many of the tasks in your Excellence Zone: You’re great at these tasks, but they don’t offer you true enjoyment or fulfillment.
> 
> The tasks in your Genius Zone fall into Quadrant 4: The time you spend on them is productive and enjoyable, you’re better at these tasks than most other people, and when you’re working on them, you’re also moving toward fulfilling your purpose. Just as Hendricks writes that you should focus your time and attention on the tasks in your Genius Zone, Bailey explains that emphasizing tasks in Quadrant 4 enables you to devote your attention and skills to the tasks that matter most.

#### How to Recognize What’s in Your Genius Zone

To identify what’s in your Genius Zone, Hendricks recommends considering a few criteria. You can pinpoint **areas where you have remarkable abilities,** or ask yourself **what you really love to do**. You can also think about which **activities you find the most fulfilling** or whether you do any **work that doesn’t feel like work to you**. Those all serve as hints that an activity might fall into your Genius Zone. For example, you might recognize that writing is in your Genius Zone if you feel deeply satisfied when working on an essay or find that writing a blog post doesn’t feel like work.

Another hallmark of tasks in your Genius Zone is that you probably experience them in a distinctive way with your body. The embodied experience of engaging your genius feels different for everyone: Some people lose track of time, others experience time slowing down, and still others feel a physical sense of joy or freedom.

(Shortform note: Some experts who write about finding meaning in life advise paying special attention to the tasks you enjoy doing. In _Think Like a Monk_ , Jay Shetty writes that devoting your time to the activities you enjoy helps you feel happier and more satisfied. He explains that when you feel interested in something, you become more engaged with it. Deeper engagement helps you focus more completely and work to perfect your skills. But Shetty notes you can also find meaning in tasks you don’t naturally find interesting: By cultivating an appreciation for them, you can learn to deeply engage with and derive satisfaction from just about any task.)

### Why Is Living in the Genius Zone the Best Way to Be Happy and Fulfilled?

Now that we know what the Genius Zone is, we’ll explore why devoting your time and attention to the tasks in this zone will help you feel more satisfied in your everyday life.

In Hendricks’s view, striving to live in the Genius Zone offers a more fulfilling alternative to what might be your status quo: going through your daily life doing work that doesn’t fulfill you, criticizing yourself for things you have or haven’t done, worrying about things you can’t change, and wishing that you could control what other people do or what they think of you. He writes that you’ll become happier by **stepping outside of these negative thought** **patterns** and replacing them with efforts to spend your time and energy in the Genius Zone instead.

> **How Reducing Negative Thoughts Improves Your Life**
> 
> Just as Hendricks writes that reducing negative thoughts can help you live a happier life, other experts say that replacing negative thoughts with positive ones can reduce stress and improve your health, both of which could make you feel happier. Researchers find that people who practice positive thinking have lower rates of depression, better psychological and physical well-being, reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, and stronger coping skills.
> 
> These researchers recommend turning negative thinking patterns into positive ones by identifying the areas of your life that you tend to think negatively about, evaluating your thoughts throughout the day, interacting regularly with positive people, and making a rule that you’ll treat yourself kindly—which means that you won’t say anything rude to yourself.

#### What Are the Benefits of Living in the Genius Zone?

Hendricks writes that spending your time in the Genius Zone has a number of benefits, both direct and indirect. He explains that as you shift your focus to tasks that engage your genius, you’ll make changes that have two direct effects: **You’ll decrease the frequency of your negative thinking, and you’ll increase your ability to access and express your creativity**. Also as an indirect result of the change in your thinking and behavior, you’ll improve how you relate to other people. Next, we’ll take a closer look at each of these benefits.

(Shortform note: The benefits of living in the Genius Zone sound similar to the benefits of spending time in flow. In _Ikigai_ —a book about the Japanese philosophy of finding your purpose at the intersection of what you love, what you’re good at, what you can get paid for, and what the world needs—Héctor García and Francesc Miralles explain that learning to experience flow can help you find your ikigai. They note that when you experience flow, your mind is focused, you’re living in the present, you feel confident and in control, and you feel led by the task rather than by your ego. By integrating flow into your life as much as you can, you not only experience these short-term benefits, but you can also more readily access and fulfill your purpose.)

##### You’ll Curb Patterns of Negative Thinking

The first benefit of living in the Genius Zone involves reducing your negative thoughts. Hendricks writes that **every day, you have hundreds of opportunities to enter the Genius Zone, and each one comes to you through your tendency to worry about things you can’t control**. When you’re thinking negatively about something outside of your control—maybe something that happened in the past, or what other people think of you, or things you can’t change about your circumstances—you can either keep doing what you’re doing, or you can let go of your negative thinking and self-criticism to engage your “genius” instead.

(Shortform note: Many experts say that it’s common for people to dwell on things that they can’t change, and they offer a variety of strategies for curbing this tendency. In _Who Will Cry When You Die?_ , Robin Sharma recommends trying to focus on things that you can improve in the present or the future, rather than ruminating on things that happened in the past. For instance, instead of obsessing over a mistake you made, try to reframe it as a lesson, learn something from it, and then move your focus to something that’s within your power to improve.)

**Hendricks characterizes cycles of self-blame and self-criticism as addictions that sabotage you in the pursuit of your goals**. When you redirect your attention away from the negative thoughts that you habitually think about yourself, then those thoughts have a way of receding into the background. He explains that this is much more effective than fighting negative thoughts, which just become more persistent the more you try to suppress them.

(Shortform note: Psychologists say that many of us internalize negative messages that we then perpetuate as self-criticism. Both the habit and the content of self-criticism have negative effects and contribute to depression and anxiety. Fortunately, you can kick even a persistent addiction to self-criticism: Practicing self-compassion by treating yourself with care even in stressful situations can help. So can practicing techniques like mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation, tools that are both proven to help reduce self-criticism.)

##### You’ll Gain More Access to Your Creativity

The second direct benefit of living in the Genius Zone is learning to access your creative skills more readily. Hendricks writes that to live your life in the Genius Zone, you have to **commit to pursuing your full creative potential**. By making this commitment (and following through on it), you’ll spend more time exercising your creativity. You’ll also learn to avoid the negative emotions and coping mechanisms that accompany the feeling of unfulfilled creative potential.

(Shortform note: Nobody wants to feel creatively unfulfilled, but it’s challenging to figure out how to practice your creativity instead. In _Keep Going_ , Austin Kleon writes that it helps set the right goals for your creative pursuits. You might feel accustomed to setting results-based goals, but Kleon advises setting process-based goals instead. He writes that process-based goals center the creative process and the things you enjoy about it, in much the same way that cultivating flow is about focusing on the satisfaction you derive from the process. For example, instead of setting the goal of creating a YouTube video that gets viewed millions of times, you might set a goal of just making a video for a friend and enjoying the process of making it.)

Hendricks writes that when people feel that their creativity is stifled or that they’ve stalled, **they compensate by developing various “addictions” to distract themselves**. This might look like what we traditionally think of as addiction—such as drinking or smoking—but it could also manifest as another coping mechanism that helps you forget that you’re feeling creatively unfulfilled. (Maybe you watch Netflix all evening instead of working on your own screenplay.) Hendricks notes that you probably always have time for these habits, even when you don’t have time for creative pursuits. When you stop telling yourself you don’t have time for your creative work, you can confront your sense of unfulfillment and recommit to pursuing what you love.

(Shortform note: Though Hendricks uses the word “addiction” to describe distractions that become bad habits, other experts differentiate addictions as conscious behaviors that have negative consequences for your health. When a behavior becomes a habit, you tend to engage in it automatically and subconsciously. But an addiction is anything but subconscious: You spend increasing amounts of time thinking about and engaging with it. An actionable way to think about the ways you limit your creativity might be to look for the excuses you make: Experts say that when we make excuses to limit ourselves, it not only prevents us from achieving the task but also hurts our motivation. So making excuses might be the habit you want to break.)

##### You’ll Improve Your Relationships

A benefit indirectly associated with living in the Genius Zone is improving your relationships. Hendricks writes that learning to let go of things that are outside of your control to pursue life in the Genius Zone can have profound effects on how you relate to others because you’ll **learn to accept other people as they are, without trying to control them or worrying about what they think of you.**

Additionally, taking stock of how you’re spending time can help you evaluate whether you’re dedicating your time to relationships where you’re appreciated for your creativity. Hendricks writes that many people dedicate significant time and energy to relationships that hold back their creativity. But if you want to spend more of your time in the Genius Zone, you’ll need to cultivate the relationships that support your creativity.

(Shortform note: Most of us enjoy feeling that our time and skills are appreciated, but not all experts agree with Hendricks that we need to worry about feeling supported and appreciated. In _The Courage to Be Disliked_ , Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga write that happy people focus on helping others, and they feel satisfied when they contribute to others’ well-being. That means that they just need to feel useful, and they don’t feel an emotional attachment to other people’s opinions of them or their work. In this model, you might only need to feel that your creative pursuits are helping other people—not necessarily that other people appreciate your creativity—to feel fulfilled and happy.)

### How Can You Access the Genius Zone?

Living in the Genius Zone requires practice with consciously choosing how to allocate your time and attention. It also involves **a process of committing and recommitting to your goals, and gently correcting course when you realize that you’ve strayed**. Hendricks explains that instead of chasing perfection and considering success an all-or-nothing endeavor, you can realize that it’s inevitable to make mistakes. When you slip up, take concrete steps to get back on track instead of criticizing yourself.

(Shortform note: Expert advice abounds on how you can push back against perfectionism. In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown writes that you can treat yourself with compassion and accept your imperfections and mistakes, rather than punishing yourself for them. One way to do this is to practice positive self-talk: Actively encourage yourself as you face your challenges rather than criticizing yourself for your flaws or shortcomings.)

Hendricks outlines a variety of methods and tools to access the Genius Zone, pursue your creative potential, and minimize your negative thinking. Each one is either **a tool you can use when you realize you’re trying to control something you can’t** **or a practice you can cultivate over time** to work toward the goal of doing the things you love while making a positive impact on the world around you.

(Shortform note: It often isn’t easy to figure out how to do creative work that has a positive impact, and not everyone agrees that this is a balance you have to strike. In _Big Magic_ , Gilbert writes that you might limit your creativity by setting the requirement that it has to help other people or otherwise be “important,” rather than something that’s true to you. Similarly, in _Keep Going_ , Kleon advises considering the impact that your work has on you as well as on others: He argues that nobody should suffer for the sake of your creative work, and that includes you.)

In this section, we’ll explore Hendricks’s tools to help you access your Genius Zone, based on a range of “Hands-On Activities” he offers throughout the book.

#### Commit to Letting Go of Negative Thoughts and Pursuing Your Full Creative Potential

To find and live in your Genius Zone, the first thing that Hendricks says you should do is to explicitly make a commitment to yourself: **Resolve to stop your habit of negative thinking and to pursue your true creativity**. Hendricks writes that if you don’t feel that you can sincerely make this commitment, then you shouldn’t proceed with the rest of the process until you’ve figured out what stands in your way.

(Shortform note: Hendricks doesn’t comment specifically on what could cause you to feel resistance to changing your thoughts and pursuing your creative potential. But one answer might lie in your natural change aversion: If you’ve been thinking and living your life in a specific way, then it’s natural to resist change, even if you know that change might make you happier. Psychologists say that your dislike of change is driven by cognitive biases that can lead you to make poor decisions and fall short of your potential. They recommend taking a step back to look as objectively as you can at how you’re making your decisions. Then, you might be able to determine whether it’s your fear of change, or something else, that’s holding you back.)

#### Perform the “Genius Move” When You Start Thinking About Things You Can’t Control

Next, the key method of the book is a technique that Hendricks calls the “Genius Move.” Hendricks writes that when you feel unhappy, it’s because your thoughts have turned to something that’s outside of your control. **The solution is to switch your focus to something that you can change**.

  1. First, notice that you’re feeling unhappy, that you’re carrying tension in your body, or that you feel stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts. 
  2. Next, try to identify the situation that you’re trying to control. (That could be anything that you’re worrying about, from the impression you made on a new neighbor to the odds that Amazon is going to deliver the book you ordered in time for your weekend trip.)
  3. You might be able to figure out what it is and why you’re trying to control it. Or, that might not become clear. Either way, the important thing is to sit with the question. 
  4. Then, even if you’re not sure what you’re trying to control, acknowledge that it’s outside of your control and state that you’re letting go of trying to control it. 
  5. Finally, identify something positive and productive you can do to affect something that’s within your control and then take that action. 



> **The Genius Move Versus Mindfulness**
> 
> Many readers cite the Genius Move as one of the most valuable parts of Hendricks’s method. For instance, author Josh Trent characterizes this step-by-step exercise as “a simple, life-altering practice.” For some readers, the simplicity of the Genius Move and its focus on becoming aware of your thoughts might sound like an exercise in mindfulness, another practice that’s often described as deceptively simple but potentially perspective-altering.
> 
> In _Wherever You Go, There You Are_ , professor of medicine and mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn defines mindfulness as the practice of noticing what’s happening in the present moment and experiencing it without judgment. You can do this anywhere, anytime, just like the Genius Move: Mindfulness offers the opportunity to pause and experience what’s happening both around you and inside you, without trying to change or control the moment.
> 
> When, in the first and second steps of the Genius Move, you notice your negative feelings and realize that you’re trying to control something you can’t, you’re practicing a kind of awareness that Kabat-Zinn differentiates from thinking. You achieve this awareness by simply observing what you’re experiencing, whether that’s a feeling of unhappiness, a sensation of physical tension, or a flurry of negative thoughts.
> 
> Kabat-Zinn explains that you can learn from this observation, as Hendricks explains might happen in the third step of the Genius Move, where you might gain some insight into the situation that you’re feeling an impulse to control. Kabat-Zinn also writes that mindfulness can help you look inward to make informed decisions and then take intentional steps in the direction you want to go. That’s similar to what Hendricks is describing when he advises, in the fourth and fifth steps of the Genius Move, deciding that what you’re trying to control isn’t yours to change, stating that you’re letting go of it, and identifying an action you can take.
> 
> While using the Genius Move and engaging in Kabat-Zinn’s mindfulness exercises can both help you tune in to what you’re experiencing, mindfulness meditation is a broader practice that involves a wide range of exercises designed for different purposes and people. But in its most basic form, mindfulness, like the Genius Move, might be one way to pause and reset when you realize you aren’t spending your time on the things you value most.

#### Use Your Breath to Tune In to Your Emotions

Next, Hendricks advises cultivating an awareness of your breathing as a useful tool for pursuing life in the Genius Zone, a process that he believes should involve both the mind and the body. He explains that you can **learn to tune in to your emotions by becoming aware of your breathing**. Breathing involves both the autonomic nervous system and conscious control, so learning to pay attention to your breath might be one way to access the connection between your conscious and unconscious minds.

For instance, Hendricks explains that when you’re feeling calm, you’ll notice that your abdominal muscles relax and you take deep breaths that fill your belly. When you’re feeling angry or scared, you can feel your abdominal muscles tense, and your breathing might be restricted to your chest. If you learn to notice when your breath moves up into your chest, then you can realize when you feel angry or scared, name the feeling, and figure out how to respond to it.

(Shortform note: Experts often recommend cultivating an awareness of your breath to tune in to what’s happening internally: In _Wherever You Go, There You Are_ , Kabat-Zinn characterizes breath as a crucial tool for mindfulness. He writes that you can use your breath as a focal point when you realize that you need to pause and pay attention to what you’re experiencing or feeling. Another mindfulness expert, psychologist Russ Harris, writes in _The Happiness Trap _that when you develop body awareness—which you can do by paying attention to your breathing, noticing tension in your body, or focusing on the heat you feel in your body—you create space within your body to accept your emotions, rather than fight against them.)

#### Commit to Communicating Honestly and Thoughtfully

Another strategy Hendricks recommends adopting if you want to live in the Genius Zone is to cultivate relationships with people who not only support and appreciate your creativity but with whom you can **communicate honestly and thoughtfully**. He explains that you probably leave things unsaid, even in conversations with the people you’re closest to. But you don’t want to be lied to, and so you shouldn’t lie to other people.

(Shortform note: Psychologists say that communicating honestly is about a lot more than just refraining from telling lies. Honesty requires not just the absence of deception but also a willingness to be open and trusting with someone else. In fact, some experts report that a willingness to feel vulnerable or to disclose something meaningful about yourself more accurately indicates the strength of your relationship with another person than whether you occasionally tell a white lie. Conversely, being honest isn’t about saying everything that comes into your head; instead, you can be sensitive to the other person’s feelings while still speaking truthfully about what you’re thinking and feeling.)

Hendricks advises that in addition to practicing the skill of communicating honestly, you should **cultivate the skill of listening generously and thoughtfully** , without interrupting or criticizing what the other person says. He explains that you can’t control what other people think or say, and letting go of trying to control them will make it easier for you to live in your Genius Zone.

(Shortform note: Listening generously is a principle that comes up in many books, but it’s not always clear how you can put it into practice. In _What Got You Here Won’t Get You There_ , executive coach Marshall Goldsmith offers some practical steps for becoming a more generous listener. First, he recommends letting the other person speak without interrupting them, just as Hendricks advises. Second, Goldsmith says it’s important to give the other person your full attention when they’re talking, keeping yourself from zoning out or getting distracted. And third, he recommends being thoughtful about how you decide to respond to the other person, making sure that your response makes them feel respected, appreciated, and heard.)

#### Accept Negative Thoughts Without Trying to Change Them

The next strategy that can help you pursue your genius is to learn to **overcome your negative thoughts about the past, the future, other people, and yourself**. Hendricks writes that to stop dwelling on your negative thoughts, you have to first acknowledge that you can’t control your thoughts. When you accept your negative thoughts for what they are, then you loosen their hold over you. By using the “Genius Move” to change your focus, you can stop expending energy on fighting negative thoughts and instead focus it on something you can change.

(Shortform note: For many of us, letting go of negative thoughts is easier said than done. In _The Willpower Instinct_ , health psychologist Kelly McGonigal explains that you can’t use willpower to control your thoughts or desires. If you’ve ever found yourself obsessing over the very thing you’re trying not to think about, then you’ve seen this firsthand. McGonigal notes that rather than trying to suppress a thought, you’ll likely find it much more effective to let your mind express it, while realizing that you don’t have to act on it. Once you allow the thought to surface, then your mind can stop obsessing over it and let it go.)

#### Stop Leaving Tasks Incomplete

Another simple tool for living in your Genius Zone involves learning to finish what you start. Hendricks writes that much of our negative thinking begins because **we have a tendency to leave tasks and conversations unfinished**. When we leave these things incomplete, then we feel negative emotions ranging from guilt to sadness to shame to denial, as well as a physical sense of that negative feeling.

Unfinished tasks could be as small as an email you left in your “drafts” folder or as big as brushing off an important conversation with your partner. The solution is to identify the tasks that you’ve left incomplete and, one by one, go back and finish them. If you have a long list of the things you’ve left undone, take it day by day, and you’ll cross items off your list and eliminate sources of negative thoughts.

(Shortform note: Many experts agree that we often leave tasks incomplete despite the fact that the habit doesn’t serve us. In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield writes that you might have projects that remain unfinished, commitments you haven’t followed through on, or insufficient time to spend with the people you love. Like Hendricks, Canfield advises making a list of tasks you’ve left incomplete and then addressing them, one by one. Canfield characterizes these unfinished tasks as clutter that constantly distracts you and demands your energy, hurting your productivity and focus. As you cross them off your list, you’ll have more energy and mental space for new things in your life.)

#### Ask Open-Ended Questions

Another tool that Hendricks recommends using is the open-ended question (what he calls “wonder questions”). Hendricks writes that the sensation of wonder lies at the heart of creativity: It’s what you feel when you let your mind explore, free of your efforts to control or criticize it. He explains that **asking yourself open-ended questions that relate to the things that you’d most like to know in your life** can engage your creativity, genius, and wonder.

These questions don’t have a single right answer; instead, they have a number of possible answers, each of which might open a different avenue for you to explore. You might want to know, “What can I do every day to make the most of my time with my family?” or “How can I use my skills to make the biggest difference in my community?” Hendricks notes that discovering answers to these questions could change your life. But even if you don’t find a complete answer, the process of contemplating the question can still help you gain insight into how to do what you love to do while making a positive contribution.

(Shortform note: Experts characterize wonder as a complex emotion, one that combines surprise and curiosity with contemplation and joy—and involves a heightened level of consciousness and emotion. You feel wonder both when you’re awed by something and when you’re puzzled by something that you want to explore, both situations that we’ve all experienced. In _21 Lessons for the 21st Century_ , Yuval Noah Harari writes that throughout human history, we’ve asked ourselves questions like “What is the meaning of my life?” and “What is my role in the universe?” Harari writes that when we wonder about these open-ended questions, we look for the answers in cultural stories or within ourselves.)

#### Cultivate Relationships With People Who Support Your Creativity

Next, if you want to pursue the highest expression of your creativity, it helps to **surround yourself with people who support your creative pursuits and appreciate your creativity**. Hendricks recommends taking a clear-eyed look at the people to whom you devote your time and energy. When you build relationships with people who support your creativity, you can do the things you love to do and help them do the same.

However, when you choose to spend time and energy with people who don’t encourage your creativity, Hendricks recommends acknowledging the role of your own choices instead of blaming others when you fail to reach your creative potential. **Letting go of blame frees up more space for creativity**.

(Shortform note: Some experts agree with Hendricks that other people play an essential role in creativity. One way to surround yourself with people who support and inspire your creativity is to find your creative community. Novelist Alexander Chee—who mentors and advocates for writers from marginalized communities, especially queer and AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) writers—explains that community is something you have to actively seek out. Chee explains that doing creative work as part of a community isn’t just about making connections with other people: It also involves making long-term commitments to the causes that are important to you and taking care of your community.)

#### Appreciate and Cultivate Your Creativity

Another tool to tap into your creativity is simple appreciation. Hendricks writes that **the more deeply you appreciate your creativity, the more freely you’ll be able to access and express it** —which is necessary for your happiness. According to Hendricks, you need to treat your creativity as you would a partner, one whom you value and want to keep around. When you express your appreciation for your creativity, you not only feel grateful for it but you also pay particular attention to it, tuning in to it and choosing to spend your time with it.

(Shortform note: Appreciating your creativity like a partner might help you cultivate it. Writer Kelly Link explains that you can think of your subconscious as a “Silent Partner” who continually supplies you with creative ideas. When you reject those ideas, then your Silent Partner becomes more hesitant to offer them to you. If you reject too many ideas, then it may stop offering them altogether. Link suggests learning to recognize and welcome ideas from your subconscious—and to ask for more. Then, your subconscious learns to generate more ideas that are exactly what you’d like to produce in your creative practice.)

When you tell yourself that you feel grateful for your creativity, you may need to **tune out negative thoughts** that tell you that actually, you aren’t grateful for your creativity, or maybe that you aren’t creative at all. Hendricks recommends simply acknowledging those thoughts and putting them aside to focus on deepening your relationship with your creativity instead.

(Shortform note: If you find that you have trouble ignoring negative thoughts, psychologists have identified some concrete steps you can take to let go of them. First, you can remind yourself that you aren’t your thoughts, and they’re only with you temporarily. You can also set a few minutes aside to listen to them and ask them why they’re there—and you just might get an answer. Another idea is to tune into the emotions you’re feeling so that you can understand what’s bothering you. Or, you can just thank your negative thoughts for trying to protect you.)

#### Commit to Spending a Specific Percentage of Your Time in the Genius Zone

Time commitments are another simple tool that Hendricks advises using as you pursue creative fulfillment. He recommends **considering how much time you want to commit to spending in your Genius Zone and setting a specific goal**. For instance, he suggests that you might want to focus on your genius for an hour a day, for half of your waking hours, or for all of your waking hours. By making a commitment to spending a portion of your day in the Genius Zone, you make room in your life for your creativity, in the capacity that makes the most sense for you.

(Shortform note: Though many of us can find an hour a day to dedicate to a new habit, Hendricks doesn’t comment on how you could make the more demanding commitment of dedicating half or all of your waking hours to the tasks in your Genius Zone. Other writers have raised the question of whether arranging your life around your passions is only within reach for people with an unusual amount of resources and privilege. In _The Trouble With Passion_ , sociologist Erin A. Cech explains that the advice to “follow your passion” perpetuates inequality by class, gender, and race. Cech argues that people need wealth and cultural capital to build a career around their passions, and even then, their passion may be exploited by employers.)

#### Set Goals to Measure What You’re Accomplishing in the Genius Zone

The final strategy that Hendricks recommends is to **set goals for your work in the Genius Zone**. He visualizes the Genius Zone as a spiral: It doesn’t have a ceiling and doesn’t impose limits on you, your creativity, or the amount of time you can devote to pursuing your genius. When you commit to spending significant amounts of time in the Genius Zone, you’ll progress toward higher expressions of your creativity.

Hendricks recommends taking some time to identify what your goals might look like. Because they function as milestones along your journey, Hendricks advises thinking about what you might want to accomplish in the next year, in five years, and by the end of your life. The idea is to think concretely about what it would look like for you to spend your time doing what you love and making a meaningful contribution to the world. For instance, you might set the goal of publishing an essay in the next year, writing a book in the next five years, and making a difference to at least a few readers with your body of work by the end of your life.

(Shortform note: Setting goals can help you work toward the things you want to achieve and track your progress, but only if you set the right ones. Some experts recommend creating goals that are “SMART”: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. They say that when you set goals, you should be positive but realistic and practice self-forgiveness when you fall short. By setting the right goals for your work in the Genius Zone, you can also connect what you do every day with what you want to achieve over time. Additionally, in _Who Will Cry When You Die?_ , Sharma recommends setting many goals related to your purpose. He asserts that by setting goals, you not only give yourself a plan but also find the agency to accomplish them.)
