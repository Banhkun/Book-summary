## Exercise: Find Your Genius

Hendricks writes that your genius is about the way you do the things you love and the attention that you devote to them, and that true creativity involves serving yourself and others with your creative gifts.

* * *

First, think about one creative task that you find exceptionally fulfilling. Maybe it’s a task where you become deeply absorbed in what you’re doing, something you’re very skilled at, or something that doesn’t feel like work to you. Write your task below.

Next, think about how spending more time pursuing this task could serve you. Maybe you’d find your days more fulfilling if you spent more time on your creative work. Perhaps you could get started on a goal you’ve always had or get paid to do creative work. Write down one or two ways that spending more time with this task could serve you.

Finally, think about how devoting more of your time and attention to this creative task could serve other people. How can you use your creativity to do something that’s valuable or meaningful to other people in your community? (Maybe you can put your skill to use working for a cause you care about or helping an organization you support.) Write down one or two ways that devoting more time to your creativity could serve others.
