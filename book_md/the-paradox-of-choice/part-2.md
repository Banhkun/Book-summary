## Part 2: Challenging Choices | Chapter 3: How and Why We Choose

In Part 1, Schwartz describes the proliferation of choice in market democracies and the categories of choices we face. Part 2 will examine how we make decisions, common mistakes we make, and how expanded choice hinders our decision-making and personal satisfaction.

Schwartz explains that making choices is always challenging—having a huge number of options just exacerbates the difficulty. **Decisions are challenging, in part, because each decision has many layers.** For example, think about choosing a city to live in. How much does it cost to live there? What are work opportunities like? Do you have friends or loved ones who live there, or would you have to spend a lot of time meeting new people? These are just a few questions you’d need to consider. A single large decision, then, can consist of many different small decisions to weigh against each other.****

In addition to confronting many layers, we also contend with psychological biases that often lead us to poor decisions. To provide a context for understanding how we go wrong, Schwartz first describes what the ideal decision-making process looks like.

### Steps to a Good Decision

Schwartz lays out several steps that go into making a careful decision:

  1. Determine your goal(s). 
  2. Consider how important each of your goals is. 
  3. Lay out your options. 
  4. Evaluate how each option can advance your goals. 
  5. Choose the best option. 



After you make your decision and put it into action, Schwartz recommends a sixth step of reflecting on the results of your decision and using what you learn to adjust future goals and the way you go about meeting them.

> **More Decision-Making Tips**
> 
> While Schwartz gives an overall framework for making decisions, here are a few more specific strategies:
> 
>   * Make a list of pros and cons, considering the future possibilities of each decision.
> 
>   * Do some relaxing activities to decrease decision-making stress.
> 
>   * Talk through your options with people you trust.
> 
>   * If you’re concerned about others’ reactions to your decision, think about how you’ll tell them the decision you made.
> 
>   * If the decision you’ve been leaning toward starts to feel wrong, take another look at your original options to see if any of them seem more appealing now.

### Why We Make Bad Choices

While the steps Schwartz describes may seem simple, we have thought processes that can get in the way of making effective decisions.

Schwartz describes five cognitive biases that hinder our ability to make decisions. He references concepts developed and researched by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky; many of those concepts are described in Kahneman’s book, _Thinking, Fast and Slow_.

#### 1\. Experienced, Remembered, and Expected Utility

We use our memories of past experiences to decide what we want in the future. **Our memories aren’t always reliable, so the goals we choose for the future are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions.**

Schwartz defines three concepts that explain how we use our faulty memories to make decisions: **experienced utility, remembered utility, and expected utility.**

  * **Experienced utility** is how an experience makes you feel _in the moment_ it occurs. If you attend a concert from your favorite artist and have a great time, then your sense of experienced utility tells you that this is a positive experience. 
  * **Remembered utility** is what you remember about an experience _after_ it occurs. This can differ from experienced utility, because we never remember events exactly as they occur. Schwartz cites Kahneman, who determined that we remember experiences based on: 1) how the experience felt at its absolute best and its absolute worst, and 2) how the experience felt when it ended. Our memory of experiences as they end is particularly skewed, since the ending isn’t reflective of the whole experience. Think about the concert example: If you got stuck in the rain as it ended, your memory of the experience would sour, even though you had a fantastic experience the rest of the time. 
  * **Expected utility** is how we make choices for the future based on past experiences. Remembered utility is faulty, so our expected utility isn’t always accurate. Because of the rain, we might not get tickets to another concert again anytime soon, even though the rest of the experience was positive. We also aren’t always good at determining what we’ll want far in the future. Because of the many weaknesses of using our memories to plan for the future, it’s easy to make errors when determining goals.



> **How Reliable Is Our Memory?**
> 
> While it’s true that our memories can be biased and skewed, scientists have had difficulty determining the extent of our memory’s reliability or unreliability.
> 
> For example, _Scientific American_ described a recent study showing that people’s memories were much more accurate than anticipated: When recalling events that happened two days ago, a study group described them with 90% accuracy, much higher than the 40% the researchers predicted.
> 
> Other studies have shown that, while memories tend to be strong soon after events occur, they diminish over time. Researchers are still studying how memory works, and how well, but understanding the likelihood that our memory can be strong in the immediate aftermath of an event and weaken over time can be helpful in decision-making.
> 
> For example, if you take a trip and are trying to decide whether to return next year, you might write down your thoughts immediately after the trip. Even if remembered utility biases you to consider your feelings at the end of the trip, you’ll still probably have a sharp memory of what happened at the beginning and middle.

#### 2\. Availability Heuristic

Another factor affecting how we recall information is which memories are most readily available to us.

Kahneman and Tversky coined the term **availability heuristic for our tendency to give greater weight to information we can easily recall.** If we can remember something easily, we generally assume it happens frequently or it’s important.

The availability heuristic can sometimes be accurate, since the frequency of an experience or event can make it stick in our memory. However, **the vividness of an experience can also make it stick in our memory regardless of how common or uncommon it is.**

For example, imagine a parent who is watching the local news a week before Halloween. He sees a report describing people slipping illegal substances into Halloween candy. He decides that, this year, he will check every piece of his child’s Halloween candy. Even though it’s extremely uncommon, the parent thinks it is likely that his child’s candy will be tampered with, because the news report he saw sticks so vividly in his mind.

The availability heuristic damages our ability to make decisions, because it can cause us to give importance to experiences or pieces of information that don’t really matter. Imagine you’re planning a trip, and you’re deciding between renting a house in two beach towns. You’ve researched online reviews from vacationers in both towns, and Town #1 has overwhelmingly positive reviews, while Town #2 has overwhelmingly negative reviews. You think you’ve made up your mind, but a friend tells you she took a trip to Town #2 and had a great experience. You then book a trip to Town #2 because her advice was more vivid to you than the negative online reviews. Unfortunately, the reviews were right, and you have a bad experience in Town #2.

**To counteract the availability heuristic, Schwartz recommends collecting information from a variety of sources and people.** Getting multiple opinions, many of which might be memorable, can help you make informed decisions even with this cognitive bias.

> **The Availability Heuristic and Media**
> 
> The media can significantly affect people’s perception of the frequency or prominence of certain phenomena—local media, for instance, frequently report on the risk of tainted Halloween candy, even though it almost never happens.
> 
> Another example of the availability heuristic being affected by media coverage is popular perceptions of crime rates. For years, most Americans have believed that the rate of violent crime is rising. However, data does not bear that out—in fact, violent crime has been decreasing since the 1990s. An article for FiveThirtyEight makes the case that the media has an important role in this misperception, as local news outlets tend to disproportionately cover violent crimes. People see memorable reports of murders in their community; because these reports are deliberately attention-grabbing, they skew people’s perception of violent crime.
> 
> By seeking out various news sources, as Schwartz recommends, we can become less susceptible to reports that are eye-catching but misleading.

#### 3\. Anchoring and Framing

Even when we gather information from different sources, we can be led astray by making faulty comparisons. Schwartz defines two methods of comparison: anchoring and framing. **Anchoring is using other items as reference points for comparison, while** **framing is using language to manipulate how people choose among options**.

Both buyers and sellers of consumer goods use anchoring. Consumers use it to help them narrow their options, and sellers use it to incentivize customers to buy their products. For example, James needs a new sweater for fall. He typically shops from sale racks at department stores, and last year he found a sweater for $20. Now, he’s looking for a new sweater using the price of his old sweater as a point of comparison (or anchor). If he finds a sweater that’s under $20, it’s a steal, but if he can only find sweaters above $20, he’ll find them expensive in comparison.

While James is using a cheap sweater as an anchor, someone who shops at high-end stores where most sweaters are over $100 would have a different anchor—to them, a $90 sweater would be a bargain.

Most stores also use anchoring to incentivize shoppers to buy products: If a store lists many items as on sale, shoppers will think they’re getting a bargain, no matter the actual price. Companies also sometimes make high-priced versions of their products that incentivize customers to buy the regular versions, which are inexpensive in comparison.

Besides anchoring, companies also use framing to incentivize consumers to buy particular products. For example, a bookseller may offer two batches of books, one of expensive hardcover editions, the other of less expensive paperback editions. If the seller wanted people to buy the hardcovers, he might frame or describe them as “special-edition hardcovers,” and the paperbacks simply as “paperbacks.” On the other hand, if he wanted people to buy the paperbacks, he could frame or present the paperbacks as a “special discount.” The products are the same in both scenarios, but the language the bookseller uses is meant to influence which product the shoppers buy.

Because of the psychological biases they prompt, **anchoring and framing can have significant effects on the decisions we make** , even though they have no bearing on the actual products or experiences they describe.****

> **“Nudging” People to Make Choices**
> 
> In their book _Nudge,_Richard H. Thaler and Cass Sunstein identified a method of influencing people’s decisions that can help to counteract the negative effects of anchoring and framing. (_Nudge_ also discusses other cognitive biases that Schwartz describes, including the availability heuristic.)
> 
> Thaler and Sunstein argue that everyone is susceptible to numerous cognitive biases when making choices, so those responsible for presenting choices should design them in a way that leads people to make beneficial decisions. The authors call this method of leading people to good choices “nudging.” For example, if the bookseller thinks the paperbacks are flimsy and poorly printed, he could frame the hardcovers as durable or top quality to give customers an incentive to purchase them. The bookseller would therefore lead customers to a superior product.

#### 4\. Prospect Theory

Building on their research on anchoring and framing, Kahneman and Tversky developed the concept of **prospect theory**. Like anchoring and framing, prospect theory describes how people choose among uncertain or risky options, and the role that bias plays in those choices.

The researchers noted that gains and losses have psychological effects influencing our decisions. As you make gains, you feel good, but as you continue making gains, the satisfaction you feel diminishes. Likewise, when you incur a loss, you feel bad, but as your losses increase, your dissatisfaction might not increase as much.

For instance, if you won $1 million at the lottery, you’d likely feel elated. If your winning were unexpectedly doubled, you might expect to feel twice as happy. However, you’d probably feel a little happier, but not much more than when you won your first million. Overall, the more you accumulate, the less additional happiness you’ll feel.

The reverse is also true: if you lost $1 million, you’d be unhappy. You’d be somewhat more unhappy if you lost $2 million, but the initial loss would feel worse than any additional loss would. Additionally, **people generally feel loss more acutely than gains, according to prospect theory** —so the person who lost $1 million would feel disappointment more acutely than the person who won $1 million would feel joy**.**

There is also a “neutral point” that determines what will feel like a loss or a gain: Anything better than the “neutral point” will feel like a gain, while anything worse than the “neutral point” is a loss. **This “neutral point” is arbitrary, and can be manipulated by anchoring and framing**. To extend the sweater shopping example, if a store normally sells a sweater for $40, but announces that it will be going on sale for $20, then your “neutral point” will be $40, and getting the sweater for $20 will feel like a gain.

Because our perception of gains and losses is not objectively accurate, our decision-making is affected by the risk aversion and manipulation of neutral points that prospect theory describes.

> **Two Modes of Thinking Affect Decisions**
> 
> Kahneman and Tversky influenced Schwartz’s ideas in _The Paradox of Choice_ —their prospect theory helps explain the biases that come into play when we’re overwhelmed with choices.
> 
> In _Thinking, Fast and Slow, _Kahneman argues that people have two modes of thinking: System 1, which encompasses automatic reactions and processes, and System 2, which encompasses deliberate and conscious thinking. System 2 can get overwhelmed, which can lead to System 1 taking over our decision-making processes and making us more vulnerable to cognitive biases. Kahneman contends we should aim to balance System 1 and System 2 thinking in our decision-making.
> 
> Prospect theory describes the biases inherent in System 1 thinking: The psychological impacts of gains and losses, and the impulse to make decisions based on an arbitrary reference point, are automatic perceptions that we don’t consciously engage with. Schwartz would likely argue that when we’re faced with too many choices, our capacity for System 2 thinking is diminished, as it will eventually take too much energy to make choices.

#### 5\. The Endowment Effect and Sunk Costs

The _endowment effect_ explains how and when we feel losses.

Because of the endowment effect,**** once you have something, you feel that it’s yours, or you “own” it. This applies even if you’ve only possessed it for a short time. Once you’ve “endowed” an item or experience with your ownership, giving it up even after five minutes will feel like a loss. The endowment effect influences when we feel something is a “loss,” in accordance with prospect theory.

**The endowment effect amplifies our aversion to _sunk costs_ , **which can become losses**.** Sunk costs are resources you’ve already spent or invested and can’t recover. For instance, you might buy tickets to see a favorite actor in a Broadway play, then learn that an understudy will be performing the role that day. Since you “owned” the tickets per the endowment effect, you might feel compelled to see the show anyway in order to avoid a sunk cost.

Sunk costs are a particular concern for those who prioritize avoiding losses. While there’s no logical reason to do something that won’t benefit you or that you don’t want to do just to avoid feeling that you’ve “wasted” your money, an aversion to sunk costs (or a sunk cost bias) is psychologically powerful.

> **How Much Do You Care About Sunk Costs?**
> 
> The sunk cost aversion affects most people to some extent, but some people are more susceptible to it than others. If you’re not sure how much you consider sunk costs when making decisions, this short questionnaire evaluates how susceptible you are to this bias. The questionnaire consists of several sample scenarios. For example, one scenario asks you to imagine that you’ve spent a long time on a project that doesn’t have much hope of succeeding, and while you can’t take back the time you spent on it, you have the opportunity to begin a promising new project. If you answer that you’d prefer to stay on with the unsuccessful project, it’s likely you’re susceptible to the sunk cost bias. The more decisions like this you make in the other sample scenarios, the more likely it is that you struggle with sunk costs.
> 
> The questionnaire was created by economists David Ronayne, Daniel Sgroi, and Anthony Tuckwell, who also detailed their methodology in a _Harvard Business Review_ article. They found that **those who have substantial experience making decisions are less likely to be susceptible to sunk costs** than those who don’t. So while most people struggle with sunk costs once in a while, you’ll likely become less influenced by them with time and experience.

### How Expanded Choice Complicates Decision-Making

We’ve discussed how numerous psychological biases make choices challenging. Schwartz describes three major ways that expanded choice adds to the challenge:

**1\. More options means more effortful choices.** When there are more choices to make, and more options to choose from in each given choice, the time and energy it takes to make an informed decision dramatically increases.

(Shortform note: Effortful choices lead to decision fatigue. Signs that you’re dealing with decision fatigue include procrastination, impulsive decisions, indecision, and avoidance. If you’re experiencing decision fatigue, try taking some time to rest before making decisions, making a list of decisions in order of priority, and asking people you trust for their input.)

**2\. With too many choices in front of us, it’s easy to make bad decisions.** When too many choices demand our attention, we can’t carefully consider each choice, so we’re more likely to make bad choices.

This might not matter when choosing what to make for dinner or what TV show to watch. But there can be long-lasting consequences if you don’t take the time to make decisions in more important areas. For instance, if you buy a used car without adequate thought, you could end up driving an unsafe vehicle.

(Shortform note: Research shows that it’s particularly easy to make a bad decision when you’re in an anxiety-inducing situation, or the decision has the potential to be rewarding. For example, you may be more likely to make a bad choice at work if you’re overwhelmed by your job, and you might be more likely to make a bad choice about a romantic partner if you find that person exciting and attractive. If you’re struggling with a decision, try asking yourself these questions to prevent a negative outcome: 1) What’s the worst thing that could happen?, and 2) How would I feel if the worst did happen?)

**3\. Since having more choices is more stressful, the psychological consequences of a bad choice can be more severe.** We all make choices that don’t turn out the way we expect. But when you spend a lot of time making a choice and it turns out badly, you’ll probably feel worse than if you’d chosen quickly.

Schwartz contends that because of the difficulties and pitfalls of facing too many choices, **many people fall into a particular bad habit: making most of their choices indiscriminately, without considering options or consequences.** People who make decisions in this haphazard way can be called “guessers,” while those who generally think through their decisions are “deliberators.”**** Everyone has to “guess” and “deliberate” sometimes, but habitual guessing leads to habitual bad decisions.

> **Choice and System 2 Thinking**
> 
> Schwartz’s description of guessers and deliberators echoes the two types of thinking Kahneman describes. System 1 thinking is automatic, while System 2 involves conscious thought—so when we guess we use System 1 thinking, and when we deliberate we use System 2 thinking.
> 
> These systems help explain how the psychological difficulties caused by expanded choice get in the way of effective decision-making. System 2 thinking weakens when we feel overwhelmed, stressed, or tired, and we then use System 1 judgments to a greater extent—and since cognitive biases are an effect of System 1 thinking, this can cause us problems.
> 
> Expanded choice, then, can cause us to make poor decisions because it exhausts our System 2 thinking.
