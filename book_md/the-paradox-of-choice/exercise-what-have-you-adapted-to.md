## Exercise: What Have You Adapted To?

You’ve probably had a pleasurable experience that’s eventually worn off. Think about how you respond when this occurs.

* * *

Reflect on an exciting experience you had, or a purchase you made. When did the excitement begin to wear off? How did you react?

Think about something in your life that you’ve adapted to, but that you’re still grateful for. How does this aspect of your life make you feel? And how will you practice gratitude for this more regularly?

Think about a purchase or experience you’re planning. How do you expect it’ll make you feel? When you begin to adapt to those feelings, what can you do to avoid the hedonic treadmill of continually searching for more exciting experiences?
