## Chapter 10: Choice and Depression

In this chapter, Schwartz examines the negative psychological consequences of choice in more detail. **He argues that expanded choice is a factor in rising rates of depression, and that depression can be particularly likely for maximizers.**

Schwartz discusses the effects of optimism and pessimism on choices, the influence of expanded choice and an individualistic culture on depression, and a possible link between depression and maximizing tendencies.

### The Effects of Optimism and Pessimism

In his earlier discussion of learned helplessness, Schwartz argued that a loss of control causes negative psychological consequences, such as an inability to choose. He expands on this point, adding that**our subjective responses to loss of control influence how we fare psychologically.**

While a loss of control alone may not cause depression, it can spur thought patterns that do. Schwartz identifies three binaries that determine how we respond to failures and losses of control:

  * **Global vs. specific:** Imagine you’re a college student who failed an exam. A global response would be, “I’m terrible at exams, so of course I didn’t pass,” while a specific response would be, “This was a particularly hard exam; I failed because the professor included questions I never expected.”
  * **Chronic vs. transient:** In the same scenario, the chronic response would be, “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to pass an exam,” while the transient response would be, “I failed this exam, but it was a fluke. I’ll study harder and pass the next one.”
  * **Personal vs. universal:** The personal response would be, “I bet nobody else had this much trouble; I failed the exam because I’m a failure,” while the universal response would be, “The professor didn’t write a fair exam, and I can’t imagine anybody had an easy time taking it.”



**Global, chronic, and personal responses are pessimistic, while specific, transient, and universal responses are optimistic.** If you frame every failure as a result of your personal inadequacy, without much you can do to improve, you’re more likely to develop depressive tendencies. On the other hand, if you view your failures as isolated incidents largely due to external circumstances, you can more easily move past them.

With this in mind, Schwartz observes that blaming yourself for all of your perceived failures and losses of control causes psychological damage. He also notes that, in an expanded choice society with innumerable options, it’s a lot easier to blame yourself for choices that fail.

> **The Benefits of Optimism**
> 
> Optimism can help improve your mental health, so if you tend to be pessimistic, learning how to think optimistically will benefit you. Earlier, we discussed Martin Seligman’s concept of “learned optimism,” which shows that people can learn to be optimistic by choosing to view difficulties as specific, transient, and universal.
> 
> In his book _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman discusses the positive effects of optimism. According to Goleman, optimistic people tend to be motivated, flexible, and goal-oriented, seeing failure as something to overcome rather than something that defines them. He also cites research suggesting that optimism can lead to strong performance in college, more so than high SAT scores.

### Depression and Society

While our responses to losses of control can shape our mental health, Schwartz argues that **our society sets us up for psychological trouble through excessive choice and overemphasis on individualism.**

Middle-class Americans (and those in comparable market democracies) technically have more control and choice than ever before. Yet depression and suicide rates have risen consistently, especially among young people. Since feeling in control is linked to mental health, this can seem contradictory.

However, Schwartz believes that rising depression and general unhappiness are linked to rising expectations of choice and control. As we’ve become accustomed to great degrees of control over our lives, we expect even more control. Since our expectations are high, we’re increasingly likely to be disappointed. Schwartz points out that societies where people have less control have not seen rising rates of depression comparable to countries like the U.S., suggesting that their lower expectations for control may play a role in determining their overall satisfaction with life.

Along with control, individualism and personal responsibility have been rising as cultural values. As a result, we are taught to seek excellence, and when we fail, it becomes easy to blame ourselves, even when we aren’t totally in control of our circumstances. The national preoccupation with thinness and weight loss is an example of this: Though none of us are totally in control of our appearance and weight, our culture has convinced us that we are.

Another negative consequence of individualism is fraying social ties. Schwartz has already discussed the positive health benefits of strong social ties. Since individualism now takes precedence over social ties, he argues that more people have become isolated, causing dissatisfaction and loneliness.

> **Rising Rates of Depression**
> 
> Since the book’s publication in 2004, depression in the United States has continued to rise. This is particularly notable among young people, as 15.08% of American youth experienced a major depressive episode in 2019, a 1.24 % increase from the previous year.
> 
> Based on Schwartz’s ideas, it makes sense that an individualistic culture can lead to a greater likelihood of depression. There’s even evidence that people who live in collectivistic societies are genetically less likely to experience depression.
> 
> Rising depression, however, cannot solely be attributed to the issues of an overload of choice and reliance on individualism that Schwartz focuses on. Numerous other societal issues can impact mental health—for example, people who belong to groups that experience oppression or discrimination tend to have higher rates of mental health issues. Among them, L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more likely to experience depression than cisgender and heterosexual youth, and young girls are more likely to experience depression than boys.

#### Individual Success vs. Social Failure

Schwartz adds a caveat to this conclusion: **Individualism, heightened control, and expanded choice can strongly benefit certain individuals.**

Everyone is distinct psychologically, and certain people are well-suited to meet these values and create fulfilling lives for themselves. However, even if some individuals thrive, Schwartz contends that this does not negate the broader social damage incurred by these values.

> **Happiness, Individualism, and Consumerism**
> 
> In his 2018 book _The Happiness Fantasy_ , Carl Cederström argues that those who promoted individualism and expanded choice are most likely to benefit from them.
> 
> Cederström contends that counter-cultural movements in the 1960s popularized the ideas of self-fulfillment as a path to happiness. This perspective was co-opted in the following decades by corporations, who geared their marketing toward the promise of individual fulfillment, while political leaders perpetuated the idea that individualism and consumerism can lead to happiness. Cederström doesn’t believe that contemporary ideas of individualism, consumerism, and uninhibited freedom of choice lead to happiness, although they underlie the idea of happiness in Western societies.
> 
> Corporations stand to benefit the most from values like individualism and freedom of choice in the market, so it’s logical that they shaped these ideas. Cederström also notes in an interview that, anecdotally, the people he found who were most satisfied with this vision of happiness were men. While Schwartz writes that individuals who thrive with individualism and expanded choice are basically anomalies, Cederström would likely argue that they stand to benefit most from these values: Essentially, they’re the people and groups who have the most power socially.

### The Link Between Depression and Maximizing

**As one might expect, maximizers seem likely to experience depression** because of two characteristics that make them susceptible: impossibly high expectations, and a tendency to blame themselves for any decision that doesn’t satisfy them.

Schwartz argues that maximizers are more likely than the average person to experience depression as a result. Bolstering his point, Schwartz points to studies he’s conducted that indicated that people with maximizing tendencies tend to score higher than the average person on assessments of depression.

> **The Science Behind Depression and Maximizing**
> 
> Schwartz found the link between depression and maximizing in a 2002 study he conducted with several other researchers. They provided the participants with a questionnaire measuring their maximizing tendencies, and they found that those who scored high were also likely to experience depression, in addition to heightened regret and decreased happiness and optimism.
> 
> While this doesn’t definitively establish that maximizing is the _cause_ of these experiences, Schwartz believes they’re linked. The dissatisfaction that maximizing causes, then, goes beyond decision-making and may significantly impact psychological health.
