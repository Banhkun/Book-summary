## Exercise: How Has Expanded Choice Affected Your Decisions?

Schwartz argues that the overwhelming number of minor choices we make every day causes unnecessary stress. Reflect on how youâ€™ve handled a situation where you had many options to choose from.

* * *

Describe a recent instance where you had to make a consumer choice and had numerous options available to you. What were some of these options?

How did you feel about these options? What were some of the differences between them that you struggled with? How much time did you spend deciding?

How did you make the decision, and how did you feel afterward?
