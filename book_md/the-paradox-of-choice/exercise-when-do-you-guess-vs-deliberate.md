## Exercise: When Do You Guess vs. Deliberate?

Decisions can be overwhelming and stressful, so it can be tempting to be a guesserâ€”that is, to choose indiscriminately.

* * *

Describe a time when you chose an option by guessing, instead of thinking about your alternatives. Why did you take this approach?

Do you think this approach was effective? Why or why not?

On the other hand, describe a time when you deliberated before choosing. Why did you spend time making the decision?

What was the effect of taking time to make your choice?
