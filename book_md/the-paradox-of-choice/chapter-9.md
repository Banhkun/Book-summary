## Chapter 9: Pitfall #4—Comparison

Schwartz posits that **one reason we may feel regret or disappointment in our choices is that we compare them with others’ choices** to gauge whether we’re choosing well.**** Too much comparison, especially social comparison, can lead us to bad judgment in our decision-making.

In this chapter, Schwartz lists common comparisons we make, discusses the effect of high expectations on our comparative decision-making, and describes why social comparison can be one of the most damaging kinds of comparison.

### Common Comparisons

Schwartz identifies four common types of comparisons we make in order to judge our decisions:

  1. We compare the results of our choices against our _hoped-for outcomes_. 
  2. We compare the results against our _expected outcomes_.
  3. We compare the results against our _recent experiences_. 
  4. We compare the results against _others’ experiences_.



These comparisons can make our choice seem better or worse, depending on what we’re comparing it to. When our choice seems worse in comparison, we sense gaps between what we wanted and our outcome.

Schwartz cites social scientist Alex Michalos, who identified three types of gaps:

  1. The gap between what we want and what we have. 
  2. The gap between what our peers have and what we have.
  3. The gap between the ideal outcomes and experiences of the past and what we have now. 



Schwartz also adds a fourth: The gap between what we expect and what we have. He added this gap because he believes many people have become accustomed to high-quality experiences and goods, leading to disappointment when something doesn’t meet our high standards.

The comparisons we make to judge our choices, and the gaps we feel between the outcomes of our choices and alternative outcomes, create regret and stress.

> **Closing Professional Gaps**
> 
> Schwartz focuses on how to mitigate the impact of comparison on our thinking, but sometimes these comparisons and gaps can help us acknowledge what we want in our lives: If a choice doesn’t live up to expectations, or we feel that we don’t have what we truly want, we can sometimes take steps to reach what we aim for.
> 
> Our professional life is an area where we might make comparisons and see gaps. Ways to close the gap between what you want and what you have include taking on stressful tasks instead of avoiding them, prioritizing your work, and holding yourself accountable.

#### Neutral Points

Neutral (or reference) points, an aspect of prospect theory discussed in Chapter 3, shape how we make comparisons, potentially causing disappointment.

Schwartz explains that when we make comparisons, we use neutral points to guide our decisions: They can be past experiences, imagined outcomes, others’ experiences, and so on. However, these points of comparison are anything but neutral. For instance, if we set an unrealistic neutral point, we might be disappointed with the experience we have.

Remember the example of James, who was shopping for a sweater? He was looking for a sweater that was $20 or less, because $20 was the reference point he had set. Another shopper might have a reference point of $50, or $100, depending on their income and the quality of sweaters they’re used to buying. James would be disappointed if he could only find sweaters that were over $35, but the shopper used to $100 sweaters would be thrilled if he found a $35 sweater he was happy with.

As explained earlier, reference points are different for different people, so disappointment stemming from this comparison is subjective.

> **_Thinking, Fast and Slow_ and Reference Points**
> 
> In _Thinking, Fast and Slow,_ Kahneman elaborates on how reference points factor into the way we choose subjectively among alternatives (prospect theory).
> 
> The endowment effect, or the sense that something is “yours” even if you’ve only had it for a short time, creates new reference points: You quickly get used to the idea of owning something, and the fact of your ownership becomes your new reference point. This is why it feels like a loss to give up something that you’ve had for even a brief time.
> 
> Similarly, when we set goals, they become reference points—even when they’re arbitrary. Because of this, we feel that we’ve gained something when we reach a goal, and we feel that we’ve lost something when we miss the goal.
> 
> Kahneman acknowledges the inherent bias and unreliability of reference points, yet he also underscores that reference points affect the way we all live our lives and make decisions. So when making choices, keep in mind that you’re likely comparing your options against a reference point that may or may not be helpful.

### High Expectations

Schwartz argues that **the gap between what we expect and what we have is exacerbated by expanded choice.**

As noted earlier, with expanded choice, we have higher expectations (or reference points) for goods and experiences. This is especially true for maximizers, who are almost guaranteed to feel disappointment in their choices because their reference points—imagined ideal outcomes—are unrealistic.

**Schwartz recommends lowering our expectations to reduce disappointment and increase pleasure.** Experiences that are exceptionally pleasurable should be exceptions rather than the rule. For instance, you might save a bottle of expensive champagne for New Year’s Eve (a special occasion), instead of drinking it whenever you feel the impulse. Our expectations become easier to meet, and truly great experiences become all the more pleasurable when they happen infrequently.

> **The Burden of High Expectations**
> 
> High expectations can cause issues in various areas of our lives. In the _Harvard Business Review_ , CEO Peter Bregman writes about how holding high expectations for himself and others led him to unnecessary dissatisfaction and hurt his relationships. Because of his high expectations, he’d been overly hard on himself for occasionally being indecisive, and he’d been harsh toward his daughter for occasionally acting impulsively.
> 
> Bregman concludes that compassion for yourself and others can ease the burden of high expectations. This can also apply to decision-making. For instance, a maximizer’s expectations might be so high that they’re overly critical of themselves for making a choice that falls short. A maximizer could lessen this difficulty by understanding that not every decision they make is perfect and accepting occasional mistakes in their decision-making.

### Social Comparison

**In market democracies, social comparison—comparing ourselves to others—affects decision-making the most** , according to Schwartz. As with counterfactuals, we can compare ourselves to others positively or negatively. For instance, if you’re the first in your college graduating class to get a full-time job, you may feel accomplished in comparison to your peers. However, if you’re passed over for a promotion later, you may feel inferior to colleagues who were promoted.

Schwartz explained earlier that upward counterfactuals often make us feel worse, while downward counterfactuals make us feel better. This is often true, as well, with upward and downward social comparisons—but not always. For instance, you might feel good if people whom you know and like do well; on the other hand, you might feel bad if people you know are much worse off than you are.

Another distinction between the experience of counterfactuals and social comparisons is that we have less control over the latter. Social comparisons are an unavoidable aspect of society and daily life, and as such we have little to no control over them. While we can control the counterfactuals we imagine to a certain extent, we can’t always help comparing ourselves to the people we see and interact with every day.

> **Upward and Downward Social Comparison**
> 
> Whether we make upward or downward social comparisons depends on the circumstances. Upward comparisons are more likely when the comparer makes them privately, does not think of themselves as inferior, and is personally invested in the positive characteristics of the person they’re comparing themselves to. On the other hand, downward comparisons are more likely when the comparer feels that their identity or well-being is vulnerable, as downward comparisons boost self-esteem.
> 
> While Schwartz has argued that, with exceptions, upward comparisons make people feel better and downward comparisons make people feel worse, some researchers think that the emotional effect of social comparisons depends almost entirely on the individual. For example, if your best friend gets a promotion at her job, you might feel happy for her, even if you’re not satisfied with your job. On the other hand, if another friend of yours gets fired from his job, you might feel bad for him, instead of feeling happy that you’re better off.

#### Status and Positional Competition

Schwartz notes that a motivating factor behind social comparison is the desire for status. However, **achieving status is difficult in a society of expanded choice:_Everyone_ has more ways to accrue status, so it’s harder to get ahead. **

For example, people have traditionally sought status within their own social circles. Yet social media platforms to which everyone has access have widened the arena.

One way people try to gain or express status is through positional competition: competing among others for scarce resources or positional goods, such as a luxury car or a room at a 5-star hotel. By accruing positional goods, you gain social status. However, as more people try to attain them, it becomes more competitive.

Schwartz argues that society encourages us to compete for scarce resources. Status and positional competition motivate us to compare ourselves and our choices to others’, yet ultimately, scarcity makes this pursuit profoundly unsatisfying.

> **Social Status and Games**
> 
> Accruing status is a common goal throughout life and society. For instance, in _A Theory of Fun for Game Design_ , Raph Koster details how social status affects game playing.
> 
> Koster writes that the drive to achieve social status is common across games of all kinds. The clearest example of how you can achieve social status through games is that many have winners and losers—the drive to win a game indicates a desire for status. Some games, such as Monopoly, also involve jockeying for territory or property.
> 
> Since all people attempt to attain social status to some extent in their daily lives, it makes sense that it would also play a role in escapist activities.

#### Maximizing

While social comparison and the drive to accrue status cause challenges for everyone, Schwartz notes that, once again,**** maximizers suffer the most acutely because of their drive to have the best.

Schwartz cites research showing that **those most likely to be negatively impacted by social comparison are generally unhappy people and maximizers**. When given a task, these people were only happy when they found they were doing better than others, and they were unhappy when they were doing worse than others, regardless of their actual skill.

Schwartz notes that it is unclear whether maximizing causes people to be unhappy, or unhappiness breeds maximizing tendencies, but it’s likely that both are true. It may seem contradictory that maximizers are impacted by social comparison: In their quest for “the best,” it may seem improbable that they’re concerned with what other people have. However, you can only really determine what “the best” is by comparing the outcomes of your choices to those of others. A maximizer might buy something because they believe it’s better than a similar product their friends own.

> **Social Media, Social Comparison, and Maximizing**
> 
> Social media encourages people to make constant social comparisons, which can be harmful psychologically.
> 
> Because people tend to post idealized images of themselves on social media, users make frequent upward comparisons. When subjected to a constant stream of images that cause upward social comparison, people may experience depression, lower self-esteem, and negative body image. These results are particularly strong for those who are pessimistic.
> 
> If a maximizer sees a stream of images of people doing better, it likely will make them more unhappy than a satisficer would be, since maximizers are more affected by others’ success.

#### Expanded Choice

**Schwartz contends that expanded choice makes social comparison both more common and more emotionally difficult.** When presented with more options than we know what to do with, it’s natural to look to the results of others’ decisions for guidance.

And since social comparison tends to make you feel worse, judging your choices by the choices of others is likely to do the same.

> **Dealing With Social Comparison, Expanded Choice, and Social Media**
> 
> Thanks to social media, we have endless opportunities to feel inferior to other people. Here are a few tips for avoiding the negative effects of social comparison:
> 
>   * Avoid comparing yourself to the most exceptional people you can think of.
> 
>   * Target your social comparisons to people you think you could learn something from.
> 
>   * Reflect on the positive attributes of your life.
> 
> 

> 
> Some social media-specific strategies you could try are to unfollow people who cause you to make stressful social comparisons, or limit the amount of time you spend on social media each day.
