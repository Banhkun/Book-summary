## Exercise: Train Your Brain

You can use your brain’s neuroplasticity to your advantage in creating new skills or building new knowledge. Apply the principles of incremental learning and massed practice to enhance your neural pathways and learn a new skill.

* * *

Identify a skill you want to develop or improve—playing an instrument or a sport, for example.

Next, write down smaller tasks that you can do in massed practice (in short, concentrated bursts) to increase your skills incrementally. This might look like learning to play scales on a guitar, or learning how to throw a football. Subsequent steps might be learning arpeggios, then simple songs on the guitar, or learning to catch, then learning to kick a football.

Finally, note when you’ll practice these incremental skills and for how long. Write down the more advanced tasks you’ll practice later, so you have a full plan of how to master that skill.
