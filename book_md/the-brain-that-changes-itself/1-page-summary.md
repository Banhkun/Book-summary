## 1-Page Summary

In _The Brain That Changes Itself_ , Norman Doidge explains that the brain is plastic, meaning it can change its own structure and connections in response to stimuli. This contrasts with the long-held belief that the brain is hardwired from an early age.

Doidge explains how the brain’s plastic nature can be used to improve outcomes for people suffering from severe brain damage or congenital brain disorders by restoring cognitive, sensory, and motor functions that have been lost or impaired. His book conveys complex ideas in a way that a layperson can understand and illustrates them through stories of real people whose lives have improved thanks to the power of neuroplasticity.

Doidge is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst and the best-selling author of _The Brain’s Way of Healing Itself_. _The Brain That Changes Itself_ has sold over one million copies in over 100 countries.

In our guide, we’ll first look at what neuroplasticity is and how it works, as well as the history of the concept’s development. We’ll also look at the potential applications of neuroplasticity for improving people’s lives and treating brain damage and disorders that once seemed untreatable. Finally, we’ll examine some of the negative effects neuroplasticity can have. We’ll also add updated and supplemental scientific research to further explain and expand upon the book’s concepts.

### What Is Neuroplasticity and How Does It Work?

**Doidge defines neuroplasticity as the brain’s ability to grow and reorganize itself in response to stimuli**. Your brain is your processing center, and your brain’s structure and processes can change based on external or internal triggers to improve your brain’s performance and efficiency.

(Shortform note: The phenomenon of neuroplasticity means that, despite what we previously thought, our intelligence and ability levels are determined more by our environment than by our genes. Evidence also suggests that teaching children they have the power to change their own brains helps them learn better—particularly at-risk students.)

How do these changes in your brain happen? Doidge explains that the brain is made up of _neurons_ , or nerve cells, which send signals to each other to produce every one of the brain’s functions. Neurons are separated by tiny spaces called _synapses_. When one neuron sends a signal to another neuron, it releases a chemical called a _neurotransmitter_ into the synapse. The neurotransmitter then travels to the next neuron and delivers it a message.

Neurons can send and receive two types of messages: signals that cause other neurons to fire and signals that make other neurons less likely to fire. Neuroplastic change occurs **when a specific type of signal is sent between neurons again and again, so that a pathway is formed between them, which makes them more likely to fire in that same way in the future**.

According to Doidge, the more a pathway is used, the more efficient it becomes. This is why practicing something a lot—using the same neural pathway—makes it easier to do. This also means that pathways that are _not_ used frequently are less efficient, which is why doing something new or that you’re not used to doing can be so difficult.

For example, if you're right-handed, you're more likely to use your right hand for most things you do because that neural pathway is well-established. However, if you want to increase your skill with your left hand, you can practice using it for those activities, and as the pathways controlling your left hand become stronger, you'll become more skillful with that hand. This is what Doidge means by neuroplasticity: your brain’s ability to change your thoughts, abilities, and behaviors by forging new neural paths.

> **The Second Step of Neuroplasticity: Insulating Our Brain’s Pathways**
> 
> Doidge’s description of the role of neurons in neuroplasticity is extensive, but it may only be part of the neuroplastic picture. The new neuronal pathways created by learning new information or skills are like uninsulated electrical wires—they can successfully transfer their electrical signals, but research suggests this transference isn’t made efficient until a sheath of a fat called myelin forms around the pathway. This sheath insulates the pathway so that energy doesn’t leak out as electricity travels through it. The more myelin that forms around the pathway, the more efficient it becomes.
> 
> This process—called myelination—is responsible for the development of what we call muscle memory, which is when a skill becomes so ingrained that you can do it without consciously thinking about it. This is how your new skills and ideas become long-term or permanent memories, or how you might go from consciously forcing yourself to use your non-dominant hand to being fully ambidextrous. Because myelination occurs on such a large scale in the brain but consists of so many micro-components, it's very difficult to study, so its role in neuroplasticity has only recently been recognized.

### How Did the Concept of Neuroplasticity Develop?

Neuroplasticity wasn’t always considered valid in the field of neuroscience or related fields like psychology and biology. According to Doidge, the concept of the brain as plastic wasn’t taken seriously in the scientific community until around the 1960s. Instead, the brain was thought of as a machine with distinct parts designated for different functions. **This was called _localizationism_ and suggested the brain wasn’t capable of significant structural changes**.

Neuroplasticity only became an accepted concept after many years of research provided the foundation for how the brain can change. In this section, we’ll examine localizationism and explore the evolution of our understanding of the brain, from mapping the areas of the brain with the functions they perform, to the critical period of neuroplasticity in infants, to the natural ways our brains change, and finally to how this information can be applied to modern treatments.

> **Harmful Worldviews Stemming From Localizationism**
> 
> While some of the principles of localizationism—for example, that certain functions tended to be controlled by certain parts of the brain—were correct, the belief that localizationism was universal and inflexible is what led to the dismissal of neuroplastic concepts. Additionally, it led to the founding and validation of the pseudoscience of phrenology, or the belief that brain function can be examined by studying a person’s skull. This was based on the assumption that the structure of the brain shaped the skull.
> 
> The concepts of phrenology have been debunked, but before that it was often used as a justification for racism, particularly in the United States. In the 1800s, certain scientists used studies of phrenology to claim that Africans’ brains made them inherently more prone to subservience and caused them to need a master to control them. Others used it to argue that white people were a separate species from other races like Native Americans and used this claim to justify land theft, colonization, and genocide of Native American tribes.

#### Early Beliefs: Localizationism, or the Machine-Like Brain

According to Doidge, localizationism was first proposed in 1861 by Paul Broca after he observed a patient who had a stroke and afterwards was unable to say anything except one word. Broca dissected the patient’s brain after death and found that the patient’s left frontal lobe was damaged. When dissections of other patients who had suffered speech loss also showed damage to that same area of the brain, it provided evidence for the idea that speech was controlled by the left frontal lobe specifically.

These observations were generalized, leading to a belief that, because certain areas seemed to control certain functions, those areas were the only ones that could ever control those functions, and that severe damage to one location meant those functions were lost forever.

> **Broca’s Inaccurate Picture of the Brain**
> 
> Broca’s discovery laid the groundwork for future neurological research, but its scope was very limited, which led to an incomplete picture of speech in the brain. The speech issue that Broca discovered in these stroke patients is known as aphasia, and strokes are the most common cause of aphasia. Aphasia impairs speech processing, but another common speech impairment, dysarthria, results from damage to the parts of the brain that help control the muscles involved in speech.
> 
> If Broca had studied speech issues in patients with neurological conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or cerebral palsy instead of focusing on stroke patients, he might have instead concluded that the area responsible for speech is the basal ganglia, which is where dysarthria comes from.

This belief in the machine-like brain is part of why neuroplasticity wasn’t studied deeply until the second half of the 20th century. Another reason is that scientists didn’t have the technology to study the living brain at a microscopic level. They could dissect the brain during an autopsy, but they couldn’t examine the brain’s functions in real time until the development of electrode technology.

(Shortform note: The first use of electrodes to study the brain in a human while awake was in 1874, which led to the 1929 discovery of electroencephalography by Hans Berger, a method that gave scientists the ability to detect and diagnose things like seizures and brain tumors by recording the brain’s electrical activity.)

Doidge says a final reason neuroplasticity wasn’t seen as a valid theory was that people with severe brain damage almost never fully recovered, while damage in other parts of the body _could_ be fully healed. Since the body could completely recover from a cut on the hand, the body was viewed as plastic, but the brain was viewed as unchangeable.

(Shortform note: The idea that the brain was unchangeable wasn’t the only misconception about the brain that came from observing brain-damaged patients. Scientists around this time also found that people who received severe damage to certain areas of the brain like the corpus callosum showed no symptoms of impairment, so they concluded—falsely—that large portions of the brain had no function. This may have led to the modern myth that we only use 10% of our brains.)

#### Developing a Map of the Brain

According to Doidge, **scientists developed a “map” of the brain that showed which areas seemed to control which functions**. If every function had a specific location in the brain, then scientists should be able to pinpoint those locations and their related functions—and they did. By using electrodes attached to living patients’ brains, experimenters were able to detect the location of electrical activity from certain stimuli. Though these brain maps were developed based on localizationism, they became very useful in the study of brain plasticity, as we’ll see later.

Wilder Penfield created the first full brain map by using an electric probe to manually activate certain areas of the brain and asking the patient what sensations they felt in response. For example, if he activated a place in the brain, and in response the patient said they felt pressure in their right foot, he would note that area as being associated with the right foot. Over the course of these procedures, he formed a map of the entire brain. Because the brain has no pain receptors, patients were able to stay awake during these types of brain surgeries so they could respond to Penfield’s questions.

(Shortform note: While Penfield’s use of electrodes led to the revolutionary development of the full brain map, the technology had other applications that were more questionable. Electrodes can be used to detect electrical activity, but also to provide electrical stimulation. In the 1950s and 60s, a scientist named Robert Heath implanted electrodes in a number of patients’ brains, sometimes without their full informed consent, and used them to perform various experiments. The most controversial of these was his use of electrodes to attempt to convert a gay man to heterosexuality, a practice now known to be not only ineffective but extremely harmful.)

Initially, Doidge says, electrodes could only measure brain activity on a large scale, detecting activity in thousands of neurons at once. Later, scientists developed microelectrodes that allowed them to view electrical activity at a microscopic level. Microelectrodes were so small they could be placed beside a neuron and monitor the activity there in response to stimuli like being touched.

Scientists could see that neurons that were physically near each other corresponded to body parts that were also physically near each other—for example, neurons controlling movement of the index finger were near neurons controlling the middle finger. The maps created in this way are even more detailed than modern brain scanning technology, but because the process is so tedious and time-consuming, it's rarely used.

> **Today’s Brain Scanning Technology**
> 
> Modern brain mapping is usually done using electroencephalograms (EEGs), which involve placing a cap containing electrodes on a patient’s head and measuring the brain’s electrical activity through their scalp. Another method is magnetic resonance imaging, which shows not only the brain’s electrical activity but also an image of the structure of the entire head and its parts, including bones, blood vessels, fat, and muscle. Though these scans aren’t able to detect neuronal activity on a microscopic level like microelectrode mapping, they're also much less invasive since they don’t require surgery and can be performed in as little as 20 minutes.
> 
> This mapping technology gives us the ability to measure neurons’ response to stimuli and their roles in things like motor function and language processing, but it's not yet advanced enough to study how higher level thinking or behaviors occur in the brain—things like attention or lying. Unfortunately, some companies ignore these limitations in order to make money and will claim to have technology that can use brain imaging to analyze consumer behavior or detect lies, which isn’t possible with our current technology.

#### Discovery of the Critical Period: Plasticity in Infants

The research into brain mapping led to the discovery of the _critical period_ in a person's or animal's early development. According to Doidge, **the critical period is a span of time in infancy when our brains are absorbing immense amounts of information and developing connections at an extremely high rate**. This is the period when our brain maps are first being built.

Continued research showed that during the critical period, unused parts of the brain can change themselves to perform functions different from their original functions. However, the belief was that once this critical period was over, the brain was set in stone for the rest of our lives.

(Shortform note: There are actually several critical periods of brain development that humans go through throughout their childhoods. The human brain develops rapidly even while we're in the womb, as a pregnant person’s stress levels have been shown to impact their fetus’s brain development—further evidence that the brain continues to develop and isn’t set in stone.)

Scientists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel discovered the critical period by using electrodes to study the development of the visual cortex in kittens. When they sewed one eyelid shut during the kitten’s critical period (three to eight weeks), then later unsewed it, they found that the brain map for vision in that eye never developed—the cat remained blind in that eye for the rest of its life. However, they also found that the part of the cortex that would have processed input from the shut eye rewired itself to process input from the eye that was left open. This showed that the brain _was_ capable of structural change, or plasticity, but Hubel and Wiesel believed that this plasticity ended once the critical period was over, and that the brain maps were then hardwired for the rest of the creature’s life.

(Shortform note: Hubel and Wiesel’s experiments showed that sensory deprivation during the critical period could keep a sense from developing at all, but new research suggests sensory deprivation can also be used in adulthood to restore a sense that didn’t develop correctly. In another experiment using kittens, specifically those with impaired or lost vision in one eye, scientists found that immersing the kittens in total darkness for ten days caused their visual centers to revert to a level of plasticity similar to the critical period, allowing them to regain their vision in the impaired eye. Researchers believe this is because the nonuse of the visual system for ten days destabilized the established visual system, allowing it to rebuild itself completely.)

#### Learning How Maps Change: The Competition for Brain Space

It was clear now that, at least in infancy, the brain was capable of restructuring itself in response to something like the loss of a sense. According to Doidge, further studies involving brain mapping showed that **brain maps constantly change, even without interventions like removing input from a sense or part of the body**. Mapping an animal once and then doing so again months later showed changes in the maps every time, indicating that our brains change in the normal course of our lives.

(Shortform note: Early maps showed us the location of things like bodily functions and sensory perception and processing in the brain, but more recent research has allowed us to pinpoint where newly-learned concepts appear in the brain. Studies showed that when a group of people all learned the same new concept, the same regions of their brains were activated, showing exactly where that learning was taking place. Not only was this a big step forward from just mapping functions and sensory processing, it also showed that _everything_ we learn causes permanent changes to our brains—which helps explain why repeated brain scans show that maps are constantly changing.)

One experiment using monkeys showed that the brain wasn’t “hard-wired” to have a specific structure, indicating that the brain must be plastic. In the experiment, scientists disconnected the monkey’s nerves that control their thumb and forefinger, then reversed them. But the nerves reorganized themselves so that the monkey could still control its thumb and forefinger just as well as before.

Additional research led to the discovery of _competitive neuroplasticity_. According to Doidge, this means if a nerve stops working (is cut), the area of the brain that is connected to that nerve doesn’t just waste away. Instead, since the brain only has so much mass to perform all its different functions, the nerves that still work will use that leftover brain space, showing that there’s competition for limited resources within the brain. If you don’t use an area of the brain for its original purpose, it may be taken over by other functions you _do_ still use.

To discover this, researchers again used monkeys as test subjects: They disconnected the nerve that controls the middle of the hand, or the median nerve, so that it wouldn't receive any input from the middle of the hand. As expected, when the middle of the monkey’s hand was touched, the brain area connected to the median nerve no longer lit up. However, touching other areas of the monkey’s hand that were controlled by different nerves _did_ cause that brain area to light up, meaning that brain area was now being used to detect input from those other nerves.

> **Competitive Plasticity and Human Development**
> 
> Competitive brain plasticity may help explain why humans lack certain senses that other animals have, such as infrared vision or ultrasonic hearing. If these skills weren’t necessary for our survival, our brains never made space for them, so our species never developed them. Humans have greater cognitive capacity—and often larger brains proportional to our body weight—than animals and therefore need more bodily resources to sustain that cognitive capacity.
> 
> This higher cognitive capacity and the large brains required to store it may also explain why humans are born helpless compared to so many other creatures. While some animals like horses and chickens are able to stand and walk immediately after birth, human babies are born so weak they can’t even lift their heads. Scientists believe this is because of different gestational periods—while horses, for example, are pregnant for 11-12 months, human infants must be born around the nine-month mark in order for their heads to fit through the birth canal, which is smaller in humans because we’re bipedal.
> 
> Additionally, being pregnant increases a person’s metabolic needs, and research suggests that a human’s metabolism wouldn’t be able to sustain a fetus past nine months of pregnancy. Therefore, our high cognitive capacity requires much more development post-birth compared to most other animals.

#### Training the Brain: Applications for Restoring Function

As we’ve seen, research showed that the neural connections in the brain were changing constantly and that they could even move around in the brain or disappear entirely depending on the functions demanded of the brain. According to Doidge, this meant that new connections must be forming between neurons that weren’t previously connected. Scientists realized that **the brain’s ability to form new connections meant they might be able to treat or even cure things like learning disabilities and severe brain damage** by training the neurons to fire in a more desirable way.

(Shortform note: The ability of brain maps to disappear entirely can cause us to lose certain abilities or skills, and these losses may be accelerated by our growing technology. The human brain has a lot of space devoted to navigation, for example, but since the invention of GPS, people have been using that part of their brains less. This has led our mental navigation systems to become less active, and consequently, other abilities like spatial awareness and certain types of memory are becoming weaker. Scientists are researching ways that GPS technology could be modified so that we can still use it to find our way around while also practicing the navigation skills that strengthen our memory and spatial awareness.)

According to Doidge, a series of experiments by Edward Taub proved that **we can train neurons to control a body part that doesn’t have sensory input.** The experiments involved _deafferenting_ the arms of monkeys: cutting sensory nerves so that the brain didn’t receive any sensation from the arms. Previous experiments with deafferenting monkeys showed that if one arm was deafferented, the monkey would only use the healthy arm, leading scientists to believe that motor control was dependent on sensation—once the neural connections for sensation were disconnected, the neural connections for movement became unusable.

Doidge says that Taub discovered the reason a monkey with one deafferented arm would begin using the healthy arm exclusively was because of _learned nonuse_. After surgery on the spinal cord, the neurons have trouble firing correctly—a condition called _spinal shock_ , which results from damage to the spinal cord and usually lasts two to six months. An animal in spinal shock will try to use its deafferented arm, but because the neurons aren’t firing well, it will frequently fail to get the response it wants and eventually give up trying. It will learn to not use its deafferented arm and to use only the healthy one instead, thereby reinforcing only those neural pathways to the healthy arm while the pathways to the deafferented arm fall into disuse.

(Shortform note: Since spinal shock is the result of damage to the spinal cord, it usually only occurs in those who’ve experienced a severe spinal cord injury. Deafferentation is performed by cutting the nerve right where it connects to the spinal cord, so this is why deafferentation would result in spinal shock while most surgeries and procedures would not.)

> **A Global Definition of Learned Nonuse**
> 
> While the phenomenon of learned nonuse is well established in the medical field, scientists are still working on creating a clear definition of learned nonuse that would apply across all scientific disciplines and an objective way to diagnose it. Experts suggest that it’s characterized by a difference in the brain’s ability to _deliberately_ perform a motor function on demand and its ability to perform that function _spontaneously, that is,_ without a conscious effort to use a body part that is harder to use. In other words, someone experiencing learned nonuse of the right arm can _deliberately_ pick up a glass with their right hand, but they wouldn’t reach for it _automatically_ with their right hand—they’d use their left.
> 
> Since things like which arm we favor to perform certain tasks is often an unconscious choice, eliminating learned nonuse first requires a _conscious_ effort to use the affected body part instead of compensating with a body part that has no functional impairment.

However, further experiments showed that learned nonuse could be prevented by restraining the deafferented limb until spinal shock wore off, because while the arm was restrained the monkey wouldn’t try—and fail—to use it, so once the restraint was taken off, it soon used its arm just like it had before surgery.

(Shortform note: We can infer from Doidge’s description that the reason a monkey can still use its limb after restraining it during spinal shock is that it’s aware of a physical constraint restricting its movement, so it doesn’t try to use it. The neural pathways for that limb therefore remain in place and the monkey doesn’t learn that the limb doesn’t work, as it would if it tried _and failed_ to move an unrestrained limb.)

Taub also found that learned nonuse could be corrected if he forced a monkey to use its deafferented arm by restraining the healthy arm, and that it could even be corrected years after the deafferentation was performed. This had major implications for stroke victims who had lost movement in certain body parts, as we’ll see in the next section.

(Shortform note: While correcting learned nonuse can restore the use of an impaired body part, research suggests that if it’s done too soon after injury, it may do more harm than good. Experiments on animals showed that restraining the healthy limb immediately after an injury could cause _forced overuse_ , which can result in increased brain damage and hinder recovery. It’s possible there is an optimal period for this type of therapy after a stroke or injury that would provide the greatest gains without exacerbating the problem.)

### How Can Neuroplasticity Improve Our Lives?

Doidge says that neuroplasticity means we can change our brains to suit our needs. This has resulted in huge developments in neuroscience that have helped many people recover motor, sensory, and cognitive functions they had lost. Let’s look at some instances of such recovery.

#### Help for Stroke Patients

According to Doidge, Edward Taub used his research with monkeys to develop a treatment for regaining motor control called _constraint-induced movement therapy_ , or CI therapy. If a patient loses the ability to use one of their arms—a common result of strokes—**this therapy re-teaches them to use it by constraining their good hand**. Being forced to use their affected hand in everyday activities causes the brain to rewire itself to make those movements possible and then easier.

(Shortform note: New technology is being developed that could complement or substitute for Taub’s CI therapy: Scientists have created a virtual reality interface that allows stroke patients to “practice” performing everyday activities. Using their brain to control an artificial hand, the patients can see themselves performing these tasks, and the activities are shown to retrain their brains to use their impaired limbs or body parts similarly to the way Taub’s therapy retrains the brain.)

Taub’s therapy regimens are founded on three principles: training with activities we do in everyday life is more effective; training should be incremental; and training is most effective in _massed practice_. This means the training should be done in short, concentrated periods, which is more effective than training over a long period of time with less frequency.

(Shortform note: Massed practice appears to be effective specifically in reorganizing the brain to use an impaired body part. However, research suggests that for learning more complex tasks, massed practice may be less effective than distributed practice, which is carried out over a longer period of time with more breaks in between practice sessions. Distributed practice also seems to be more effective for learning and retaining new information and knowledge.)

#### Help for Patients With Balance Loss

Because plasticity can allow the brain to substitute one sense for another, it can also help someone to regain a lost sense such as balance. Balance, or the _vestibular sense_ , tends to weaken as we age, leading to more frequent falls. Balance issues can also occur from brain damage.

In order to restore a patient’s sense of balance, neuroscientists use a device called an accelerometer to stimulate the patient’s tongue according to the movement of their head, letting them sense a change in their balance through the sensations on their tongues.

When patients use this device, **new connections form between their balance system and their tongue**. This provides a residual effect, so even when they take off the device, their new balance system keeps going for a while. The more and longer the device is used, the longer the residual effect, and it can eventually become permanent, fixing the patient’s balance issues entirely.

> **Other Solutions for Balance Issues**
> 
> In addition to the accelerometer Doidge describes, scientists have developed other devices and methods of substituting another sense for a patient’s sense of balance.
> 
> Part of our ability to balance comes from fluid canals in our ears that let us know if our bodies are moving or leaning in a given direction. Inner ear diseases and infections can interfere with this system. For balance issues resulting from inner ear damage, researchers are studying technology that could retrain the brain’s balance system by applying electrical stimulation to the ears’ fluid canals in response to the body’s movement using a prosthesis or implant.
> 
> Other researchers are working on developing a type of insole that would apply small vibrations to the soles of the feet to help detect changes in movement. This treatment could be particularly effective in patients who have sensory loss in their extremities, as research has already established that these types of vibrations can help restore sensation in the feet.
> 
> A third type of technology being developed uses sound to substitute for the vestibular sense: It detects a person’s movement and makes a sound when they lean in a certain direction. The patient can tell if they’re leaning forward or backward by the pitch of the tone, and they can tell left from right depending on which ear they hear the tone in. The tone grows louder the further they lean.

#### Help for Patients With Phantom Limbs

Doidge says people with _phantom limbs_ can also benefit from neuroplastic intervention. The term phantom limb refers to a sense of still having a limb that has been lost. So, for example, if you’ve had a leg amputated, you may develop a phantom leg that you can still feel as if the real leg were there. You may feel pain, pressure, or other sensations like itching, and you may also feel the physical sensation of moving that leg even though it’s not there anymore.

Some amputated limbs feel like a dead weight—like the limb is still there but is paralyzed or frozen. This happens because a limb is often immobilized with a cast or sling for a long time before the amputation. Scientists believe that the brain continues to send motor commands to it, only to receive no response to show that the limb is moving. Then, once the limb is amputated, the brain map that developed while it was immobilized—where the brain sends signals and the limb doesn’t respond—becomes fixed, and the brain continues to feel like the limb is there but is frozen or paralyzed.

Phantom pain works similarly. The brain continues to send commands to the amputated limb but receives no response, so the commands increase. The brain tries so hard to move the amputated limb that it causes the pain that your brain associates with trying too hard to move it (like how your hand hurts if you clench it too hard). According to Doidge, 95% of people who have a limb amputated suffer from long-term phantom pain.

To eradicate phantom pain, a device called a mirror box, developed by Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran, allows a patient who’s lost an arm to “see” their phantom arm by mirroring their good one. The box has two sections divided by a mirror. The patient places their existing arm into one section of the box and is then told to imagine putting their phantom arm into the other section. They then watch the reflection of their good hand and arm moving, which makes it look like their other arm is moving as well, and soon this causes them to feel like their phantom arm is moving along with the reflection. This ability to “move” their phantom arm helps relieve the pain they’re feeling, and over time, use of the mirror box can make the feeling of the phantom limb go away entirely.

(Shortform note: Ramachandran’s mirror box has proven to be very effective in treating phantom arms and pain, but new virtual reality technology may provide a solution that is more accessible and effective than the mirror box. By wearing a pair of VR goggles and a glove, plus electrodes on the stump of the missing limb, patients can not only see their missing limb being used as they play various games that involve both hands, they can also feel it thanks to the stimulation provided by the electrodes attached to their stump. Further research seeks to expand this technology to be applicable to lower body amputations as well.)

> **Leftover Brain Maps and Phantom Pain**
> 
> The phenomenon of phantom limbs seems to fly in the face of what we know about neuroplasticity and the brain’s ability to rewire itself in response to changes: If we lose one of our limbs, it seems the brain should reorganize itself so that the maps devoted to controlling that limb become dormant or disappear entirely. However, research has shown that our brains can retain their maps for a missing hand for over three decades after the loss of the hand. While the reason for this isn’t fully understood, it may be useful in the development of brain-controlled prostheses, as the brain may be able to adapt to such a prosthesis with minimal retraining.
> 
> Phantom pain also seems to be directly linked to these retained maps: The stronger the brain’s representation of the missing body part, the more intense phantom pain they experience. In many cases of severe pain from phantom hands, the brain’s representation of the missing hand is just as clear and strong as the representation of their remaining hand. However, there also seem to be fewer connections in these patients between the representation of the missing hand and the rest of the brain, so while the brain’s image of the hand remains strong, it's often out of sync with the rest of the brain.

#### Help for Patients With Learning Disorders

Neuroplastic research may even allow us to “cure” learning disabilities, asserts Doidge. **By studying what areas of the brain are affected by a disability, we can create specific types of mental exercises to strengthen those areas and treat the disability**. People who struggle with speaking, reading, and writing often have issues in their premotor cortex, for example, and can benefit from exercises that strengthen that part of the brain. These might include tracing exercises, which involve tracing complex characters or lines to stimulate the neurons in the premotor cortex. People who have issues with auditory processing—understanding and remembering spoken information—may benefit from memorizing poems and stories.

(Shortform note: The idea that learning difficulties stem from individual parts of the brain has been well established, but recent research suggests this premise might be flawed. Instead, according to a recent study, these difficulties seem to come from poor connections between different parts of the brain. This suggests that learning disabilities are less the result of a single part of the brain struggling to process information and more the result of the brain having difficulty sharing information between different brain areas. Though this conflicts with Doidge’s explanations, it may help explain why something like speech can be improved through tasks as seemingly unrelated as tracing unfamiliar characters.)

A regimen like this is highly individualized. Doidge suggests that providing all children, regardless of disability, with an individualized plan that targets their weak areas could vastly improve their education and abilities later in life.

He also suggests that implementing these plans early can make a big difference, because otherwise the child will often attribute their weaknesses to “stupidity,” start to dislike learning, and avoid the activity they struggle with, which prevents them from getting stronger in that area.

(Shortform note: Doidge’s suggestion that all children would benefit from individualized learning that focuses on their unique needs and gifts is supported by research into both learning disabilities and giftedness. Research shows that students whose learning disabilities aren’t accommodated experience stress from their academic struggles at school, and students whose giftedness isn’t accommodated experience understimulation. Both situations can lead to behavioral problems and a dislike of school, and both can be avoided through more personalized education like what Doidge describes. Unfortunately, personalization requires a great deal of resources—more than are currently available to public schools in the US.)

### Drawbacks of Neuroplasticity

Unfortunately, brain plasticity may have downsides, says Doidge. Because, as we’ve discussed, plasticity is competitive, **when one area of the brain becomes unused, it’s likely to be taken over by other functions that are used regularly**. This can make it difficult to break bad habits because using the pathways involved with those habits not only strengthens them, but also weakens the pathways that are _not_ used by the bad habit.

(Shortform note: This pattern of engaging in a bad habit, strengthening that habit, and weakening good habits can create a harmful feedback loop: Any time a habit is triggered, you’re more likely to engage in that habit, which further reinforces the association of that habit with that same trigger. To break this loop and the bad habits it entails, experts recommend quitting bad habits cold turkey so you stop reinforcing them and then replacing them with good habits so those pathways get strengthened instead. If quitting cold turkey is too difficult or dangerous, you can still replace the bad habits with good ones using incremental steps.)

This also applies to learning a second language: The reason adults have more trouble learning a second language than children do is that the areas of their brain that process language are already being used to process their first language. It therefore takes more practice for an adult than for a child to create new pathways in that area to correspond to a second language. It’s easier to learn a second language while you're acquiring your first language because the map of neural pathways for language widens to include both languages as they develop at the same time. However, when you’re learning a second language as an adult, that new language has to develop a brand new neural map rather than incorporating it into the first language’s map.

(Shortform note: Other research suggests that learning a language in childhood may be easier because of _brain lateralization—the tendency of the brain to use either the left or right hemisphere more than the other in certain processes_. Experts say that, during the critical period in childhood, the brain is able to use both hemispheres in learning language because it's more plastic, whereas in adulthood, that learning would likely be specialized to the left hemisphere, which may reduce its connection to other parts of the brain and thus make learning harder.)

Doidge also suggests that neuroplasticity could be responsible for excessive worry and disorders like obsessive compulsive disorder. As your brain continually plays through anxiety-inducing scenarios, those pathways become stronger, which means you worry about them even more.

Though it may be the cause, Doidge also says that neuroplasticity could be the _cure_ for excessive worry and obsessive compulsive disorder. Therapy that involves reframing the worrisome thoughts into something positive, or distracting yourself with something positive, can help weaken the worry pathways that have become so strong.

(Shortform note: Other research into obsessive compulsive disorder suggests that distraction from worry may not be as effective as thinking about your worry through metacognition. Rather than diverting your attention away from your obsessive thoughts, metacognition based on doubt therapy is designed to make you more comfortable with the uncertainty underlying those thoughts—for example, if you compulsively wash your hands because you always doubt they’re fully clean, this therapy would give you step by step instructions for becoming more comfortable with the idea that your hands might not be fully clean. While the approach is different, this method would also weaken the brain pathways involved in worry.)
