## 1-Page Summary

Some children get angry quickly and are remarkably stubborn. For parents of these children, dealing with their behavioral issues can be draining at best and extremely disruptive to home life at worst. Drawing on his experience with long-term behavioral problems, clinical child psychologist Ross W. Greene outlines a method for addressing these “explosive” children in _The Explosive Child_. By using open communication and collaborating with your child, Greene says, you can stop dealing with outbursts as they happen and start preventing them from happening in the first place. Our guide covers his method in four parts:

  * **Part 1: Understanding Explosive Children** discusses common myths about the causes of outbursts and Greene’s explanation of why they really happen.
  * **Part 2: Managing Outbursts** outlines common strategies parents use to manage outbursts and Greene’s opinion on each.
  * **Part 3: Preventing Outbursts** explores Greene’s suggestion that prevention is key for addressing long-term behavioral problems.
  * **Part 4: Common Challenges** lists challenges parents may face when using Greene’s methods and details how to overcome them.



Through our commentary, we’ll compare Greene’s strategies to psychological research and advice from other parenting experts.

### Part 1: Understanding Explosive Children

Greene defines “explosive” children as children who have frequent and severe _outbursts_ :**moments of heightened frustration, anger, and inappropriate behavior.** Behaviors during an outburst might include extended screaming fits, physical violence, or shutting down entirely.**** All children have outbursts occasionally, but explosive children have them often enough to overwhelm or even endanger themselves and their families.

(Shortform note: Greene describes his method as a way to deal with problems counselors have been unable to address, but he doesn’t view it as a _replacement_ for counseling. In fact, one of the main functions of Greene’s non-profit Lives in the Balance is to work with pediatricians, counselors, and other mental health professionals. So, while the method covered in this guide is helpful to a great extent, if you’re in a situation where your child is showing particularly concerning violent or aggressive behaviors, know that there is nothing wrong with getting a mental health professional involved.)

Before you can address your child’s outbursts, Greene explains, you must first understand why they happen. To this end, Part 1 of our guide will walk through common _myths_ about the causes of outbursts and then outline Greene’s explanation of why they really happen.

#### Common Myths About Outbursts

Greene focuses his arguments on two common myths about outbursts:

##### Myth #1: Outbursts Are Planned

The first and**most significant myth Greene challenges is that children can behave if they want to, but they “choose” to have outbursts** —planning them or using them to get what they want. Greene explains that in reality, outbursts are sudden and intense emotional experiences that are very unpleasant for a child. Just as no adult would willingly choose to become extremely upset or strategically plan when they’ll become extremely upset, children don’t _want_ to have outbursts and don’t plan them ahead of time.

For example, Liz has outbursts frequently but tends to regret them afterward. She doesn’t like getting angry or being punished for her behavior, and after calming down she feels guilty about what she said and did to her parents—people she loves—in the heat of the moment.

(Shortform note: Some child psychologists disagree with Greene, claiming children _do_ sometimes use outbursts as a tool to get what they want. However, these experts argue this behavior is learned—when parents repeatedly give children what they want in order to stop outbursts, their children will begin to associate bad behavior with getting their way. In addition, these children won’t learn how to manage their emotions and behaviors to get what they want, since outbursts already get them their way.)

##### Myth #2: Outbursts Are Inevitable

Second, Greene dispels the myth that **there’s nothing parents can do about outbursts.** This myth often uses medical diagnoses to claim a child is and always will be unstable and prone to outbursts regardless of what their parents do. This myth fails to understand these diagnoses properly, explains Greene. Diagnoses are just checklists of symptoms or behaviors—they aren’t definitive or permanent, and parents can work to address specific symptoms to improve their child’s behavior.

For example, Liz has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). She frequently loses things and then has outbursts when she realizes they’re missing. While losing things _is_ a common symptom of ADHD, Liz’s parents can teach her to double-check that she has everything before leaving the house, helping to prevent outbursts related to lost items.

(Shortform note: The idea of behavioral problems having concrete diagnosable causes is partially based in the _medical model of psychology_ —the idea that just like physical illness, behavioral problems or mental illnesses originate in the body and can be specifically diagnosed and treated. Much like Greene, critics of the medical model believe it oversimplifies human psychology, ignoring or even discounting the role of learned behaviors or social environment in contributing to symptoms of mental illness.)

#### What _Actually_ Causes Outbursts

If outbursts don’t come from manipulative children or diagnoses, then why do they happen? What causes them? Greene explains that outbursts have two required components: a practical challenge and a lack of the executive skill needed to meet that challenge.

##### 1) A Practical Challenge

The first component of an outburst is simple: **A child has trouble with something practical, like doing a specific task or following a specific rule.** All people, children and adults alike, face practical challenges throughout their lives for any number of different reasons. For example, Liz has great difficulty getting out of bed in the morning.

(Shortform note: Not all outbursts are rooted in specific tasks or challenges—some are caused by a physical response to overstimulation. These _meltdowns_ are particularly common in children on the autism spectrum, and while they __ may seem similar to other outbursts—involving a child shutting down or lashing out—they are based on the body becoming overwhelmed instead of on emotions. Resolving meltdowns therefore requires getting a child away from the overwhelming stimuli rather than addressing practical challenges.)

##### 2) A Lacking Executive Skill

A practical challenge alone isn’t enough to cause an outburst, however.**A child must also lack an important _executive skill_ : skills crucial for self-control and functioning in everyday life**—like patience, emotional management, or flexibility. Most people can use these skills to cope with practical challenges productively—they could persevere in spite of their struggle, take a break to calm down, or try using a different approach, for example.

On the other hand, a child who lacks executive skills might not know _how_ to approach a practical challenge and might be unable to communicate this to their parents. When their parents then tell them to complete these challenges, the child will get frustrated with their inability to do anything and have an outburst. Meanwhile, since the child can’t communicate what they’re going through, their outburst might look like willful disobedience to an outside observer. While all children sometimes experience this frustration, an “explosive child” struggles with more executive skills and therefore has more outbursts.

For example, Liz’s brother Bobby has trouble getting out of bed in the morning but also has the executive skills to express his needs and solve problems ahead of time. He asks his parents for a space heater so his room isn’t cold and then has an easier time getting up. Liz, on the other hand, struggles with these same executive skills. So when her parents tell her she has to get up, she feels like she _can’t_ , is unable to __ explain that to her parents, and has trouble managing how frustrated that makes her—all of which lead her to have an outburst.

> **Executive Function**
> 
> While Greene refers to the abilities listed above as “life skills,” we’ve chosen to call them executive skills because they closely correlate with _executive function_ : a set of mental processes used in self-management and decision-making first theorized by psychologists in the 1970s. Executive function includes skills in three main categories:
> 
> **Planning and organization:** The ability to break down tasks into individual steps. Skills in this category include problem-solving, setting and prioritizing goals, and time management.
> 
> **Focus and memory:** The ability to manage what you’re paying attention to in the moment. Skills in this category include starting or changing tasks without procrastinating, keeping multiple pieces of information in mind, and flexibility.
> 
> **Self-control and self-awareness:** The ability to understand and manage your thoughts and feelings. Skills in this category include impulse control, emotional management, and self-reflection.

### Part 2: Managing Outbursts

After explaining the main components of outbursts, Greene discusses the pros and cons of three common strategies parents use to manage outbursts.

#### Strategy #1: Demand

The first strategy Greene discusses is to make demands of your child using one-way communication—**you make a decision independent of your child and then expect them to obey.** For example, Liz’s parents tell her to get out of bed by 8 a.m. If she fails to complete this practical challenge, they don’t give her dessert in the evening. These are both decisions Liz’s parents made on her behalf.

##### Pros of “Demand”

Greene says the strategy of making demands is often **crucial in the heat of the moment when your child is putting themself or others in danger.** For example, grabbing your child to keep them from running into traffic and demanding they stop is not only appropriate but necessary.

(Shortform note: While a “demand” style of parenting can help with safety in specific instances or in the short term, psychological research shows continued use of this parenting style can often cause children to rebel against authority figures later on and engage in riskier behaviors, making them less safe than they would otherwise be.)

##### Cons of “Demand”

While the “demand” strategy isn’t inherently good or bad, explains Greene, it often doesn’t work on explosive children in the long term. Remember, children have outbursts when they struggle to complete a practical challenge—simply demanding they complete it _won’t_ address the real issue. However, it will often make them defensive or more frustrated if they lack the executive skills to communicate their difficulty or understand your perspective.

(Shortform note: While Greene argues a “demand” strategy of precise rules and punishments is often ineffective in the long term for dealing with explosive children, he doesn’t offer a larger critique of this parenting style. However, some parenting experts—notably, those associated with the “gentle parenting” movement, like Alfie Kohn (_Unconditional Parenting_)—view “demand” styles of parenting as counterproductive and even harmful for all children. According to Kohn, strict rules and punishments subconsciously teach children that their parents only love them if they behave. This makes children more likely to develop low self-esteem and become depressed as they grow older.)

#### Strategy #2: Delay

Another strategy for managing outbursts Greene discusses is to delay dealing with the issue. **This isn’t giving up on practical challenges, but rather prioritizing what you deal with and when**. For example, Liz has trouble completing two practical challenges: getting out of bed in the morning and clearing her plate after eating. Her parents decide the former is more important, so they delay dealing with the latter to avoid extra outbursts and tension in the meantime.

##### Pros of “Delay”

The “delay” strategy is useful when you need to de-escalate an outburst in progress or when you just don’t have the emotional energy to address an issue. Don’t feel like this strategy means giving up—after all, your child was _already_ failing to complete these practical challenges when you were still trying to enforce them. The delay strategy just means fewer outbursts and power struggles while you focus on bigger issues.

(Shortform note: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, the delay strategy can also help you get a better perspective on the issues you’re facing. Often, our problems can seem much bigger in the moment than they do after only a few hours or days, so putting off a problem temporarily can allow you to come back to it once it seems more manageable.)

##### Cons of “Delay”

**This strategy doesn’t work in the long term either** —your _ultimate_ goal is for your child to be able to overcome all their practical challenges, and delaying on its own doesn’t help with this.

(Shortform note: Consistently delaying dealing with behavioral problems can also hamper your child’s development and well-being. Psychological research shows that lax, “permissive” parents tend to have lower-achieving children with worse impulse control. This is because, without structure or responsibilities, children never have to learn how to control themselves or manage their time.)

#### Strategy #3: Discuss

So far, we’ve seen two strategies that work as short-term solutions but fail to address long-term behavioral problems. To solve these long-term problems, Greene suggests a third strategy of **working collaboratively with your child to determine what’s triggering their outbursts and how to fix it.** You accomplish this by discussing their outbursts in an attempt to understand their perspective, communicate your own perspective, and come up with a solution. (We discuss this process in detail in Part 3.)

##### Pros of “Discuss”

**This strategy is best for addressing your child’s behavioral issues in the long term,** explains Greene.**** By discovering the practical challenges and missing executive skills that lead to your child’s outbursts, you can address them and prevent outbursts from happening altogether—eliminating behavioral problems and helping your child complete their practical challenges.

##### Cons of “Discuss”

Greene acknowledges this strategy often doesn’t work when your child is already upset or having an outburst, as they won’t be able to communicate while their emotions are heightened.

> **The Psychology of Discussing Outbursts**
> 
> To better understand the psychology behind the “discuss” method, we can look to the authors of _The Whole Brain Child_. They describe people’s brains as having two main parts: The “upstairs” brain is responsible for higher thinking and reasoning, and the “downstairs” brain is responsible for primitive and impulsive responses. Children, they explain, have stronger downstairs brains that can shut out their upstairs brains—this is what causes them to have impulsive emotional reactions like outbursts. Parents therefore have to teach children how to integrate their upstairs and downstairs brains so they work together.
> 
> Discussing their behavioral problems allows them to do just that: Your child uses _upstairs_ brain higher thinking to explain the _downstairs_ brain emotional response that led to their outburst. Distinguishing between upstairs brain and downstairs brain thinking also helps explain why discussions don’t work when your child is upset—their downstairs brain is in control when their emotions are heightened, meaning they can’t perform the upstairs brain task of speaking with you until they’ve calmed down.

### Part 3: Preventing Outbursts

As we noted in Part 2, Greene contends the “discuss” strategy is best for addressing long-term behavioral problems. In Part 3 of our guide, we’ll outline the four main steps of this strategy: **prepare topics, gather information, share your perspective, and brainstorm solutions.**

#### Step #1: Prepare Topics

Before discussing outbursts with your child, Greene says **you should prepare two lists, one for each component of an outburst:**

##### 1) Practical Challenges

Make a list of the specific tasks your child has trouble completing and the rules they have trouble following. Don’t frame this in terms of their problem behaviors—prevention requires focusing on what _causes_ outbursts, not on what happens _during_ outbursts. For example, Liz’s parents would list “Has trouble getting out of bed in the morning.” They _wouldn’t_ write down “Screams at us when we tell her to get up.”

(Shortform note: It can be difficult to deemphasize your child’s problem behaviors, especially when those behaviors are hurtful to you. If you’re struggling with this, try to avoid taking their behaviors personally—as previously discussed, children don’t _want_ to disobey you and manipulate you into feeling a certain way. They’re just having their own emotional struggles and lack the self-control to manage everything they say. Making the effort to stay objective and focus on _just_ their practical challenges now will pay off with fewer hurt feelings later on.)

##### 2) Lacking Executive Skills

Make a list of the executive skills your child might be lacking. Greene provides his own list you can use as well. He frames these missing skills as “difficulties” your child faces rather than as problems with their behavior. Note that you won’t be using this list for discussion topics with your child—it’s just for your own reference to try and contextualize your child’s outbursts.

(Shortform note: Noting your child’s lacking executive skills can also help you understand the full scope of their struggles and how those struggles impact their development in different ways. Psychologists have been able to link struggles with executive functioning to anxiety, depression, and even physical health problems due to increased stress. This makes it especially important that you not only accurately list your child’s lacking executive skills, but that you also work to develop them over time—which Greene’s method is designed to do.)

#### Step #2: Get Your Child’s Perspective

Once you’ve created your lists, Greene says you can discuss practical challenges with your child beginning with the ones that cause the most outbursts or conflicts. Your goal in these conversations is to **understand your child’s perspective on their practical challenges and outbursts.** Greene acknowledges this isn’t always an easy process—kids often don’t fully understand their own feelings, and they might resist talking about their behavior—but by approaching your child openly and working with them, you’ll eventually discover the causes of their outbursts.

(Shortform note: Instead of just asking your child what causes their outbursts, some parenting experts suggest you also keep track of your child’s behaviors leading up to an outburst. By taking the initiative and paying attention to when and where outbursts occur, you’ll learn important information about your child’s behaviors. This information may then reveal productive starting points for your discussions.)

Greene offers two guidelines for conducting these discussions with your child:

##### 1) Ask Specific Questions

Greene explains that your questioning throughout the discussion should focus on the specific circumstances behind practical challenges—allowing you to change or avoid these circumstances later on, preventing outbursts. To do this, **ask your child a lot of what, who, where, and when questions, like:** What is challenging or frustrating? Who makes you upset? Where and when do you tend to get upset? What were you thinking about in the moments leading to the outburst? For example, Liz’s dad asks _what_ Liz doesn’t like about getting up in the morning or _when_ she finds it easier or harder to get up.

> **Circumstance, Thought, and _Then_ Action**
> 
> Though it might seem like the circumstances of a practical challenge directly cause your child’s outbursts, there’s more going on than first appears. These circumstances, also known as behavioral triggers, are actually connected to specific ways of thinking rather than specific ways of acting. These thoughts are the “middle step” between specific circumstances and your child’s responses to them. For example, Liz encounters the behavioral trigger of waking up early. She associates this event with a specific way of thinking: “I hate getting up in the morning. I shouldn’t have to.” Then, when she’s told to get up, she automatically starts thinking about how unfair that is, works herself up into a rage, and has an outburst.
> 
> This middle step, a thought pattern, is crucial for understanding why outbursts happen—if a child can recollect what they were thinking just before an outburst, you can understand the chain of events leading to their behavior. Plus, if you’re able to find a way to interrupt your child’s negative thought pattern (through coping methods like breathing exercises, for example), then they won’t progress to the next step of having an outburst even in the face of a behavioral trigger.

##### 2) Practice Active Listening

While getting your child’s perspective, you’ll want to keep your child as open and communicative as possible so they feel comfortable talking with you. To this end, Greene suggests you actively listen to your child, making them the focus of the conversation. He offers several conversational dos and don’ts for active listening:

  * **Do repeat your child’s answers back to them** to make sure you understand them correctly.
  * **Do ask clarifying questions** like “What do you mean?” or “How so?” when you don’t understand something.
  * **Don’t bring up problem behaviors** , as doing so might make your child defensive and closed off.
  * **Don’t guess what your child is feeling** or why they acted a certain way—you don’t want to speak over them and deprive them of an opportunity to explain themself.
  * **Don’t offer solutions yet** , as this will come later.



> **Nonverbal Cues and Active Listening**
> 
> Psychologists suggest there are several more crucial components to active listening, many of which have less to do with what you _say_ and more to do with how you _act_. They advise that you also:
> 
>   * **Pay attention to your body language.** Sometimes, our movements can say something we don’t intend. To show you’re engaged and interested in what the other person has to say, try to smile, avoid folding your arms, and nod regularly.
> 
>   * **Keep up eye contact.** This allows you to show your conversation partner that you’re engaged with them and aren’t distracted by anything else.
> 
>   * **Don’t cut off your conversation partner.** Even if there’s a period of silence while they consider what to say, you should be patient and wait for them to continue. This makes it easier for them to complete their thoughts and also shows you aren’t getting bored with what they have to say.
> 
> 


#### Step #3: Explain Your Perspective

Once you feel as though you have a good sense of your child’s perspective on a practical challenge, Greene says **you should explain your perspective to them.** Tell your child _why_ you ask them to complete these practical challenges and how failing to do so negatively impacts them and the people around them. By helping your child understand why you ask them to complete practical challenges, those challenges will feel less arbitrary and less frustrating.

For example, Liz’s dad explains his perspective by saying, “I’m concerned that you’ll keep getting in trouble with your school by showing up late. Also, if you miss the bus and I have to drive you then I get in trouble for being late to work.” This shows Liz why she has to get up and the consequences when she doesn’t.

(Shortform note: In addition to sharing the consequences of failing to complete practical challenges, you can share your feelings about your child’s behavior, explain the authors of _How to Talk So Kids Will Listen& Listen So Kids Will Talk_. The goal of this isn’t to guilt your child, but rather to help them develop empathy and a willingness to collaborate with you. When you share your feelings, you model these skills for your child, and show them sharing feelings is not only safe but also encouraged.)

#### Step #4: Brainstorm and Test Solutions Together

Once both you and your child have made your perspectives clear, Greene says the next step is to **work with your child to find a solution that works for both of you.** You shouldn’t go into this step having _already decided_ on a solution since it might narrow your thinking or cause you to slip into a “demand” strategy. Whatever solution you land on should be realistic and should satisfy everyone—otherwise, it’ll only breed resentment and increase tension over time, leading to future conflicts.

While you might think this step gives your child too much power or lets them take control, Greene argues this isn’t the case. You’re still determining a way they can complete the practical challenges _you_ give them, after all.

(Shortform note: The process of coming up with and testing a number of solutions can be time-consuming and draining, something critics of collaborative parenting styles tend to focus on. These critics argue the involved processes of collaboratively working through each issue (as opposed to using clear rules and punishments) are sometimes unrealistic for parents, especially those who can only spend a limited amount of time with their child each day due to work or other concerns. While collaborative approaches can have their benefits, critics concede, parents shouldn’t feel guilty if they struggle to employ them.)

Greene outlines a three-part plan for brainstorming potential solutions: **recap your concerns, offer initial ideas, and then revisit and refine them.**

##### 1) Recap Concerns

**Recap your and your child’s perspectives.** This will help keep in mind what your solution has to address. For example, during the discussion in Step #2, Liz revealed that she has trouble getting up on days when there’s nothing she likes for breakfast. Liz’s dad will recap this as well as his concerns about lateness.

(Shortform note: Repeating ideas in conversation not only helps you remember what was said, but it also proves you’ve been listening and helps your conversation partner feel heard and understood. This then encourages them to be more open and expressive moving forward, since they know they’re getting through to you.)

##### 2) Offer Initial Ideas

**Brainstorm some initial ideas for solutions, asking your child first.** Since this is their struggle, they might already have some ideas of how to address it or a perspective different from your own. Then, you can offer your own ideas or modifications. For example, Liz suggests she should pick what she has for breakfast every day. Liz’s dad modifies the idea slightly, suggesting they plan breakfasts for each week together.

(Shortform note: The authors of _How to Talk So Kids Will Listen& Listen So Kids Will Talk_ offer concrete advice for this early brainstorming stage to make sure things go smoothly. They suggest you start with any and all ideas on the table (even ones you can’t agree to, like letting your child do whatever they want), writing them all down in a list. Then, both you and your child can go through this list and cross off any ideas you don’t like, explaining your thoughts and feelings along the way. These extra steps will help your child feel like you care what they think and are really working _with_ them rather than _against_ them.)

##### 3) Revisit and Refine

**Work with your child to implement your solution, changing it as needed.** Try out your solution for a while and see if it helps your child address their practical challenge or lowers the number of outbursts they have. If it doesn’t, continue having follow-up discussions with your child to try and determine what works, what doesn’t, and whether another solution might be better. Remember, this is a process, and you might not get it right on the first try.

For example, Liz and her dad discover that their weekly breakfast plans often become power struggles, so they continue communicating openly and eventually decide to scrap this solution and look for a new one. Unlike when Liz’s dad used the demand strategy, though, they’re still making progress even though their first solution failed—they’re getting better at opening up to one another and understanding each other’s perspectives.

(Shortform note: Many parenting experts emphasize the importance of consistency when it comes to rules and discipline, arguing that it makes your child feel more secure and less anxious by helping them know what to expect from you. However, solutions are all about finding a way to make practical challenges manageable for your child—and if a given solution doesn’t do that, then continuing to use it won’t do anybody any good. If anything, it will only raise your child’s anxiety more by leading to more conflicts and power struggles. Therefore, you can forgo consistency until you find a solution that works.)

### Part 4: Common Challenges

As you work to prevent outbursts by using Greene’s method, you’ll likely encounter challenges. In Part 4 of our guide, we’ll discuss three common challenges parents face during this process, as well as Greene’s suggestions for how to deal with them.

#### Challenge #1: Reluctance

Greene acknowledges that especially early on when you adopt the “discuss” strategy, your child might be reluctant or unwilling to talk. This is normal and usually occurs for two main reasons:

  1. Your child still expects a one-way “demand” strategy and isn’t used to this new two-way approach. Therefore, they might still be somewhat defensive or not yet have the executive skills to communicate openly.
  2. Your child genuinely doesn’t know why they struggle with a practical challenge or why they had an outburst. 



Even if your child is reluctant early on, **keep at it.** **Continuing to have these conversations will help them get better at reflecting on and communicating their feelings**.

(Shortform note: While Greene’s advice to manage reluctance mainly centers around _reducing negative feelings_ in a discussion, other parenting experts suggest you can also _increase positive feelings_ your child has toward self-awareness and expression. By praising your child for expressing their feelings or having them identify their _strengths_ , you can encourage them to be more open even outside of discussions about practical challenges.)

#### Challenge #2: Other Children and Adults

The second common challenge Greene brings up is managing your child when they’re around other children and adults. Because public outbursts can get chaotic quickly, Greene emphasizes **safety and stability should be your first priority** —even if it means getting medication to manage their behavior or using the “delay” strategy to avoid outbursts. In addition, you can make things easier for yourself by explaining your child’s outbursts to others:

  * Tell your child’s school about what causes your child to have outbursts, as well as the solutions you and your child use to prevent them. (Shortform note: In addition to telling your child’s teachers your experience, ask them for their perspectives—hearing how someone else sees your child behave in a different environment might give you more insight into your child’s outbursts.)
  * If your child’s siblings resent the special attention or privileges your child receives, explain that fair doesn’t always mean equal—different people struggle with different things, and your job as a parent is to help your children overcome whatever their struggles may be. (Shortform note: Parenting experts note that in addition to explaining how different kids need help in different ways, you can help address sibling jealousy by pointing out and praising each sibling for their unique strengths and talents.)



#### Challenge #3: Difficulty Communicating

Greene explains that if your child has limited communication, whether due to a disability, diagnosed condition, or any other number of reasons, the “discuss” strategy becomes more difficult but **not impossible.** You can use simplified methods like key phrases or pointing to pictures to help them express their needs. If your child is largely unable to communicate, you can keep track of their outbursts and try to find patterns of when they occur. These patterns can help you determine and then address the causes of those outbursts.

(Shortform note: In addition to pictures and key phrases, role play is a commonly used method of communicating practical challenges and boundaries to children with autism and learning disabilities. Role play not only allows you to model good behavior for your child, but it also allows your child to practice good behavior while they’re still calm and in a safe environment.)
