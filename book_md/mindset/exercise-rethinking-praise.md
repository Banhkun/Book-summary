## Exercise: Rethinking Praise

When kids accomplish something, adults often praise them for their abilities in an effort to boost their confidence. However, research shows this kind of praise makes children reluctant to take on challenges because it reinforces the notion that abilities are fixed. Children are afraid that trying something and failing will call their abilities into question.

* * *

What were you praised for as a child? What were you criticized for?

What message did the above interactions send you about your abilities? What do you believe about your abilities today?

Is there something youâ€™ve never tried because you doubted you have the ability? What could you learn if you went ahead and tried it?

If you have a child, what was the last accomplishment you praised him or her for? Did you praise for ability or for a process of effort, strategies, and perseverance? How did the child react?
