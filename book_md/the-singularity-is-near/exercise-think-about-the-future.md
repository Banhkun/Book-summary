## Exercise: Think About the Future

Kurzweil argues that our future will be shaped by simultaneous advances in the fields of biomedicine, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. Consider how these have impacted your life and what potential they hold for tomorrow.

* * *

Medical research has created new treatments we could only have dreamed of decades ago. How have you or someone you love benefited from advances in medical science? What other advances would you like to see in your lifetime?

The device you’re reading this guide on right now is the product of decades of circuit miniaturization. Can you picture any benefits to continuing that trend, and if so, what do you imagine they are? What might be some hazards of making computers even smaller than they are now?

Artificial intelligence is potentially the most helpful and the most disruptive new technology since the development of atomic power. What concerns do you have about how AI may directly impact your life and society? Which do you feel is greater—its benefits or its hazards—and why?
