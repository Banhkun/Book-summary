## Shortform Caveats

_Drive_ has interesting ideas that seem true on introspection, but the book **is very light in cited research, and heavy in anecdotes**. The concepts in _Drive_ originated in basic research, but many applications in management are only anecdotes – a certain company instituted 20% time, and lo and behold they started growing! Select anecdotes suffer heavily from bias and are relatively unconvincing.

Furthermore, since its publication, **several policies touted by the _Drive_ book have received backlash or even been repealed**. For instance, Google’s famous 20% time has been repealed (we’ll explain why later). Netflix offers unlimited vacation days, but workers sometimes complain that it sets unclear expectations that cause people to take _less_ vacation. The policies cited in this book haven’t been sufficiently proven to stand the test of time.

Finally, one of the central premises of the book is that financial incentives don’t do a great job of getting the behavior you want. But a vast volume of research has gone into the opposite, in demonstrating the effect of financial incentives in improving work. Like many management books, _Drive_ doesn’t do a complete enough job of exploring the opposing stance – in this case, surveying the vast literature on incentives.
