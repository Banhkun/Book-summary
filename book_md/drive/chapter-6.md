## Chapter 6: Purpose

In addition to autonomy and mastery, the _how_ and the _what_ of work,__ the third pillar of Motivation 3.0 is the _why_ of work. What purpose does the work serve? What is the value of what I’m doing? In particular, **people are wired to want to help other people** – it may be part of our evolution, selecting for people who do something beyond themselves.

In the absence of outward-looking purpose, people can become anxious or depressed. And if people blindly profit goals, at the expense of building meaningful relationships and achieving purpose, they may regret their emptiness when it’s far too late to change course.

Data suggests that today’s workforce is feeling an increasing need for purpose:

  * Volunteerism rates are increasing rates, and this is correlated with increasing levels of worker disengagement. This suggests volunteering nourishes people in ways that today’s work does not.
  * Workers rate nonmonetary factors like “giving back to society through work” as more important rewards than money.
  * After the 2008 recession, a set of MBAs decided to institute an MBA Oath, centered around “serving the greater good by bringing people and resources together.”



Studies also show that **acknowledging purpose makes people work harder and perform efficiently**. In an experiment with university fundraisers, the group that was read stories about how raised funds benefited students worked harder and doubled the amount of money raised.

**Here’s how to promote purpose in the workplace:**

  * When discussing goals of management, think beyond sterile words like “value” and “differentiation.” Reach for deeper ideals like honor, truth, justice, and beauty.
  * Use the pronoun test to gauge your work environment – do people describe the company in terms of “we,” or in terms of “they?”
  * **Always explain _why_ something needs to be done. **This prevents work from feeling purposeless.
  * Donate some company profits to charity, since spending money on others seems to increase our well-being. Even better, give employees autonomy over deciding where they want to send their share of the donation pool.
  * Combine purpose with autonomy: give workers 20% time to work on a socially meaningful project.
