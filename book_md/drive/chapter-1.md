## Chapter 1: Old Understandings of Motivation No Longer Work

Much like computers, society is run by underlying operating systems – a set of protocols, laws, and understandings that govern how we view the world and how we behave with each other.

The earliest operating system, termed Motivation 1.0 in the book, was simple, biological: we are animals trying to survive, and satisfying the primal needs of food, water, shelter, and sex is a fundamental driving force. This kept the human species alive for much of our evolutionary past.

But when humans created more complex societies, Motivation 1.0 was inadequate. Satisfying primal urges would have encouraged theft, murder, and adultery. So common expectations of behavior were put into place to suppress Motivation 1.0. Humans transcended to organize around a second drive, **Motivation 2.0: to seek reward and avoid punishment.**

This worked especially well during industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries. Because human work in factories was easy to measure, it was easy to see how work policies changed productivity. Pay people more per widget they make, and they’ll crank out more widgets.

Thus, the **management approach in this period viewed workers as simple cogs in a machine** – lubricate them appropriately with external rewards or punishments, and they will run smoothly to keep the overall machine humming. This is a relatively simple model to understand, monitor, and enforce. Motivation 2.0 enabled great efficiency of manual labor and assembly-line performance, which spurred much of the growth in the past 200 years.

**But more recently, Motivation 2.0 has run into limitations itself.** It fails to satisfyingly explain certain phenomena like:

  * Wikipedia successfully thrives as a massive crowd volunteering effort – no contributors are paid for editing and adding material. In contrast, Microsoft Encarta, an encyclopedia from the 1990s, failed to keep up with the Internet despite massive financial investment. 
    * Imagine you were asked in that time to bet on which product would succeed: 1) a product made by the world’s largest software company, with an army of well-paid authors, or 2) an online community full of uncredentialed, unpaid volunteers. You wouldn’t be blamed for choosing the former.
    * This example generalizes to open source projects like Linux and Apache, where contributors are driven strongly by unpaid motivations.
  * New corporate structures that de-emphasize profit are emerging, like the “low-profit limited liability company” or the “B corporation,” both of which emphasize social good rather than profit maximization. This growing movement suggests that **people aren’t driven _entirely_ by financial rewards.**
  * People often leave lucrative jobs to take lower-paying ones that provide a clearer purpose or are more inherently enjoyable.



Note that extrinsic rewards are not totally absent from the examples above. For example, open-source contributors gain experience and resume line items that enhance earning potential later. But this isn’t a direct and immediate reward, so standard operant conditioning models don’t apply.

Recognizing Motivation 2.0’s limits are important because **the nature of our work is changing from the rote to the creative**. The assembly line-like jobs of the early 20th century are disappearing to outsourcing and automation. Today’s information work is basing more on critical thinking and creativity.

And in this new economy, using tools that worked in the old economy can be harmful. Later we’ll see how **extrinsic rewards can suppress intrinsic motivation and reduce creativity**.

Understanding motivation is also important because companies are becoming less hierarchical, trimming manager levels and imposing less direct oversight over workers. In this new autonomous structure, companies need to identify people who are self-motivated, and they need to understand how to avoid crushing this spirit.
