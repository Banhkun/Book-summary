## Chapter 3: Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivation

In the book we’ll discuss two types of behavior:

  * **Type X** behavior**** is driven by **extrinsic** desires and less by the intrinsic satisfaction of an activity. This is Motivation 2.0.
  * **Type I** behavior**** is driven by **intrinsic** desires – autonomy, mastery, and purpose. This is Motivation 3.0.



People tend to be driven primarily by either Type X or Type I. Consider yourself – what gets you up in the morning and pushes you through the day? What motivates that colleague that seems like a continuous go-getter?

Organizations also tend to be driven primarily by either Type X or Type I motivation. Picture a strict, commission-based salesforce running on Type X, while a free-working company like Google leans more Type I.

The book makes a few points about Type I behavior:

  * **Type I’s outperform Type X’s in the long term.** While extrinsic rewards can fuel work in the short-term, they tend to exhaust as workers habituate to the reward. In contrast, intrinsic motivation can be self-sustaining and renewable over long periods of time.
  * **Type I behavior comes from both nature and nurture.** Type I seems to be the natural state of most human beings (imagine the curiosity of a child), but Type X is forced upon us by the way we run our homes, our schools, and our workplaces. 
    * But there’s still hope - with education and the right environment, extrinsically motivated Type X’s can become intrinsically motivated Type I’s.
  * **Type I’s still care about money and recognition.** You can’t expect Type I’s to work for free - they require a baseline compensation to remove money as a consideration point. But after a certain point, compensation is less a driver for Type I’s and more a form of recognition or feedback about performance.
  * **Type I’s have greater physical and mental health.** Studies show that people who prefer autonomy and intrinsic motivation have higher psychological health and better relationships than Type X people. (Shortform note: It’s unclear whether this is correlation or causation. Healthier people may be in a better position to get more creative jobs that allow for more intrinsic motivation.)
