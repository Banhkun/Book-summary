## Exercise: Strengthen Your Local Community

One key commitment of Brooks’s relationalist approach to life is the commitment to your local community. In this exercise, evaluate strategies for strengthening the community around you.

* * *

Describe a recent situation in which you engaged with your community. How did this experience make you feel closer to your community?

Which outlets do the members of your community currently have for spending time with one another?

How effective are these outlets at fostering a sense of community?

Of Brooks’s steps for strengthening community (hosting neighborhood dinners, being vulnerable with your neighbors, embracing the code of the neighbor), which do you think is most effective at forging a sense of community? Why?

How could you implement that step in your community? This might involve, for instance, devising a concrete plan to organize a community event.
