## Exercise: How Has Noise Affected You?

We’re all affected by the judgment errors that noise leads to. These errors can reduce the quality and consistency of our legal system, educational institutions, workplaces, and more.

* * *

Think of a time you relied on a judgment made by an institution of some sort. Describe the situation. What was the context? What was the judgment?

What actions or outcomes did the judgment lead to? Remember, this could be a situation that benefited you or harmed you.

Now think about the ways noise may have affected the judgment. Don’t worry about accurately analyzing the situation; the point is to brainstorm about how noise may have affected the judgment you received.

Are there ways you could have avoided or counteracted the noise you encountered? How could the institution that judged you have reduced the noise that affected their judgment?
