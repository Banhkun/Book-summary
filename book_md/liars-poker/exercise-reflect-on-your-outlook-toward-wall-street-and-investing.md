## Exercise: Reflect on Your Outlook Toward Wall Street and Investing

Lewis’s depiction of 1980s Wall Street can lead to deeply cynical conclusions about the financial industry as a whole. Nevertheless, many other authors have written about investing as a thoughtful process that anyone can pursue without unethical behavior. Consider whether you believe Lewis’s portrayal is typical of the modern world of investing, or if the practices he describes are emblematic of a few “bad apples” in the business.

If you contribute to an employer’s pension fund, how transparent is that fund about how your money is invested? How much do you trust your pension fund’s managers to make wise investment decisions, and why do you feel that way?

Have you ever worked with a financial adviser? If so, does that adviser recommend frequent purchases and trades, or do they recommend slow and steady investments? In what way do you feel your adviser’s financial interests align with or diverge from your own?

If you invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds on your own, how do you choose where to invest? How much are you concerned with sharp fluctuations in the market? Have you ever made investment decisions that you feel, in retrospect, were overly impulsive?
