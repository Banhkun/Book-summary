## Exercise: Find a “Good Enough” Solution

Sometimes business owners get stuck on a problem because they’re searching for an ideal solution. To get unstuck, they need to give up on finding a perfect answer and embrace the concept of “good enough,” or achieving maximum efficiency with minimal effort.

* * *

Consider the current state of your business. Describe a problem that you haven’t yet solved because you haven’t come up with a perfect solution.

Assume that a perfect solution to that problem doesn’t exist. Now consider how you could get it solved right now to a “good-enough” standard. Make a list of two or three possible solutions.
