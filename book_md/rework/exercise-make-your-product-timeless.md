## Exercise: Make Your Product Timeless

Successful businesses are built around features that customers want today and will still want in the future. Your product should include elements that have a timeless, permanent appeal.

* * *

Consider a product you're developing (or think about your existing product). Will it still be relevant—and in demand—in 10 or 20 years? Why or why not?

If your product isn’t currently timeless, how might you tweak it to give it a permanent appeal? (If you believe it is timeless, what tweak could you make to _further_ ensure that it’ll remain relevant?)
