## 1-Page Summary

Published in 2021 by speaker and best-selling author Jon Acuff, _Soundtracks_ offers strategies to help you take control of your thoughts. Acuff argues that while overthinking tends to undermine your productivity and self-esteem, **you can harness the power of overthinking and use it to work toward your goals**.

According to Acuff, to take control of your thoughts, you’ll need to interrupt negative thoughts, replace them with positive ones, and repeat those positive thoughts until you believe them, and they become patterns. Acuff refers to these recurring thought patterns as “soundtracks” and argues that by switching from negative soundtracks to positive ones, you’ll be able to motivate yourself more effectively.

(Shortform note: Acuff refers to all repeated thoughts as soundtracks, in reference to music’s power to shape the emotional impact of scenes in TV and in movies. This metaphor gains extra rhetorical weight when you consider that music can powerfully impact your mental and physical health, improving everything from anxiety levels to sleep quality. While Acuff isn’t talking about music, throughout _Soundtracks_ he suggests that much like music, positive thinking can have a significant impact on your life.)

In our guide, we’ll take you through Acuff’s process for taking control of your thoughts, one step at a time: First, we’ll look at strategies for interrupting negative patterns of thought. Then we’ll show you how to create positive slogans for yourself that encourage you to take action. Finally, we’ll explain the importance of repeating your slogans and affirmations until you internalize them.

Throughout the guide, we’ll share psychological research to explain _why_ Acuff’s strategies work and compare _Soundtracks_ to other notable approaches to self-improvement.

### Step 1: Interrupt Negative Overthinking

To begin taking control of your thoughts, Acuff argues that **you must first interrupt negative thoughts to prevent overthinking**. Overthinking occurs when your negative thoughts are so persistent that they begin to distract and discourage you. Over time, overthinking leads you to believe that any action you take will result in failure, so you avoid going after your dreams.

For example, suppose that your lifelong dream is to become a first-rate sushi chef, but because you lack confidence in your skills, you’re convinced you’ll never get a foot in the door. Nevertheless, you apply to a few restaurants, and to your surprise, your top choice offers you a trainee position. In the days before your first shift, you can’t stop imagining the embarrassment when the staff realizes you have no idea what you’re doing. You get so anxious about it that you decide not to go in at all, and the opportunity passes you by.

(Shortform note: While overthinking on its own isn’t a mental illness, overthinking can be a symptom of anxiety disorders. If you find that you still struggle with overthinking no matter how closely you adhere to Acuff’s strategies, it may be worth seeking out mental health treatment. In particular, cognitive behavioral therapy can be an effective treatment for anxiety, alongside other strategies such as diet, exercise, and mindfulness.)

#### Your Brain Is Wired for Overthinking

According to Acuff, it can be difficult to interrupt negative thoughts because **human brains have a natural tendency toward negative overthinking**. Acuff notes that your brain responds to minor negative events in a similar way to how it handles major traumas, deeply internalizing these experiences and their consequences. Your brain’s habit of latching on to negative memories makes it easier to remember failures than successes, which can lead you to form inaccurate negative beliefs about yourself.

(Shortform note: You may be more or less biologically inclined to overthinking depending on your gender. According to a recent study, on average women are more given to overthinking than men. Scientists hypothesize that women may be more inclined to overthinking due to higher average levels of frontal lobe activity and blood flow within the brain. These physiological differences also offer benefits including increased focus and intuition, alongside the drawbacks of overthinking and anxiety.)

As Acuff notes, once you’ve formed a negative belief about yourself, you’ll tend to interpret new experiences in a way that reinforces your prior negative belief, thanks to a phenomenon called _confirmation bias_. Because of confirmation bias, if you hold a negative belief about yourself, your brain will interpret even minor setbacks as evidence that the negative belief is true.

(Shortform note: While Acuff focuses on how confirmation bias can reinforce negative beliefs about yourself, confirmation bias can also work in your favor. Experts say that in the right conditions, confirmation bias can help bolster confidence. The key is starting with the right belief—if you start with a negative idea about yourself, new experiences will deepen your negativity, but if you start with a positive belief, you’ll interpret everything as evidence that your positive belief is true. While Acuff doesn’t consider this potentially beneficial side effect of confirmation bias, he _does_ offer strategies for forming positive beliefs about yourself, which you can use to take advantage of confirmation bias.)

#### Strategies for Interrupting Negative Thoughts

Now that you know how negative thoughts can prevent you from working toward your goals, let's look at some strategies you can use to interrupt negative thoughts and stop them from holding you back.

##### Question Negative Thoughts

To interrupt negative thought patterns, Acuff recommends that you take a moment to **critically examine negative thoughts** when they come up. When a thought gets stuck in your head, there are three criteria you can use to determine whether it’s counterproductive.

(Shortform note: While Acuff’s strategies for combating your negative thoughts are useful, sometimes you might not be able to overcome those thoughts on your own. If you’re having difficulty working through negative thoughts, it can help to turn to a partner, friend, or family member for support. Turning to loved ones can provide a healthy dose of perspective whenever you need a little help wrangling your internal monologue.)

**The first factor to consider is whether the thought is true.** Many negative thoughts are simply false, and taking a moment to recognize this can help you escape the cycle of negative thoughts. This can be especially helpful if you’re dealing with negative thoughts that tell you you’re inadequate or underqualified.

For example, suppose your boss offers you a promotion that includes increased responsibility. Negative thoughts could tell you you’re not ready for such a role, and you’ll fail if you accept the promotion. However, if you take a moment to ask if these thoughts are true, you’ll realize that you _are_ qualified for the new position—otherwise, your boss wouldn’t have considered you for the role in the first place.

(Shortform note: Experts note that because your brain is constantly thinking, it naturally generates many thoughts that have no basis in reality. Especially unpleasant random thoughts are known as intrusive thoughts, which tend to be more common in individuals with OCD and other disorders. Experts recommend that when these thoughts occur, it’s best to simply ignore them and wait for them to pass, as your brain will quickly move on to the next thing.)

**Next, assess whether a given thought will help you accomplish your goals.** If a thought doesn’t help you move forward, or actively hinders your productivity, that thought probably isn’t worth dwelling on. Recognizing that a negative thought is unhelpful can help you be less affected by it.

For example, imagine you have a deadline coming up at work, and you can’t stop thinking about how you could be fired if you fail to meet it. Instead of working on the now-stressful project, you’re inclined to completely avoid it due to anxiety. However, by taking a moment to think about it, you realize that by focusing on a hypothetical negative outcome, you’re making it more difficult to get anything done. Instead, you choose to focus more positively on the acclaim you’ll receive when the project is completed, which motivates you to keep pushing forward.

(Shortform note: Experts suggest that humor can be an effective strategy for overcoming counterproductive thoughts. If you’re able to find a way to laugh about a difficult situation, you’ll feel less stressed, which will make it easier for you to reapproach the situation from a more positive perspective.)

**Finally, when dealing with a negative thought, take note of whether the thought makes you feel good.** It can be easy to think mean-spirited, negative things about yourself. However, these kinds of thoughts can lower your confidence and prevent you from striving for your goals.

(Shortform note: If you’re struggling with an especially mean-spirited inner critic, experts recommend mentally referring to yourself in the third person in order to distance yourself from that inner critic. By referring to yourself by name, you distinguish between your conscious, positive thoughts about yourself and your inner critic’s negative thoughts. Once you’ve created that distance, it’s easier to disregard the negative voice in your head in favor of creating your own positive narrative.)

To identify unkind thoughts, Acuff suggests you consider how you’d feel if the thought was directed at one of your friends. For example, suppose you can’t stop thinking that you’re not smart enough to get into medical school. On reflection, you realize that if someone said something like that about one of your friends, you’d dismiss that person and their statement entirely. Reflecting further, you decide not to listen to such a patently unkind thought and return to working on your medical school applications with renewed faith in yourself.

(Shortform note: Acuff’s recommendation to view thoughts about yourself through the lens of friendship echoes a mindfulness concept known as self-compassion. Self-compassion is the practice of learning to treat yourself with kindness, in much the same way you would treat a friend. Part of that practice involves recognizing that you aren’t weak or isolated if you’re struggling in difficult situations. Recognizing that it’s natural for you to struggle sometimes can help you feel less frustrated and negative toward yourself when in a difficult situation.)

##### Relax and Refocus

Acuff notes that assessing your thoughts may not always be enough to interrupt them. It’s possible to recognize that a thought is untrue, unhelpful, and unkind, and still remain fixated on it anyway. When dealing with these kinds of persistent negative thoughts, Acuff recommends that you **step away from whatever you’re working on and take a moment to engage in a relaxing activity** to help refresh your mind before going back to work.

(Shortform note: Stepping away from intense work and re-engaging later may help you solve problems more creatively, writes Daniel J. Levitin in _The Organized Mind_. By stepping away from a task, you switch your brain out of central executive mode and into mind-wandering mode. In mind-wandering mode, you’re able to consider information from a variety of sources that you may not consider while in the narrow, intense focus of central executive mode.)

### Step 2: Replace Negative Thoughts With Positive Ones

Once you’ve managed to interrupt your negative thoughts, Acuff recommends that you **replace them with positive thoughts that encourage you to take action toward your goals**.

(Shortform note: In addition to motivating you to pursue your goals, positive thinking also has health benefits. A positive emotional state correlates with a longer life expectancy and a lower risk of heart disease. By pursuing Acuff’s strategies for positive thinking, you can increase your productivity and improve your health at the same time.)

#### Strategies for Choosing Positive Thoughts

To maximize the power of positive overthinking, choose positive thoughts that relate directly to your goals. As Acuff writes, choosing thoughts that pertain to your goals helps empower you to perform better in the most important situations in your life.

For example, suppose you have an upcoming presentation at work that you’re worried about. Thinking generally positive thoughts about work is good, but thinking more specifically about the presentation is better. If you spend the week beforehand reminding yourself that you’re a well-prepared and skillful public speaker, it’ll help you carry yourself with confidence into your presentation.

(Shortform note: Acuff isn’t alone in his assertion that positive thinking has life-changing potential. In _The Power of Positive Thinking_ , Norman Vincent Peale argues that your expectations determine the quality of your life—when you expect the best, you get the best, and when you expect the worst, you get the worst. While Peale doesn’t specify _how_ positive thoughts lead to positive results, Acuff provides a more practical insight into how to make the most of positive thinking.)

Acuff notes that when choosing positive thoughts, you should focus on finding _solutions_ to difficult situations and not on the situations themselves. This can be especially helpful when dealing with a situation that’s causing you mental stress and anxiety. Focusing on solutions helps you avoid anxiety and stay on task, whereas focusing too much on the situation will only make you more anxious.

For example, suppose you’re a writer and you can’t stop stressing about the deadline for your next draft. Instead of thinking about the deadline, you could think positively about solutions, remembering how you’ve succeeded in similar situations in the past. If you get stuck thinking about the deadline, saying to yourself “I _have_ to get this done by Friday,” you’ll likely feel more anxious. On the other hand, if you think something positive and solutions-oriented, like “I successfully met my last deadline, so I can apply the strategy I used then to meet this one,” you’ll feel more confident and more ready to tackle your work head-on.

(Shortform note: While focusing on solutions can be a powerful motivational tool, it also comes with certain risks. Experts note that unchecked optimism in difficult situations can lead you to choose unnecessarily risky solutions. To prevent these kinds of situations, experts recommend that you balance optimism with realism when looking for solutions, carefully weighing the risks of different options.)

**If you’re having trouble coming up with positive thoughts, Acuff suggests inverting old negative thoughts.** This method can help you come up with positive thoughts that relate to any situation where you’ve previously struggled with overthinking.

For example, if you’re a distance runner, and one of your old negative thoughts was “I’ll never be able to run a marathon,” you could flip this thought upside-down. Your new line could be something like “I have what it takes to go the distance."

(Shortform note: Some authors recommend that you write down negative thoughts that occur throughout the day so you can return later and turn them into positive ones. Writing down thoughts can be especially useful when you notice negative thoughts occurring in a busy moment, and you don’t have time to rework them. By keeping track of negative thoughts as they occur, you’ll ensure you’re able to address any recurring negative pattern of thought, regardless of when they pop up.)

In addition to inverting negative thoughts, you can borrow positive phrases from others. Acuff notes that positive thoughts can come from anywhere—friends, favorite books, even song lyrics. Coming up with your own positive thoughts can feel difficult at first, so it can help to outsource them, especially when you’re first getting started.

(Shortform note: While Acuff suggests that repeating positive phrases pulled from other sources can help motivate you, not everyone agrees with him. Some studies suggest that by repeatedly exposing yourself to the same positive ideas, you desensitize yourself to them, getting less and less motivation from them as time goes on. To counteract this effect, continually seek out new positive thoughts, to ensure that you’re always working with fresh and effective ideas.)

##### Build Positive Habits by Taking Action

According to Acuff, it’s important that you couple your new positive thoughts with action. As you take action toward accomplishing your goals and experience success, you’ll increase your confidence, which will help your positive thoughts work more effectively.

(Shortform note: As you begin the process of turning negative thoughts into positive ones, some writers believe it can be helpful to focus on smaller goals that can be accomplished in your daily life. When you accomplish these accessible, near-term goals, it’ll boost your confidence, which will enable you to tackle other daunting problems.)

Acuff recommends coupling rituals with your positive thoughts to help get in the habit of taking action. Anything you can do to create a positive association with a difficult task will help spur you to continued action. For example, if you’re struggling to make it to the gym, in addition to creating slogans around working out, you can also create rituals—for example, putting on your favorite workout gear, listening to energizing music, or taking a relaxing bath after working out.

(Shortform note: As you build positive rituals to go with your new positive outlook, be sure to choose rituals that are fun. Studies have shown that when a new habit or activity is fun, you’re more likely to return to it and stick with it longer. By contrast, if your ritual is something unpleasant, you’re more likely to be discouraged and avoid returning to it in the future.)

### Step 3: Repeat Positive Thoughts Until They Become Patterns

Once you’ve settled on new positive thoughts, the final step is to repeat them until you internalize them. **By repeating your positive thoughts until they stick, you’ll avoid returning to old negative thoughts** and becoming demotivated.

(Shortform note: In addition to helping you stay motivated, repetition can help you learn more effectively. Studies have shown that when you repeat an action, you learn more quickly and experience more positive feelings. In addition to the motivational effects Acuff describes, repeating positive thoughts and coupling them with action can help you acquire skills and build confidence at the same time.)

To demonstrate how repeating positive affirmations can impact your life, Acuff hired researcher Mike Peasley to measure the effectiveness of Acuff’s approach. In the study, participants who repeated positive phrases overwhelmingly felt that doing so helped them work toward their goals.

(Shortform note: While Acuff frequently cites the study conducted by Peasley as evidence for the effectiveness of his approach, it’s important to note that Peasley and Acuff never publicly published their research methods. As Ben Goldacre notes in _Bad Science_ , when scientific studies don’t thoroughly explain the methods they used to reach their results, it casts a shadow of doubt over their findings. This doesn’t necessarily mean that Acuff and Peasley’s study was flawed. Rather, they simply haven’t given us enough information to evaluate it. According to Goldacre, in situations like these, it’s best to take research findings with a grain of salt until further research is published.)

Acuff recommends that you r**epeat your positive thoughts out loud each day to maximize their effectiveness**. While doing this may feel awkward at first, Acuff argues that it will help you internalize positive beliefs about yourself and increase your confidence more quickly.

(Shortform note: Acuff’s belief in the benefits of talking to yourself aloud is backed up by scientific research. Studies have shown that talking to yourself aloud helps you focus on a task even more effectively than talking to yourself internally. While it may feel awkward, repeating positive thoughts out loud can help you function better.)

If you’re having trouble with this step, Acuff advises that you **make a list of every success you experience** , even small ones. Listing your successes can help you believe in yourself and in your positive thoughts, making it easier to feel confident repeating them.

(Shortform note: In addition to helping you believe in yourself, research shows that listing successes can help decrease stress. By writing down daily successes and celebrating them, you increase your sense of accomplishment, which lowers stress, making it easier to continue working toward your goals.)

Lastly, **if you’re having trouble remembering and repeating your new thoughts, it can also help to create a physical symbol to remind you of them**. There are countless possible examples—a piece of string tied around your finger or even a pair of lucky socks. Whatever symbol you choose, each time you see it, remember your commitment to positive thinking and to yourself, and it’ll help to keep you motivated.

(Shortform note: When choosing a physical object to remind you of your positive thoughts, it’s important to choose something that catches your eye. By choosing a bright and colorful object, you give your brain a visual cue that’s difficult to ignore. By contrast, if you choose a mundane object, you’re more likely not to notice it.)
