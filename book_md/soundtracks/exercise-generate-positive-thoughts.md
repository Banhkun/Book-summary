## Exercise: Generate Positive Thoughts

Learn to interrupt negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones.

* * *

Reflect on a stressful situation in your life. What thoughts about yourself and the situation come to mind? Choose a particularly negative thought and write it down below. For example, suppose you’re a basketball player, and you performed poorly in your team’s most recent game, which resulted in a loss. You might find yourself thinking that you’re just not good enough to help your team make it to the playoffs.

Now assess the negative thought using Acuff’s criteria. Is the thought accurate? Does it push you to achieve your goals? Does it make you feel good?

Replace this negative thought with a positive one that relates to the same situation. Follow Acuff’s example, and invert the negative thought, transforming it into a positive one. Write your new positive thought below. For example, if you can’t stop thinking that you aren’t a good enough basketball player for your team to make the playoffs, your new positive thought might be, “I have the skills to lead my team to victory.”

Come up with a ritual that will help you remember and act upon your new positive thoughts. Think of a way to reward yourself for taking action. Detail your plan below. In our basketball player example, you could make a plan to practice a couple of hours each day, repeating your positive thoughts as you perfect your shots. To couple your practice routine with a rewarding ritual, you listen to your favorite album each time you hit the gym and unwind with an episode of your favorite show when you get home.
