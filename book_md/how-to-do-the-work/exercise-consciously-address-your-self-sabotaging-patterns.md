## Exercise: Consciously Address Your Self-Sabotaging Patterns

According to LePera, consciously addressing painful experiences helps create healthier patterns.

* * *

Reflect on an unwanted circumstance in your life and write down how it makes you think, feel, and behave. (For example, seeing your reflection makes you think about how overweight you are. You feel ashamed of your appearance and avoid leaving the house.)

Reflect on your childhood experiences and write down at least one way in which they may have influenced the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that you noted above. (For example, you remember overhearing your mother make a negative comment about your appearance to her friends. This made you feel ashamed.)

Consider the seven different categories of defensive behaviors. Write down the one that represents the way you cope with your unwanted situation. (For example, your response to your reflection—you avoid leaving the house—suggests that you avoid drawing attention from other people to avoid criticism.)

First, write down at least one belief that might fuel this defensive behavior. (For example, “No one will love me if I don’t look perfect.”) Then, write down what you _want_ to believe. (For example, “I am lovable just as I am.”)
