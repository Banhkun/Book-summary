## 1-Page Summary

What's the secret to extraordinary success? We often think it's luck, talent, or skill, but sports psychologist Bob Rotella argues that people achieve excellence because of their _mindset_. In _How Champions Think_ , Rotella explains that**champions share similar ways of thinking that set them apart** : They nurture a positive self-image, break down ambitious dreams into realistic goals, and learn to grow from setbacks. By adopting the mental habits of a champion, you can unlock your full potential and achieve excellence in whatever you pursue.

Rotella is a professional golf coach and former director of the Sports Psychology Department at the University of Virginia. He also wrote the bestseller _Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect_. Rotella has worked with hundreds of companies, high performers, and professional athletes, including LeBron James and golf champions Pat Bradley and Tom Kite, helping them improve their mental game and reach new levels of success.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss how to develop a positive self-image by improving your optimism and confidence. Then, we’ll explore methods for honing your skills and performing effectively under pressure. Finally, we’ll examine Rotella’s advice for overcoming and learning from setbacks and challenges. Along the way, we’ll present other experts’ tips for high performance and provide additional actionable advice to help you apply Rotella’s principles to your goals.

### Part 1: Adopt a Positive Self-Image

Rotella writes that to become exceptional, you must first **change how you view yourself and adopt a positive self-image.** He explains that your mindset—the way you view your abilities and the beliefs you have about the world—affects how successful you’ll become. It can either hold you back or empower you to further your skills, overcome difficulties, and achieve ambitious goals.

(Shortform note: Rotella argues that a positive self-image is pivotal for success, but why exactly do you view yourself the way you do? In _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz explains that your self-image is a reflection of how you interpret your experiences. For example, if you win an award, you might feel proud or you might feel guilty that you didn’t deserve it. Which of these two reactions you have is largely influenced by the opinions and beliefs of others, especially when you were young, Maltz writes. However, Maltz asserts that your self-image is _subjective_ —it isn’t a reflection of objective reality, and you can change it to be more positive by practicing techniques that challenge you to think differently about yourself.)

Specifically, he says that champions choose to be optimistic, develop confidence in their abilities, and overcome self-imposed limits. In the following sections, we’ll discuss these attributes and how to develop them.

#### Choose to Be Optimistic

According to Rotella, champions excel because they choose to be optimistic: **They remain hopeful and expect positive outcomes even when faced with challenges or uncertainty.** He explains that optimism doesn’t guarantee success, but pessimism almost always leads to failure. Imagine, for instance, that you have to give a public speech. If you’re pessimistic and believe that things will go wrong, you’ll likely freeze and panic if you forget what to say. Conversely, if you trust that your preparation and training will pay off, you’re more likely to relax, take a brief pause to recall your point, and resume your speech smoothly.

(Shortform note: While many experts agree that having an optimistic attitude can help you achieve your goals, they suggest you combine optimism with realism. Optimism helps you cope and keep going in spite of setbacks and difficulties, but being too optimistic can give you a false sense of security: You assume bad things won’t happen to you and, as a result, you may struggle to learn from mistakes or address issues. To balance optimism and realism, experts suggest you take time to reflect each day on positives in your life but also think about issues and challenges you should address.)

You might think that people are naturally optimistic or pessimistic, but Rotella argues that optimism can be learned. One way you can improve your optimism is by strengthening your belief in your ability to achieve your goals. To do this,**find role models who’ve overcome struggles similar to yours** or who’ve come from a similar background, and who’ve accomplished what you aspire to do despite those challenges. This will help you see that your dreams are achievable because if someone else, particularly someone who’s faced similar challenges, was able to succeed, you’ll develop the faith that you, too, can achieve your goals.

(Shortform note: In _The Motivation Myth_ , Jeff Haden says finding a role model can provide you with more than just inspirational examples: You can study _how_ your role model accomplished what you aspire to do and then follow their example. Start by identifying one thing they do that would move you toward your goal and do it. For example, if your role model is a professional artist who does sketches on their commute to work, you could try doing the same. Performing actions that your role model took to achieve their success may help you become even more optimistic than if you only admired their feats.)

#### Develop Your Confidence

In addition to being more optimistic, champions also have a lot of confidence in their abilities. According to Rotella, **confidence is the key to exceptional success because it empowers you to work hard and perform at your highest level.**

(Shortform note: While Rotella says confidence is the key to success, other experts argue the opposite—that having _lower levels of confidence_ can actually lead to greater success, as long as you're serious about your goals. They give three reasons for this: First, people with lower self-confidence are more prepared because they pay more attention to negative feedback and are more aware of their weaknesses. Second, they work harder because they're motivated by the gap between their current skill level and their goal. Third, they tend to be less arrogant, which helps them work better with others. In light of this, perhaps it may be better to cultivate a moderate instead of a high level of confidence.)

While optimism is a broad faith in your eventual success, _confidence_ is more specifically the faith you have in your particular skills—for example, you might be optimistic that you can win a cooking contest, but your confidence comes from your knowledge that you can cook a perfect steak.

(Shortform note: Another way to understand the difference between optimism and confidence is to consider how they relate to time. Confidence is the trust you have in your abilities in the _present_ moment while optimism is the expectation of good outcomes in the _future_. Because of this, it’s possible to have one without the other. For example, you might currently lack confidence in your art skills but be optimistic that you’ll one day become a professional artist.)

Rotella explains that when you have confidence in your skills, you’re likely to put more effort and time into improving them. However, when you lack confidence in your skills, you may feel easily discouraged and give up when you face difficulties rather than work harder to overcome them.

(Shortform note: While Rotella writes that confidence leads to better skills, psychologist Meg Jay argues the opposite: Better skills lead to confidence. In _The Defining Decade_ , she cautions against people telling you to "feel confident" before you’ve practiced, studied, and worked through challenges as you build your skills, as confidence that’s built only on people telling you that you’re great is fragile and will shatter when you run into obstacles. She doesn't dispute Rotella's advice that confidence can give you a positive outlook, but she advises that you focus on skill-building first as it will lead to more meaningful confidence.)

Fortunately, like optimism, confidence is a skill you can develop. Rotella provides two tips to help you do so:

**1) Avoid perfectionism.** Rotella notes that perfection is unattainable in any field and even the most successful people make mistakes. Instead of obsessing over perfecting your skills, he recommends you simply improve them enough to feel confident in them.

(Shortform note: In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown agrees with Rotella and points out a misconception about perfectionism: People often treat perfectionism as a good thing—a desire to be the best version of themselves—but more often than not, they’re more concerned with how others view them. Brown argues that perfectionism only sets impossible standards to meet and leads to self-loathing and shame. To overcome this way of thinking, she suggests you practice self-compassion and change how you respond to shame and judgment.)

**2) Practice visualization.** Spend 15 to 30 minutes each day visualizing yourself performing the skill you want to feel more confident about. Make your visualization vivid by imagining all five senses—how things look, feel, smell, sound, or taste. According to Rotella, if you imagine something in detail, your subconscious mind believes that it’s true. Visualize not only your successes but also the potential obstacles you may encounter and how you can overcome them. By doing so, you’ll be less fazed if setbacks occur in reality because you’ve practiced how to handle them through visualization.

(Shortform note: In _The Miracle Morning_ , Hal Elrod provides a slightly more structured three-step visualization exercise: First, set the stage: Put on some low music, sit up straight, and take deep breaths. Next, visualize yourself achieving your goals with all your senses (as Rotella advises) and imagine how good it’ll feel. Finally, picture yourself acting in ways that move you toward your goals—studying, writing, making calls, and so on (this is similar to Rotella’s advice to visualize obstacles, although Elrod frames them more as _challenges_). This exercise will not only increase your confidence as Rotella suggests, but it will also motivate you to take action.)

#### Overcome Self-Imposed Limits

Rotella writes that many people limit their potential based on what they believe is “realistic.” But to become exceptional in your field, you must **break free from the limits you’ve imposed on yourself.** This means ignoring what others deem impossible and setting big goals.

(Shortform note: In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , Robin Sharma writes that you can push yourself beyond your limits by practicing _kaizen_ , a Japanese word meaning “continuous improvement,” if you take a small step to improve yourself each day. This way, you don’t have to worry about what’s “realistic” or not—you simply strive to do a little better every day. For instance, if you want to be a polyglot, you might try to add a new word to your vocabulary each day.)

Rotella says there are several reasons people limit themselves.

First, people often set mediocre goals because they’re afraid of failing to reach bigger ones. However, Rotella argues that you shouldn’t be concerned about failure. Even if you don’t accomplish your ambitious dreams, you’ll achieve much more than if you limit yourself to comfortable goals.

(Shortform note: In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cordone offers a reason mediocre goals will limit your success: Mediocre goals are uninspiring and thus people aren’t motivated to put in the effort needed to achieve them. As a result, they give up more easily when they encounter challenges. On the other hand, setting ambitious goals gets you excited and gives you the motivation and energy to achieve them.)

Another reason people limit themselves is that they overestimate the importance of innate talent, believing others are successful because they have more talent than they do. However, Rotella explains that exceptional people succeed more because of their strong character traits and less because of their innate talent.

(Shortform note: According to Angela Duckworth in _Grit_ , people often put too much emphasis on the role of talent for two reasons: First, we rarely see the hard work and effort others have put in to succeed, so we assume their achievements are due to natural talent. Second, we credit success to natural talent to avoid feeling bad, using it as an excuse for not having achieved more ourselves. However, Duckworth argues that effort and grit (which is defined by two key traits: perseverance and passion) ultimately matter more for success than natural talent.)

### Part 2: Work Diligently to Achieve Your Ambitious Dreams

A positive mindset sets a good foundation for achieving excellence in any field, but it’s not enough by itself. Excellence requires hard work—you must **master your skills by engaging in quality practice and staying committed to your goals, and then perform at your best by letting your subconscious mind take over.**

(Shortform note: Other experts agree that there’s no shortcut to exceptional success—you must prepare yourself to put in the necessary hard work. In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone gives advice on how to do so: Assume every endeavor you undertake will require 10 times more time, effort, and resources than you expect. This way, you’ll be ready to deal with unexpected challenges. If it turns out to be easier than you expected, you’ll still be happy with the result.)

#### Engage in Quality Practice

You can’t achieve your ambitious dreams through wishful thinking alone. To turn your dreams into reality, you must **put in quality practice to develop your skills.**

(Shortform note: What’s the difference between quality practice and ineffective practice? In _Decoding Greatness_ , Ron Friedman says _self-reflection is the most important element of good practice_. This means tracking your goals, the techniques you use to reach them, and how well you’re performing. By regularly reflecting on your practice, you can determine which strategies work best for you, which helps you concentrate your efforts in the most productive and valuable way. One easy way to practice self-reflection is by starting a journal, Friedman says.)

Rotella describes several methods for practicing your skills:

**1) Create a training plan.** Rotella suggests you break down your ultimate dream into realistic goals that you can pursue daily. You’ll then not only have a practical roadmap to follow, but also a way to measure and take satisfaction in your progress. Your plan will differ depending on your aspirations, but it should lay out actions you’ll take to improve and progress to your ultimate goal. For example, if you want to run a marathon, your process might involve finding a coach, following a training program, and setting frequent goals, such as how many miles you’ll run each day.

(Shortform note: In _High Performance Habits_ , Brendon Burchard provides a simple process for creating a practical plan to achieve your ambitious dream: First, write down your goal in a clear and specific manner. Next, break down your goal into five big steps you’ll need to take to accomplish it. Then, for each of the five steps, create a list of tasks you have to complete to accomplish that step. Finally, Burchard recommends you enter those tasks into your calendar and assign deadlines for each of them. This helps you stay disciplined and motivated to complete the tasks you set for yourself.)

**2) Practice smarter.** Although developing a training plan is vital for success, Rotella writes that it’s not enough in the long-term—you must not only practice your skills diligently, but also _strategically_. Don’t sink energy and time into inefficient study or practice. Instead, evaluate your practice approach: Consider how you can challenge yourself and strengthen your skills in a way that best translates to the real-world scenarios you’ll face. For example, if you’re preparing for a test, you could quiz yourself with flashcards or ask your teacher for extra worksheets instead of spending hours memorizing facts.

(Shortform note: In _Peak_ , Anders Ericsson provides deeper insight into what constitutes smart practice. He explains that simple repetition will only make you competent in your skill and that, to take your performance to the next level, you must engage in what he calls “purposeful practice.” To practice purposefully, you need four things: clear and specific goals, complete focus, feedback, and challenge. For example, if you want to improve your dancing skills, you could set a goal of doing a challenging section of a dance routine five times in a row without making a mistake, eliminate any distractions, and get feedback from a coach or partner.)

**3) Watch the competition.** By assessing your competitors and the standards of your field, you can get ideas of how to practice and prepare more effectively. Rotella suggests you compare yourself to people similar to you in skill level and be mindful of what they’re doing. For instance, if they’re practicing four hours a day and you only practice one hour, you should find a way to practice more effectively or put in more hours.

(Shortform note: Instead of comparing yourself to someone with a similar skill level, Simon Sinek recommends in _The Infinite Game_ that you find a “worthy rival”—someone who has some skills or qualities that are _better_ than yours. This should be someone you respect and feel inspired by as opposed to someone you only want to beat. By viewing your competitors this way, you can examine their strengths and improve your weaknesses, instead of dismissing them and missing out on valuable insights.)

#### Boost Your Commitment

Once you have a training plan to follow, you must **adopt a relentless commitment to your goal that drives you to invest more time and effort into honing your skills than others do.** Commitment means you work steadily toward your goals and are willing to make sacrifices for them.

(Shortform note: In _The 12 Week Year_ , Brian P. Moran says you need four things to exercise strong commitment: First, identify a strong “why” to motivate you (such as the dream of becoming an entrepreneur). Next, recognize the best and most effective path you could take to produce the outcome you want. Then, be prepared for the sacrifices you’ll have to make to follow through on your commitments. Finally, push through negative feelings and focus on your promises.)

According to Rotella, there are a number of ways to boost your commitment to your goals.

**1) Reflect on what you enjoy about your craft.** It’s easier to be committed to your skill when you’re passionate about it. But, according to Rotella, many people struggle with how to stay passionate. This can happen for a number of reasons—they may encounter a lot of rejection or feel like they’re not improving, for instance. To renew your passion, Rotella suggests you regularly remind yourself about what you enjoy about the work or activity you do.

(Shortform note: If plateaus or rejections are hurting your motivation, one way to rekindle your passion is by reimagining your good memories—for instance, when your team won a match or when you completed your novel manuscript. Imagine that memory being vividly projected on an IMAX screen five to 10 times. This will get you excited and motivate you to pursue that feeling once again.)

**2) Create good habits.** Replacing bad habits with good habits can help you stay committed to your goals. Habits are unthinking behaviors that don’t require willpower. Rotella explains that all habits begin with a cue—something that triggers you to do a certain action. To replace a bad habit, you must recognize the cue and consciously respond differently to it. For instance, finishing dinner might be a cue for you to plop onto your couch for the rest of the night. If you want to work on your novel instead, you must create a new response to the cue. Instead of going straight to the couch after dinner, you might force yourself to go straight to your writing desk.

(Shortform note: While starting a good habit might be simple, sticking with it tends to be much harder. In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor suggests you’ll achieve greater success with your habits if you make them easier to start. For example, if you want to write after dinner instead of lounging on the couch, you could lay out your writing materials on your desk after you get home and pile objects on your couch so there’s no room to sit on it. This minimizes the effort it takes for you to start writing while increasing the effort it takes to relax on the couch.)

#### Let Your Subconscious Mind Take Over

When it’s time to put your skills to the test, you may feel pressure and nerves you didn’t feel when you were training. To prevent your emotions and thoughts from interfering with your performance, you must **quiet your conscious mind, trust in your training, and let your subconscious mind take over.** Rotella explains that your conscious mind hijacks your brain with unhelpful thoughts such as doubts or worries that break up your natural flow. When your subconscious mind is in control, you can focus on your task, stay in the present moment, and maintain your composure after victories and mistakes.

(Shortform note: By putting your subconscious mind in control, you might achieve what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls _flow_ —a mental state of deep focus and enjoyment he discusses in _Flow_. In this state, you’re so focused on your task that everything else fades away, allowing you to forget about the pressure and your nerves and perform at your best. Csikszentmihalyi doesn’t define this as a state of _subconsciousness_ but rather as a state of _ordered consciousness_ , as opposed to a _disordered consciousness_ in which you’re controlled by your doubts and worries, and which aligns with Rotella’s observations about the conscious mind.)

To activate your subconscious, detach yourself emotionally from the outcome of the event and focus on the present moment. Rotella suggests you approach the situation as if you were doing something you don’t care about. For example, if you’re performing at a piano recital, imagine that you’re only singing karaoke with your friends. When you remove the stakes, you can focus on applying your skills rather than worrying about how well you’re doing. You should only judge how well you did later, Rotella writes, as immediate judgment will only interfere with your current performance.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle writes that many people struggle to focus on the present because they _resist the present reality_ , especially if they’re facing obstacles or challenges. For instance, if you’re playing a competitive sport and your team is down by many points, you might resist the reality of your situation by thinking, “I can’t believe we’re doing so terribly right now.” This way of thinking causes frustration and anger, which will only make things worse. Instead, Tolle suggests you focus on _accepting_ the present as it is, without resistance or judgments of good or bad. Instead, try to think, “We’re down a few points, so we’ll need to play more aggressively.”)

Rotella advises that another way to tap into your subconscious is by smiling.**** Whether you’re facing down a business presentation, a sports match, or a college exam, smiling relaxes your brain and allows your subconscious mind to take over so that you fully trust your abilities and allow the quality of your training to shine through. In contrast, frowning engages your conscious mind, which makes you doubt yourself and your abilities.

(Shortform note: Smiling can improve your performance because your body language affects what emotions you feel. When you smile, you trigger your brain to release chemicals that make you happier. These chemicals also relax your nervous system and reduce stress. To get the most benefit from smiling, experts suggest trying to smile as genuinely as possible.)

### Part 3: Grow From Challenges and Setbacks

Just as important as maintaining a positive attitude, training your skills, and trusting in your subconscious mind is learning how to overcome setbacks and challenges. Rotella writes that to be exceptional, **you must learn not only how to bounce back after failure but also how to glean lessons from it.** You can do this by learning to value the process over the outcome, letting go of your mistakes, and finding the right people to support you.

#### Value the Process, Not the Outcome

To ward off disappointment and persevere in spite of failures, you must **see the _process_ of pursuing your goals as more important than the _outcome_** , Rotella writes. Exceptional people pursue their goals fully recognizing the possibility that they may not attain them. They find joy in the process of striving for their goals, rather than in the promise of external rewards or recognition. This mindset ensures that you give it your all and persist even when you face obstacles that might prevent you from getting the outcomes you desire.

You can be more process-oriented by creating two lists of goals: One for training and one for performance. Both lists should be process-focused. So, for example, if you’re a violinist, your training goals might be practicing sight reading for an hour every day and your performance goals might be focusing on the present moment during your concert. Having these goals in place gives you something to focus on other than the outcome of your performance, be that a competition, a musical performance, a speech, and so on.

(Shortform note: Many experts agree with Rotella’s advice to focus on your process, which is within your control, instead of on an outcome, which is affected by variables beyond your control, such as luck or opportunities. In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear writes that you can do this by making small improvements to your behaviors rather than aiming for a broad goal. For example, if you want to improve your grades, don’t aim for a certain GPA, but instead, find ways to learn more effectively and improve your study habits (this would correspond to Rotella’s advice for _training_ goals). When you do this, you’ll not only better approach your overall goal, but you’ll also feel a sense of achievement along the way.)

#### Focus on Successes, Not Failures

Rotella writes that to overcome challenges, you should also **focus on your successes and let go of your mistakes.** This doesn’t mean you should ignore your mistakes completely. Instead, you should learn from them and then let them go. Wallowing in your mistakes doesn’t improve your performance but only weighs you down and depletes your confidence.

(Shortform note: If you have trouble letting go of your mistakes, even after gleaning a lesson or two from them, consider using the 10/10/10 test: Ask yourself how you’d feel about the mistake 10 weeks, 10 months, and 10 years from now. By changing your perspective, something that might feel catastrophic in the moment may seem far more insignificant, which can help you move on from your mistakes.)

Rotella advises athletes in particular to spend no more than 10 to 20 minutes reflecting on a mistake. When you think about your mistakes, consider how well you followed your training and whether you let your conscious mind get in the way of your performance instead of trusting in your subconscious. Once you’ve reflected on these points and figured out how to do better next time, move on.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, it might not be helpful to dwell on your mistakes immediately after they happen. If you find this to be the case, consider scheduling a time to worry about your mistakes later. Choose a time, place, and duration and then write down the mistakes you want to reflect on at that time. Postponing your reflection for a later time allows you to focus on the present moment. You might also find that your mistakes no longer bother you as much as they once did.)

#### Find Support in Others

Another way you can grow from challenges and setbacks is by **finding people who can give you advice and support you with your goals** , Rotella writes. However, you must also be selective about whom you listen to and learn to distinguish helpful feedback from unhelpful feedback. If you take everyone’s advice, you'll end up experimenting with different and often contradictory approaches that will only leave you confused, distracted, and frustrated.

To determine who to listen to, Rotella suggests you first find the right people to support you. They should be optimistic and encouraging, yet willing to give you honest and constructive feedback. They should also share your vision and values. He then advises that when you find people you trust, you should treat them with respect and listen to their advice.

(Shortform note: In _Who Will Cry When You Die_ , Robin Sharma suggests assembling a support group of three to four people. He adds that these people shouldn’t just be there to offer you advice and feedback that you can trust, but you should also have something to offer _them_. Consider arranging weekly meetings where you can support one another with your challenges.)

Even when you trust someone’s opinions, though, you still shouldn’t take their advice without thought, Rotella writes. He suggests you listen to them, but know your strengths and stick with the techniques that suit you best. Their advice may be sound and their techniques may work for others, but they may not match your natural strengths.

Listening to the opinions of people you trust ensures you get constructive feedback that helps you improve rather than unhelpful feedback that damages your self-confidence. Thus, Rotella advises that once you’ve identified people you trust who can give you feedback, you tune out feedback from everyone else. This includes other experts who want to offer you tips, as well as negative and unhelpful people who may try to discourage you. Rotella advises you to ignore these people and not let them affect your confidence or performance.

> **How to Recognize Helpful Feedback**
> 
> Many experts agree on the importance of learning how to receive feedback well, and they provide additional tips to consider alongside Rotella’s.
> 
> In _Think Big_ , Grace Lordan writes that one way to distinguish helpful from unhelpful feedback is to decide, before you seek feedback, what kind of feedback you _won’t_ accept. For example, if you’re a musician, you may decide not to take advice about changing the genre of your music. By deciding this ahead of time, you can ensure you stay true to your identity. This can also help you identify advice that goes against your natural strengths.
> 
> While Rotella advises you to only listen to the advice of those you trust and ignore the rest, other experts propose a more nuanced approach. In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young suggests you accept feedback differently depending not on the person who’s giving it, but the type of feedback they’re giving: outcome, informational, or corrective. Young suggests you only seek corrective feedback—which identifies your weaknesses and suggests ways to improve—from reliable authorities. But you can accept outcome feedback (which evaluates your results) and informational feedback (which points out your mistakes) from a wider range of sources.
