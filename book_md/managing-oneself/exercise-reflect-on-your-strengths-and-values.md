## Exercise: Reflect on Your Strengths and Values

Drucker says that self-reflection is the first step towards self-management. In this exercise, you’ll apply his techniques of self-reflection and start thinking about your strengths and values.

* * *

Looking back on the last 12 months, identify an achievement that came from working from one of your strengths. How did this strength help you to succeed?

Which two to three values do you consider to be the most important in your work life? Examples of commonly held work values are accountability, balance, creativity, honesty, independence, and reliability.

What two to three values does your company expect you to show? These can be values stated in materials such as a company handbook or values that you infer from feedback from your manager.

Describe one instance where your values aligned or clashed with your company’s values. What do you think this experience says about your fit with your current position?
