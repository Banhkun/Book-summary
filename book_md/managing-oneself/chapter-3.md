## Chapter 3: How to Put Self-Reflection Into Action

In the previous chapter, we discussed various elements of self-reflection that Drucker recommends to manage yourself so that you learn who you are and what your personal recipe for career success is. In this chapter, we’ll look at how to put that advice into action.

Drucker outlines two suggestions: First, we’ll explore his ideas on setting targets. Then, we’ll discuss his ideas on managing relationships with people in your working life.

### Use Goals to Excel in Your Role

Once you’ve thoroughly worked through the stages of self-reflection, you should have identified what your strengths are and the kind of job where you produce excellent work. Drucker recommends that you then answer the question, “How can I excel in my current role?”

**You excel by making a notable difference to your workplace using your strengths** and other kinds of self-knowledge. Do this by setting a work-related target and then working backward to make a step-by-step plan for achieving it.

Drucker gives several target-setting recommendations, including:

  * The target should engage your strengths.
  * It should be an ambitious target that you’ll have to push yourself to achieve.
  * It should be specific, with easily definable and measurable results.
  * It should have a deadline in the near future, with a maximum deadline of 18 months. 



An example of such a target would be the manager of a team at a call center deciding to reduce the time callers spend waiting to speak to an agent by 15% within a year. This manager would work backward from 12 months away to figure out how to achieve this goal, noting that they’ll need to check that the call center agents have access to the software they need to handle calls and that they’re motivated to help people efficiently. These two factors would dictate the manager’s top priorities for the forthcoming months.

> **Setting SMART Targets**
> 
> Drucker’s advice on targets and his specific ideas around what kind of target to set are similar to the “SMART” target model outlined by George Doran _._ Doran said that every target should be:
> 
>   * **S** pecific: The target should clearly identify a desired outcome.
> 
>   * **M** easurable: The results should be easily measurable.
> 
>   * **A** ssignable: The tasks needed to achieve the target should be assigned to specific people.
> 
>   * **R** ealistic: The target should be achievable within the current circumstances.
> 
>   * **T** ime-bound: There should be a clear timeline for all steps of the target.
> 
> 

> 
> Doran found that adding the “SMART” aspects to the targets made it more likely that the target would be achieved.
> 
> The SMART target method and Drucker’s guide for target setting both agree that targets should be specific, measurable, and time-bound. However, the techniques differ in that Doran’s SMART targets technique works for targets set _by_ anyone _for_ anyone, as they are assignable, whereas Drucker’s targets are ones that you set for yourself. Moreover, the SMART target technique calls for a realistic target, whereas Drucker incites you to push yourself to achieve an ambitious goal, not necessarily considering how feasible it might be. He may justify this by saying that the target is achievable if you’re working from your strengths.

### Managing Your Professional Relationships

Now that we’ve discussed one part of Drucker’s plan to put self-reflection into action, we’ll analyze the other, which concerns managing your professional relationships.

Managing your professional relationships is an essential component of building trust with others, according to Drucker. **Trust gives you credibility,** creating a pool of people who know your skills and track record. Another reason why trust is important is that most jobs involve working with other people in some capacity, so if you can’t foster trust and collaborate well, it’ll hinder your ability to advance.

> **Trusting Your Colleagues**
> 
> Author Simon Sinek would agree with Drucker on the importance of trust between colleagues, and he outlines a further reason why trust is important in his book _The Infinite Game_. Sinek argues that trust between colleagues is a core component of workplace psychological safety. This allows you to open up to your colleagues and your boss (and vice versa) if you need help or if you made a mistake, which you may be afraid to do if you don’t trust those around you.
> 
> A sense of trust in the workplace therefore leads to people catching and rectifying problems early on, rather than fearful employees sweeping potential issues under the rug until they become difficult to solve.

#### Communication With Colleagues

Drucker gives a strategy to build trust and improve the quality of your working relationships. Just as you now know your own preferences, you must recognize that **everyone you work with has their own strengths and values** —Drucker recommends that you find out what those are. You do this by communicating with them.

He says to begin by describing the results of your self-reflection to your colleagues and then asking them to tell you the same information about themselves. You must also observe your colleagues closely to gain as much information about them as possible. This allows you to **understand each other and work together more effectively** , complementing each others’ preferences. Drucker’s advice applies up and down the hierarchy, helping you to manage your managers. For example, you might start communicating with them in a style that suits them.

> **How to Get to Know Your Colleagues**
> 
> Drucker is clear on the benefits of sharing the insights of your self-reflection with your colleagues and manager and on getting them to do likewise, but he doesn’t give an exact template for how these conversations should take place. This raises several problems: A discussion about your own strengths and values would possibly make for some stilted water cooler chat, and it’s hard to know how to encourage your colleagues to invest equally in this process.
> 
> _Forbes_ gives some more concrete suggestions of how to get to know your colleagues’ working style. They recommend asking your colleagues about the challenges they face and offering to assist them. This links to another step they suggest: to help your colleagues so they feel obliged to help you in turn. They also advise you to explain the benefits of effective collaboration to your colleagues, such as the possibility of a bonus, to open the gateway towards accommodating each other.
