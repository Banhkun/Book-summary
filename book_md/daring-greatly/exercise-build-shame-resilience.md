## Exercise: Build Shame Resilience

Identify a recent experience in your life where you felt shame and the impact it had on you.

* * *

Describe your experience of it. How did it feel in your body? What messages did it communicate to you about yourself?

Now, letâ€™s take a look at this experience again, but with critical awareness. Are the shame messages rational or realistic? Is there a gap between how you want to be seen, and what you think others expect of you?

Considering this experience further, did you feel willing to engage with others about it? How did you think others might see you if you were to share your shame?

A crucial element of shame resilience is speaking about your experience. What are some ways you can share your experience when you encounter shame in the future? Who in your life might you feel willing to reach out to?
