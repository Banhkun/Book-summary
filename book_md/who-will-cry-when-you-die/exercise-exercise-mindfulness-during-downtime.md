## Exercise: Exercise Mindfulness During Downtime

Most people have times during the day in which they regularly “tune out.” This might be on the commute, during a class, or in front of the TV at the end of the day. Rather than disconnecting, you can actually use these times to practice mindfulness.

* * *

Identify one or two times during the day during which you normally disconnect from reality. What are the circumstances in which you do this, and how do you disconnect? (For instance, you might disconnect on your train ride home by listening to music or scrolling through social media.)

Note down why you zone out during that time. (Are you exhausted? Bored? Uninspired?) Be as specific as possible.

Write down a way you can instead be mindful during that time, taking into account _why_ you zone out in the first place. Don’t force yourself to be mindful in a way that isn’t conducive to the state you’re in. (If, for instance, on your homebound commute, you zone out because you’re exhausted, you might be mindful by tuning in to your body and sense how exhaustion feels. You might not want to try being mindful of the scenery, as that might simply be too taxing at that moment.)
