## Exercise: Use Mistakes to Grow

View your mistakes objectively as learning opportunities, rather than as personal shortcomings.

* * *

Describe a moment in the last month when you made a mistake and the context in which you made the error. (This can be a big or a small mistake.)

Write down _why_ you made that mistake—what logic or reasoning were you following? (For instance, if a work presentation didn’t go well, you might note down that you were trying to implement new and unfamiliar feedback or that you were working with imperfect knowledge of the topic.) Be specific and objective—don’t justify a mistake by simply writing down that you’re “bad at presentations,” for instance.

Now, imagine the very same situation that prompted your mistake will arise again. You cannot avoid it, but you can change how you approach it based on what you learned from your reflection on your last mistake. Write down how you’ll apply that learning to this new situation. (For instance, in your next presentation, you’ll be sure to get the resources you need to be fully informed or ask follow-up questions about feedback you don’t understand.)
