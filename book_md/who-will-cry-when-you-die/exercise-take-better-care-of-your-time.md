## Exercise: Take Better Care of Your Time

Assess how carefully you spend your time and make necessary changes to spend it more effectively.

* * *

Pick a recent day to perform a time analysis on. Write down what your _planned activities_ were for that day and the amount of time you wanted to allocate to each activity. Ensure each minute of the day is allocated in some way, even if it was just for downtime. (Don’t write down how you _actually_ spent your time—we’ll look at that in the next step of this exercise.)

Now, note on your schedule when you were pulled away from the task or activity you should have been doing. (For instance, if from 8:30 a.m. to 8:50 a.m. you meant to eat a peaceful breakfast but actually spent that time frantically searching for an article of clothing to wear to work, make note of that.) How many activities did you fully accomplish? How closely did you stick to your ideal schedule?

Finally, for each time you were pulled away from the task at hand, note how you might prevent this from happening in the future. You’ll have more control over certain distractions than others, and there may be distractions you simply cannot ignore—for instance, when your boss needs you. But wherever possible, devise a defense mechanism to deal with incursions on your time.
