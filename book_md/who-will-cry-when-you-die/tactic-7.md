## Tactic 7: Practice Kindness

Sharma also discusses kindness as a tactic to develop your control over your life and steer it toward your purpose. We’ll first describe why Sharma feels kindness is integral to pursuing your purpose. We’ll then cover six ways in which you can spread kindness to yourself and others.

### Be Kind to Yourself and Others Every Chance You Get

Sharma’s recommendation is to simply **be kind to yourself and others as often as possible**. When you do this, you more effectively pursue your altruistic purpose in life. Let’s say your purpose is to add value to your community. When you perform community service with a kind disposition, you add more value than if you had a sullen or even neutral disposition.

(Shortform note: Beyond enabling you to more effectively pursue your purpose, practicing self-kindness has other benefits. Being kind to yourself turns off your body’s threat response, thereby calming your heart rate and reducing damage to your immune system. In this relaxed, unthreatened state, your body can regenerate and heal. Being kind to others, in turn, can have a positive impact on your mood and self-esteem.)

Here are six strategies Sharma recommends to spread kindness:

#### Strategy #1: Laugh Intentionally Every Day

One way to be kinder to yourself is to **find a reason to laugh every day** , says Sharma. Laughter has stress-relieving and energizing properties that make your life more pleasant.

(Shortform note: As Sharma suggests, laughter has scientifically-proven health benefits: It can increase your oxygen intake, which stimulates your muscles, lungs, and heart. Laughter can also even enhance the functioning of your immune system and ease pain.)

#### Strategy #2: Send Kindness When You Spend Money

When spending money, spread kindness spiritually by **being grateful that the money came to you and passing it along with kind wishes** , suggests Sharma. Gratitude is a form of kindness to _yourself_ because it makes you aware of the blessings in your life. Furthermore, by wishing that the recipient benefits from your money, you enhance your capacity for compassion—a form of kindness to _others_.

(Shortform note: You can deploy gratitude to make your life better outside the realm of monetary transactions—for instance, to build new good habits, writes _Atomic Habits_ author James Clear. When implementing a challenging habit—like regular exercise—feel grateful that you have the mobility to exercise, rather than fixating on any inconveniences of working out.)

#### Strategy #3: Send Thank You Notes

One way to _practically_ spread kindness to others is to**send thank you notes** , writes Sharma. This small act of gratitude can have a hugely positive effect on the recipient.

(Shortform note: Sharma recommends writing more thank you notes, but this is a form of communication that’s become somewhat forgotten in the digital age. To send an effective thank you note, get to the point of the message—the thanks—quickly and specify how or why you are thankful. End by expressing how you can repay the kindness—by inviting the recipient out for coffee, for instance.)

#### Strategy #4: Forgive Others to Be Kind to Yourself

Sharma believes **you can be kind to yourself by** **forgiving others quickly**. When you forgive, you relieve yourself of the burden of carrying negative feelings and make room for happiness.

(Shortform note: In _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living,_ Dale Carnegie recommends an extra, important element to the act of forgiving: actually _thanking someone you feel has wronged you_ if they taught you something. For example, if a motorist yells at you for not having your headlights on, thank them—or send mental thanks—for letting you know.)

#### Strategy #5: Be Kind by Being Humble

Humility is a great way to spread kindness, claims Sharma, because it shows others you’re open to and respectful of their ideas. By being humble, you signal to others that you’re aware you don’t know everything (and never will) and that you’ll listen to them with an open mind.

(Shortform note: Humility isn’t just a way to spread kindness—it’s also an important tool for having difficult conversations. As the authors of _Crucial Conversations_ discuss, a combination of humility and confidence lets you speak clearly while being open to learning and changing your mind.)

#### Strategy #6: Add Value by Educating Yourself

Finally, **spread kindness by acquiring specialized knowledge and sharing it** , says Sharma. When you contribute something new to a project, conversation, or relationship, you add value, and others can benefit from your insights. If, for instance, a grandparent is developing Alzheimer’s disease, educate yourself about supporting someone with this disease and implement that learning to make your grandparent’s life better.

(Shortform note: _Ego Is the Enemy_ author Ryan Holiday also makes an argument for constantly educating yourself, but his motivation is attaining personal success rather than spreading kindness. Holiday claims that being a constant learner allows you to continue growing, thereby continuing to excel in your field.)
