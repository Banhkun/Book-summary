## Exercise: Take Smarter Risks

Assess the benefits and disadvantages of risks to strengthen your risk-taking muscle.

* * *

Note an area of your life in which you feel you’re holding yourself back. Describe what you wish to do or try more in that area. (An example area might be your social life, and your wish might be to meet more neighbors.)

Now, describe the benefits you’d gain by taking more risks in the area you noted. (For instance, if you take risks that make you more social in your neighborhood, you might make friends to take walks with.) List as many benefits as you can.

Next, describe the beliefs or fears that underpin your reticence to take risks in this area. What is keeping you in your comfort zone in this area of your life? (You might fear, for instance, that you won’t have anything in common with your neighbors or that everyone in your neighborhood already knows each other well.) List as many fears as you can.

Now, think about the fears you just listed and consider how likely they are to occur. Additionally, reflect on how you might reduce the chances of those fears being realized or mitigate the discomfort that might arise if they are realized. (For instance, if you’re afraid you won’t have anything in common with your neighbors, you might simply initiate a casual conversation about an interest of yours and see how they react.)

Now that you’ve completed this exercise, how do you feel about taking risks in this area of your life? Are you more or less likely to take the risks you want? Explain your answer.
