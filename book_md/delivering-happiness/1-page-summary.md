## 1-Page Summary

According to Tony Hsieh, the former CEO of online clothing retailer Zappos, happiness is good for business. Happy employees work harder and more efficiently, and happy customers spend more money.

So how can you make your customers and employees happier and maximize profits? In _Delivering Happiness,_ Hsieh says the answer lies in implementing three principles: **Encourage a healthy business culture, provide great customer service, and invest in continuing education**. In this guide, we’ll explore these three guiding principles that made Zappos a successful company.

### Foster a Healthy Culture

While Hsieh never provides a concrete definition of company culture, we’ve used his discussions on culture to define it as follows: **Culture is the standard behaviors and beliefs that employees maintain both in business settings and in their personal lives.**

For example, many companies nurture the cultural belief that customer satisfaction is a priority and encourage employees to behave respectfully toward colleagues and customers. These behaviors eventually become cultural workplace habits, and employees start applying them in their personal lives as well, considering other people’s needs before their own and treating everyone respectfully.

**It’s important to have a culture that reflects your business’s mission** so that your employees will habitually behave appropriately to advance that mission. For example, Google’s mission is to make information universally accessible. Behaviors and beliefs that fit this mission include encouraging curiosity and valuing transparency. Employees with these traits will approach their jobs with open minds and determination to innovate and improve information accessibility, advancing Google’s mission. However, if Google’s culture didn’t reflect its mission, instead prioritizing profit over customer satisfaction or accessibility, employees might suggest and implement policies counter to the mission (such as putting information behind paywalls).

> **Company Culture’s Disputed Definition**
> 
> Most people agree that corporate culture involves the behavior of a company’s employees, their beliefs, or as Hsieh argues, both. Those who prioritize behavior say it doesn't matter what employees believe as long as they behave in a way that supports the company’s mission. Those who emphasize belief argue that it doesn’t matter what specific behaviors employees engage in: As long as they believe in the company’s mission, they’ll act in accordance with that mission.
> 
> Hsieh’s definition is the most comprehensive, including both behavior and belief as important factors in achieving a company’s mission. This is fitting given that people are composed of both their beliefs _and_ behaviors, and the two are interlinked: for instance, certain beliefs encourage certain behaviors. Thus, aiming to influence just one of these factors through company culture is arguably reductive.

#### The Importance of Protecting a Healthy Culture

According to Hsieh, a company's culture grows organically from its employees. As such, you must hire people who improve and uphold the desired culture.**Employees who don’t uphold the company's culture can change or damage that culture.**

Hsieh says most businesses encounter this problem because they hire employees that’ll bring them high profits without considering how these employees will impact the company’s culture. Most of these employees only focus on making money, rather than supporting their coworkers and the company. This influx of money-focused employees degrades the culture from a supportive, enjoyable environment to a miserable one.

(Shortform note: Companies that focus too much on profits rather than developing a healthy culture develop "toxic cultures” that push employees to meet impossible standards of profit and efficiency. To meet these standards, employees take shortcuts and illegal actions, such as lying on balance sheets to make the company seem more profitable than it really is, thus making the culture even _more_ toxic. When these illegal actions are exposed, the company usually blames individual employees instead of the culture. They distance themselves from the issue to save face and refuse to acknowledge the larger, systemic problems: the lack of support and toxic culture that inspired the employees’ actions.)

#### How to Assess and Nurture a Healthy Culture

If culture grows naturally, as Hsieh maintains, how can you assess what your culture currently is? Hsieh suggests asking your employees. **Because _everyone_ involved in a company influences its culture, gaining every perspective on that culture is important.**

(Shortform note: While Hsieh says it’s important to gain every employee’s perspective on culture, he doesn’t say _how_ to ask all employees for this feedback. Some HR experts argue that surveys are the most effective method of gaining employee feedback. Use comprehensive yearly surveys and short weekly or monthly surveys to gain perspective on your entire company’s culture. Yearly surveys let you track large-scale problems, and shorter, more frequent surveys let you track smaller issues and catch problems before they escalate.)

##### Create a List of Cultural Principles

Once you’ve gained an understanding of your culture, you can work to nurture its good qualities. Hsieh recommends **formalizing your culture into a set of principles.** Some common principles include prioritizing customer experience, embracing change, and taking personal responsibility. Making a list concretizes your culture and makes it easier to communicate and enforce the principles that’ll support your company’s mission.

This step should also rely on employee testimony: You’re not establishing a set of principles you think the company _should_ have. You’re discovering those good qualities your employees believe the company _already_ has so you can nurture them.

> **Principles Are More Complex Than Hsieh Suggests**
> 
> Patrick Lencioni (_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_) disagrees with Hsieh's assessment that your principles should be solely based on the good qualities your company already has, claiming the matter is more nuanced. He argues that there are four types of principles:
> 
>   * **Core principles:** These are**** principles selected and enforced by the executives of a company. They form the cultural cornerstones of the company.
> 
>   * **Aspirational principles:** These are**** currently unattained principles that you want the company to achieve.
> 
>   * **"Permission-to-play" principles:** These are the basic standards of honesty and integrity that every company requires from its employees.
> 
>   * **Accidental principles:** These are principles that stem from employees and spread throughout the company over time. These principles usually form from the shared interests and personality types of coworkers.
>

### Zappos’s Culture

Now that we've covered Hsieh's general ideas about creating a company culture, let's look at how he fostered Zappos's culture specifically. Zappos began nurturing its culture early in the company’s life. Based on his employees’ suggestions, Hsieh refined Zappos’s culture into ten defining principles. We’ve synthesized these into three critical categories: friendship, support, and innovation.

#### A Culture of Friendship

**The first principle defining Zappos’s culture is friendship,** Hsieh explains.**** Employees who are friends with their coworkers are happier, which inspires them to do better work and makes the office environment more enjoyable. In addition, employees that are friends work better together in difficult times.

(Shortform note: Research supports Hsieh’s belief that friendship is important in the workplace: People who have friends at work are more productive, dedicated, and happy. You can encourage friendships at work by creating an environment of communication, humility, and compassion. Managers can foster such an environment by exemplifying these qualities themselves, as their employees will likely follow their lead.)

**Zappos encourages friendship by building it into the hiring process**. For example, in the company’s early days, the hiring team considered if they would enjoy spending time with each potential employee outside of work. If the answer was “no,” they wouldn’t hire that individual.

(Shortform note: Zappos initially used the potential for friendship as a barometer for hiring new employees. However, only hiring people you like and who share your values and interests can lead the company to lose diversity of experience or thought. Instead, hire people who add to the culture, rather than conform to it. These individuals have different values and perspectives than your existing employees, which means they add nuance to your culture and new ideas to your company. These additions ensure that your culture doesn’t stagnate and instead continues to innovate and improve.)

#### A Culture of Support

The second principle of Zappos’s culture is supporting employees, Hsieh says. **Support means recognizing what’s best for your employees’ happiness and productivity and fulfilling that need, even if it means losing money in the short term.**

For example, your employees might need affordable childcare so they can focus on work instead of worrying about their children. To meet this need, you might institute a program to help parents pay for childcare or even provide childcare in-house. These solutions cause a short-term loss in service of long-term growth fueled by employee happiness and productivity.

(Shortform note: Recognizing and providing for your employees’ needs, rather than the needs of the business, requires employee-level empathy. This means respecting that your employees have lives and goals outside of their jobs, rather than pushing their personal lives and needs aside in favor of profits.)

##### How Zappos Provides Support

**One of the things employees need to be happy and productive—and that Zappos provides—is trust and empowerment to make decisions,** Hsieh argues. The employees on the “front lines” of a department are usually the best equipped to understand and handle that department’s problems. Supporting these employees and their suggestions shows that you respect them and empowers them to solve problems faster.

(Shortform note: Paul L. Marciano agrees with Hsieh’s emphasis on trust and empowerment in _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work. _He outlines three main steps to empowering employees: First, share information with your employees about the company’s goals and procedures so they can work to fulfill those goals. Second, ensure your employees have all the resources needed to complete their tasks. Finally, step back and let your employees use the information and resources you've provided. Let them try new things and learn from their mistakes.)

**Another thing employees need to be happy and productive is financial security.** Zappos provides financial security for its employees by offering 100% medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage for all employees.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that offering employees such comprehensive insurance packages makes them healthier and less stressed. This decrease in stress and increase in health makes employees up to three times more productive than employees with less comprehensive insurance. Also, offering insurance can reduce operating costs: Employees will often take lower salaries in exchange for insurance, since buying insurance coverage directly often costs more than a salary increase would cover.)

#### A Culture of Innovation

**The final principle of Zappos’s culture is innovation.** Innovation is vital for any company, Hsieh maintains, because companies fail when they stop improving. The only way to maintain success is constant evolution.

(Shortform note: Many people stifle their company’s innovation because they won’t hire people who are smarter or more skilled than them and who may thus help them to improve. In _The Art of Thinking Clearly,_ Rolf Dobelli calls this “social comparison bias.” Encourage innovation and maintain your company’s success by hiring the smartest and most talented people you can, even if they’re smarter or more talented than you.)

**Innovation also contributes to employee happiness.** Following the same patterns and processes at work becomes stifling over time and can lead to employee burnout, Hsieh explains. On the other hand, innovation brings a constant sense of excitement and growth to a company, making people more engaged and happier at work.

(Shortform note: Innovation’s relationship with happiness is a two-way street: Innovation inspires happiness and happiness inspires innovation. When employees have a good day, they’re more likely to come up with original and creative ideas. Thus, if you nurture them, innovation and happiness can work together in a cycle, continually improving your business and making your employees happier.)

##### How Zappos Encourages Innovation

**Zappos encourages its employees to innovate by supporting their ideas, even unconventional ones** , Hsieh says.**** For example, rather than conducting conventional job interviews, the Zappos hiring team created unconventional “speed interviewing.” Like speed dating, prospective employees only have a few minutes to convince the hiring team that they’re a good fit for the job. While the speed interviewing initially needed some trial-and-error to run smoothly, it lets the hiring team evaluate a lot of candidates quickly and determine who might be a good fit.

> **Zappos’s Continued Innovation**
> 
> Zappos continued to innovate its recruitment process after _Delivering Happiness_ was published. In 2014, Zappos replaced its traditional job postings with the Insider program. Instead of filling a single job position, the program focused on cultivating more general relationships with potential future employees: Its recruiters discussed general skills and interests, rather than specific job criteria. Once Zappos understood the potential employee’s personality and skills, it could determine where in the company that person fit and offer a job.
> 
> This program saw initial success, increasing engagement and interest in Zappos as well as the quality of applicants. However, it didn’t work well in the long term, and Zappos returned to offering traditional job postings on their website. This may be a sign to be bold with your innovation but pay close attention to the success of new projects and be willing to pivot to another plan if necessary.

### Provide Great Customer Service

Providing great customer service is another vital component of a successful business. According to Hsieh, **great customer service is being so supportive and adaptable in every customer interaction that you have a positive emotional impact on the customer.** This positive emotional impact is the first step toward forming a healthy and profitable long-term relationship with that customer.

(Shortform note: Hsieh sees a positive emotional impact as the root of good customer service, but how do you generate this positive response? It doesn’t necessarily mean going beyond your customer’s expectations with free perks and bonuses: Studies show that most customers are happier with simple, quick solutions to their problems. Prioritize problem-solving before worrying about dazzling your customers.)

#### Why Is Great Customer Service Important?

Hsieh says **providing good customer service is important because it increases the “lifetime value” of customers.** This is the total revenue that a customer brings to the company throughout their life. If a customer only uses your service once, then their lifetime value is very low. However, if you create an emotional connection through your customer service, your customers are more likely to return to your business and increase their lifetime value.

(Shortform note: Hsieh notes that increasing the lifetime value of customers is important, but he doesn’t explain _how_ important. Studies show that if companies increased the lifetime value of 5% of their customers, they’d increase profits by 100%. This profit increase occurs because you can charge long-term customers more money. By forming relationships with customers, you encourage them to trust you. If customers trust you, they’ll prefer your services over those of a competitor, even if you charge more.)

#### How Zappos Encourages Great Customer Service

Zappos encourages great customer service through its intensive training program, Hsieh explains. **_Every_ Zappos employee goes through four weeks of customer service training and two weeks working in the customer service call center.** Most companies would view this as a waste of time and resources, but Zappos sees it as essential to the company’s success. If all employees are trained in customer service, they can all embody the principles of good customer service—such as attentiveness and politeness—in their interactions with customers, business partners, and the press.

(Shortform note: Hsieh says training _all_ employees in customer service is important. However, others go further, arguing that training internal departments that don’t usually interact with outsiders is most beneficial. Backend departments often complicate the customer service department’s job. However, if every employee is trained to prioritize customer service, they’ll focus on helping the customer service department succeed and thus help to maximize customer lifetime value. For example, an IT department that hasn’t trained in customer service may delay upgrading customer service’s hardware because they value the marketing department more. After customer service training, the IT department would prioritize upgrading customer service’s hardware so they can contact customers faster.)

##### Maintain Communication With Customers

Another vital element of customer service is maintaining communication with the customer. Zappos achieves this through its call center. While call centers are almost ubiquitous in large and medium-sized companies, Zappos sets itself apart from its competitors through its innovative, customer-oriented call center policies.

(Shortform note: Research supports Hsieh’s commitment to making his call centers as effective as possible. Studies show that 80% of customer interactions happen over the phone. In addition, 92% of customers base their opinion of a company on their experiences with that company’s call center. Thus, optimizing your call center can be vital to securing long-term customers.)

Hsieh says Zappos has three unusual call center policies that encourage the kind of communication necessary for great customer service:

**1\. Zappos doesn’t time calls.** Most call centers measure employee success through the number of calls they take in a period of time, which pressures employees to rush calls. Untimed calls mean employees can instead focus on providing great customer service.

(Shortform note: Research supports Zappos’s abandonment of timed calls. Studies show that customers care less about call speed than they do about having their problems solved with a single call. Thus, call centers should judge employee success on whether they can handle customer needs without having to transfer the customer, rather than on how quickly they make calls.)

**2\. Zappos doesn’t use scripts.** This allows employees to use their own judgment when handling customer requests and form genuine relationships with customers.

(Shortform note: Employees can form genuine relationships when they don’t have to rely on scripts because they have the freedom to learn about their customers and integrate that knowledge into their service. For example, a customer may mention that they enjoy hiking. The employee can use this information to connect with the customer and direct them to the company’s hiking boots. The customer will be impressed that the employee paid attention to their interests and is more likely to shop there again.)

**3\. Zappos doesn’t upsell.** Many companies use their call centers to promote upgrades or additional products to customers. However, upselling prioritizes revenue over the customer experience. Instead of trying to sell a customer more products during their call, Zappos indirectly encourages customers to make further purchases by providing great service.

(Shortform note: Zappos’s _call center_ doesn’t upsell, but its website does by tracking items you’ve previously viewed or purchased and recommending items you might like based on that data. This isn’t hypocritical: Customers’ needs change depending on the situation. When customers call Zappos, they just want to solve their problem quickly. However, when shopping online, upselling can help customers find the best products to meet their needs. For example, Zappos’ website might register that you’re shopping for Nike sneakers and display several different style and price options so you can quickly find one you like that fits your budget.)

### Invest in Continuing Education

According to Hsieh, the third and final important element of a successful business is continuing employee education: in other words, constantly giving your employees training and learning opportunities. This training shouldn’t only apply to the skills the employee was hired for, Hsieh adds. Rather, employees should learn about a variety of different skills and areas of knowledge so they can more easily innovate and adapt to new situations. According to Hsieh, **employees are happier and more willing to work when they’re learning and improving themselves.**

(Shortform note: How does learning make you happy? Raph Koster explains in _A Theory of Fun For Game Design _that “fun” is a burst of dopamine you receive when learning something new or mastering a skill. Dopamine generates pleasure and motivation, so learning something new, as Zappos encourages, directly contributes to happiness.)

In addition, **companies are only as good as their employees,** Hsieh explains. Your company can’t grow and improve unless your employees do as well because they’re the ones operating the business. Thus, to keep innovating and maintain your company’s success, support your employees’ innovation and success.

(Shortform note: Hsieh says companies are only as good as their employees and uses this as justification for continual employee education. Others take this idea a step further, saying your company is only as good as your worst employees. Thus, improve the quality of your company by evaluating and training your _weakest_ employees specifically. You’ll improve your profits and the newly-trained employees will likely feel happier and more fulfilled.)

Finally, **continuing education is important for business succession planning.** Many companies train their employees for a single, specific job, Hsieh says. Then, when those employees have to adapt to another role—whether because of a planned promotion or an emergency situation—they aren’t prepared to do so. However, if your company prioritizes continuing education in a variety of skills and areas of knowledge, you’ll create a system where any time a role opens, there’s an employee ready to fill it. Not only does this alleviate stress, but it also provides a clear path of career progression for your employees, giving them a constant stream of goals to aim for.

(Shortform note: In _Principles_ , Ray Dalio agrees that succession training is important. He suggests three steps you can take to ensure your employees are ready to fill new roles. First, select a replacement for each key person on your staff: Just like you’d have backups for important parts of a machine, make sure someone’s ready to fill the gap if any of your essential personnel are unavailable. Second, give these future successors opportunities to see how their predecessors think and solve problems. Finally, let successors handle some of their predecessors’ responsibilities so you can analyze how prepared they are for the role.)

#### How Zappos Encourages Continuing Education

Zappos encourages continuing education through its “educational pipeline” system of training. Hsieh says Zappos’s pipeline operates on a merit badge system: **People who fulfill certain training requirements earn promotions and pay raises.** The first, basic elements of training are mandatory, but after those elements are completed, people can select which merit badges they want to earn and which skills to specialize in.

(Shortform note: This merit badge system works because it offers employees a _choice_ in what to train in. Even minor choices engage intrinsic motivation, where you do something because it’s personally rewarding for you. This kind of motivation lasts longer and is both stronger and mentally healthier than motivation caused by external rewards. Its power is visible in studies of traditional education: College students who select their own courses and assignments turn in better work more consistently. By applying proven theories of educational motivation to its programs of continuing education, Zappos thus encourages its employees to find fulfillment and happiness in their training.)
