## Exercise: Nurture Your Company’s Culture

Hsieh says culture is made of the standard beliefs and behaviors that guide employee interactions. These behaviors can either help your company achieve its long-term goals, or damage its attempts to do so. Thus, nurturing your company’s good cultural qualities is a vital step to creating a successful business.

* * *

Describe your company’s long-term goal or mission. Why is that goal or mission important to you?

Now, describe the good qualities your company culture and employees _already_ have. How can those good qualities help you fulfill your long-term goal? (Note: If you’re struggling to identify these qualities, ask yourself “Are there any behaviors or beliefs that my employees share?” The more common these positive qualities are, the easier they’ll be to nurture.)

Consider each of the positive qualities you described above. Make a plan to nurture each quality. (Be specific and realistic: You might not be able to afford a pay-to-quit program like Zappos right now, but you can focus on cultural fit when interviewing potential employees.)
