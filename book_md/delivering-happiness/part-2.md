## Part 2: Hsieh’s Principles of Success | Chapter 5: Hsieh’s Life Lessons

Now that we’ve covered the three main principles that led to Zappos’s success, we’ll examine the general life lessons Hsieh learned and applied to his work at Zappos _._

Hsieh says he expressed an interest in pursuing entrepreneurship at just nine years old. While his parents expected him to become a doctor, he wanted to make his own choices and direct his own life. **He believed directing his own life would make him happy, and that to direct his own life he needed to make money.** Thus, Hsieh experimented with various business ventures throughout his childhood and young adulthood.

(Shortform note: Directing your life is important for your overall happiness, as Hsieh believed as a child. However, having money isn’t necessarily the key to doing so. Rather than focusing on money, picture the best, happiest version of yourself and plan how to attain that goal. One of the steps to becoming your ideal self may be to improve your financial situation. However, that shouldn’t be your _only_ goal, because it’ll only give you a temporary boost in happiness. The happiness from growing as a person and using your skills to help others is more powerful and long-lasting.)

These early entrepreneurial ventures taught Hsieh valuable lessons in business management that shaped his approach to managing Zappos. In this chapter, we’ll explore these lessons and how they influenced Hsieh’s business principles.

### Hsieh Learned From His Mistakes

Hsieh learned the keys to running a successful business through trial and error. **Instead of giving up during hard times or letting his mistakes define him, Hsieh learned from them** and avoided those mistakes in the future, gradually improving his business sense. This dedication to learning from his mistakes formed the core of his belief in innovation and continual education, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 4 of this guide.

Let’s explore three important life lessons Hsieh learned after making mistakes:

#### Follow Your Passion

One mistake Hsieh learned from was not initially following his passion. Hsieh learned the importance of following your passion shortly after graduating college and starting full-time work. As discussed above, Hsieh wanted to find happiness by directing his own life. He believed making money was the solution, so he selected a job based on salary rather than interest in the company’s mission. However, rather than making him happy, taking a job he didn’t care about left him bored and miserable.

**Hsieh realized that money alone couldn’t build a fulfilling career: He had to be passionate about the _way_ he made money as well. **Thus, Hsieh quit his well-paying but unfulfilling job, focusing on finding happiness through self-direction, rather than money. This passion led him to start his first company, LinkExchange (an internet-based advertisement company), rather than finding another traditional job. While establishing LinkExchange was a demanding task, requiring long hours and hard work, Hsieh’s passion helped him persevere and succeed.

> **Should You Follow Your Passion?**
> 
> Hsieh maintains that following your passion is an important consideration when choosing a career. This is a common idea in the business world that gained momentum in the 1970s and is now almost ubiquitous. However, in _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ , Cal Newport argues that following your passion is actually a terrible way to determine your career.
> 
> There are a few reasons passion isn’t necessarily an indicator for a good career:
> 
> **1\. Motivation is more important than passion.** Motivation has a more direct connection to enjoying your job and making a fulfilling career than passion does. To encourage motivation, find a job where you have independence, the ability necessary to complete your job, and strong connections with coworkers.
> 
> **2\. Few people have passions related to their jobs.** Studies show most people’s passions revolve around hobbies, rather than their jobs. However, many of these people are still happy with their jobs and find them fulfilling. Thus, passion isn’t necessary for a fulfilling career.
> 
> **3\. Passion for a job grows over time.** Studies show that passion and job satisfaction increase over time. As you grow more accustomed to your job, you become better at it, earning greater independence and competence. These factors in turn increase your motivation, as discussed above, and improve your job satisfaction. Only after this do most people begin to see their careers as passionate callings rather than mere employment.
> 
> Rather than tailoring your career to your passion, Newport suggests keeping an open mind and being willing to find passion in whatever job life leads you to.

#### Avoid Overconfidence

**Overconfidence is another dangerous mistake for entrepreneurs to make,** Hsieh says, as it encourages reckless decisions. Hsieh struggled with overconfidence throughout his life: When one business decision succeeded, he would approach the next opportunity as if it was guaranteed to succeed as well. He wouldn’t consider whether the market or his circumstances had changed since his initial success and made bad investments as a result.

For example, after leaving LinkExchange, Hsieh started an investment fund called Venture Frogs. He raised money for the fund easily and his investments were profitable. He was so successful, in fact, that he didn’t worry about the dot-com crash that occurred in 2000. **Hsieh was overconfident because he succeeded in the past, so he didn’t consider how the new circumstances of the crash would affect his business.** As a result, he invested all the fund’s money in companies that started failing in the crash and was unable to raise more.

Hsieh says this experience taught him to **carefully weigh the risks and benefits of a decision before making it, rather than expecting success because he succeeded in the past.**

> **The Dot-Com Crash and Avoiding Overconfidence**
> 
> The dot-com crash occurred because of the same overconfidence Hsieh warns against. People were excited about internet companies and overconfident that these companies would succeed. These people invested in internet companies without properly estimating the risks of said investments. Thus, the fledgling internet companies received a lot of money very quickly.
> 
> In turn, these internet companies were overconfident that the investments would continue, so they didn’t handle their finances properly, spending the money as quickly as they received it to grow larger. When the investments dwindled, the companies went out of business because they were so focused on growing that they didn’t have any savings or sustainable sources of income. The few companies that did survive the crash did so because they were practical about their financial situation, rather than overconfident.
> 
> How can you avoid the kind of dangerous overconfidence that led to the events above? While Hsieh suggests combating overconfidence by weighting the risks and benefits of a decision, he doesn’t explain how to do so. Here are a couple of tips:
> 
> **1\. Be critical of your ideas.** In _Principles_ , Ray Dalio suggests asking yourself, “How do I know I'm right? What am I missing?” before making a decision. These questions force you to use critical thinking, rather than being overconfident that you’re always right.
> 
> **2.Set tripwires for taking action.** It’s easy to become complacent and overconfident in your company’s proven historical approach. However, market situations change quickly, and your responses must change accordingly. Determine in advance what market shifts would necessitate a change in approach—these are your “tripwires.” Also, determine in advance how you’d need to adapt to survive the tripwire. Once the market meets these tripwire conditions, you can quickly adapt to the new situation. If you fail to do so, your business may crumble.
> 
> For example, Kodak assumed the low quality of digital pictures would maintain physical photos’ popularity. If Kodak had set a tripwire for changing its approach—for example, digital resolution improving to a certain point—it could’ve adapted and survived. Instead, Kodak was overconfident in its historical approach, didn’t adapt, and went bankrupt.

#### Insource Your Essential Operations

The final mistake Hsieh learned from was failing to insource essential operations. Before we discuss this mistake, let’s define what essential operations _are_.

In Chapter 1, we discussed the importance of determining your company’s principles. **It’s also important to determine your “core competencies”: the elements of your company that are essential to your operation.** For simplicity, we’ll call these “essential operations.” For example, Hsieh says one of Zappos’s essential operations is its call center since its operation relies on providing good customer service.

**Once you’ve determined these essential operations, you must manage them _within_ your company,** Hsieh emphasizes. Prioritize your essential operations and assign your most dedicated and passionate employees to manage them. Outsourcing work is standard practice for many companies, especially in areas that require less expertise, like call center work. However, outsiders won’t care as much about the overall well-being of the company, which means their quality of work will be worse than that of internal employees.

> **Identifying Your Essential Operations**
> 
> Hsieh defines essential operations as the most important elements of your company’s operation. Others add another element to the definition: Essential operations are the areas that your company is known for excelling in that differentiate you from your competitors.
> 
> Identifying and insourcing your company's essential operations, as Hsieh suggests, isn’t a new idea. Experts have been supporting this division between core requirements and less-important operations for decades. However, while the idea is an old one, the execution of the idea is still difficult for many companies. There are two main ways companies fail to identify and focus on their essential operations:
> 
> **1\. Companies don’t insource _just_ their essential operations.** Some companies try to handle all aspects of their operation internally, rather than focusing on their essential operations. This works for small companies, where it’s easy to manage everything from production and transportation to retailing goods. However, as companies grow and markets globalize, it becomes more cost-effective to outsource less important functions of your company. Rather than trying to be adequate in all areas of your company’s operation, focus your resources on becoming _excellent_ in the most important areas.
> 
> **2\. Companies insource the _wrong_ operations.** It can be difficult to tell what your company’s essential operations are. Consider both your company’s basic function and its principles when identifying them: Your essential operations will support both. For example, Zappos’s having its call center as an essential operation isn’t intuitive if you only consider its essential functions as a shoe vendor. However, once you consider its principle of great customer service, the call center’s importance makes sense.

### Hsieh Focused on Long-Term Goals

**Another important lesson Hsieh learned as he began his career in business was to prioritize long-term goals.** Hsieh explains that many new business owners are so focused on keeping their company in business in the short term that they _neglect_ their long-term goals. This is a mistake: Short-term goals, like making a certain number of sales this week, may keep your company in business, but long-term goals, like expanding into three countries, provide overall direction and a path to lasting success. If you only rely on short-term goals, your company will eventually stagnate and fail.

For example, Zappos originated as a drop-ship company: People ordered through Zappos's website, Zappos sent that order to the shoe manufacturer, and then the manufacturer shipped the package to the customer’s house. This method was less expensive for Zappos because it didn’t need to maintain warehouses or inventory. If Hsieh had only focused on his short-term goals of keeping the company in business and maximizing profits, he would’ve kept the drop-ship model.

However, Hsieh knew that if Zappos was going to succeed long-term and become a key player in the apparel market, it needed to expand to have its own warehouses and inventory. Thus, Zappos stopped drop-shipping, accepting the extra expense and effort needed to create its new, self-sustaining system. **Zappos sacrificed its short-term goals for its long-term ones,** and doing so made it more successful than the drop-ship model ever could have been.

> **Should You Always Prioritize Long-Term Goals?**
> 
> Hsieh says you must prioritize long-term goals over short-term goals. In _Measure What Matters_ , John Doerr agrees that long-term goals are important. However, Doerr adds that whether to focus on short- or long-term goals depends on your situation—defaulting to long-term goals may not work for all companies. For example, if you’re trying to cement your company’s position in the market or survive a difficult financial period, focus on short-term goals to keep your company in business. However, if your position in the market is secure and you want to expand, or if you have more financial freedom, focus on long-term goals.
> 
> Hsieh’s example of how Zappos focused on long-term goals mostly follows Doerr’s recommendations. Zappos was already established when it made the decision to stop drop-shipping, and the majority of its profits came from sources other than drop-shipping. In other words, its position was secure and it could expand without much risk. Thus, Zappos met Doerr’s requirements for focusing on long-term goals. If Hsieh had attempted to stop drop-shipping _before_ Zappos was secure financially and established in its market, the company might have failed.

#### Learning From Poker

Hsieh learned the importance of long-term planning while playing poker. In poker, **there’s a difference between making a long-term decision that can win you the game and making a short-term decision that wins you the hand,** he explains. Winning a hand feels good, just like having high profits does in a business context, but it can’t predict your future success. On the other hand, playing poker with a long-term goal means you might lose the hand but win the overall game, just as Zappos lost money when it stopped drop-shipping but eventually became more successful by doing so.

> **Pre-plan for the Short Term to Focus on the Long Term**
> 
> The best way to focus on long-term goals—in poker and business—is to pre-plan a strong short-term strategy. If you already have a concrete, repeatable plan for your short-term decisions, you can spend more time and energy focusing on the long-term situation, rather than having to continually make short-term decisions.
> 
> In addition, having a plan stops you from panicking if you have short-term bad luck. Rather than repeatedly changing your strategy to overcome that bad luck, overreacting, and later regretting it, you can maintain your strategy and trust that it will eventually lead to long-term success. Or, if you suspect your short-term strategy will no longer have the best possible results, you can devote your time to adjusting your long-term plan while your pre-planned strategy continues in the background.
> 
> For example, in poker, you might pre-plan how you’re going to bet, and in business, you might pre-plan your daily operations (scheduled marketing, a consistent rate of new hires, and so on). Then, if you have several bad hands or something disrupts the market, you can devote time to adjusting your long-term plan while your original strategy takes care of your short-term actions—betting aggressively to scout out your opponent’s tells, or temporarily slowing marketing and staff expansion until the market stabilizes.

##### Changing Tables in Poker and Business

Poker illustrates another way you can become trapped by short-term goals, Hsieh adds. Sometimes when playing poker, you need to change tables and opponents to make a profit. If you only focus on what’s happening at your table, you won’t realize if other tables become more profitable than your table. Instead, you need to pay attention to the whole room, looking for signs it’s time to change tables.

This concept applies to business as well, Hsieh says. **Sometimes, you need to change markets to make a profit.** If you only focus on the day-to-day minutiae of your company and succeeding in your current market, you won’t have the whole-picture view needed to see that your market is losing profitability or that other markets are gaining profitability. You need to take a step back and recognize when changing markets is the best option.

Continuing our example, Zappos’s “table” or market was drop-shipping. If Zappos hadn’t paid attention to its market’s shifting profitability, it might have remained a drop-ship company and gone out of business. However, Hsieh paid attention to the whole market. He realized that drop-shipping was less profitable than his competitors’ practice of direct distribution. Thus, he moved to the “direct distribution” table, increasing Zappos’s sales by over 500%.

(Shortform note: Zappos continued to change “tables” to maximize long-term profits after its initial shift away from drop-shipping. In 2007, it expanded its market from shoes to all kinds of apparel and accessories. As a result, its profits jumped from just below $600 million to almost $850 million.)

> **Changing Tables and Markets in Poker and Business**
> 
> Hsieh says leaving an unprofitable table is an important part of poker and business. But how can you tell that your table is unprofitable? One sign of an unprofitable table in poker is that your table has aggressive players. These players constantly raise their bets, meaning you must risk a lot of money before getting to see how profitable your hand might be.
> 
> In business, this is like entering a market that’s dominated by a monopoly. Monopolies can afford to sell their goods at a loss because they dominate the market. While this risks monopolies’ money—as aggressive poker players risk theirs—it drives other companies, who can’t afford to sell their goods for such low prices, out of business. In this situation, it’s better to change to a more competitive market.
> 
> But how can you change markets? The most important step in this process is researching the new market you’re thinking about entering in three main areas:
> 
> **1.Market demographics. **This includes things like how many competitors your company would have in the new market and how profitable those competitors are. This tells you whether there’s enough business available in the market to make the change worth the effort.
> 
> **2.Customer demographics. **This includes the age, gender, and spending habits of your potential customer base. This information helps you plan your marketing approach and adjust your product so it appeals to your new base.
> 
> **3.Political and regulatory landscape.** This influences the market’s development and can warn you of any upcoming shifts that would affect your company. It can also warn you of any problems with joining that market. For example, if your potential product doesn’t fit a certain state’s regulatory laws, that location isn’t a good fit for your headquarters.
> 
> Once you’ve researched all these areas, you’ll have a solid understanding of the new market and how your company would fit into it. Weigh whether the new market would be better for your company in the long term. If so, take a risk and make the change.
