## Chapter 2: Zappos’s Culture

In Chapter 1, we examined what culture is and how to nurture it. In this chapter, we’ll cover how Zappos developed and nurtured its own culture.

Zappos sets itself apart from its competitors through a culture devoted to making its employees happy. Hsieh believes that **by making its employees happy, Zappos will naturally fulfill its other objectives of great customer service and continued success.**

(Shortform note: Both Zappos’s own success and other authors support Hsieh’s dedication to employee happiness. In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek agrees that happier employees work harder and create better results: By prioritizing your employees over profits, you inspire them to care for the company in return. This means they will freely devote more time and effort to making the company successful.)

Zappos began nurturing its culture early in the company’s life. Shaping the culture at this stage was easy, Hsieh explains, because **Zappos had a small group of employees who joined the company because they were excited about the project,** rather than just looking to make money. Zappos could start nurturing these good qualities from the very beginning.

(Shortform note: Hsieh’s advice on developing and nurturing culture here focuses on building the culture of a new company. But what if your company is already established—how do you develop culture then? While you can’t dictate culture from the top-down, you can _guide_ it. Change your company’s processes to encourage your desired principles. Employee behavior and attitudes will gradually shift to uphold those principles. For example, if you want to encourage efficiency, automate as many repetitive, time-draining processes so your employees can spend their time on more important projects. Your employees will recognize this dedication to efficiency and adopt that principle over time.)

Based on these employees’ suggestions, Hsieh refined Zappos’s culture into 10 defining principles. We’ve synthesized these into three critical categories:

  * A culture of friendship
  * A culture of support
  * A culture of innovation



### A Culture of Friendship

**The first principle defining Zappos’s culture is friendship,** Hsieh explains.**** Employees who are friends with their coworkers are happier, which inspires them to do better work and makes the office environment more enjoyable. In addition, employees that are friends work better together during difficult times.

Zappos nurtures this culture of friendship in a number of ways. First, **Zappos encourages employees to be themselves,** letting their true personalities and interests shine through, Hsieh states. Having a blend of personalities and interests in your team makes work more enjoyable, and employees who don’t have to put on a persona at work are more comfortable and eager to work.

(Shortform note: Encourage your employees to be authentic by learning about their interests and engaging those interests at work. For example, if one of your employees is a stand-up comedian, encourage them to give engaging, humorous presentations. Also, model authenticity yourself: Be open about your personality and interests so your employees feel safe doing the same.)

Second, **Zappos encourages employees to have fun at work.** Having fun increases employee happiness and enthusiasm for work, Hsieh says. This boost to productivity makes up for any time fun activities may take away from work.

(Shortform note: Having fun increases employee happiness and enthusiasm because it triggers intrinsic motivation. Being intrinsically motivated means you do something because it’s personally rewarding for you. This kind of motivation lasts longer and is both stronger and mentally healthier than motivation caused by external rewards. Having fun while working releases positive chemicals in the brain that make the activity personally rewarding and trigger intrinsic motivation.)

**Zappos also encourages honest communication and humility throughout the company.** Hsieh explains that honest communication strengthens relationships and encourages respect, making it essential to Zappos's culture of friendship. Similarly, humility encourages respect because employees focus less on their own accomplishments and more on encouraging and uplifting others, which is also important for relationships.

> **Work Friends: A Danger or a Benefit?**
> 
> Research supports Hsieh’s belief that friendship is important in the workplace: People who have friends at work are more productive, dedicated, and happy. Despite these benefits, only 19% of Americans report having meaningful relationships at work.
> 
> There are several possible reasons why there are so few work friendships. The expectations of professionalism at work can make friendships awkward, as people struggle to find a balance between acting like a friend and a coworker. Another hurdle is the job itself: Coworkers have tasks to complete, which means they rarely spend enough uninterrupted time together to forge a friendship. Finally, friendships can fall apart and the resulting tension harms team efficiency. This threat may discourage coworkers from forming friendships at all.
> 
> You can mitigate these possible friendship-related problems by encouraging an environment of communication, humility, and compassion, as Hsieh suggests. Managers can foster such an environment by exemplifying these qualities themselves, as their employees will likely follow their lead. By encouraging these factors, management shows it supports friendly relationships, which eases the pressure of professionalism and encourages employees to solve conflicts amicably. When managers take these steps, employees can reap the benefits of work friendships with fewer risks.
> 
> Humility is arguably the most important of the above traits to exemplify because it can naturally lead to the other traits. Humility means recognizing that you’re no more or less important than any other person: Once you realize this and treat other people accordingly, better communication and compassion are easier to nurture as well. As such, practice humility by listening to other people rather than being distracted by your own opinions or ideas, practicing gratitude, and being willing to admit when you don’t know something or aren’t the best person to complete a task.

#### How Zappos Encourages Friendship

Zappos doesn’t stop at abstractly encouraging its employees to embody the principle of friendship. It also takes concrete steps to increase friendships among its employees, Hsieh explains. For example, in its early days, **Zappos built friendship into the hiring process** : When evaluating potential employees, the hiring team considered if they would enjoy spending time with the potential employee outside of work. If the answer was “no,” they wouldn’t hire that individual.

(Shortform note: Zappos initially used the potential for friendship as a barometer for hiring new employees. However, only hiring people you like and who share your values and interests can lead the company to lose diversity of experience or thought. Instead, hire people who add to the culture, rather than conform to it. These individuals have different values and perspectives than your existing employees, which means they add nuance to your culture and new ideas to your company. These additions ensure that your culture doesn’t stagnate and instead continues to innovate and improve.)

In addition, Hsieh says Zappos designed its building so every employee must funnel through the lobby to enter or exit. This is less convenient for employees than having several exits, but this strategy **increases the number of positive interactions employees have with each other as they enter and leave work.** Even these brief positive interactions encourage the formation of friendships.

(Shortform note: Experts agree with Hsieh that small, positive interactions between coworkers can grow into relationships which then improve teamwork and performance. However, while brief contact _can_ facilitate these relationships, longer interactions form stronger bonds. To this end, some CEOs go beyond Hsieh’s methods, building longer periods of time into the day for employees to be social without the pressure of wasting company time. While this lessens the time employees spend working, the benefits of positive employee relationships outweigh that loss.)

### A Culture of Support

**The second principle of Zappos’s culture is supporting its employees** , Hsieh says. Employees that feel supported by their employers are happier and more motivated to work hard.

(Shortform note: Many managers neglect employee support in favor of supporting customers because they see employees merely as expendable assets to gain higher profits, while customers actually _provide_ those profits. While supporting customers is important, it’s arguably more important to focus on supporting employees. Studies show that customer satisfaction significantly increases when employees are satisfied with their support at work. Thus, if you focus on supporting your employees, you’ll support your customers—and your bottom line—too.)

Hsieh explains that **support means recognizing what’s best for your employees’ happiness and productivity and providing for that need, even if it means losing money in the short term.** For example, your employees might need affordable childcare so they can focus on work instead of worrying about their children. To meet this need, you might institute a program to help parents pay for childcare or even provide childcare in-house. These solutions cause a short-term loss in service of long-term growth fueled by employee happiness and productivity.

(Shortform note: Recognizing and providing for your employees’ needs, rather than the needs of the business, requires employee-level empathy. This means respecting that your employees have lives and goals outside of their jobs, rather than pushing their personal lives and needs aside in favor of profits. This respect could take the form of maternity leave, flexible working hours, or providing training for promotions.)

#### How Zappos Provides Support

**One of the things employees need to be happy and productive—and that Zappos provides—is trust and empowerment to make decisions,** Hsieh argues. The employees on the “front lines” of a department are usually the best equipped to understand and handle that department’s problems. Supporting these employees and their suggestions shows that you respect them and empowers them to solve problems faster.

> **Supporting Your Employees Through Empowerment**
> 
> Paul L. Marciano agrees with Hsieh’s emphasis on trust and empowerment in _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work. _He outlines three main methods of empowering employees:
> 
> **1\. Share information.** Give your employees information about the company’s goals and processes so they can work to fulfill those goals. If you hoard information on a need-to-know basis, employees will feel untrusted and resentful. They'll try to learn the withheld information through gossip, leading to the spread of confusion and false information.
> 
> **2\. Provide resources.** Give your employees the resources they need to complete their tasks. This includes training as well as physical resources. These resources should remove obstacles that may impede employee progress. For example, training removes a lack of knowledge, and automated systems remove repetitive, time-consuming jobs.
> 
> **3\. Give responsibility.** Give your employees the chance to use the information and resources you've provided. Let your employees try new things and learn from their mistakes. If you’re anxious about delegating responsibility and risking costly mistakes if your employees can’t cope, decide what would constitute an acceptable loss and delegate responsibility within that limit. For example, you might decide that an employee losing $100 by investing in a failed project is an acceptable loss. In that situation, limit your employees' responsibility so they can't invest more than $100 without consulting a manager.

##### Supporting Employees Through Financial Security

**Another thing employees need to be happy and productive is financial security.** Zappos outdoes its competitors in supporting its employees’ financial security in several ways. One of the most well-known examples is its four-week probation period. If employees quit during this time, they receive a $2,000 bonus. This incentive ensures that people stay at Zappos _because they want to work there_ rather than staying out of necessity because they can’t afford to search for another job. This policy inspires and impresses employees, Hsieh explains, and fewer than 1% of employees take the offer.

(Shortform note: After _Delivering Happiness_ was published, Zappos extended its “pay to quit” policy. The company found that some employees succeeded in the company for a while, but later experienced burnout. These burnt-out employees then left the company on bad terms. To encourage employees to leave on good terms before burning out, Zappos removed the bonus’s time limit. In addition, the bonus increases for every year an employee has worked for the company, with a maximum bonus of $5,000. Even with this increase, only 3% of Zappos’s workforce has accepted the offer.)

Besides pioneering new strategies for employee support, **Zappos optimizes common strategies like offering comprehensive insurance.** Zappos provides 100% medical, dental, and vision coverage for all employees, as well as 50% coverage for spouses and dependents of employees.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that offering employees such comprehensive insurance packages makes them healthier and less stressed. This decrease in stress and increase in health makes employees up to three times more productive than employees with less comprehensive insurance. Also, providing insurance attracts experienced employees and can reduce operating costs: Employees will often take lower salaries in exchange for insurance, since buying insurance coverage directly often costs more than a salary increase would cover.)

### A Culture of Innovation

**The final principle of Zappos’s culture is innovation.** Innovation is vital for any company, Hsieh maintains, because companies fail when they stop improving. You can't become comfortable with your current success because others _can_ and _will_ copy your methods. The only way to maintain success is constant evolution.

(Shortform note: Many people stifle their company’s innovation because they won’t hire people who are smarter or more skilled than them and who may thus help them to improve. In _The Art of Thinking Clearly, _Rolf Dobelli calls this “social comparison bias.” __ Encourage innovation and maintain your company’s success by hiring the smartest and most talented people you can, even if they’re smarter or more talented than you. Focus on supporting these people, rather than competing with them, to make your company the best it can be.)

**Innovation also contributes to employee happiness.** Following the same patterns and processes at work becomes stifling over time and can lead to employee burnout, Hsieh explains. On the other hand, innovation brings a constant sense of excitement and growth to a company, making people more engaged and happier at work.

(Shortform note: Innovation’s relationship with happiness is a two-way street: Not only does innovation inspire happiness, but happiness inspires innovation. When employees have a good day, they’re more likely to come up with original and creative ideas. Thus, if you nurture them as Hsieh suggests, innovation and happiness can work together in a cycle, continually improving your business and making your employees happier.)

#### Innovation Relies on Risk and Creativity

**Part of innovation is taking risks and making mistakes.** Zappos encourages employees to take risks and make mistakes because that’s the only way to learn, according to Hsieh. Over time, people who make mistakes have better instincts for which projects will succeed or fail and can choose successful ventures accordingly. Furthermore, trusting your employees to learn from their mistakes lets them better themselves and put their new experience and skills to work for the company, which in turn increases your profits.

(Shortform note: Hsieh claims that making mistakes—or failing—is the only way to learn. However, others argue that you learn less from personal failure than success. To learn from your failures, you need to accept that you failed. However, your brain sometimes refuses to accept failure because doing so damages your self-esteem. To overcome this, remember that failure is normal and not a sign that you’re incompetent or bad—as Hsieh encourages through his mistake-positive perspective. Remembering this trains your brain not to see failure as a threat to your self-esteem, which lets you accept your mistakes, learn from them, and improve.)

**Another element of innovation is creativity.** Creativity itself is a risk because you’re straying from the methods that you're sure work. However, Hsieh points out that creative innovations can also improve existing proven methods.

(Shortform note: Finding ways to foster creativity is especially important in the modern working world, where remote work is increasingly common. While remote work provides flexibility, it stifles spontaneity. This is a problem because spontaneous meetings between coworkers are often the most creative and innovative, as coworkers who didn’t specifically plan to share their thoughts build on each other’s ideas. This free exchange of thought can’t be perfectly replicated digitally. To address this lack of contact and spur creativity, modern companies have experimented with technologies that mimic in-person interactions.)

#### How Zappos Encourages Innovation

**Zappos encourages its employees to innovate by supporting their ideas, even unconventional ones** , Hsieh says.**** For example, rather than conducting conventional job interviews, the Zappos hiring team created unconventional “speed interviewing.” Like speed dating, prospective employees only have a few minutes to convince the hiring team that they’re a good fit for the job. While the speed interviewing initially needed some trial-and-error to run smoothly, it lets the hiring team evaluate a lot of candidates quickly and determine who might be a good fit.

> **Zappos’s Continued Innovation**
> 
> Zappos continued to innovate its recruitment process after _Delivering Happiness_ was published. In 2014, Zappos replaced its traditional job postings with the “Insider program.” Instead of filling a single job position, the program focused on cultivating more general relationships with potential future employees: Its recruiters discussed general skills and interests, rather than specific job criteria. Once Zappos understood the potential employee’s personality and skills, it could determine where in the company that person fit and offer a job.
> 
> This program saw initial success, increasing engagement and interest in Zappos as well as the quality of applicants. However, it didn’t work well in the long term, and Zappos returned to offering traditional job postings on their website. This may be a sign to be bold with your innovation, but pay close attention to the success of new projects and be willing to pivot to another plan if necessary.

### How Zappos Continues to Nurture Its Culture

These days, Zappos nurtures its culture—ensuring the implementation of the three facets above—through the Zappos Culture Book, Hsieh says. Every year, **Zappos employees, vendors, and customers share their perspectives on the company’s culture** in a book. These unedited testimonials—both positive and negative—are available to the general public as an introduction to the company, Hsieh adds.

The Culture Book shows Zappos’s executives how the company’s culture evolved during the year and lets them determine what aspects of that culture to nurture going forward. It also shows Zappos’s dedication to transparency, as well as its dedication to living according to its principles.

> **Additional Benefits of Culture Books**
> 
> There are several benefits of the culture book system that Hsieh doesn’t discuss. For instance, collecting and publicizing nuanced views of the company in this way can make your company appear more welcoming of diverse team members. Not every employee has the same work style or needs—for example, some employees may work best in a social environment, while others need time alone to be most efficient—and publicly sharing the perspectives of many different team members shows your acceptance and openness to supporting these different needs. This encourages a wide variety of potential employees to apply.
> 
> In addition, you can use your culture book to measure employee cultural fit and track any difficulties they experience: If an employee mentions the same issues in several entries, you can evaluate how to better support that employee in those areas or whether the employee is still a good fit for the company.
