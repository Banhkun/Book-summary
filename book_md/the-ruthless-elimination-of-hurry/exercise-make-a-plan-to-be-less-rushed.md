## Exercise: Make a Plan to Be Less Rushed

Comer says that our rushed lifestyles harm our relationships, spirituality, health, and sense of purpose. Reflect on the extent to which your lifestyle is rushed and craft a plan to make your life more lively.

* * *

In what ways is your lifestyle rushed? Recall that rushing is when you’re engaged in meaningless activities that distract you from meaningful ones. (For instance, perhaps you’re addicted to online shopping, which leaves you less time for meaningful activities such as spending time with family.)

A rushed lifestyle can lead to the following perils: weak relationships, less spirituality, poor health, and the feeling that you lack a purpose. Which of these perils do you experience the most, and how does that peril show up in your life? (For example, perhaps you’ve been spending your Sunday mornings shopping online instead of going to church, and as a result, you’ve lost some of your connection to God.)

Consider the peril you wrote about above. Which solution appeals the most to you: slowing your daily tempo or honoring the Sabbath? What’s one step you could take to pursue that solution? (For instance, you could slow your daily tempo by gamifying the process of limiting your online shopping. Perhaps you could set yourself a weekly limit of 15 minutes of online shopping and challenge yourself to stick to that limit.)

As you take steps to make your lifestyle less rushed and more lively, what types of opportunities might you have to say “no” to? (For example, perhaps you’ll need to forgo some tempting online sales.)
