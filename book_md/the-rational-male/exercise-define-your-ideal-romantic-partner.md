## Exercise: Define Your Ideal Romantic Partner

Tomassi says that men need to be clear about what they want and need in a partner so they choose partners who satisfy them and ignite true passion.

* * *

Describe your ideal romantic partner. (Consider qualities like appearance, values, social status, occupational status, how she acts around you, and any other qualities that are important to you.)

Now rank each of those qualities (1 = nonnegotiable, 2 = important, 3 = nice to have). Why did you rank the qualities the way you did?

Looking at your current or previous romantic partners, describe how well those people measure or measured up against the qualities you just listed. See if you can identify any themes, and write down your insights. (For example, do you repeatedly choose people who are too needy or who treat you poorly?)

What can you do differently to find partners who more closely match your list of ideal qualities? (Consider Tomassi’s tips: Prioritize your interests and beliefs, say no when women try to negotiate for sex, and stay connected to your value as a man.)

Describe the kind of romantic partner you want to _be_. What, if anything, would you need to do differently to be that kind of partner? (Consider Tomassi’s advice to build your value by working on your fitness, advancing your education and career, expanding your social network, and being unpredictable.)
