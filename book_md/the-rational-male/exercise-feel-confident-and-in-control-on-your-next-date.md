## Exercise: Feel Confident and in Control on Your Next Date

Tomassi says that men need to define the terms of their relationships with women by being assertive, confident, and in control.

* * *

Describe your most recent date. How did you feel while you were on the date? (For instance, consider whether you felt confident or insecure, sexy or unattractive, and appreciated or taken for granted.)

What do you think caused you to have those feelings? Consider what your date said or did that may have caused them (for example, compliment you, tease you, touch you, or ignore you). Also, consider what _you_ said or did that may have caused them (for example, the clothing you wore, the posture you displayed, or the decisions you made).

What _didn’t_ you say or do that you really wanted to? Why did you hold back? (Consider whether you were trying to be a “nice guy” or whether you’ve internalized some disempowering messages about how men “should” be or act in relation to women.)

If you could re-do the date again, what would you do differently to feel more empowered and in control of the date? (Remember Tomassi’s advice: exude confidence and control, stay connected to your value as a man, and be assertive.)
