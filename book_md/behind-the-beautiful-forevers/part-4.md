## Part 4: Recession and Trial

By 2008, the great recession had begun in the U.S. and started to affect the livelihoods of Annawadi residents in numerous ways. Meanwhile, the court began the trial of Kehkashan and Karam, but it was a long process.

### Global Recession Felt in Annawadi

The U.S. recession affected the local economy of Annawadi in complex ways. As the U.S. stock market collapsed, and other markets lost value, it meant there was less money from foreign investors being channeled into development projects in India. This resulted in fewer construction jobs available at the airport as well as in related businesses like hotels and parking garages.

The price of scrap metal fell, too. This meant that trash pickers couldn’t earn as much for collecting the same kinds of materials. At first, the trash pickers thought things would pick up with the start of the tourist season. In November, Indians from abroad visited for the Hindu festival Diwali, people from the U.S. and Europe visited during December, and Chinese and Japanese tourists visited through January, producing more trash to collect and sort.

But around the same time that Annawadians started to feel the effects of the recession, terrorists began carrying out attacks around Mumbai. They targeted places that served tourists, such as hotels, train stations, and taxis.**The slum dwellers realized the tourist season they were hoping for wasn’t going to materialize because people wouldn’t want to travel to a city besieged by terrorism.** Many slum residents, unable to afford enough food, had to eat rats and frogs again.

#### Thievery: Sunil’s New Line of Work

To continue to earn a living while the economy suffered, Sunil joined a group of boys who stole metals from construction sites around the airport. The group searched for nickel, electroplate, and aluminum because these were the most profitable metals. Almost everything else had fallen in price.

Once, Sunil was caught searching for metal and was beaten by a constable. He worried about being murdered like Kalu if he weren’t careful. One place he frequented for metals was an under-construction parking garage. He liked watching the people of higher classes coming to and from the airport from the roof of the garage. **Though he used to think that he might surpass his current socioeconomic status and join a different class of people in Mumbai, he wasn’t so sure now.**

Occasionally, he and Abdul talked about their quality of life. Both boys agreed that even if they had a bad life, there was still value in being alive. Abdul learned this when Zehrunisa beat him once: He realized that even if she continued to beat him every day, he would still have a life.

Sunil thought that if he, like Kalu, were to die, it wouldn’t matter to people in the higher classes in Mumbai. However, he thought that valuing his own life counted for something, even if others didn’t value it.

### Political Motivation and Reform

The terrorist attacks had demonstrated that people in higher classes were just as vulnerable as anyone else to violence. For example, during the attacks, police officers didn’t know how to use their weapons to stop an attack at a train station. In another instance, officers received calls for help from the maternity ward of a local hospital that was being attacked, but they chose to stay at their station. These incidents motivated people in higher classes to seek reform through new leadership. Parliamentary elections were coming up and a surge of people in the higher classes started registering to vote.

**Political involvement was a departure from how the upper classes usually reacted to adversity: using their wealth to solve problems rather than fighting for fundamental change.** For example, if they disliked the quality of the drinking water, they could pay for a filter rather than demanding water policy changes.

Traditionally, people in lower classes were more likely to be registered to vote because it was one of their only ways to wield power, but they faced obstacles registering to vote. Ahead of the parliamentary elections, some slum dwellers and people from minority groups found that even when they submitted paperwork, election officials wouldn’t process it. Despite attempting to register for seven years, the Husains still hadn’t been granted permission to vote.

### Fake Philanthropy

For a while, it looked like all of Asha’s scheming had amounted to little. She had many hustles, but she still hadn’t succeeded in bringing in enough money to get her family out of the slum. However, her luck changed when some government officials approached her about overseeing funding for a new network of public schools.

The government had received funding, including some from foreign investors, to provide elementary school education to all eligible children in Mumbai. **But it was mostly a facade so the program organizer could divert most of the money to himself and people who would help him.** He wanted to funnel money through a nonprofit that could then disperse it to him and his accomplices. He approached Asha because someone had established a nonprofit for her a number of years ago for a government project that never came to fruition. Nevertheless, it was still a viable nonprofit he could use for his scheme.

The group created documents showing that Asha’s nonprofit had overseen 24 kindergartens for poor students for the past three years. This was enough to get approval for dispersing funds for the new school program to her nonprofit. Her job, then, was simply to receive money into the organization’s bank account, then write and hand-deliver checks to the people the project manager specified.

There was one small hurdle: The checks required two signatures. **Asha approached the woman she’d named as secretary to the nonprofit, but the woman was too fearful they would get caught to sign the checks.** Asha fired her and made Manju the secretary of the nonprofit so she could provide the second signature. The officials told Asha she wouldn’t make much money for herself the first year, but she would make more money later.

In Asha’s opinion, working in the corrupt overcity was easier than trying to survive in the slums. The trick was believing that you wouldn’t get caught and that what you did wasn’t that objectionable overall.

### Failed Elections and Razing the Slums

When parliamentary elections were held, fewer people from higher classes turned out to vote than was expected. As a result, most of the same people were reelected, hopes for government reforms were put on hold, and plans to raze the slums of Mumbai moved forward.

**The government wanted to raze all of Mumbai’s slums and to relocate residents to modest apartments if slum dwellers could prove that they had lived in the slum since 1995 or 2000, depending on the slum.**

Though the apartments would only be 269 square feet, they would have running water. This was such an attractive commodity that investors wanted to cash in. If they could “prove” they were the owner of a hut in a slum and had lived there long enough, they could get one of these apartments for free. Investors started connecting with people in the slums whose huts they could buy, and they had papers forged saying they’d lived there the appropriate amount of time.

Asha helped arrange one such deal. She convinced a young woman with three children in Annawadi to sell her hut, only to have the woman change her mind, feeling tricked and fearful of losing her shelter. She tried to file a police report, but the police were loyal to Asha. Soon after, the person who bought the hut sent a group of drunk men to forcibly remove the family. They dragged the woman out by her hair and dumped kerosene on her last bag of rice as her children cried. **Onlookers thought that Asha had lost her way and began to resent her dealings in the slum.** They had always suspected Asha to be money-motivated, but now it appeared she’d stop at nothing. Unfortunately for Asha, she didn’t even get the commission she’d been promised for helping with this deal.

Officials planned to raze the slum in phases over several years, so residents were hopeful that they wouldn’t be kicked out immediately, buying them time to fight for benefits under the relocation program. In the first phase, the Beautiful Forevers wall came down and the sewage lake was filled in to prepare the ground for something new. Bulldozers turned up old garbage that had landed in the lake, like shoes and even a cooking pot. Annawadi residents had several ideas for what might go on the new site: a cricket pitch, a school, a hospital, or more airport-related infrastructure.

### The Fate of the Husain Family

Karam and Kehkashan’s case was put on a fast track—their trial began after spending months in jail rather than years. If convicted, they faced 10 years in prison. Abdul would face a separate trial with separate charges.

Though the fast-track system shortened the time spent waiting for trial, judges often heard dozens of trials at the same time, holding short hearings for each case each week. So the trials themselves still took months to finish.

Karam hoped for exoneration. **However, he was concerned that the prosecution was planning to call witnesses who hadn’t observed Fatima’s burning or the words Karam and Kehkeshan said to Fatima.**

The first few witnesses troubled them. Someone who worked in the morgue of the hospital where Fatima was treated testified that she’d been burned over 95 percent of her body, as was stated on the falsified medical records. At the next hearing, a police officer said that the Husains’ maltreatment led Fatima to suicide.

**Meanwhile, outside of the courthouse one day, the government official who had taken Fatima’s statement at the hospital tried to pressure Karam into paying her off, saying that the case wouldn’t go in the Husains’ favor if she didn’t.** She said witnesses might embellish details of the fight between the Husains and Fatima, and she herself might do the same to Fatima’s account if she were called to the stand. She said that Karam, Kehkashan, and Abdul would end up in jail. But Karam pointed out that they had already been in jail while awaiting the trial. He said their lawyer would help the judge see their side and refused to pay, opting to let the justice system run its course.

The witnesses the following week offered some hope that the trial would work out in their favor. **One of the witnesses was a girl who lived in Annawadi and testified that she hadn’t actually witnessed the fight. She also said Fatima had been known in Annawadi for starting fights.** Another witness testified that he was angry at the police for calling him as a witness to the case. Though the police had recorded his statement after Fatima’s burning, he too hadn’t actually witnessed the fight or the incident and was unhappy at having to miss work to testify.

Fatima’s husband hoped that the Husains would be found guilty of the charges against them. When Fatima passed away, he’d had to give up his two young girls to a local orphanage because he couldn’t risk leaving them at home during the day while he worked—young girls left alone were vulnerable to sexual assault from strangers. He felt that, indirectly, the Husains had stolen his chance to provide a stable life for his daughters.

When Fatima’s husband testified, he embellished the account of Fatima’s fight with the Husains, saying that in addition to calling her names, they had beaten her with a stone. He hoped this would lend evidence to convict the Husains.

Then, several additional factors made the Husains unsure they’d prevail:

  1. The weather grew warmer and the windows of the courtroom were opened during the hearings. **Kehkashan and Karam were seated so far away from the proceedings that the traffic noise from the street made it impossible to hear what was being said.**
  2. Around the same time, the judge grew impatient with the slowness of the stenographer. The stenographer was supposed to be recording the court proceedings in English, but they were having to translate the proceedings from Marathi. To save time, the judge started dictating to the stenographer, which led to odd or contradictory notes. For example, Cynthia—Fatima’s friend whose trash picking business had failed when the Husains’ started picking up—had said in a statement that she’d seen the fight when she’d actually been home preparing dinner. When the defense lawyer brought her lie to light, the court stenographer wrote down that she had lied _and_ seen the fight.
  3. The Husains learned that a new judge would preside over the case and would have to use the barebones transcript to catch up on the proceedings.



The government official who took Fatima’s statement in the hospital tried for a third time to convince the Husains they should pay her to help resolve the case. This time, she said Fatima’s husband was willing to drop the case in exchange for about $4,000. However, because the case was being brought by the state, it couldn’t be called off for any amount of money. **She hoped the Husains wouldn’t realize this, but they saw through her scheme and refused once again to pay her off.**

Kehkashan and Karam began their new trial with the new judge, who liked to crack jokes and didn’t seem to take the proceedings very seriously. During closing arguments, the judge looked at Kehkashan and quipped that he didn’t even know for sure who he was looking at because she was wearing a burqa, despite her having done so every day in court. Finally, after months of trial, the judge said they were ready to issue the verdict, but first, they’d take a 90-minute break.

After the break, but before the verdict was read, Kehkashan and Karam were put on the witness stand for the first time. **The only question they were asked was what their occupations were.** Kehkashan said she was a housewife because she didn’t want to go into detail about her recent separation from her husband. Karam said he worked in plastics because he thought this sounded more reputable than working with garbage. The judge told Karam that Fatima was dead because of him, but Karam replied adamantly that she had burned herself. The judge found them not guilty of the crime, saying that they hadn’t driven Fatima to suicide.

#### Abdul’s Limbo

While Abdul was in juvenile jail, Zehrunisa had sold his garbage shed to help cover the family’s expenses. Since his release, Abdul had rented a hut in a different part of town to run his business. But he struggled to make money there because the trash pickers in that area already had preferred buyers. He decided to give up this hut, and he drove his family’s van around the state offering to transport recyclables to the appropriate facilities for a fee.

He still had to check in at the jail three days per week to prove he hadn’t fled. Traveling to the jail required taking a whole day, so he only worked four days per week and couldn’t earn as much income as he used to.

Zehrunisa tried to get some clarity on when he would stand trial. When she inquired at the juvenile court about the case, she was told the trial would begin within one to three months. **After 15 months went by, Zehrunisa and Abdul were convinced that he was being condemned to the limbo of awaiting trial forever.**

Despite Abdul’s inability to work a full schedule, his family hoped they would qualify for one of the apartments that would be provided to slum dwellers as part of the razing plans. Additionally, his other siblings were helping support the household by working temporary jobs.

After the special visit from the teacher to the boys’ prison, Abdul had resolved to live a more virtuous life. If most people were like water, he wanted to be like ice—made of the same substance, but elevated above others by how he lived. But as time dragged on, and his trial wasn’t scheduled, he became more disillusioned. He told Allah that he felt as though the ice inside him was melting, and he was becoming water, just like everyone else because of how the world worked: No matter how much he tried to do the right thing and get ahead, he couldn’t.
