## Part 1: The Residents of Annawadi

_Behind the Beautiful Forevers_ recounts the lives of residents of a slum in Mumbai called Annawadi, which sat adjacent to the Mumbai International Airport..

Katherine Boo, a U.S. journalist married to an Indian, spent four years learning the stories of Annawadi residents through reading public documents, conducting interviews, and observing people’s day-to-day lives. She tells the stories of real people—their names are unchanged—and how a globalized world affected them: Despite India experiencing a new era of wealth, opportunity, and increasing development, many people still struggled to survive day-to-day, even when working harder than ever.

In 1991, India began a period of “economic liberalization,” which led 100 million people out of poverty over time. And yet, Annawadi was founded the same year and persisted. Though governments can create policy to nurture the potential of their people, they sometimes just reinforce corruption instead, and people adapt to the system. The poor tried to exploit one another to get ahead, and police and government officials exploited the poor, leaving the poor with little power and few resources. Nevertheless, many still hoped they could get ahead if they simply worked hard enough.

Part 1 introduces Annawadi, its residents, and their daily struggles.

### Annawadi

Annawadi, a half-acre slum, sprang up in 1991 during repairs to a runway of the Mumbai airport. The workers came from the state of Tamil Nadu and decided to stay in hopes they could get additional construction jobs. “Anna” means “older brother” in Tamil, and Annawadi means “land of the Annas.” The land was swampy, and they worked to pack dry dirt into muddy areas to make it livable. The first huts were made of bamboo poles and empty cement sacks.

By 2008, Annawadi had 3,000 inhabitants. Residents lived in one of three areas:

  1. An area with small, one-room huts, often with shared walls. It was built near a sewage lagoon fed by public toilets.
  2. Another area with poorer housing, built by Dalits, members of India’s untouchables caste.
  3. A road where there was no shelter and the poorest of the poor would sleep atop bags of trash they had picked to keep them from being stolen.



The slum’s sewage lagoon was filled with garbage and pollutants. Airport construction workers also dumped waste there in the middle of the night and one time, something in the lake dyed the bellies of animals that slept near its shores blue. **Some people living in the slum made so little money that they had to supplement their diet by catching rats and frogs living near the lagoon, or eating the grass that grew at its edges.**

People suffered air-pollution-related ailments, like asthma, as well as tuberculosis and other diseases.

#### In the Shadow of Wealth

A large concrete wall stood between the slum and main drive to the international terminal of the airport. On the wall, cheerful advertisements hawked luxury items to the “overcity,” or upper classes. One advertised Italian tiles, with the slogan, “Beautiful Forever,” repeated over and over for the length of the wall. Thus, the slum was located “Behind the Beautiful Forevers.”

Despite the slum’s proximity to the airport, only six of Annawadi’s residents held permanent jobs there. One young boy, Rahul, had gotten temp work as a server at one of the hotels next to the airport thanks to his mother Asha’s efforts. As a server in this hotel, he got close to the affluent clientele and their over-the-top parties. He told the other slum dwellers stories of the parties, as well as strict company policies for servers, like not looking directly at the guests. One time, he got into trouble for demonstrating some dance moves at the request of the guests.

Most people did work making cheap goods, like garlands for airport tourists or hanging decorations for people’s car mirrors. Many people no longer felt limited by caste or religious affiliation, and they aspired to better jobs or living situations.

**As India modernized and became sensitive to the image presented by the poverty of slums, there was periodically interest in razing Annawadi, but this had yet to come to fruition.**

### Abdul: Trash Seller

Abdul Hakim Husain was a teenager who belonged to one of the few Muslim families in Annawadi. From a young age, Abdul helped his family earn a living by buying recyclable materials and garbage from trash pickers to sell to recyclers. Being adjacent to the airport meant trash was abundant, whether from the luxury hotels surrounding the airport or in the form of food containers littering the road to the international terminal. **The variety of trash coming from the airport and hotels reflected a booming global economy.** In addition, preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics had boosted the price of scrap metal worldwide, making Abdul’s job suddenly more lucrative. He could earn $11 a day taking materials to a recycling facility.

His father, Karam, had taught Abdul the trade of trash buying—for instance, how to bite and smell plastic to identify what kind it was and how much it was worth. But Karam suffered from tuberculosis and couldn’t work any longer.

The Husains were looked down on for being Muslim. Muslims often had trouble getting decent jobs in Mumbai, such as being hired as hotel workers. Even the family’s modest success as garbage sellers drew some suspicion from their neighbors in the slum. Inspired by Hitler, one local political party, Shiv Sena, valued ethnic cleansing and periodically incited riots against Muslims in Mumbai.

Abdul mostly preferred to keep to himself and not talk—he believed that the less he knew about the neighbors, and the less they knew about him, the better.

#### Zehrunisa: Abdul’s Mother

Abdul’s mother,, Zehrunisa, had many obligations to her family and her neighbors. Her husband, Karam, made a payment on land outside of Mumbai where he hoped they could build a more permanent dwelling and where they’d be part of a larger Muslim community. **Karam saw the move as a chance to give his family a comfortable living without frequent exposure to luxury goods they couldn’t afford, like fancy cars and clothes seen near the slum.**

Zehrunisa had doubts about Karam’s dream of moving because:

  1. Living in a predominantly Muslim community might mean losing some of the freedoms she’d found in Annawadi. For example, she was able to confront Karam about things that upset her, which might not be accepted in a more conservative Muslim community. 
  2. With his tuberculosis, Karam might not live long enough to make the move.
  3. Though they had paid for the land, there was no house on it yet. 



So she negotiated with her husband to make their hut in Annawadi more livable instead of continuing to invest in the land in Mumbai.

### Abdul’s Helpers: Sunil and Kalu

Abdul bought garbage from garbage pickers who lived in the slum, and he kept it in a storage shed near his family’s hut. Two garbage pickers he worked with, Sunil and Kalu, embodied the plight facing young boys, especially trash pickers, in the slum: doing hard work for little gain.

#### Sunil

Sunil lost his mother early in his life, and his father had taken him to an orphanage. There, Sunil developed the ability to understand people’s motives. For example, he understood that the nuns running the orphanage would use certain language to persuade foreign tourists visiting the slum to donate goods or money—for instance, they talked about working with Mother Teresa, or about how the children were AIDS orphans—and he understood why the orphanage would accept goods or toys from the visitors, only to turn them around and sell them for money.

**Sunil became a trash picker when he was kicked out of the orphanage at 11 years old because the nuns didn’t want to care for older children.** He returned to Annawadi and learned to work hard to provide for himself, selling anything he could. Trash picking was grueling work, and Sunil worried he had stopped growing and would end up a small man like his father.

Often, his work involved climbing in and out of dumpsters. Risks included getting gangrene, maggot-riddled wounds, and lice. For energy, Sunil sometimes took puffs of tossed cigarettes. Other kids huffed discarded, partially full bottles of the Indian brand of Wite-Out. Eventually, they’d develop swollen bellies and remained severely underweight.

#### Kalu

Kalu was known for two things in the slum—working in a diamond factory and scavenging aluminum and other scrap metal, a lucrative prospect. (The owners of the diamond factory claimed to have a detection system to ensure that employees didn’t steal from the company, but the other boys in the slum didn’t believe it. They insisted Kalu should steal some, even if he had to hide them in his butt.) Often, the industrial facilities that discarded scrap metal would guard the areas or have tall fences with barbed wire. Despite these barriers, Kalu could tolerate making multiple trips over barbed wire fences in a single night.

**Sometimes, police would tell trash pickers where they could find trash in exchange for a cut of the earnings from the materials.** In one instance, the police told Kalu about an industrial facility near the airport without barbed wire fences where he could scavenge. Kalu visited around 11 p.m. one night and found some iron rods, but he was chased off by security and had to leave them behind. He was convinced that the pieces would be taken by another scavenger if he didn’t get back soon, but he needed some sleep first. Sunil agreed to help him by waking him up at around 3 a.m. and accompanying him to the site. Getting there required expertly navigating the airport grounds, swimming through a black, polluted river, and returning the same way carrying the heavy pieces of metal—all in the middle of the night. They then sold these to Abdul.

### Fatima: The Husains’ Next-Door Neighbor

Fatima was the mother of the family next door to the Husains. Abdul and others called her One Leg because she was born with one of her legs tapered below the knee. People made fun of her for the amount of makeup and perfume she wore and for her many extramarital lovers.

As a child, Fatima’s family had kept her at home and didn’t send her to school because of her disability. As an adult, she looked for affection where she could find it, maintaining a revolving door for lovers each day while her daughters attended school and her husband was at work. She was also known for her temper, beating her children or hitting neighbors with one of her metal crutches. Neighbors thought her rage was animalistic, but Fatima disagreed—she was just as human as anyone else, yet because of her disability, she was treated as subhuman.

One of Fatima’s young children, a two-year-old girl, caught tuberculosis, and Fatima was terrified she would get it too. Shortly after her daughter’s tuberculosis diagnosis, the child drowned in a bucket. Fatima claimed it was an accident, saying she’d been at the public toilet at the time. Zehrunisa wanted to believe it had been an accident, but since their families shared a wall, she knew that Fatima had been home at the time. Also, the hut was very small, so it was unlikely Fatima didn’t know the girl was in trouble.

The police came to investigate, but they quickly ruled it an accident. Young girls died in the slums all the time. **Many parents were extremely wary of illness or injury in their children, fearful that treatment would impoverish them even further.** Sickly children of both sexes were often killed. And the phenomenon wasn’t limited to lower-classes—wealthy parents might end a pregnancy of a girl once they found out the sex via sonogram, but slum-dwellers didn’t have access to this technology.

In Annawadi, the Husains’ Muslim community consisted of a man who owned a brothel and Fatima’s family. Though Zehrunisa and Fatima were friends, they clashed frequently, too. On the one hand, Zehrunisa believed that the Muslim families in Annawadi needed to support one another’s religious practices, celebrating holidays together, like Eid. On the other, she disliked how much Fatima beat her children, and she often broke up fights between Fatima and Fatima’s husband.

### Asha: Aspiring Slumlord and Middle-Class Member

One powerful figure in the local community was Asha. In Asha’s childhood, the women in her family went hungry when there wasn’t enough food to go around. She wanted to amass enough money and power to avoid economic hardship, become a slumlord, and eventually, live outside the slum and reach the middle class. A “slumlord” was the person who ran the slum at the direction of authorities and politicians. It wasn’t an official position, but everyone understood the rolee.

Asha found herself on the path to this role after falling on hard times. Her husband was an alcoholic and was often too drunk to work, affecting the family’s economic security. In her twenties, Asha turned to sleeping with powerful figures, like police officers and politicians, to support her family. The money she brought in helped put her daughter, Manju, through college. (Shortform note: The author also implies that Asha’s extramarital affairs ingratiated her with these figures, helping herself gain political or social power.)

#### Asha’s Strategies

Asha aspired to reach the middle class by broadening her network of connections through her political party, Shiv Sena—which promoted ethnic cleansing and distrusted Muslims, making the Husains suspicious of Asha’s work—and by working to make locals support the party. One way she did this was by helping people solve their problems, which in turn could make them sympathetic to her party. For example, she held visitation hours in her hut to help people resolve disputes or seek assistance.

Once, an acquaintance of Asha’s, Mr. Kamble, approached her about a business loan. Specifically, he wanted Asha to give him money from a government-backed loan program for small entrepreneurs even though this had nothing to do with how he’d use the money—he was out of work and needed to pay for heart surgery. **At the time, the Indian government was trying to promote a story of development by lending money to small businesses, but it wasn’t scrupulous about who got the money or what they used it for.** The money was often used for other purposes in exchange for a cut for the officials who handled it.

Though Asha had helped Kamble get a job in the past, she refused his request for a loan, hoping to get a bigger cut later as he grew more desperate. She told him to go to a temple and pray that he would get the money he needed for his heart valve. However, he eventually died without the money for surgery. Asha also staged last-minute events, like protests and rallies, to show support for Shiv Sena politicians.

**Asha wasn’t averse to exploiting the people around her for her own gain.** In the long term, her goal was to sow discord that she could then help resolve for payment, building her family’s wealth so they could one day afford to live outside of the slum. She also hoped to gain political power by being elected a Corporator and overseeing a political ward, or voting district. Though Asha also was supposed to be a teacher at an elementary school, she had her daughter, Manju, do the teaching instead so she could tend to her political obligations.

Asha’s political work reflected part of a larger effort to address issues in India, like poverty and women’s empowerment. However, most of these problems, as well as big ones like corruption and exploitation, continued to go unaddressed. For example, when the government initiated a group in which women pooled their money to give each other loans in times of need, Asha devised a system where women would pool money and give it to women outside of the collective at a high interest rate. But when the foreign press needed a tangible example of India’s progress on women’s economic security, the government would often send them to Asha to showcase her projects.

When journalists visited, Asha often introduced them to Manju, saying that her daughter was going to be one of the slum’s first college graduates and wouldn’t have to depend on a man for her living, which pleased the visitors.

In another instance, Asha helped to cover up fraud by the Corporator of Ward 76, the political district she lived and worked in. Certain elections in India were required to have only female candidates or only people from a certain caste. **To be able to run in a low-caste-only election, the Corporator had faked his caste certificate and ancestry, and won.** When his opponent challenged him in court, the Corporator asked Asha to organize a prayer vigil at a local temple to drum up support for his work. The Corporator didn’t show up as promised, but when he called at 1 a.m. to say he wouldn’t be able to make it, he could hear over the phone that a large crowd had gathered and was pleased that he still had the support of the local people.

### Manju: Different Aspirations

In college, Manju studied English literature, but her school was not very prestigious, so the bulk of her literature homework consisted of memorizing the plots of books and their themes. Her professor tested her on these, and she’d be tested on a state exam as well. She considered herself good at memorization, or “by-hearting,” as she called it.

Manju spent two hours a day teaching grade school in Annawadi. The school was Annawadi’s only school, taught out of Asha and Manju’s home. It was funded through the Indian government with help from a Catholic charity. **Many schools in Mumbai were funded by unscrupulous charities that lined the pockets of the wealthy rather than serving school children.** But the charity funding Manju’s school was better than most.

Manju often used her two hours of school teaching each day as a study tool: She’d teach her students about the plots of the books she was reading for college in order to memorize them.

Asha thought Manju should only teach on days that someone from the government visited to check in on the school, but Manju rejected the idea because she took pride in her work, and she wanted to be a teacher when she finished college.

In addition to her college studies, Manju spent most of her time caring for her family home—gathering water, cooking, cleaning, and more. Covering all of her responsibilities while completing her studies left her only four hours of sleep most nights. People in the slum thought that Manju was exceptionally kind given her demanding schedule, her beauty, and her mother’s network of connections. Manju disapproved of her mother being involved in scandals around the slum, but she tried her best to keep to her misgivings to herself.
