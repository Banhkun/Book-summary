## Part 2: The Husains’ Conflict With Fatima

Abdul’s family soon began work on the renovations Zehrunisa wanted for their home. In the construction process, they upset Fatima, their next-door neighbor. How Fatima chose to retaliate ultimately drastically disrupted the life of the Husain family.

### Hut Renovations

To make their hut more liveable, Zehrunisa and Karam planned to install Italian tiles like the ones advertised on the Beautiful Forever poster, a new shelf near her cooking area, and a small window to let out the cooking smoke.

Despite the constant threat of the authorities coming to raze the slum, no one thought there was anything wrong with the family making renovations to their hut. **They knew that whenever the razing happened, the government planned to relocate families who had lived in the slum since 2000 to apartments, and they figured that families with more established huts stood a better chance of getting accepted into this program.**

Before beginning the work, the family moved out trash and recyclables they were storing in their house, as well as a television they had bought on a payment plan and some other goods. Some of the children guarded the piles while the other children did the work.

Abdul worried that his family’s renovation would make their Hindu neighbors resentful that his Muslim family earned more than they did. He generally tried not to attract attention to himself. Indeed, seeing the piles of things outside, some of Annawadi’s residents began to realize that the family was wealthier than other families in the slum.

#### Fatima’s Anger

The renovation work involved many noisy tasks. To prepare the hut for the ceramic tiles Zehrunisa wanted, some family members were working to break up the stone floor and level it. Abdul was working to install a cooking surface, but to do so, he needed to cut into the wall that separated their hut from that of Fatima, the one-legged neighbor. Fatima periodically called out from her hut to complain about how loud the work was. She had complained the last three times the Husains had done work on their hut. Each time Fatima called out complaining, Zehrunisa would patiently call back, explaining the work they were doing and that it’d be noisy.

**As Abdul was trying to install the cooking surface, he accidentally bumped the wall, knocking mortar dust into a pot of rice Fatima was cooking.** Fatima was upset and went outside to confront the Husains. Zehrunisa met her outside and they began shoving each other. People gathered to watch as the women hurled insults at each other. Fatima demanded they stop doing the work on the wall or Zehrunisa’s family would pay for bothering her, but Zehrunisa contended the Husains had built the shared wall and had a right to do work on their own home. She also said that if they had waited for Fatima and her family to build a wall, both of their families would still be seeing each other naked. Abdul broke up the argument and took his mother by the neck back into the Husains’ hut.

**Fatima went to the police to file a complaint, saying Zehrunisa had beaten her, but the police largely dismissed the incident as too minor a squabble for them to deal with.** Zehrunisa went to the station later to tell her side of the story, and the police officers asked for bribes—technically, the Husains didn’t have a business license for their trash operation, but the police let them keep working in exchange for periodic bribes. However, Zehrunisa was several months behind on payments. So, Fatima was sent home and Zehrunisa stayed to deal with the police.

Asha, the aspiring slumlord, felt obligated to try to resolve the dispute between the two women. If she didn’t help, her reputation as a mediator would be questioned and the Corporator might replace her with someone more capable of managing people’s affairs, and she’d no longer be able to garner support for her political party.. Plus, not being involved in others’ affairs meant not earning a cut of the money people paid to resolve problems.

Asha showed up at the police station and suggested that Zehrunisa pay her 1,000 rupees, some of which she’d give to Fatima to quiet her complaints about the hut renovation. Zehrunisa refused, saying she’d work it out with Fatima’s husband, whom she got along much better with. Just as Asha distrusted the Husains for being Muslim, Zehrunisa distrusted Asha for being anti-Muslim.

**In Asha’s opinion, not settling the dispute was unwise because by not paying some money to Fatima now, Zehrunisa would exacerbate Fatima’s discontent and make her do something even more desperate.**

##### Tensions Escalate

Meanwhile, while Zehrunisa was at the police station, Kehkashan, her eldest daughter, decided to confront Fatima outside her hut. She was frustrated with Fatima for complaining to the police, which had led to her mother getting harassed for money. Normally, Kehkashan helped resolve fights, she didn’t start them. But now, she threatened to tear Fatima’s other leg off. Fatima retorted that Kehkashan had prostituted herself. (In fact, Kehkashan had recently moved back to her family’s hut when her husband refused to be intimate with her and had affairs.)

Hearing the accusation against his daughter, Karam came out of the Husains’ hut. Kehkashan was more concerned that Zehrunisa was still being held at the police station. Karam sent his son, Mirchi, to check on her. Then, he told Fatima they planned to finish the renovations and would try to avoid each other after that.

Karam retreated into his hut. At that point, after days of work, they had made a lot of progress. Abdul had finished installing the cooking shelf and was picking up pieces of brick that had fallen down. The floor was mostly leveled and cement had been laid. But there was still a lot of disruption: Karam still hadn’t bought the tiles that Zehrunisa wanted, the shouting between the families had scared the younger children, and the family that was supposed to protect the Husains’ television—the brothel owner’s family—had accidentally broken it.

With so much in disarray, Karam finally lost his temper and stormed over to Fatima’s hut. **Since Fatima had lied about Zehrunisa beating her, Karam wanted to show her what a real beating felt like, threatening to have Abdul beat her.** Though he usually obeyed his father, Abdul didn’t want to hit a disabled woman. Kehkashan intervened and calmed her father down, but as she led him away, he told Fatima that their family should pay the Husains for half of what it cost them to build the shared wall in the first place. Fatima retorted that the Husains would need the money for their funerals because she would get back at them.

#### Fatima’s Burning and Hospital Stay

Fatima was mentally unstable, and she wanted a way to get back at the Husains for their threats and the renovations. She barricaded herself in her house, loud music playing. When her 8-year-old daughter, Noori, came home from school and couldn’t get inside, she called for assistance to see inside. Fatima’s neighbor and friend, Cynthia, propped Noori up so she could see through a hole near the roof. **Noori watched as Fatima doused herself with kerosene, and lit herself on fire.** Some of her neighbors had to break down her door to save her. When they got inside, they saw that the flames were mostly out because Fatima had used a water container to put them out, but she was in terrible pain. One neighbor thought that perhaps Fatima had only wanted to burn herself a little bit and instead had let the flames get out of control. Fatima said she had done it because of the Husains.

Fatima was taken to Cooper’s Hospital, which had a reputation for patients dying in their care. Doctors were discouraged from touching patients and the hospital didn’t provide food. Patients’ families had to pay for their own medicine and fill prescriptions at pharmacies outside of the hospital. A burn cream that Fatima needed cost so much money that her husband couldn’t afford to also buy bottled water for her to stay hydrated.

From her hospital bed, Fatima told police that Abdul, Karam, and Kehkashan had burned her.

While Fatima was in the hospital, her friend Cynthia, who also had a grudge against the Husains, visited her. Cynthia’s family’s trash picking business had suffered when that of the Husains became successful, and Cynthia had previously suggested Fatima retaliate.****

Asha also visited Fatima in the hospital. She wanted Fatima to rescind her accusation against the Husains. In exchange, the Husains would pay for Fatima to get better treatment at a private hospital. Fatima thought Asha only wanted her to do this so she could take a cut of the money, and she refused.

Meanwhile, the police knew Fatima had set herself on fire from having talked to Noori, the daughter who witnessed it. However, they hoped to use the accusations against the Husains to extract money from them. They sent a government worker—who was also interested in extracting money from the Husains—to reframe Fatima’s story. In India, it’s a serious crime to commit suicide, so they sought to make it look as though Fatima had been driven to burn herself by the Husains. The government worker reported Kehkashan and Karam’s verbal threats against Fatima, and she contended that Abdul had beaten Fatima, which led Fatima to burn herself.

Fatima soon died of her burns. **To avoid blame, the hospital said the cause of death was an infection resulting from burns over 95 percent of her body rather than the true figure, 35 percent.** Zehrunisa and Kehkashan helped prepare Fatima’s body for burial because it’s traditional for Muslim women to prepare other women for burial. Despite the incident, their families were friends and tried to practice their faith together.

### Abdul and Karam in Police Custody

The night Fatima went to the hospital, Zehrunisa knew that the police would come looking for the accused family members. She wanted Abdul’s father to go to the station in place of his children, and she encouraged Abdul to flee. Abdul couldn’t think of anywhere to go except his trash storage room. He hid there for the night as the police came to his family’s hut next door and arrested Karam. Eventually, he decided he’d rather turn himself in than hide in fear and leave his father to be beaten by the police. Plus, he knew he and his father weren’t guilty of the crime, and he wanted to be exonerated.

**While in police custody, Karam and Abdul faced frequent beatings.** When police beat Karam, they taunted him for being Muslim; when they beat Abdul, they tried to get him to confess to beating Fatima. Their detention wasn’t entered in police records, and they were kept in a room for unofficial police business. It had a small hole in the wall through which visitors could talk to those inside and offer small gifts, like cigarettes. Zehrunisa visited regularly to update Abdul and Karam on the status of Fatima and the case.

Zehrunisa had already paid some money to the police when she’d gone to the station earlier in the week to argue their case, but the police wanted more in exchange for making the case go away. Meanwhile, the government worker who took Fatima’s official statement and Asha were also asking for money to make the case go away. **Abdul realized that the jail was being run like a business where innocence could be bought for the right price.**

Eventually, Asha called the police station and insisted that the Husains hadn’t set Fatima on fire. During the call, Abdul could hear the officer on the phone telling Asha that Abdul and his father weren’t being tortured. After the call, the officer announced that they hadn’t committed the crime and Abdul and his father weren’t beaten again.

Karam thought that Asha likely did this as a show of her power, figuring he and Abdul would tell Zehrunisa about it and she’d accept Asha’s help. Asha would then receive a cut of the money paid to rid the family of the charges and help Fatima’s husband. They still refused to accept this kind of “help” from anyone.

### Kehkashan, Abdul, and Karam in Jail

Kehkashan was sent to a women’s jail, Karam to the Arthur Road jail, and Abdul to a juvenile detention facility. **In India, those who couldn’t pay for jail bonds could be held for years before facing trial.** Zehrunisa had trouble providing collateral to pay for jail bonds to get her three family members out. Most of the things of value her husband owned were in his name only. She sold the back room of their hut, and she considered selling more, like the garbage storeroom. Zehrunisa also visited numerous relatives in the city to ask for money for bail, but few were willing to support her. She even tried approaching the family of a woman she hoped would be Abdul’s fiancée, but they were also unsympathetic, and the marriage would likely be called off due to the accusations against Abdul.

At first, Abdul was to be sent to the same adult jail as his father, but Zehrunisa paid a bribe to a local school to falsify a school record for Abdul, showing that he was 16. **She didn’t know his age because families that were struggling to survive didn’t often have those records.**

In Abdul’s juvenile jail, most of the kids were Muslim. Muslims were generally overrepresented in India’s criminal detention system. Conditions at the jail were poor. The kids got to exercise for an hour in the morning and were supposed to receive educational instruction the rest of the day, but instead were usually sent back to their cells.

One day, however, a teacher gave a special presentation. He talked about how some of the children in the jail had done bad things and would continue on this negative path their whole lives. But he presented an alternative: If the boys chose to walk a more virtuous path and reform themselves, they would have better lives, and justice would come to them in time.

Prior to this speech, Abdul wanted desperately to confess to hurting Fatima, even though he was innocent, because most of the boys at the jail thought that confessing to a crime would allow you to go home.**But upon hearing this teacher’s presentation, he resolved to take a virtuous path and not relent, which meant sticking to the truth even if he couldn’t get out of jail sooner and his family’s finances suffered while he couldn’t work.**

#### Abdul’s Release

**A judge ruled that Abdul wasn’t a flight risk and could live at home until his trial as long as he promised to check in with the jail three days per week.**

Zehrunisa filled in Abdul on her struggle to raise money to get them out of jail. Karam, Abdul’s father, was not allowed medicine for his tuberculosis in the prison, and his health was failing. Kehkashan, Abdul’s sister, seemed to be in good spirits because her jail had relatively good conditions. Zehrunisa didn’t know when any of their trials would be, but she’d now secured a lawyer to argue their case.

She also told Abdul that his trash business had collapsed in his absence. His brother Mirchi had tried to run the business, but most of the scavengers ended up selling their goods to another trash collector instead. Abdul decided to restart his business, but he felt determined to walk a virtuous path as he’d learned at the jail. This meant not buying stolen materials from the scavengers and being okay with the income he’d earn from running his business three fewer days per week to meet the jail’s check-in requirement.
