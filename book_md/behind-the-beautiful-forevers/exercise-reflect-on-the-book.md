In the last part of the book, Annawadians deal with the effects of a global recession, indicated by a lack of jobs and a declining price of scrap metal. How does economic instability show up where you live? How is it similar or different from that of Annawadians?

This book provides a snapshot of the lives of different slum residents, many of them with varying challenges. Who do you think had the best life? Why?
