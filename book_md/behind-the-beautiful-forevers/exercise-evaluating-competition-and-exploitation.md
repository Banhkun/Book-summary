## Exercise: Evaluating Competition and Exploitation

Consider the competition and layers of exploitation affecting the Husains and Fatima.

* * *

Despite Zehrunisa’s efforts to connect in faith with Fatima’s family, the Husains couldn’t overcome Fatima’s rage at their home renovation project. How did envy or competitiveness shape the families’ relationship in that situation?

Is there anything you think the Husains should have done differently to smooth over the situation with Fatima?

Asha, the police, and the government worker all wanted money from the Husains to make Fatima’s case go away. As India continues to develop, what are one or two reasons you think this type of corruption remains common?
