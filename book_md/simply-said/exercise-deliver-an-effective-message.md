## Exercise: Deliver an Effective Message

Sullivan says that in all forms of communication, your goal is for the other person to easily understand your message. Practice writing a persuasive, unambiguous message.

* * *

Think of an idea or project that you’d like to propose to management. Write your main message in one sentence using fewer than 10 words. (For example: “We need free, unlimited coffee in the break room.”)

What are the proposal’s benefits to _management_? List three to five benefits below. Keep in mind the universal motivators of time, feelings, and money.

Identify next steps, clearly stating deadlines and people involved.

Draft a persuasive email to management, containing the information above. Remember to include a strong subject line.
