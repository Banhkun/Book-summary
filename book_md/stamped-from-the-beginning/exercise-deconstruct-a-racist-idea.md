## Exercise: Deconstruct a Racist Idea

Kendi argues that racist ideas exist to prop up racist policies. Let’s see how that principle helps explain a racist idea you’ve encountered.

* * *

Describe a racist idea that has affected you in some way. It may have caused you harm, it may be an idea that you’ve believed at some point, or it may be an idea that you’ve seen other people expressing.

What racist policy (or policies) does this idea justify?

Who benefits from this racist policy and how?

Describe one or more antiracist policies that could replace the racist policy you identified.
