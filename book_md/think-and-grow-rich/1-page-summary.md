## 1-Page Summary

_Think and Grow Rich_ is Napoleon Hill’s best-selling guide to becoming wealthy and successful. Published in 1937, it introduced the concept of positive thinking to the masses and was a forerunner to much of today’s self-help literature.

The main premise of _Think and Grow Rich_ is that **our thoughts create our reality**. If we know what we want, desire and pursue it single-mindedly, have faith and create a plan, we can _think_ it into being.

Hill offers a specific action plan and principles for achieving riches, which he gathered from interviews with 500 wealthy people, including Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and Charles M. Schwab. He began with a conversation with Carnegie, who he says challenged him to spend 20 years interviewing successful men to capture in writing a philosophy of success that anyone, regardless of their station in life, can successfully emulate.

Although the book focuses on financial success, its principles also are applicable to other goals.

The ‘master key’ to success is first understanding that we have the power to control our thoughts — then taking responsibility for doing so. If we choose not to control our thoughts, they end up controlling us.

Our thoughts determine whether we succeed or fail in work and life. If we fill our minds with thoughts of success (become success-conscious or money-conscious), we can achieve riches. If we allow ourselves to become failure-conscious instead, failure is what we will get.

The prescription for turning positive thoughts into riches, which is repeated in many ways throughout the book, is this:

  1. Focus on a single, clearly **defined purpose** as your overriding life goal.
  2. Make achieving this goal your **all-consuming desire**.
  3. Pursue it with **persistence** and **faith**.



Other principles or qualities that come into play are:

  * Decisiveness: Make decisions quickly and stick with them.
  * Imagination: Cultivate your imagination as a source of ideas and inspiration.
  * Planning: Create a specific plan to achieve success.
  * Affirmation: Picture yourself succeeding and you’ll succeed.
  * Master Mind group. Create a group of people committed to helping you achieve your goal.



Hill gives examples of how some of the country’s most successful business leaders, inventors, and creative thinkers achieved great wealth or other forms of success by following the steps and principles for transforming thoughts into reality.
