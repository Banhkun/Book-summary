## Principles 3 and 4: Have Unwavering Faith

In addition to having an intense desire for riches or other success, you also must have an **unwavering faith or belief in your goal _and_ your ability to achieve it**.

Faith or belief is one of the most important keys to converting our thoughts into reality. Faith works on a subconscious level and helps move you toward your goal.

If you have faith in yourself and your plans to achieve wealth, it will prompt ideas and associations that lead you to success.

But if you lack faith and believe the opposite, you’ll defeat yourself. For instance, if you believe that you’re doomed to poverty due to forces beyond your control, this negative belief will take over your mind. It will block out positive thoughts and desires that could help you overcome your circumstances, and you will fail to improve your current state.

So to achieve your goal, it’s important to develop faith to propel you toward it, and inspire others to work with you. You can develop faith through **affirmation and visualization** (which the author calls autosuggestion) — that is, by **constantly telling yourself you can succeed and by envisioning yourself succeeding**(more on autosuggestion later).

You eventually come to believe the things you repeat to yourself. If you write down your goal and repeat it frequently by reading it out loud, you’ll reinforce it in your mind and convince your subconscious to act on it.

You can go a step beyond envisioning yourself succeeding by **_acting as though you already have the thing you want_**. Your mind takes on the nature of the thoughts that dominate it.

If you lack **self-confidence** , or faith in yourself, you can change that, and increase your chances of success, by doing and repeating the following:

  1. I know I have the ability to achieve my specific goal.
  2. I will concentrate my thoughts for 30 minutes a day on the person I intend to become.
  3. I will spend 10 minutes a day demanding self-confidence from myself.
  4. My goal demands that I develop self-confidence to achieve it.
  5. I will cultivate positive thoughts toward myself and others. I have faith that I will change my thoughts and become self-reliant and successful.



### How Faith Leads to Success

Here are two examples of how unwavering faith in an idea led to incredible success and systemic changes.

Example 1: The creation of U.S. Steel Corporation

Charles M. Schwab, who worked for Andrew Carnegie, had a vision for restructuring of the steel industry. But it was counterintuitive. The standard practice at the time was to create monopolies, then increase prices to reap profits, which restricts demand. Schwab, however, wanted to do the opposite — make steel cheaper, and create a huge and expanding market to create larger profits.

To do that, he needed the cooperation of J.P. Morgan, one of the world’s wealthiest men. Others had tried and failed to interest Morgan in organizing a steel trust.

Schwab’s great faith in his idea, his eloquence in presenting it, and his ability to produce numbers to back up his plan, persuaded Morgan and other titans of finance and industry to go along with his restructuring plan. He introduced it in a speech at an industry dinner, and later personally lobbied Morgan and Carnegie. Schwab sold the others on the idea and together they merged their business interests to create the U.S. Steel Corporation. He became its president.

Schwab combined an idea, plus faith and persistence, to convert his idea to reality. But his faith in the idea put it in motion.

Example 2: Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream of equality

Martin Luther King Jr.’s strong faith and belief in the human rights of all people inspired the Civil Rights movement of the sixties, which called attention to the segregation and discrimination against African-Americans in all areas of life, incuding the workplace, housing, education, public services, and social life.

Although the movement drew violent resistance, which cost King his life, his faith that his dream of equality would be realized inspired others to take up the cause and created a sea change in American society that continues to have effects today.

### Autosuggestion

Autosuggestion is the act of **constantly telling yourself you can succeed and by envisioning yourself succeeding**. By consciously visualizing your success, you trigger your _subconscious_ imagination to deliver you the plans that get you to your goal.

Faith and autosuggestion (affirmation) work hand in hand. You can use autosuggestion to develop faith, since telling yourself you’ll succeed will develop conviction that you will achieve it. And you can use faith to strengthen the thoughts and desires you are planting in your subconscious mind.

For autosuggestion to be effective, you must believe in what you’re saying. Don’t just speak empty words devoid of feeling. “Emotionalize” your words with faith for what you’re saying to really sink in.

Autosuggestion takes practice and intense concentration. Building on the 6 steps from the “all-consuming desire” chapter, visualize your success in even more detail:

  * Visualize your specific goal. Focus on it until you can see it.
  * Believe that you are already in possession of the goal.
    * If it’s money, imagine that you already have it in your bank account or in cash sitting in front of you.
    * If it’s something else, imagine that you already have it, and picture what your life is like.



Visualizing the money makes it seem real and will subconsciously encourage you to act in ways that help you reach your goal, rather than in self-defeating ways.
