## Exercise: Removing Your Excuses

Alibis are the excuses we use to justify our failures and mistakes. They usually start with the words, “If only…”

* * *

What is a “go to” excuse you give for not being where you want to be, for not doing what you know you should do, or for failing at something? (If often starts with “if only.”)

Stop wishing for what you _could_ have, and start planning to get it. Turn your excuse above into a plan. What concrete thing can you do now to make your excuse irrelevant?
