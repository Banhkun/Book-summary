## Shortform Introduction

_Think and Grow Rich_ , first published in 1937, is an action plan for getting rich, but its principles of positive thinking are applicable to any other important goals you have.

Hill’s premise that our thoughts turn into physical reality — you can _think_ yourself rich — was popularized by the New Thought movement of the 19th century.

The book was a bestseller for decades and remains popular today. Nonetheless, _Think and Grow Rich_ is a product of its time — reflecting the prejudices of its era, apocryphal stories, and assertions based on a limited understanding of science. For completeness, we’ve included this information in hopes they’ll be useful in understanding the book’s principles.

  * For instance, in explaining how positive thinking brings positive results, Hill asserts that our thoughts create vibrations that attract corresponding vibrations from the ether of the universe, creating the reality we desire.
  * While you might not accept this as literally true, you might view the vibrations/ether explanation more as a metaphor. For instance, if you obsess over an idea, then your mind filters all of the information you receive through this idea. When you receive new information, you think, “Is this relevant to my idea? Does it help me further my idea?” In this way, new information that can help resonates with you (like vibrations in the ether).



There are multiple versions of the book available, some with added material or edited sections. The Napoleon Hill Foundation endorses only the original version. However, because some Shortform readers may benefit from added material, this summary blends Hill’s original examples of successful industry leaders from the late thirties with modern examples from recent editions.

The original book meanders, with each idea being repeated multiple times and the concepts blending into each other. The examples given don’t always relate to the principle at hand. We’ve reorganized some material by theme to make it easier to follow, and we renamed his “13 Steps” as “14 Principles.” Some recommendations and lists that are tangential to the core message of the book are included in an appendix.

Also for completeness, we have included explanations that are not supported by science today, but that still may be useful in understanding Hill’s principles.

Similarly, some of the stories Hill uses differ from accepted historical accounts, but may be valuable as aids in remembering and applying the principles.

Regardless of the packaging, Hill’s message that we can chart our destiny through positive thinking remains relevant to many people nearly a century later.

### Introduction

_Think and Grow Rich_ , originally published in 1937 in the aftermath of the Great Depression, offers a formula and step-by-step instructions for getting rich, which author Napoleon Hill asserts are accessible to everyone regardless of their circumstances. The book was well-received by depression-weary citizens and remained a bestseller for decades. It is still popular today.

People who want to make a lot of money are the primary target of the advice given in _Think and Grow Rich_ , but it’s also applicable by those who define success differently.

Hill’s premise is that **your thoughts, whether positive or negative, become your reality**. You must control your thoughts if you want to control your destiny. If your dominant thoughts are about riches (which can mean wealth, happiness, success in business, successful relationships etc.) you can become rich.

The best way to control your mind is to keep it occupied by having a single, specific goal (a **definite purpose**), making it your **all-consuming desire** , and pursuing it with **persistence** and **faith** that you can achieve it.

Hill identifies 13 principles for changing your mindset and achieving your goal through positive thinking. He gleaned these principles from interviews with more than 500 wealthy and successful people, including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Charles Schwab. Hill says his interview project began with a conversation with steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, who challenged him to spend 20 years interviewing millionaires to capture in writing a philosophy of success that could be replicated by anyone willing to learn and apply the principles.
