## Principle 2: Have an All-Consuming Desire

The first step to riches is having an **all-consuming desire** to achieve your specific goal or **definite purpose**.

Hopes or wishes for something aren’t enough — in fact, if your desire is no more than a wish, you’re likely to quit striving for it when you hit roadblocks. You have to _want something badly_ in order to achieve it.

**Your hunger to reach your goal must be so strong that you stake _everything_ on achieving it, and you burn your bridges, leaving yourself with no way to retreat.**

Your goal has to be **overriding** — you can only devote your full energy to a single goal at the same time.

Examples of strong desires laying the foundation for success:

Example 1: Edwin C. Barnes’ burning desire

Barnes’ story is told in Chapter 1, but here is a closer look at how his intense desire to partner with Edison played out. To start with, his goal was specific: He wanted to _partner_ with Edison, not work _for_ him. It became the consuming obsession of his life, and when he was ready to act on it, he left behind his past life and devoted everything to reaching his goal.

While Barnes worked for Edison as a mere salesman for five years, he didn’t give up on his desire for a partnership or decide to do something else instead — **his desire only grew stronger** , and he focused on becoming Edison’s partner until it became a reality.

Example 2: Department store founder Marshall Field

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, many merchants who lost their businesses chose to leave the city in defeat rather than to rebuild. However, one merchant, Marshall Field, refused to give up. He had an overwhelming desire to build the world’s greatest store on the ruins of his original store, no matter how many times it burned down. He built the Marshall Field’s department store in downtown Chicago, which eventually grew into a national chain.

Example 3: Director Steven Spielberg

Steven Spielberg had an all-consuming desire to make movies. He had made films as an amateur, but hadn’t broken into the industry. He came up with a unique idea for literally getting in the door. He took a Universal Studios Tour, then sneaked away and hid on the lot until after the tram had left. As he left at the end of the day, he made a point of speaking to the guard. Because the guard then recognized him, he was able to return daily for three months.

Then Spielberg’s burning desire drove him to find other entry points. He always wore a suit and carried a briefcase, giving the impression he was a student with a summer job there. He spoke often to directors, writers, and editors. He found a vacant office and moved in, and he added his name to the directory. Spielberg eventually got to know the head of production for the television department, who became his mentor and gave him opportunities to produce films.

Spielberg’s burning desire forced him through obstacles that would have held back many others in his position. His desire seemed all-consuming, and he was willing to do anything to achieve it.

### Set a Specific Goal

Beyond having a desire, you need to set a **clear, specific goal**. You can’t hit a vague target.

**Define your goal as clearly as you possibly can. Visualize it happening in vivid detail.**

For many people, making money is the definition of success, and that is also Hill’s focus. He offers six steps **to turn your _desire_ for riches into _reality._**

  1. Define the exact amount of money you want.
  2. Decide you are willing to sacrifice to get the money (like how many years of work, where you will live). Nothing comes without a price.
  3. Set a specific date for when you’ll have the money in hand.
  4. Create a specific plan for getting the money, and start on it right away.
  5. Write down on paper the above: how much money you intend to get, what you will give to get it, the date when you will have it, and your plan for acquiring it.
  6. Read your statement out loud twice a day, morning and evening. See, feel, and believe that you already have the money.



(Shortform note: You can adapt these steps for your personal goal, even if it’s not money.)

These steps don’t require particularly hard work, sacrifice, or a lot of education — just an understanding that you can’t count on chance or good luck to reach your goal. You must dream, desire it to the point of obsession, and plan.

### The Importance of Being a Dreamer

People who are driven by a strong desire and definite purpose typically are dreamers. They’re **open to big ideas and pursue them relentlessly, without fear of failure or opposition**. They know that each failure is a stepping stone to success.

Marconi, an Italian inventor and physicist, was intrigued by the recent discovery of electromagnetic waves, and dreamed of putting them to use. His work in long distance radio transmission in the early 1900s enabled the transmission of news, information and entertainment around the world. Radio, TV and cell phones ultimately grew out of his work. (His success, however, didn’t come without opposition: His friends had him examined in a psychiatric hospital when he announced he could send messages through the air without wires.)

Similarly, Henry Ford also dreamed big, even though he was poor and lacked a formal education. He envisioned the automobile and went to work on it with the tools he had at hand. Vehicles now are an integral part of life on earth because Ford went after his dream.

Other examples of dreamers who acted on big dreams and changed the world in the process include Columbus, Copernicus, Thomas Edison, Abraham Lincoln, and the Wright brothers.
