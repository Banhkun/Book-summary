## Principles 5 and 6: Specialized Knowledge and the Master Mind

Knowledge is critical to making better decisions and achieving your goals.

There are two types of knowledge: general and specialized. Colleges provide general knowledge, but often this knowledge lacks practical application. If you want to get rich, the type of knowledge you need is **specialized** and specific to the particular industry or endeavor you’ve chosen as your path. This is why college degrees aren’t guarantees of career success — formal education should be viewed only as the beginning for acquiring knowledge.

To make progress toward your goal, **figure out what sort of specialized knowledge you need, and why you need it**. Then figure out how to get it. There are various ways to gain this specialized knowledge, including training programs, books, research and experimentation, and personal experience.

**Never stop gaining specialized knowledge related to your goal.** Don’t make the mistake of thinking your learning ends when you graduate from school. In fact, much of the practical knowledge that gets you toward your life’s goals comes after school. Combining a hunger for knowledge with imagination will help you adapt to changing times.

### The Master Mind

Despite the importance of specialized knowledge, don’t feel like you need to know _every_ necessary piece of knowledge yourself in order to achieve your goal. Instead, you need a **Master Mind group** — a **group of associates who have the knowledge, advice and expertise to help you achieve your goal.**

**No one has enough experience, education, and ability to accumulate a fortune single-handedly. You need a Master Mind group to help you shape a plan for reaching your goal.**

Henry Ford demonstrated this to great effect:

  * A newspaper called him “an ignorant pacifist,” and Ford sued.
  * In court, the paper’s lawyers tried to argue that the statement was accurate: Ford was indeed “ignorant.” They put Ford on the stand and began asking him trivia questions, like “how many soldiers did the British send to the American colonies in 1776?” 
  * Ford tired of the questions, and replied that at the touch of a button he could summon someone who could answer any question he had about his business. Why would he clutter his mind with useless general knowledge when he had people around him who could supply any knowledge he demanded? 



No matter how much knowledge he contains himself, anyone who knows _where to get knowledge when needed_ is an educated individual. Through his Master Mind group, Henry Ford had all the specialized knowledge he needed to start an automobile revolution.

The same was true of Andrew Carnegie. He reportedly once said he didn’t know anything about the technical aspects of the steel business, and he didn’t particularly care to — because his Master Mind group knew everything necessary for making and selling steel.

A group of dedicated minds brainstorming and thinking together can connect and build on one another’s ideas and insights. Together, you and your Master Mind can achieve something greater than any individual could achieve alone.

Both of these examples also illustrate another point — someone who’s had limited formal education should never feel inferior, because specialized knowledge is always accessible. Ford and Thomas Edison had little formal schooling but were hugely successful in their chosen fields because they knew where and how to get the knowledge they needed.

More examples of Master Minds:

  * President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a group called his Brain Trust. He brought the best minds in the country to Washington to solve economic problems.
  * Ross Perot left IBM to create his own company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS). Although he was discouraged against going out on his own, he assembled a small team of dedicated experts who shared his goal and helped create the company. 



**Here are the steps to forming your own Master Mind group:**

  * Make a list of people who have the necessary knowledge, experience, and resources to create and carry out the plan that will achieve your goal.
  * **Decide what you have to offer** to people you want in your Master Mind group. No one will join your effort without some kind of benefit or compensation, which can be money or something else.
  * Meet with the members of your group twice or more a week, until you come up with a plan or plans for achieving your goal.
  * Make it a priority to maintain harmony in the group.
