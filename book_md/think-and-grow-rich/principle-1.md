## Principle 1: Think Success by Default

Thoughts are powerful: What you think becomes your reality. We all have the power to control our thoughts, although many people don’t use it. If you harness this power, you can become wealthy, or achieve what you seek.

The way to achieve riches is to become **success-conscious** , rather than **failure-conscious** :

  1. Start by focusing your mind on a single, clearly **defined purpose** , not multiple purposes that would dilute your focus. Choose one overriding life goal.
  2. Make achieving this goal your **all-consuming desire** , to the point that you think of little else and you devote all your time and energy to achieving it.
  3. Finally, **be persistent** in pursuing your one goal or purpose. You will encounter setbacks but have **faith** in your goal and ability to achieve it — and **never give up on it**.



Here’s how this process worked in the lives of two men.

Example 1: Partnering with Edison

  * Edwin C. Barnes had an overriding goal (his **definite purpose**) of working with the inventor Thomas Edison. Partnering with Edison became his **all-consuming desire**. 
  * Despite never having met Edison, Barnes went to see and told him his goal. Edison recognized his determination but gave him a lesser job. While this might seem like a defeat, Barnes agreed to work for Edison, but **persisted** in focusing on his specific goal of a partnership. 
  * This went on for five years, but he didn’t give up on his goal or stop thinking about it. 
  * Barnes saw an opportunity when Edison couldn’t get his salespeople to sell his new dictating machine. Barnes said he could sell it and was given the opportunity. He sold it so successfully that Edison gave him a contract to distribute and market the machine. 
  * Thus, Barnes _thought_ his way into a partnership with Edison. Continuing to believe he could be successful allowed him to persist, which allowed him to seize the opportunity when it surfaced.



Example 2: Striking Gold

  * A man had a specific **purpose** and **desire** to find gold. He discovered a small amount of gold, staked a claim, and raised money for the machinery and labor to extract more. 
  * But after much work, the effort came up empty. **He lacked persistence** , so he quit, selling the machinery to a ‘junk’ man. 
  * Before reselling the machinery as junk, the junk man hired an engineer, who advised that the gold lay just three feet from where the man had stopped drilling. 
  * The engineer was right and the junk man made a fortune because of the first man’s **failure to persist**. 



Similarly, the 500 wealthy men interviewed by Hill told him their greatest successes came when **they persisted in going one step beyond a failure or setback**. Thomas Edison reportedly tried and failed 10,000 times before inventing a successful electric lightbulb.

Temporary defeats are common in most endeavors, and they often seem to come when success is within reach. Unlike Edison, though, many people quit too soon.

### Developing a Success-Consciousness

People who become rich do so because they have a **success-consciousness** — they spend their time thinking about success rather than about things that can go wrong.

However, there are several hurdles to success-consciousness.

The first is our **human tendency to believe that difficult things are impossible**(Shortform note: This isn’t well explained, but consider that this gives us an easy excuse for not trying something new or to avoid the embarrassment of failure). To avoid this tendency to assume something can’t be done, Hill clipped the word “impossible” out of his dictionary as a symbolic way of removing it from his mind. He advises readers to also remove it from their thinking.

Another hurdle to success-consciousness is the tendency to **measure everything by our personal experience and beliefs** , rather than realizing things can be better or different. For instance, some people who are poor can’t envision becoming rich because their experience of poverty and defeat dominates their thoughts, preventing them from trying to change things, and thus reinforces their circumstances. **The key to change is taking control of your mind by occupying it with a defined purpose, burning desire, and persistence.**

As an example of success-consciousness, Henry Ford wanted his engineers to design an eight-cylinder engine in one piece (his specific goal), but the engineers told him it was impossible. He persisted in his demand and kept sending his engineers back to the drawing board, and eventually, after a year, the engineers designed it. Ford succeeded because he knew specifically what he wanted, and would not accept others’ claims that it was impossible to achieve.

When we exercise our ability and power to control our thoughts, we embody the sentiment of the English poet W.C. Henley, who wrote: “I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.”

The secret to mastering our economic fate is to fill our minds with thoughts of money (or whatever we want) — to have a success-consciousness — and to persist until we achieve it. Our thoughts create the success we’re striving for.

With these general principles in place, Hill spends the rest of the book describing the 13 Steps to Riches. Many of the ideas overlap with each other, but they all relate to creating the positive mental energy necessary to inspire success.
