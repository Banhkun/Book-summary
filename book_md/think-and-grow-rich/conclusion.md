## Conclusion

You now have the “master key” for achieving riches or success as you define it: the ability to control your thoughts.

You either control your thoughts or they control you — there’s no middle ground. You control your mind by occupying it with a specific goal (**definite purpose**), which is your **all-consuming desire** , and with a **plan** for achieving it.

The master key is powerful. If you don’t use it you’ll fail. But the reward for controlling your mind is mastery of yourself and your destiny — attaining life’s riches.
