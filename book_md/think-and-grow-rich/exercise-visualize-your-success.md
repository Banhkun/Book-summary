## Exercise: Visualize Your Success

Visualizing the thing or condition you want to achieve makes it seem real and will subconsciously encourage you to act in ways that help you achieve it.

* * *

Close your eyes and visualize something you want intensely. Describe it in as much detail as you can. Write down these details.

How does visualizing this make you feel, emotionally? Do you feel that your goal is closer after visualizing your success?

Write your personal, specific version of the following: “I know I have the ability to achieve my specific goal. I demand self-confidence from myself. My goal demands that I develop the self-confidence to achieve it.”
