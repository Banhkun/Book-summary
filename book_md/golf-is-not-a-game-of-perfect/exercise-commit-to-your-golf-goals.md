## Exercise: Commit to Your Golf Goals

According to Rotella, the first step in building confidence is setting ambitious goals. Identify your goals in golf and commit to a program of improvement.

* * *

Consider your current golf goals. Maybe they’re ambitious, or maybe they’re more modest—or maybe you haven’t yet set any goals at all. If you don’t have any goals or your goals aren’t quite so ambitious, revise them, setting a loftier, more ambitious goal. Write that goal below. If you’re already chasing an ambitious goal, write that down instead. For example, your goal could be shooting even par on a difficult course or making the cut in an upcoming tournament.

Now that you’ve identified your goals, commit to a plan that will help you attain those goals. Rotella recommends being realistic about how much time you can commit to golf. Consider your schedule and create a plan for practicing your game. Below, write down the details of this plan, including when and how long you plan to practice and what you want to work on during each session.
