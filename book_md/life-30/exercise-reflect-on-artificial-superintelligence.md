## Exercise: Reflect on Artificial Superintelligence

Reflect on the future of artificial intelligence and consider what you can do to help solve AI-related problems.

* * *

Do you think an artificial superintelligence will be created within your lifetime? Why or why not?

Consider Tegmark’s three optimistic possibilities for human life after the creation of an artificial superintelligence: Friendly AI Takes Over, Friendly AI Stays Hidden, and AI Protects Humanity From AI. Which of these three worlds would you most like to live in, and why? (For example, if the “AI Protects Humanity From AI” scenario sounds the most appealing to you, this might be because you value human rationalism and autonomy—you want humans to be the ones to design a utopia, not machines.)

What’s an AI-related problem this guide has made you more concerned about? What’s a simple step you can take today to help manage this problem? (For example, if you’re concerned about the potential for AI-enhanced weapons, you could donate some money to nonprofit organizations advocating regulation of these weapons.)
