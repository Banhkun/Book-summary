## Exercise: Create a Body-Positive Social Media Feed

Overhaul your social media feeds to provide you with more feel-good content.

* * *

Identify 3 to 5 accounts on your social media feeds that are regularly body-focused or discuss body-image issues. What are the accounts and what type of content do they post?

Take some time to analyze the content and describe how it makes you feel, both generally and about your body. Which accounts make you feel particularly positive or negative about yourself?

Why do you think these accounts make you feel especially positive or negative? What specific characteristics of their content are driving your feelings? (For example, you may notice you feel bad when seeing posts focused on diet culture.)

Finally, based on what youâ€™ve learned through this reflection, write down what you could do to add more feel-good content to your social media feeds. (For example, you could follow more accounts that focus on your hobbies rather than body-related content.)
