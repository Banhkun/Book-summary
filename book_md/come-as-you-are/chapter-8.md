## Chapter 8: The Ins and Outs of Orgasms

In the previous chapter, we learned about the different ways that people experience desire, what causes a lack of desire, and how we can increase desire within our relationship. Now, we’ll shift our attention to orgasms, which scientists define as the climactic release of built-up tension during a sexual experience. However, as we’ll discuss, Nagoski insists that **orgasms are much more complex** **than this definition allows for, and each individual experiences them in a unique way**.

To frame our discussion, we’ll start by clearing up some of the misconceptions that society has made us believe about orgasms to better understand what they are. Then, we’ll discuss in what ways one experience of orgasm can differ from another. Finally, we’ll identify why some people, especially women, have difficulty with orgasms and provide information about what they can do to have better and more frequent orgasms.

### Misconceptions About Orgasms

By now, we have a good understanding that our society perpetuates a lot of false information regarding sex. Nagoski tells us that this is no different when it comes to ideas about orgasms. In particular, she discusses several misconceptions that frame our culture’s understanding of orgasms and how these beliefs depart from the truth.

#### Misconception #1: Orgasms Are Primarily a Genital Response

Nagoski says the first misconception about orgasms is that they’re primarily a genital response. This belief comes from the fact that orgasms are often accompanied by certain physical genital responses, such as pelvic floor contractions.

In reality, Nagoski argues, **orgasms are really about what happens inside the brain** , and research shows no relationship between our subjective experience of orgasm and our genital response (just like arousal). In other words, muscle contractions can happen without orgasm, and the reverse is also true.

> **Our Brains During Orgasm**
> 
> If orgasms are about more than just a genital response, what exactly is the full picture? By using fMRI and PET scans to measure the blood flow and neuron activity of individuals experiencing orgasm, scientists have been able to observe what happens in the brain during this climactic experience.
> 
> First, multiple remote brain regions activate during orgasm, including the genital sensory cortex, motor areas, hypothalamus, thalamus, and substantia nigra. Specifically, the genital sensory cortex registers sensation in the genitals, the motor areas govern the body’s movement, the hypothalamus and substantia nigra produce hormones, and the thalamus helps bring together information related to senses, movement, memories, or fantasies that might be useful in reaching orgasm.
> 
> Additionally, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain responsible for reason, decision making, and value judgments, becomes less active. Scientists say that one reason for this is to decrease fear and anxiety, which inhibit sexual response.
> 
> Finally, the brain also releases a variety of hormones and neurochemicals during orgasm that promote enjoyment, bonding, pain reduction, and relaxation, such as dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, endorphins, and vasopressin. This is why we experience things like intense pleasure, closeness with our partner, lower sensitivity to pain, and a sense of calm after sex.

#### Misconception #2: Orgasms Are Always Enjoyable

Nagoski tells us that the second misconception about orgasms is that they’re always enjoyable. This most likely stems from the depiction of orgasms as an experience of ecstasy in porn and other media. Nagoski argues, however, that **the way we feel about an orgasm depends on the context,** just like other sensations. Often orgasms are pleasurable, but they can also be frustrating, painful, or even not feel like much at all.

(Shortform note: While Nagoski acknowledges the role of context in our experience of orgasm, she doesn’t provide specific examples of which types of context influence bad orgasms. Research shows that some of the most common reasons for these unpleasant experiences include having sex to avoid arguing about sex, feeling obligated to orgasm, or having sex that lacks emotional connection.)

One situation in which this falsehood is especially problematic, according to Nagoski, is in the context of sexual assault. **To believe that orgasms are always pleasurable is to believe that if a person has an orgasm while being sexually assaulted, then they’re enjoying the experience**. On the contrary, we know from personal accounts (in addition to the science) that this isn’t the case—many victims have reported feeling disturbed and confused about experiencing orgasm during assault.

(Shortform note: Victim accounts have stressed numerous harmful consequences that arise from experiencing orgasm during sexual assault. For example, one victim was so traumatized by her experience that she made herself believe that she only enjoyed sex if it was violent. Because of this, she purposely sought out risky and violent sexual encounters, which led her to be assaulted two more times. Additionally, the trauma caused an immense amount of shame, difficulty orgasming, and dissociation during sex.)

#### Misconception #3: Some Orgasms Are Inherently Better Than Others

Nagoski states that the third misconception about orgasms is that some are better than others. In particular, **there’s a widespread notion in both the media and the medical field that penile-vaginal orgasms are the ideal**. As discussed previously, this and many other false ideas stem from our society viewing men’s experience as the standard. Nagoski clarifies that in this case, however, men’s _pleasure_ is the default. We’re led to believe that because men usually experience orgasm through vaginal penetration, women should too. However, Nagoski notes that many women rarely, if ever, orgasm in this way.

(Shortform note: We can trace the glorification of female orgasm through vaginal penetration—despite this method of orgasm being relatively uncommon—back to Freudian psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud, considered to be the father of modern psychology, believed that orgasm through heterosexual, penile-vaginal sex was the proper way for a woman to orgasm. Anything else—including clitoral stimulation and masturbation—was considered to be immature and to make women prone to psychological disorders like psychosis.)

Nagoski says that regardless of the means through which a woman experiences orgasm, there’s no right way to have one. What’s more, **no single type of stimulation produces an orgasm that feels inherently better than another** , whether it’s vaginal, anal, clitoral, thigh, breast, earlobe, or even mental stimulation. Each orgasm simply feels different.

(Shortform note: New research on the female orgasm may call into question Nagoski’s claim that no orgasm feels inherently better than another. Preliminary findings from a pilot study show that there may be two different types of female orgasm—clitoral and vaginal—rather than different types of stimulation triggering one single type of orgasm. If this proves to be true, further research would be required to understand how exactly they differ and whether one could produce a more pleasurable sensation than the other.)

### No Orgasm Is the Same

Nagoski’s claim that no orgasm is inherently better than another ties into her fundamental idea that no orgasm is the same. As we already saw, **a person’s experience of orgasm can vary depending on the individual and the type of stimulation that produces it**. But it can also differ depending on the situation.

In fact, Nagoski tells us that orgasms can happen in lots of different scenarios—far more than what the media depicts. People can experience orgasms alone or with a partner, while they’re asleep or exercising, or during any number of other regular activities.

(Shortform note: While Nagoski doesn’t go into detail about the diverse circumstances in which orgasms can occur, women have reported a variety of unexpected and even mundane scenarios that have led to orgasms. In particular, women have had orgasms while riding roller coasters, yawning, brushing their teeth, getting laser hair removal, birthing children, and even eating a particular type of mushroom.)

### Women’s Difficulty With Orgasm

As part of the discussion about what orgasms are and what they aren’t, it’s important to acknowledge that **women in particular often have difficulty reaching orgasm**. In fact, Nagoski says that this is one of the most common reasons for seeking sex-related treatment or therapy.

(Shortform note: Compared to women, men experience much lower levels of difficulty with orgasm and ejaculation. According to research, anywhere between 1–4% of men experience delayed ejaculation, which is when men take 30 minutes or longer to be able to ejaculate. Additionally, a 2009 study showed that men are almost 30% more likely to orgasm than women.)

So why is it that so many women seem to have difficulties? Nagoski says the answer is most often the same as what causes lack of desire and non-concordance: **over-activation of the SIS due to negative emotions like stress, depression, anxiety, and shame**. For example, if you’re feeling self-conscious about your body during sex, that activates the SIS, making it difficult for you to reach orgasm.

(Shortform note: Another important factor contributing to women’s difficulty with orgasm is the lack of knowledge they have about the clitoris. One study, for example, found that the less knowledge a woman has about her clitoris, the less frequently she’s able to orgasm during masturbation. Interestingly, however, the research showed that a woman’s level of knowledge of the clitoris had no significant effect on the frequency of orgasm during partner sex—in other words, even if a woman is knowledgeable, the frequency with which she orgasms with her partner is no more than incidental. The researchers attributed these findings to a societal construction of sex that privileges men’s pleasure over women’s.)

#### How Our Brains Process Expectations vs. Reality

However, in more specific terms, Nagoski says that **orgasm difficulties arise from the way our brains process the gap between our expectations and reality** , which our culture’s tendency to set the bar unreasonably high worsens.

Nagoski explains that our brains constantly evaluate our surroundings, making comparisons between the expectations we’ve developed based on our experiences and what’s actually happening. When our expectations don’t match up with reality, we try to close the gap by setting a goal to bring them back into alignment. Nagoski adds that when we think we’re making good progress toward that goal, we remain happy and motivated. But when we don’t see good progress, we become frustrated and increasingly desperate to close the gap, until we eventually give up in despair.

In the case of orgasms, the process Nagoski describes looks like this: Society has given you the expectation that you should be able to have an orgasm from vaginal penetration, but you find yourself unable to do so. Your brain notices this gap between your expectation and reality, and so you become determined to “fix” reality by continuing to try to have an orgasm this way. When it doesn’t work, you become increasingly anxious, which activates the SIS. Ultimately, this makes trying to have an orgasm even more difficult than before, creating a continuous cycle of frustration and anxiety that eventually ends with you giving up on having one altogether.

> **How Our Expectations Influence Our Judgments**
> 
> In her discussion of how our brain compares our present surroundings to our set of expectations, Nagoski doesn’t go into detail about exactly how this process works. However, learning more about how our brain processes information can enhance our understanding of how we interpret what’s happening to us, including our experience of sex.
> 
> Over time, we come to develop many different expectations based on a wide range of experiences. Exactly which expectations we use to judge a given situation, however, depends on many different factors. One of these factors is that we tend to base our judgments on the stored information that’s most accessible to us. What’s most accessible at any given time is determined both by what’s important to us as individuals and by what we’ve been recently or frequently exposed to. Unfortunately, because certain information comes to mind more easily than anything else, it has the potential to influence our judgment—even when it’s counterfactual.
> 
> We can imagine, then, how this bias may affect our sexual experience. If society constantly tells us that we should be able to have an orgasm from vaginal penetration, that information will become more accessible. Furthermore, because our brain is wired to privilege accessible information, we’re likely to convince ourselves that we should be able to have this type of orgasm, regardless of what the truth may be. And ultimately, we’ll become frustrated and blame _ourselves_ when it doesn’t work out in the way we expected—all because of our brain’s inherent bias. This leads to the type of negative feelings that activate our SIS and inhibit orgasm, making it even less likely we’ll live up to society’s expectations.

### How to Have Better (and More) Orgasms

Despite the difficulty that many women seem to have with orgasms, Nagoski assures us that there’s hope for women to not only reach orgasm but also improve and have more of them. She says **the solution is to deactivate the SIS and slowly activate the SES**. In other words, we need to eliminate what our brain sees as reasons not to have sex and gradually increase the frequency and intensity of what turns us on.

To create an environment where this is possible, Nagoski insists we must get all of the internal states of our mesolimbic cortex—things like comfort, hunger, and sleepiness—to work together rather than against each other. What this means is that **we need to be fully present in the moment** , without any of our various internal states trying to pull us away from the goal at hand (the goal being having an orgasm). For example, even if you’re in the comfort of your own bed and relatively energized, you’ll find it difficult to focus on having an orgasm if you haven’t eaten in 8 hours.

> **Treating Our Needs as a Hierarchy**
> 
> Nagoski’s insistence that our internal states must work together for us to be present in the moment is reflected in other theories as well. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, for example, is based on the idea that there are more basic needs that must be met before a person can focus on other things. According to the hierarchy, physiological needs (such as food) are the most fundamental, followed by safety (financial security), love and belonging (friends), esteem (achievement), and self-actualization (fulfillment). In other words, if our basic needs aren’t met, we aren’t going to be able to focus on experiencing pleasure.
> 
> One fundamental way in which Nagoski and Maslow’s ideas differ, however, is that Maslow classified sex as a physiological need on the same level as food and sleep. As previously discussed, Nagoski would disagree with this categorization, because she argues that desire for sex isn’t motivated by survival, and going without sex causes no negative physical consequences. Most likely, she would classify sex—and especially pleasure—as higher on the hierarchy.

#### The Keys to Becoming Fully Present

So, how do we become fully present in the moment? Nagoski says three things can make this happen. We discussed two of the key strategies—handling stress and creating a context conducive to sex—in Part 2. But the third strategy Nagoski suggests is to **retrain our brain’s attempts at closing the gap between expectations and reality**.

One example of this is adjusting the goal from having an orgasm to simply experiencing pleasure during sex—orgasm or not. This releases us from the expectation of orgasm and prevents anxiety from activating the SIS.

> Another way to close the gap between expectations and reality is to live by the Zen philosophy of “emptying your cup.” According to the Zen proverb, when your mind—or “cup”—is full of preconceived ideas and beliefs, you become trapped by your patterns of thinking and behavior. To open yourself up to new possibilities, you must “empty” your existing expectations.
> 
> The best way to do this is to identify a problematic core belief and gather evidence that refutes it. For example, if you believe you’re broken because you don’t orgasm every time you have sex, you should search for evidence to contradict that idea—do the women you know have an orgasm every time _they_ have sex? Is there any credible information to support your belief?
