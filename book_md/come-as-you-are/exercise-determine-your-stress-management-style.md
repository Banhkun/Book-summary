## Exercise: Determine Your Stress Management Style

Better manage your stress by determining what stress management strategies work best for you.

* * *

Think about the last few times you were noticeably stressed. How did you try to manage it (if at all)? What patterns do you notice between instances—did you frequently use the same strategy (or strategies)?

Reflect on the outcome of the management strategy or strategies you chose. Did they reduce your level of stress? If so, why do you think they worked? If not, why weren’t they successful?

Choose one of the strategies that Nagoski recommends for completing the stress cycle that you’ve never tried before but want to experiment with (physical activity, sleep, affection, meditation, crying, screaming, art, or grooming). Make a plan for how you might make time to implement the strategy. (For example, plan to add 5 minutes of meditation to your morning ritual.)

How can you ensure that you’ll follow through on your plan? (For example, find an accountability buddy who can join you in your routine and check in to make sure you’re sticking to your plan.)
