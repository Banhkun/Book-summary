## 1-Page Summary

To get the best results, leaders often try to control every aspect of an organization. However, the resulting bureaucracy and hierarchy actually prevent people from doing their best work. In _Brave New Work, _Aaron Dignan __ describes how to revolutionize organizations so they can adapt to the rapid pace of change in the modern world and help employees feel more engaged. His strategies to achieve autonomy and flexibility are customizable, and they’re shaped by collective input from employees as opposed to top-down reforms.

Dignan is an investor and the founder of The Ready, a consulting firm that helps businesses and other organizations adopt his key principles of autonomy and flexibility. Based on Dignan’s experience coaching and transforming institutions, _Brave New Work,_ published in 2019, aims to convince leaders of businesses and organizations that new, unconventional ways of working together are both necessary and better for everyone.

In this guide, we’ll explain why outdated work structures are failing us. Then we’ll describe **Dignan’s foundational principles for the modern organization: autonomy for employees and flexible organizational structures** , and explore strategies for putting these principles into practice. The guide will also compare Dignan’s ideas to other books on business organization and management styles, and discuss some of the challenges of implementing these changes.

### Why Old Organizational Structures Are Failing

In this section, we’ll explain why traditional organizations (which Dignan calls “Legacy Organizations”) are ineffective in the modern world. Dignan defines traditional organizations loosely as those having a rigid hierarchical structure. They tend to have managers at the top who make decisions and monitor other peoples’ work, and other employees who carry out their instructions and have little or no authority.

Dignan identifies two ways that traditional organizational structures are failing us today: They’re hindered by organizational debt (obsolete processes and structures that hinder an organization), and they undermine employees’ engagement at work.

#### Organizational Debt Creates Inefficiency

**Organizational debt comes from processes that may have provided an important function at some point but no longer serve the organization**.

For example, if an employee once spearheaded a project without permission, and it didn’t go well, a manager might have established a lengthy review process for approving new projects. This rule might have been intended to prevent a negative outcome in the future, but it ultimately discourages people from taking initiative, and it slows the organization’s progress toward its overall goal. Dignan also notes that organizational debt is in part a holdover from early 20th-century management styles that emphasized rigid and detailed rules to streamline manufacturing processes.

> **A Different Take on Organizational Debt**
> 
> The term “organizational debt” was originally used by the entrepreneur Steve Blank, who defined it as the collection of changes that _should_ have been made by an organization, but weren’t. The phrase was a twist on the term “technical debt” which describes the accumulated cost of taking shortcuts when developing a technology or digital product. In both cases, the debt comes from making a choice with a short-term gain and a long-term compounding cost, just like taking on financial debt.
> 
> Based on this definition, organizational debt is even broader than Dignan describes and is often more like a shortcut. Most of Dignan’s examples include burdensome bureaucratic processes, but eliminating or failing to introduce a process for expediency also becomes organizational debt if it has a long-term negative impact on the organization.
> 
> For example, if you fail to implement a thorough onboarding process for employees, you might save money and time in the short term by spending less time training employees, but in the long term they will take longer to get up to speed and become productive members of the team.

Research confirms that workplaces with conventional management and structures (and thus organizational debt) are inefficient. Studies show that half of all manager roles are unnecessary, suggesting that organizations could increase productivity significantly by eliminating these roles altogether and finding new ways for workers to self-manage.

(Shortform note: Although Dignan doesn’t go into much detail on _why_ many manager roles are unnecessary, some justifications for eliminating manager roles include the following: They add overhead cost because they receive higher salaries, they increase the risk of one person making a catastrophic decision, they slow down work when decisions have to go through the chain of command, and they disempower lower-ranking employees, decreasing their incentive to innovate and contribute to the team.)

According to one study, workers in the US spend 16% of their working time on internal bureaucratic processes (things like paperwork and getting approval from higher-ups). (Shortform note: In addition to spending a significant proportion of their time dealing with red tape at work, Americans also spend enormous amounts of time navigating the bureaucracy of government social programs such as Medicaid, food stamps, and unemployment benefits. As a result, vulnerable individuals have to invest more time in lengthy application processes and often fail to get the benefits they are eligible for.)

Dignan argues that minimizing these requirements is an opportunity for organizations to reduce costs and boost profitability. He suggests that this strategy is more effective at increasing profitability than other common strategies such as laying off general staff, eliminating key functions of the organization, and acquisitions and mergers that most often fail to produce the intended boost in revenue for all companies involved.

(Shortform note: Although Dignan argues for reducing bureaucracy over other cost-reducing tactics, some argue that strategies such as layoffs are sometimes necessary as a short-term, last-resort option for companies that are in immediate financial trouble. Therefore, it’s sometimes more practical for organizations to reduce bureaucracy in tandem with other strategies.)

#### People Are Less Engaged at Work

In addition to being inefficient and less productive, traditional organizations are also failing workers today because **people are unhappy when they lack control over the best way to get their work done**. Micromanaging leads to a lack of trust and makes people want to avoid work because they’re frustrated with having someone constantly monitoring them. On the other hand, Dignan believes that when companies give people the tools and freedom to pursue their goals, they’re intrinsically motivated to do so. This type of freedom leads to more efficient work and happier people.

> **Greater Employee Engagement Increases Performance**
> 
> Confirming Dignan’s claims about worker disengagement, Paul Marciano’s _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work _cites research showing that the majority of American workers are disengaged from their work. In addition, he lists several specific ways that engaged workers perform better. According to Marciano, engaged employees:
> 
>   * Bring new ideas to work and suggest improvements
> 
>   * Take initiative
> 
>   * Exceed goals and expectations
> 
>   * Are growth-oriented, seeking to improve the self and people around them
> 
>   * Encourage and support team members
> 
>   * Overcome obstacles
> 
>   * Show high levels of discretionary effort
> 
>   * Speak with pride about the organization
> 
>   * Act as though they have ownership in the business
> 
> 

> 
> Additional research cited by Marciano shows that greater employee engagement within businesses increases profitability and customer satisfaction, and reduces turnover, fraud, and absenteeism.

### Foundational Principles: Autonomy and Flexibility

Now that we’ve discussed how traditional organizational structures are both economically inefficient and less enjoyable for workers, we’ll cover Dignan’s foundational principles to revolutionize organizations: **autonomy for employees** (what Dignan refers to as “people-positivity”) and **flexible structures** (what Dignan calls “complexity-consciousness”).

Dignan explains that his principles aren’t necessarily intended to help leaders run their organizations better, but rather to enable organizations to _run_ _themselves_ through decentralized yet coherent work toward a common goal.

#### Employee Autonomy

Dignan’s principle of autonomy is based on the assumption that people are trustworthy, intrinsically motivated, and capable of problem-solving. In a context where leaders expect these qualities in their employees, Dignan believes that employees will fulfill these expectations. On the other hand, if leaders believe that people are extrinsically motivated and need to be micromanaged to do good work, people will also internalize and fulfill these expectations.

(Shortform note: The term “stereotype threat” embodies this idea that external expectations about a person’s character or ability impact their performance. Research shows that when people are aware that they might confirm someone else’s negative perception of them, it often causes lower performance in academic settings and the workplace. This phenomenon also contributes to widening inequalities for women, people of color, and other stereotyped groups.)

Having **autonomy means that** **employees control their work as much as possible**. This requires leaders to trust individuals and groups to self-manage and make decisions on their own (or with input from peers as needed) rather than simply following instructions from a higher-up. For example, if someone needs new software to finish the project they’re working on, they should be able to purchase it quickly on their own, rather than asking a superior for permission, filling out request forms, and waiting for approval. This process is time-consuming, costly, and frustrates people who are prevented from doing the important work.

(Shortform note: Daniel Pink’s _Drive_ echoes the importance of autonomy in the workplace and clarifies that it’s not just about doing work independently, but having agency (choice that comes from within, not from external pressures) in the work you're doing and how you complete it. Similar to Dignan, he claims that traditional work environments stifle autonomy and intrinsic motivation when managers assume the worst in others and therefore try to micromanage employees. To rekindle the innate intrinsic motivation in people, Pink recommends providing autonomy in four aspects of their work: the task, time, technique, and team.)

#### Flexible Organizational Structures

In addition to employee autonomy, Dignan’s second foundational principle for effective organizations is flexibility. **Flexible organizations can adapt to constantly changing conditions**. This means that you can quickly get rid of processes that don’t serve the organization and experiment with new ways of doing things to meet new challenges.

Flexible organizations allow people to problem-solve, rather than trying to predict and control every process from the top down. For example, if a weekly group meeting has become ineffective as a company has grown, the employees should have a simple way to get rid of the meeting and create new meetings as needed. This concept also applies to things like changing pay structures, budgets, and working roles.

> **Make Your Organization Antifragile**
> 
> Dignan’s concept of having flexible organizational structures is closely related to Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s theory of being antifragile: having a system that can withstand and benefit from uncertainty and volatility.
> 
> In _Antifragile_ , Taleb agrees with Dignan that the modern world changes quickly and in unpredictable ways. Therefore, rather than trying to control a complex system such as an organization, some of Taleb’s strategies for becoming antifragile include decentralizing authority in large systems (so there is less risk of catastrophe if one person makes a bad decision) and planning for failure rather than trying to avoid it. In a business context, planning for failure could include assuming that your technology product will eventually become obsolete and planning how you will pivot to a new direction in that scenario, rather than staying hyper-focused on the current product.

### Set the Stage for Change

To implement the key principles of autonomy and flexibility in your organization, Dignan explains the process of preparing your organization for big changes. He describes guidelines for introducing the principles over the long term and emphasizes the importance of establishing psychological safety and a consent process.

While some leaders might be less inclined to invest time and energy in invisible structures such as these, this type of groundwork is foundational to changes in other areas such as budgets, profit, and productivity.

#### Introducing the Principles Into Your Organization

Dignan notes the following points to keep in mind at all stages of change, particularly at the beginning when leaders have to commit to the process:

**There’s no one-size-fits-all plan.** Unlike other organizational strategies that provide step-by-step, detailed instructions, Dignan’s principles require group reflection and collaboration to design a system that works for your specific organization.

(Shortform note: Although each organization will have a unique pathway to becoming more flexible and autonomous, William and Susan Bridges’s _Managing Transitions_ explains that transitions consist of three overall phases: Closing, when people have to move on from the old way of doing things; The Bridge, when an organization is in between the old and new systems; and Emerging, when the changes are implemented and there’s widespread buy-in from team members. In addition, because change and reform are ongoing, leaders have to manage the three phases of transitions all happening concurrently and constantly.)

**Maintaining autonomy and flexibility is an ongoing effort.** There shouldn’t be just one big overhaul implemented at one point in time, but a long-term commitment to growth and evolution. In addition, the qualities of autonomy and flexibility should guide change at all levels and among all groups within the organization. In other words, you shouldn’t have autonomy and flexibility in one department but not in another.

(Shortform note: Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer’s _No Rules Rules _discusses Netflix’s strategy for maintaining autonomy and flexibility. The authors identify four key conditions that enable these qualities: a high concentration of talent, an emphasis on innovation over error prevention, a loose company structure, and companywide alignment. Their main deviation from Dignan’s strategies is their recommendation for a high concentration of talent. The authors claim that Netflix can trust its employees with a high level of autonomy _because_ they are the best in the business (not the other way around, as Dignan might suggest).)

#### Establish Psychological Safety

As a first step for implementing autonomy and flexibility through organizational reforms, Dignan claims that it’s crucial to **make sure people feel comfortable being vulnerable** and speaking up when they notice something going well or failing. Dignan’s vision for organizations depends on workers deciding for themselves how they can improve the organization. People won’t participate if they fear retaliation or feel that the leadership is not committed to the fundamental principles of autonomy and flexibility.

(Shortform note: In _Reinventing Organizations_ , Laloux goes beyond the need for psychological safety with respect to organizational reforms and discusses the importance of fostering authenticity in individuals more generally within an organization. This means that employees can always feel safe to be themselves (quirks and all), feel respected, and not have to put on a facade of “professionalism.”)

Leaders can foster psychological safety by allowing time for changes to unfold, allowing everyone time to speak in group settings, participating actively in the new changes being implemented, and reassuring group members that there’s room for both failure and growth.

> **Benefits of Establishing Trust in the Workplace**
> 
> For leaders, establishing psychological safety boils down to the idea of building trust in the workplace. In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Paul Marciano emphasizes the importance of this concept and explains three key benefits of leaders trusting their employees:
> 
>   * Employees feel more ownership over their work and are more likely to produce better results so they don’t let their colleagues down.
> 
>   * Employees feel more comfortable proposing riskier ideas, potentially leading to more innovation.
> 
>   * Employees are more receptive to change and feedback because they believe their colleagues have their best interests in mind.
> 
> 

> 
> Though trust may take a long time to develop, it’s an important foundation for a positive and productive work environment, and the processes proposed by Dignan throughout _Brave New Work_ can all be opportunities for building trust among colleagues.

#### Establish a Consent Process

In addition to psychological safety, establishing a consent process is another important early step for integrating autonomy and flexibility into an organization. The **consent process is meant to enable workers to shape structural change from within** , rather than to create an additional hurdle for people to get things done.

To facilitate a democratic process, Dignan recommends using a consent process such as Sociocracy or Integrative Decision Making (IDM).

In the IDM process, each participant has the opportunity to speak and give input on a proposal. Toward the end of the process, participants can either consent to the proposal or raise an objection if they think the proposal is either unsafe to try or would cause irreversible harm. Any objectors then work with the proposer to edit the proposal to get consent to move forward. In a system such as this, the decision-making process is inclusive, but it’s also designed to make progress rather than having ideas thrown out if there’s no consensus.

(Shortform note: IDM is also commonly referred to as Holacracy. HolacracyOne is the company that formalized IDM, and IDM is actually a procedure that fits within the overarching philosophy of Holacracy.)

> **Challenges of Implementing Holacracy**
> 
> Although several major businesses and organizations have experimented with Holacracy, some have experienced challenges with it that Dignan doesn’t discuss. For example, the shoe company Zappos adopted Holacracy and later offered employees severance packages if they didn’t like the self-management system or wanted to leave the company for a different reason. Eighteen percent took the severance package and 6% of employees said that Holacracy was a specific motivator for quitting.
> 
> Some people said there was too much ambiguity around the work processes and responsibilities, or that not much had changed about the way work was done despite meetings and trainings. However, it’s difficult to determine what factors may have led to these perceived shortcomings for some employees, and Zappos continues to evolve and use Holacracy throughout the company.
> 
> In another example, the publishing company Medium tried Holacracy and then ended the practice because it was too difficult to coordinate efforts for larger projects across company groups, and public perceptions of Holacracy made recruiting employees more difficult.

##### Meta-Decision-Making

Your decision-making process can help you **clarify different levels of decision-making power** : what decisions people can make independently in their day-to-day work, what decisions require seeking advice from a peer, and what kinds of decisions require the group’s consent.

For example, someone might be able to change strategies on their project or purchase a piece of necessary equipment without asking anyone. However, if a person wants to form an entirely new team to work on a project, the group may recommend seeking advice from another colleague first. And if someone wants to restructure the company’s salary system, this may require using the decision-making method described above to get the entire group’s consent.

(Shortform note: In contrast to Dignan’s preference for different layers of decision-making power, Laloux’s _Reinventing Organizations _advocates letting employees make any decision on their own, as long as they seek advice from the people impacted by the decision first. Laloux points out that transparent information and the advice-seeking process are key to helping people make informed decisions. Similarly, Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer’s _No Rules Rules _emphasizes the importance of making company information transparent so that employees can make autonomous decisions.)

Dignan points out that this consent process doesn’t have to be set in stone—using these methods, participants can also consent to a _different_ decision-making process, like delegating authority to a sub-group.

> **Dignan’s Goals Parallel Those of Holacracy**
> 
> The official mission of the Holacracy governance system closely mirrors Dignan’s overall vision for organizations.
> 
> Both are focused on complex, human systems and aim to decrease hierarchy management, increase employee engagement, and distribute authority widely through dynamic roles. Both philosophies recommend tailoring strategies to the unique context of the organization based on these overarching principles. Similar to Dignan’s recommendations for constant, iterative experimentation (discussed later in the guide), Holacracy recommends “incremental evolution” to adapt to new challenges.
> 
> However, Dignan __ also discusses more specific strategies and experiments, not limited to Holacracy, that have been successful in revolutionizing businesses. For example, Dignan recommends experiments like letting employees set their own salaries and write their own job descriptions.

### Strategies for Implementing Change

Once you’ve set the stage for reform by establishing psychological safety and a consent process, you’re ready to implement Dignan’s strategies to combat disillusionment and inefficiency at work. Each of these strategies aims to incorporate his foundational principles of autonomy and flexibility into your organization.

#### Define a Unifying Purpose

Defining a unifying purpose is an essential step in establishing autonomy and flexibility because it **enables cohesive work in a decentralized context**. This should be a group effort (ideally using the consent process) to determine the overall purpose of the work, who your purpose serves, and how the purpose could be changed in the future if needed.

As individuals and groups gain the freedom to act autonomously, the **unifying purpose should guide decisions and determine what organizational changes are needed**. Metrics can be used to determine if the work is aligned with the unifying purpose, but not necessarily as a measure of success.

For example, if your organization’s purpose is to make access to clean water more equitable, members can use statistics on the number of new wells installed as a helpful indicator without it becoming the sole focus. Natural disasters may set back the efforts to install wells, new and improved technologies may emerge, or employees may find other innovative ways to work toward the goal of equitable water access.

> **Criteria for an Effective Shared Vision**
> 
> Similar to Dignan’s ideas about a group’s purpose, in _First Things First_ , Stephen R. Covey claims that organizations (as well as non-professional groups like families) benefit from a shared vision that makes everyone feel empowered and provides clear criteria on which people can base their decisions. According to Covey, the group should create a shared mission statement with the following characteristics:
> 
>   * It focuses on something everyone feels passionate about.
> 
>   * It comes from the employees and isn’t imposed from the administrative level.
> 
>   * It’s based on universal principles such as fairness, integrity, honesty, and human dignity.
> 
>   * It addresses everyone’s needs, and specifically, the four essential needs of survival, connection, learning, and giving back.
> 
> 

> 
> These characteristics mostly align with Dignan’s recommendation for creating a unifying purpose that contributes to human well-being and emerges from the collective of workers, though Covey’s version is more specific about the moral values it should embody.

#### Distribute Authority Widely

For the principles of autonomy and flexibility to be effective in your organization, authority is another important area to reform. In general, Dignan recommends giving people the power to carry out the organization’s purpose the best way they see fit, rather than workers simply following orders from a superior. **Regular governance meetings and allocating resources as needed** are a couple of specific ways to distribute authority.

A regular governance meeting creates a democratic space for everyone to implement the consent process discussed in the previous section. In these meetings, **everyone has the authority to propose changes to structures and processes** or to raise concerns about anything inhibiting their work. If your organization already has a lot of meetings, Dignan also recommends canceling all meetings for two weeks to give everyone a chance to figure out what meetings are genuinely helpful. People can then return to the governance meeting with a new perspective on what changes they want to see and what processes they want to maintain.

(Shortform note: Applied in a different context, governance meetings within families enable a more democratic style of parenting, as opposed to an authoritarian style (where parents set strict rules) or a permissive style (where children can do what they want). In democratic parenting, governance meetings are an opportunity for each family member to have a voice and weigh in on activities, household rules, and allowances. Similar to Dignan’s benefits of an autonomous workplace, advocates of this practice argue that it fosters feelings of connection, worthiness, autonomy, and courage in children.)

Since control of resources is another way to exercise authority, allowing workers to allocate resources as needed is another way to distribute authority. Rather than adhering to a rigid, traditional budget that controls the flow of resources, Dignan suggests maximizing discretionary funds and the number of people who have access to them.

> **More Strategies for and Benefits of Decentralizing Authority**
> 
> Although the context differs from the corporate environment, in _Team of Teams_ , Stanley McChrystal talks about strategies and benefits of redistributing authority throughout his military task force in Iraq. Despite the fact that the military is known for its rigid hierarchical structures, McChrystal found that running all decisions through the chain of command put them at greater risk because they could not act quickly in high-stakes situations.
> 
> To distribute authority throughout the ranks, McChrystal encouraged members to make decisions independently as long as the decision advanced the mission of the task force and was moral and legal. When officers who felt comfortable making decisions on their own reported on those decisions at briefings, McChrystal publicly approved of their actions to encourage more people to do the same. This decentralization of authority took more time for some people to adjust to, but McChrystal eventually noted the following benefits of this method:
> 
>   * Decisions were made more quickly, making the operations more efficient.
> 
>   * The quality of the decisions improved because the individuals responsible for making them felt more invested in the outcome. Instead of simply carrying out someone else’s order, they had to decide what they thought was best and eventually report on the outcome.
> 
>   * The people closer to the action were making better decisions, as opposed to their superiors, who might be farther away and have less contextual information.
> 
> 


##### Morning Star Case Study

As an example of distributing authority via resources, Dignan describes a tomato-processing company called Morning Star. Morning Star has working groups annually present their ideas for the year, and they collectively build the budget based on the ideas they are most excited about. They also allow employees to annually set their own salaries and write their own job descriptions, followed by a peer review process where their colleagues can give advice. Through these mechanisms, authority that is usually concentrated at the management level is distributed to everyone. In addition, the company’s profit growth far outpaces that of its competitors with more traditional structures.

(Shortform note: Similar to this example, Laloux’s _Reinventing Organizations_ discusses the merit of allowing employees to set their own salaries and creating a peer review system for salaries. However, there’s potential for gender inequality and other forms of societal inequality to persist in these systems. One study showed that women earn 25% less than men in self-managed teams, potentially because of the difference in their negotiating styles. Although Dignan points out that with peer review, people can encourage their colleagues to increase their proposed salary if they’re undervaluing themselves, or vice versa, mechanisms may still be needed to counteract embedded inequality in the workplace.)

#### Create Dynamic Teams

Creating dynamic teams gives individuals and groups within the organization the **autonomy to get work done quickly as self-sufficient units** (while still being united by the group’s overall purpose). Dignan argues that individuals should not be tied to a specific job title and should instead have the **flexibility to join multiple teams** based on their interests and desire to contribute toward the overall purpose. This results in a network of dynamic roles rather than a traditional organization chart with fixed and limiting positions.

One strategy for creating dynamic teams is to experiment with what Dignan calls SLAM teams:

  * **Self-managed:** The team doesn’t have to provide progress updates or receive instructions from a higher-up. 
  * **Lean:** The group is small enough to make decisions and mobilize quickly. 
  * **Audacious:** The team can pursue bold activities unencumbered by outside leadership. 
  * **Multidisciplinary:** The team has the skill set to achieve its goal. 



> **Dynamic Teams Foster Business Agility**
> 
> Research by the consulting group McKinsey confirms that businesses tend to be more successful when they create flexible or “agile” teams that enable employees to pivot to high-priority tasks and form new teams as needed. Having an “agile business” means it can adapt quickly to changing conditions. In this flow-to-work model described by McKinsey, businesses get the most out of people with multiple or scarce skills because they can work on multiple projects or areas of the business, rather than being limited to a single project or department.
> 
> The concept of business agility aligns closely with Dignan’s idea of flexibility and complexity-consciousness, and it also extends beyond dynamic teaming. The Framework for Business Agility includes agile people, culture, leadership, strategy, and governance.

#### Practice Looping Continuously

The last strategy for achieving autonomy and flexibility is to practice “looping.” The process of **looping involves experimenting with new practices and assessing how well they work for your group**.

It incorporates Dignan’s principle of autonomy by giving people the responsibility for identifying areas they’d like to improve and potential strategies for making changes. It also embodies the principle of organizational flexibility because it allows you to quickly iterate different ways of doing things. Dignan suggests that looping should be frequent and ongoing to facilitate constant progress. Notably, looping can involve eliminating processes in addition to adding new ones.

Looping includes the following steps:

  1. Observe areas for improvement.
  2. Propose a new system or strategy to experiment with. Clarify details such as the timeframe and people involved. 
  3. Conduct the experiment. 
  4. Reflect on what went well and what didn’t work well, then repeat. 



> **Looping as an Effective Leadership Strategy**
> 
> In _The Leadership Challenge_ , James Kouzes and Barry Posner argue that improving an organization through small, ongoing experimentation is an effective leadership strategy because it shows the members of the group that the organizational structures are rooted in proof of success rather than being arbitrary. Kouzes and Posner also point out that even if the experiments don’t go well, learning from failure is a highly effective teaching tool. The trial-by-error method works best when leaders:
> 
>   * Cultivate a growth mindset in which people believe they can improve their skills through hard work and practice
> 
>   * Create a culture of learning where people have opportunities to do things like seminars and online classes and can also try out new roles to develop their skills
>
