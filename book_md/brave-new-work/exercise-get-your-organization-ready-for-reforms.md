## Exercise: Get Your Organization Ready for Reforms

Before you can begin revolutionizing your organization using Dignanâ€™s recommendations, think about whether your organization satisfies the two conditions for implementing change: a unifying purpose and psychological safety.

* * *

Describe the purpose of your organization. Does the purpose motivate you and guide your decisions, or is it easy to forget amid the work?

Do you think the members of your organization are aligned with the purpose? If given the chance, how might you change this purpose to make it more human-centered or specific?

Describe a situation where you feel psychologically safe in your organization. For example, do you feel comfortable expressing your opinions or pitching risky ideas to others?

What are some ways that you or your leaders could improve psychological safety in your organization? For example, could you reward members of the group for participating in open discussion, or could leaders practice making space for others to speak up in group settings?
