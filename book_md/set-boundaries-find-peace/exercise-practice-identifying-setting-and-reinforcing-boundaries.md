## Exercise: Practice Identifying, Setting, and Reinforcing Boundaries

Learn to set healthy boundaries in your relationships.

* * *

Think of a recent situation where the way someone else treated you made you feel uncomfortable. Reflect on what specific actions made you feel uncomfortable and how you’d like to be treated differently in the future. Express this boundary below, in the form of a statement to the person who made you uncomfortable. For example: “I’d prefer that you refer to me by my first name, instead of using embarrassing nicknames.”

It’s best to assert your boundaries as soon as possible when someone else makes you uncomfortable. Look back on the situation from the previous question. Did you respond in the moment to let the other person know you were uncomfortable? If not, when is the next opportunity you’ll have to share your boundaries with this person? Briefly describe when and how you’ll initiate that conversation.

Prepare to reinforce your boundaries by deciding in advance what to do if the other person continues to violate your boundaries. In addition to restating the boundary, come up with consequences that protect you from discomfort and let the other person know you’re serious about your boundaries. Below, write down these consequences in the form of a statement to the other person. For example: “If you call me that embarrassing nickname in front of our friends again, I won’t invite you to go out with me next time.”
