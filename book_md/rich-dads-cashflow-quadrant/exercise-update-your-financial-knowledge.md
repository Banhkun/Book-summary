## Exercise: Update Your Financial Knowledge

How does what you learned from your financial education measure up to Kiyosaki’s advice?

* * *

Think about your level of financial education when you were 18. Did it come from formal education, family, friends, or independent research?

Write down three major points of financial advice you’ve received.

Does the advice you’ve received align with Kiyosaki’s emphasis on income type and the importance of generating capital to invest in assets, or does it align with the traditional path?

Now that you know Kiyosaki’s reasons for believing the traditional path to wealth no longer works, what pieces of advice are you rethinking?
