## Part 2.1: Employees and Small Business Owners

Common wisdom focuses on what kind of _jobs_ generate the most money. **Kiyosaki wants us to think differently and focus on what kind of _income_ will generate the most money. **As we’ve previewed, there are four general ways of generating income: as an employee (E), as a self-employed person or a small business owner (S), as a large business owner (B), and as an investor (I). **In the E and S categories,_you generate income from the work you do_. **

In this section, we’ll start by defining how you generate income in the E and S categories. (We’ll discuss the other two categories, B and I, in Part 3.) We’ll also discuss the traits that generally attract people to these categories.

Then, we’ll explain why Kiyosaki says **the E and S categories constitute the “traditional path” and why they’re no longer a safe bet for financial security, much less financial freedom.**

### Employees and the Self Employed/Small Business Owners: The E and S Categories

According to Kiyosaki, in both the E and S categories,**the money you make is based on the _work you do_**. Here, we’ll define both categories and explain how income is generated in each one. We’ll also explore the values Kiyosaki associates with the E and S categories, and how they influence E’s and S’s choice of work and attitudes toward money.

Keep in mind that neither your training nor your career field dictates what category you’re in; _only the way you generate your income does._

#### Employee (E)

An employee works for a business, organization, or person. As an employee, you have a paycheck and a boss. You have a contract and exchange work for money on a continuing basis.

**Examples:** CEOs and secretaries are both in the E category because they draw a salary from the company they work for.

**Values:** Kiyosaki says people drawn to the E category prioritize **security**. According to Kiyosaki, people often choose the E category because they value:

  * Predictability of their day-to-day work
  * Clarity in their job responsibilities
  * Knowing they will be paid regularly
  * Knowing their job is safe as long as they keep performing well
  * The health and retirement benefits an E category job has traditionally offered 



According to Kiyosaki, **E’s are influenced by fear of uncertainty—in both their job responsibilities and especially in their finances—and are willing to sacrifice money for security.**

**Disadvantages:** Other than the financial trap Kiyosaki says an E job will land you in (which we discuss in the second half of this section), Kiyosaki says the disadvantages of an E job are the lack of control you have over your day-to-day work and the idea that the better you are at your job, the more responsibility you get, and the harder you have to work. (Shortform note: A related disadvantage is “job creep,” where employees are gradually expected to perform more work than what’s detailed in their job description. This often eats into employees’ personal time.)

> **Benefits of the E Category**
> 
> While Kiyosaki is quick to point out the downsides of being an employee, he’s short on positives. One benefit of an E category job is that it can be a great way to learn skills and get paid for it. Kiyosaki notes that he was an employee of the Xerox company for four years, where he learned to overcome his shyness as a salesman.
> 
> Furthermore, many people appreciate, rather than feel held back by, the structure of an E category job.
> 
>   * People with mortgages, student loans, or other long-term significant debt may appreciate predictable pay.
> 
>   * Parents with school-age children may appreciate a predictable work schedule.
> 
> 

> 
> Though Kiyosaki makes the disclaimer that all four “cashflow quadrants” make up an important part of the economy, he downplays the fact that many people seek out E category jobs because they enjoy work they can only do in the E category. Professors, researchers, chefs, and teachers, for example, all make a salary and often attract people interested in the particular kind of work offered in the E category.

#### Self Employed/Small Business Owner (S)

The self employed and small business owners _are_ their business. They are their own boss, and can also be the boss of other people, but without their labor, expertise, and management, their business can’t run. Their income is the profit from their business.

**Examples:** Restaurateurs, makeup artists, doctors, and writers are all in this category.

**Values:** Kiyosaki says people drawn to the S category prioritize **personal excellence and independence**. According to Kiyosaki, people often choose the S category because they value:

  * Being at the top of their chosen field. For S’s, being good at their _craft_ matters a lot. Kiyosaki labels S’s both perfectionists and artists. According to Kiyosaki, they think that they are the best at what they do and want to have control over their work. They bristle when people who aren’t as talented as they are decide their pay. According to Kiyosaki, **an S’s need for independence and personal excellence tops their desire for money.**
  * Like those in the E category, they also value security; unlike those in the E category, **they feel secure when they take control completely** because they trust themselves more than anyone else. 



(Shortform note: As we’ll see, these values can contribute to a business’s success, but they may just as likely contribute to a business’s failure, as well.)

**Disadvantages:** The biggest negative in the S category, according to Kiyosaki, is that most small businesses fail. S’s are at particular risk for burnout because they have to perform _all_ the functions of their business, not just their core competency. A self-employed stylist has to be her own marketing team, do all her own invoices and expenses, and plan all her own travel. Like E’s, if an S business _does_ succeed, Kiyosaki warns that success means long hours and a lot of hard work.

> **Why Small Businesses Fail**
> 
> About 60% of small businesses will fail within their first ten years. Causes for small business failure other than the ones Kiyosaki lists include:
> 
>   * Not enough capital. Small businesses need to plan to have enough of a financial cushion to keep them afloat until they become profitable. If they haven’t allocated enough, money can run out before the business is profitable, and it’s difficult for unprofitable businesses to get loans.
> 
>   * Having a bad business plan, or not sticking to your good business plan. A bad business plan is a simple recipe for failure, and most businesses can’t absorb major spending or other changes.
> 
>   * Poor or overwhelmed management. A small business owner has to manage both the business plan _and_ a team of employees. They must have both business and leadership sense; one without the other is usually a sign of trouble.
> 
>   * Not reading the market. In the heat of their desire to have a certain kind of small business, many S’s will enter an already saturated market. Additionally, your location and marketing, including internet presence, need to connect you to the right customers. Your business can’t thrive without customers.
> 
>   * Caring more about excellence and independence than money: As discussed, people in the S category often take great pride in the quality of their work, but quality doesn’t always translate to more sales or contracts. When S’s prioritize excellence at the expense of efficiency or marketing, their business is likely to fail.
> 
> 


Kiyosaki assures us that E’s and S’s do important and necessary jobs in the economy. He says that E’s prize security, and S’s prize independence and excellence in their field in addition to and as a means toward security. However, because of economic changes over the past half-century, Kiyosaki argues that **the E and S categories are significantly less secure than they used to be and are, in fact, risky.**

(Shortform note: Kiyosaki doesn’t mention that one of the biggest dangers of self-employment or owning a small business is not being able to fully plan for the amount of money you’ll make within a given period. E category workers are subject to job insecurity, like a round of layoffs because of trouble at the company or an economic downturn, but an S category worker’s job is inherently at least a little bit insecure because they are not in a long-term contract with an employer. This, and the failure rate of small businesses, work against his claim that the S category is particularly secure.)
