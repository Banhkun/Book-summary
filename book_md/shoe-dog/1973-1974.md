## 1973-1974

### 1973

Prefontaine is in a funk from getting 4th in the 1972 Olympics. But he eventually gets his fire back, and he’s wearing Nikes while winning. Because US Olympic athletes at the time couldn’t collect endorsement money, Pre is also destitute. So Nike signs him as a “National Director of Public Affairs,” or a celebrity endorser, paying $5000 a year. Everywhere Pre goes, Nike goes. People flock to see him, and Pre urges them to give Nike a try.

Phil strongly requests two employees, Woodell and Johnson, to trade roles and locations, transferring between Boston and Oregon. Interestingly, he writes, “in keeping with my personality...I expressed no gratitude. I spoke not a word of thanks or praise.”

Sales are higher than ever at $4.8 million, but this year they lose $57,000. Their investors, the debenture holders, are shocked, even though Nike is gaining national traction. Phil placates them by giving them a fixed conversion rate on stock for five years, and he thinks he’ll never want to go public and have to deal with thousands of shareholders.

As expected, Onitsuka files a suit for breach of contract in Japan. Nike quickly files against them in the United States. Phil is deposed, and some facts don’t look great, like his memo about hiring a spy in Onitsuka, and stealing Kitami’s folder from his briefcase to find he was courting distributors. Despite this, Phil has a legal team he trusts and who insist they’re going to win.

Another problem in the business is creating enough supply to meet the massive demand for their shoes. Their factories are churning out shoes reliably, unlike with Onitsuka, but it’s hard to ramp up supply without taking on inventory risk from unsold shoes. Nike is already walking a fine line of profitability, and any missed shipment would delay payment to Nissho, which would cut down their ability to borrow, which would in turn delay their next factory order.

So Phil has an idea – what if they go to retailers and ask for large upfront orders 6 months in advance with big discounts, up to 7%? At first, the retailers are hesitant, but they turn around when Nike unveils a few flashy new shoes, like an updated Bruin and new Cortezes. Soon even the stragglers desperately sign up to avoid being locked out.

In September, Phil and Penny have their second child, Travis.

### 1974

The trial with Onitsuka begins in April in Portland on the matter of breach of contract and ownership of trademarks. Over several days, members of Blue Ribbon and Onitsuka are interviewed as witnesses. The stance of Onitsuka is that Blue Ribbon had always engineered a con, employing spies and deception to string them along until they could cut Onitsuka out.

Blue Ribbon has a rocky path to winning. Phil Knight gives questionable testimony about stealing from Kitami’s briefcase and nurturing a spy within Onitsuka (Fujimoto). A former store manager, Bork, has turned traitor and joined Kitami’s team, and he feeds them surgical questions to expose Blue Ribbon’s operations. Bowerman, out of contempt, hasn’t prepared and fumbles through his testimony. And Kitami lies about his movements, claiming he was only exploring distributors for market research, and the idea for Onitsuka to buy Blue Ribbon came from Phil Knight.

But there are silver linings. Iwano, Kitami’s young assistant, testifies honestly that there was a fixed plan to break Blue Ribbon’s contract, and Kitami had discussed it many times. And Kitami suspiciously requests a translator despite his fluent English, and even corrects the translator In English a few times.

Weeks later, the judge has a ruling. He will rule only on the trademarks and not on the contract breach, for reasons not explained. He says ultimately Blue Ribbon’s testimony seems more truthful – Iwano seemed honest, whereas Kitami seemed to practice active deception, especially with the translation. The judge rules that Blue Ribbon keeps all rights to the shoe names Boston and Cortez, and Blue Ribbon is due damages. He will decide damages over a few days.

Phil and the Blue Ribbon legal team are ecstatic. They weren’t expecting a win. A week after the ruling, Onitsuka pre-empts the judge’s damages by offering a settlement of $400,000. Blue Ribbon takes the deal. They sign the papers with Kitami present, and as they leave they awkwardly take the same elevator down.

The lead attorney on the case, Strasser, impresses Phil so much that they recruit him to be in-house counsel for Blue Ribbon.

Back to business: the major issue of the year is manufacturing. By working with Japanese factories, Blue Ribbon is subject to currency and labor cost fluctuations. They need new factories in new countries. Taiwan seems an obvious choice, but they’re still ramping up their quality. Puerto Rico is their second option, and despite the poorer quality they plan to make raw materials in Puerto Rico and assemble shoes in New England.

Johnson, having just moved to Oregon at Phil’s behest, is now tasked with managing the New England factory. He complains but knows that he can trust no one else to do the job, so he moves back cross-country.

This year, Nike is on track to reaching $8 million in sales. Beating Adidas seems like a possibility at this point. They open more stores and make more deals. They sign more endorsements, but Pre is still their top endorser. “We’ll always have Pre,” Phil says.
