## 1966-1967

### 1966

Blue Ribbon’s first salesman, Johnson has a personality quirk – he sends Phil mountains of letters, detailing his every development, every sale and notable customer. (Shortform note: Just take a minute to remember that business used to be done entirely through phone and letters, not email). Johnson sends advertising ideas (Phil doesn’t believe in advertising), shoe designs (Phil already has enough to deal with Bowerman), and his insistence on opening a retail shop in Los Angeles.

Phil feels smothered and rarely replies to Johnson’s letters. From studying war heroes and generals, he holds a virtue: **“Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.”**

And Johnson delivers results. His customers love him, depending on Johnson to solve their problems in both running and life. Even when he gets in a car crash and breaks his skull, he continues to sell shoes. Phil even issues him a challenge – sell 3,250 pairs of shoes in a few months, and Johnson could open his retail space in LA. And sell he does – now Blue Ribbon has an official runner mecca in Los Angeles.

At one point, Johnson sends one letter that Phil can’t ignore. One of Johnson’s customers says that he can start getting Tiger running shoes from another seller – a wrestling coach somewhere in the East Coast. That same wrestling coach from 1964 who was supposed to stick to wrestling shoes.

This simply can’t do. The wrestling coach is stepping on Blue Ribbon’s turf, capitalizing on all the hard work they’ve done building brand recognition for Onitsuka.

Phil flies to Japan immediately to meet with Onitsuka. (Financially, this is no small feat – he doesn’t have the money, so he puts the charge on his credit card.) He has a new contact – a slick-looking man named Kitami. They settle into a large conference room with other executives.

Phil lays out his case. They’d been doubling their sales each year and projecting $84,000 in sales in 1967. He’d like to become Onitsuka’s exclusive US distributor for track and field. Kitami rebuffs him. They want someone bigger, more established, with nationwide offices. Phil counters that not only do they have a new retail shop in Los Angeles, but they also have offices on both coasts.

(Phil was lying – they didn’t have an East Coast office.)

After some deliberation, Onitsuka delivers good news – Blue Ribbon will be the exclusive distributor of Tiger track and field shoes in the United States. Onitsuka would send shoes immediately to Blue Ribbon’s East Coast office. Take that, wrestling coach.

Phil is both ecstatic and anxious. Anxious because he has to open an East Coast office before the shoes arrive. He also needs someone to run the office.

There’s only one person crazy and passionate enough to do this at a moment’s notice – Johnson.

### 1967

Johnson does leave for the East Coast, but not without a fight. His father, a salesman himself, pushes Johnson to ask for more – a partnership in Blue Ribbon, $600 in monthly salary, and a third of all profits after 6,000 pairs sold.

Neither Phil nor Bowerman, the only owners of Blue Ribbon, want to give up their equity. So Phil flies to Johnson and his father to negotiate. Despite the arguments of Johnson’s father, Phil holds steady – he would give Johnson a $50 raise, and that was it. Johnson looks torn, but he doesn’t want to quit. He needs Blue Ribbon, and despite Phil’s refusal to answer his letters, Johnson feels like he thrives.

Blue Ribbon is hiring rapidly, and Bowerman has an employee candidate for Phil. Bob Woodell is famous. He was a standout runner at Oregon, but an accident left him paralyzed from the waist down and now in a wheelchair. Phil meets with him and they’re mutually smitten. Phil offers him a job opening Blue Ribbon’s second retail store in Eugene, Oregon.

Bowerman is doing other things, as always. He designs a new training shoe with a more solid sole. Onitsuka actually listens and creates a prototype, and they name it the “Aztec,” in recognition of the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

Then Adidas sues – they have a shoe called the “Azteca Gold.” In response, they rename their shoe after the conqueror of the Aztecs – the Cortez.

Bowerman has also written a book called _Jogging_. Remember how running at this time is a nonsense activity? This book changes that. _Jogging_ sells a million copies, sparking a movement and a whole new generation of runners.

Blue Ribbon moves out of Phil’s apartment and into its first real office. It’s a fixer-upper, with tissue-thin walls and broken windows. Johnson has settled on the location of their first East Coast office – Wellesley, MA, a place where runners seemed to abound and the Boston Marathon runs through.
