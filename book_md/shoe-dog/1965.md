## 1965

As it relates to selling shoes, there are a few things to remember about this time. First, running wasn’t really considered a sport or a hobby. It’s hard to believe today, but in the 1960s, jogging to get exercise was something only maniacs would do. To be fair, everyone still smoked like a fiend, and heart disease hadn’t been figured out yet. So Blue Ribbon is still selling the Onitsuka shoes primarily to student athletes – popular as they were, they appeal to just a small niche of the population.

Second, venture capital the way we understand it today didn’t really exist. Small businesses got their startup cash from banks, but banks had very different priorities from today’s venture capital firms. For one, banks didn’t want companies to grow too quickly. They wanted new companies to get profitable quickly and to never let sales exceed their cash balance.

So fast-growing Blue Ribbon run by ambitious Phil is constantly running into issues with their cash balance. Even though their sales are doubling regularly, this cash is quickly turned around to order the next, larger shipment of shoes. Thus Blue Ribbon constantly skates on thin ice with its bank.

Compounding this problem, Onitsuka is painfully unresponsive with Phil and Blue Ribbon. Their shoe shipments often arrive late, which gives Blue Ribbon less time to sell shoes, which then makes each loan repayment period tougher.

Fearing the worst from all these problems, Phil decides to hedge his bets by returning to accounting at Price Waterhouse. He doesn’t love the work, but it pays the bills.

Despite all this bad news, there are two positive developments. First, Phil hires his first full-time employee, a fellow Stanford runner named Jeff Johnson who will sell shoes in Los Angeles. Johnson has a messianic view on running – believing running done right is akin to enlightenment – and Phil hasn’t met anyone with his passion for running.

Secondly, Coach Bowerman continues to be a huge asset. His large reputation keeps growing – two of his runners medal in the 1964 Olympics. And he keeps tinkering with shoes. He learns that Japanese and American bodies are simply different, and thus the shoes need to be different, like more arch support. To have a great chance in the US, he believes Onitsuka needs to customize their shoes for Americans.

He draws up countless designs and sends them to Japan, only to receive no response. Occasionally they relent and make a few prototypes, and indeed they’re far better. Undeterred by Onitsuka’s hesitance, Bowerman even experiments with producing homemade rubber to make new soles.

You might be able to see where this is going.
