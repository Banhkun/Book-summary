## 1963-1964

### 1963

Six months after he first left for Hawaii, Phil returns home to Oregon. He greets his family warmly, but he’s concerned about one thing – have the shoes from Onitsuka arrived?

They haven’t.

He sends a letter to Onitsuka, and they reply, promising the shoes will come in a couple of days. In the meantime, he needs a job. His father’s friend, CEO of a publicly-traded company, advises him to get a CPA. If Phil changes jobs, both CPA and MBA degrees would surely prevent his salary from dropping.

Phil takes accounting classes, earns his CPA, then joins an accounting firm. It’s small – with just 4 employees, they work 70-hour weeks. While he waits for shoes to arrive, he yearns to travel, and wonders whether his journey was the peak of his life. Accounting is not his thing.

### 1964

The Onitsuka shoes arrive! Phil thinks they’re beautiful. After all, they are the embodiment of his future. Immediately, he sends two pairs to his old track coach at U of Oregon, Bill Bowerman.

Phil considers Bill part father figure, part army general. A gruff, tough-love descendant of Oregon Trail pioneers, Bill Bowerman was revered by the track team. Obsessed with performance, Bowerman constantly experimented with shoes to improve his runners’ performance, particularly to make shoes lighter. Bowerman stressed that an extra ounce to a shoe added 55 pounds of lifting over one mile. As a mediocre runner, Phil was Bowerman’s favorite guinea pig (he wouldn’t dare jeopardize the top runners with experimental shoes).

Bowerman was the most famous track coach in America, training local champions and many sub-4 minute milers. So Phil is shocked when Bowerman says not only did he like the shoes, he wants in. They work out a deal – Blue Ribbon would order 300 pairs of shoes, costing $1,000. They’d each put in half the money, and they’d split the company 51-49 – Phil with the 51. Once again, Phil gets his $500 from his father, who has reservations about his MBA son leaving his respectable accounting job to become a wandering shoe salesman.

They order 300 shoes, and Phil fills their basement with the shoes. Even better, they come with an announcement: Blue Ribbon Shoes is now the exclusive distributor for Onitsuka in the West.

Phil sells shoes the best way he knew how – going to track meets and showing the shoes to runners, coaches, and fans. His pitch: Japanese manufacturing makes high-quality shoes for extremely low prices. Word spreads fast – sales are so good, strangers show up at their house to buy Onitsukas. Just a few months later, they sell out of their shoes and order a bigger shipment of 300 shoes.

But suddenly, turmoil strikes in the form of a letter. A high school wrestling coach on the East coast claims that he’s met with Onitsuka’s senior management and has been made exclusive American distributor – Blue Ribbon was infringing on _his_ rights. Perplexed, Phil writes to Onitsuka. No response.

After months of waiting, and with no shoes to sell, Phil makes a last-ditch trip to Japan to resolve the dispute, one way or another. He flies to Japan and books a meeting. He’s tremulous, knowing that his future could be decided here.

In a preliminary first meeting, Phil launches into an impassioned plea saying the 13 West states are his, his company’s growth is strong, and that Onitsuka is honor-bound to continue their agreement. His Japanese counterparty stoically says he’ll be in touch as he leaves.

The next day, he’s scheduled for a meeting with the founder of the company, Mr. Onitsuka himself. The founder says he sees himself in the young Phil Knight. After a pause, Mr. Onistuka grants sales of _track_ shoes in the Western states to Phil, while the wrestling coach can sell his _wrestling_ shoes nationwide.

Phil is ecstatic. Before heading home, he decides to climb Mt. Fuji. Along the way, he charms a British girl, Sarah, an heiress to a chocolate company. Despite her wealth, she seems like a free spirit. They spend two joyful days in Japan, and he invites her to visit in Oregon. Weeks later, she visits, and they spend several more weeks as she charms his family.

But this comes to an end. Her (wealthy) parents disapprove of Phil, and their relationship fizzles through an exchange of increasingly distant letters. Phil wonders whether she saw him mainly as a chance to let loose and rebel, not as a real relationship worth keeping.

The new shoes arrive from Japan, but Phil spends weeks in a distraught stupor over his breakup. His sister Jeanne consoles him. Thankful, Phil offers Jeanne the position of first employee at Blue Ribbon. She accepts.
