## 1976

This year is relatively crisis-free, and Phil Knight and his team spend their time thinking about the future. Now that Nike is becoming a national, household brand, they officially incorporate as Nike, Inc.

When introspecting about what the ultimate goal of Nike is, Phil comes up with a single word: “winning.” Phil feels personally affronted when runners are wearing shoes other than Nikes. At the 1976 Olympic Trials, multiple qualifying runners are wearing Nike as they qualify to represent the US, and Nike is the talk of the athletic town. But in the actual Olympics, a runner who had previously worn Nikes at the Trials was now wearing Onitsuka Tigers – he wasn’t confident Nikes would last a whole marathon. Phil is crushed. Every rejection of Nike is a rejection of himself.

Luckily, the Nike waffle trainers are more popular than ever. They’re breaking out of athletic uses and becoming an everyday lifestyle shoe, something competitors found hard to do. Sales double _again_ to $14 million.

With this popularity, Nike needs to find new manufacturers who can handle scale, and they finally turn to Taiwan. After scouring dozens of dirty, crowded factories, they find a few shoe dogs they can trust and sign deals. Phil and his mentee drink heavily, prompted by the Taiwanese businessmen. Importantly, given the frictions between Taiwan and China, Phil sets up a sub-company called Athena. He wants to preserve the potential to enter China, with its two billion feet to put shoes on.

Despite their massive sales, finances are continuously an issue, and they continuously ponder whether to go public. It would raise cash to fuel growth, but they feel it would sell their soul and control. So they keep punting it to later, raising loans from new banks.

One loan requires Phil and Bowerman to personally guarantee the loan, which Bowerman doesn’t want to risk anymore. Bowerman wants to sell 2/3 of his stake in Blue Ribbon, which Phil reluctantly accepts. But Bowerman starts feeling idle in retirement and disrespected by Nike, even though they’re giving him the experimental equipment and tools he needs. Phil wants to keep Bowerman happy.

There are countless more difficulties to resolve – a larger warehouse on the East Coast, a larger scale advertising agency, new endorsements for more sports. But Phil gets through it with his ragtag team of Woodell, Johnson, Strasser, and Hayes. They call each other and the team Buttface. The joke is, in how many successful companies can you yell, “Hey, buttface,” and the team turns around?

Why does he love his team so? They’re clearly effective at their work, but they’re also cut from the same cloth. They came from Oregon, and they all had their personal chips on their shoulders to validate themselves to the world (Woodell lost his athletic dreams in an accident and was now confined to a wheelchair; Hayes couldn’t become partner at his accounting firm because he was too fat; Phil was cut from the baseball team and had his heart broken). They had thick skin, and they took each other down a notch. It was them against the world.

But outside of business, Phil feels guilty about his home life. He’s less often at home than he’d like, and his family misses them. Matthew holds a grudge, insisting he’ll never wear a Nike shoe. In contrast, Travis always understands.

Phil continuously questions himself and what he’s doing. Is he a good manager? Is he a good father?
