## Chapter 8: Getting Traction

With five key business components (vision, people, data, issues, and process) in place, you’re ready to create organizational traction and move forward. **Getting traction means executing, or making your vision a reality**. To create traction, set 90-day priorities and establish a meeting structure.

### 1) Priorities (‘Rocks’)

**Short-term priorities move you in the direction of your vision**. The company, leadership team, and employees all should have three to seven quarterly priorities aligned with your vision. When you focus everyone in the same direction, you collectively gain traction.

This book refers to priorities as “Rocks,” based on an analogy in Stephen Covey’s book, _First Things First,_ involving a cylinder (container) and rocks, gravel, sand, and water.

The cylinder represents the amount of time in your work day. The rocks are your priorities, gravel represents day-to-day responsibilities, sand represents interruptions, and water is everything else that comes up during your day.

If you put gravel, sand, and water into the cylinder first, the rocks won’t fit—that is, when you spend your time on day-to-day details, interruptions, and trivia, there won’t be time to address priorities. But when you put the rocks into the cylinder first, followed by gravel, sand, and water, everything fits.

The point is that you need to work on priorities first and everything else will fall into place. (Shortform note: for more information about setting priorities, read our summary of First Things First by Stephen R. Covey here.).

#### Establishing Priorities

Leaders should meet quarterly to review your vision and set priorities for the company and leadership team for the next 90 days. Here are the steps to follow:

**Step 1** : After reviewing the vision, list things that must be accomplished in the next 90 days to move toward your vision.

**Step 2** : Narrow the list to three to seven priorities.

**Step 3** : Set the due date for meeting each priority (usually it’s the last day of the quarter). Define each priority so that it’s specific, measurable, and doable. For example, a priority might be: “close three major sales.”

**Step 4** : Assign an “owner” from the leadership team to each priority. This person will be accountable for achieving it, by creating a timeline, assigning tasks, and ensuring people complete them.

**Step 5** : After the company priorities are set, each leadership team member should set their own priorities, including the company priority they “own.” Some items on the brainstorming list that were dropped in step 2 could become individual priorities.

**Step 6** : Put the company’s and leadership team’s priorities on a spreadsheet or one-page document and review it each week at the leadership team meeting.

**Step 7** : Share these priorities with the entire company at the quarterly company status meeting.

**Step 8** : Have each department establish up to three priorities. Further, each employee in the department should choose up to three individual priorities.

#### Tips for Establishing Priorities

  * Make sure you take enough time to set the right priorities—those that move you toward your vision rather than sidetracking you.
  * It takes two quarters to get the priority-setting process working effectively. Start with just the company and leadership setting priorities for the first two quarters, then have the rest of the company do it (so you learn from mistakes before fully rolling out the process).
  * Make sure you’re fully committed to the process; **don’t announce priorities to employees and then forget them or you’ll lose credibility**.



### 2) Meetings

**It’s a myth that meetings are a waste of time—meetings are where you practice accountability and get traction**.

But they need to be productive. By following a structured meeting schedule with purposeful agendas, you’ll find that everyone will get more done and continuously advance the company’s vision.

You should have two types of leadership meetings: quarterly and weekly.

#### The Quarterly Meeting

When you have annual, three-year, and 10-year goals, it’s human nature for people to start wandering off track in about 90 days. To counter this, you need to focus on interim goals every 90 days—or you’ll lose sight of your vision.

Your quarterly leadership meeting should be a full-day, off-site event with the following agenda:

  * **Opening** : Each team member should share the following: good news from the last 90 days, what’s working/not working, and expectations for the day.
  * **Review the previous quarter** : Review the financials, then review the company and leadership team priorities to confirm which ones were achieved (you won’t complete 100% every quarter; strive for 80% or better). If you missed hitting a priority, you can advance it to the next quarter, reassign it, or, if it’s close to completion, just put it on a to-do list and finish it.
  * **Review the vision** to ensure everyone has clarity so you can set the right 90-day goals. As part of this, update the issues list.
  * **Set the next quarter’s priorities** : Follow the steps for setting priorities described earlier in this chapter. List what must be done in the quarter and narrow the list to three to seven items.
  * **Tackle key issues** : Determine your top three issues and go through the IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve) process for each of the top three. Then begin moving down the list, solving as many issues as you can in the time available. Save the rest for your weekly leadership meeting.
  * **Next steps** : Clarify who is doing what, and whether there’s anything to communicate to the employees—for instance, any decisions made to solve problems.
  * **Conclude** : Each team member should share: feedback on the meeting, whether their expectations were met, their rating of the meeting from one to 10. (A successful meeting should get at least an eight.)



Repeat this meeting every quarter—don’t skip any quarters. Your quarterly meetings will become increasingly productive.

At the end of the year add a second day to your quarterly meeting for annual planning, following this agenda.

##### Annual Planning Agenda — Day One

  * **Opening** : Team members should share: the company’s three greatest accomplishments, the individual’s greatest personal accomplishments, and expectations for the meeting.
  * **Review the previous year:** Review the financials, the previous year’s goals, and the last quarter’s priorities (just note whether each was done or not done).
  * **Team building exercise** : “The One Thing”: Have the team give each member feedback on her greatest strength and weakness. Then have each team member choose one thing to do differently. 
  * **SWOT/issues list** : Discuss the company’s SWOTs (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats). From the discussion, create an issues list.
  * **Challenge the vision** : Take a critical look at your core values, core focus, marketing strategy, and 10-year target. Make sure everyone is still on board with it. Create a new three-year plan, then your one-year plan for next year (including revenue, profit, up to seven priorities, and budget).



##### Annual Planning Agenda — Day Two

  * Establish your priorities for the next quarter
  * Tackle issues 
  * Determine the next steps
  * Conclude



#### The Weekly Meeting

Once you’ve set your quarterly priorities, you and your leadership team need to meet weekly to stay focused, address issues, and communicate.

The weekly meeting is like a drumbeat that keeps your leadership team marching forward in step. In terms of productivity, this meeting should be a “10”—most people rate their meetings as a 4 or 5 on a scale of 1 to 10.

A level 10 meeting will keep your Scorecard numbers and priorities or “Rocks” on track, and give you an opportunity to troubleshoot and solve problems. The following agenda will ensure a productive meeting.

##### The Weekly Meeting Agenda

  * **Opening** : Spend five minutes sharing good news.
  * **Scorecard** : Review the numbers compared to goals— any misses should be moved to the issue solving (IDS) part of the agenda
  * **Review priorities** : Review the company’s and team members’ priorities to see which are on track; when a priority is off track, move it to the IDS agenda item.
  * **Customer and employee news** : Cite positives and move issues to the IDS agenda item.
  * **To-do list** : Review to-dos from last week’s meeting—these are action items that pop up throughout the week—for example, a commitment to ship an item immediately. Indicate whether items have been done/not done. No item should be on the to-do list for more than two weeks; the vast majority should drop off each week. The list creates traction and accountability.
  * **IDS** : Identify, discuss, and solve the issues on your issues list. There should be a few holdovers from last week, plus others added during the week, or a total of 10-15 issues. Go through them in order of priority. Once an issue has been solved, an action usually should be added to the to-do list. Next week, confirm it was carried out.
  * **Conclude** : Recap your to-do list and the assigned actions; determine whether anything from the meeting needs to be communicated to employees (what and how); have everyone rate the meeting on a scale of 1-10.



#### Tips

  * Have the weekly meeting at the same day and time each week, follow the same agenda, and start and end on time. Assign someone to run the meeting and someone to maintain the agenda.
  * Once the leadership team has the process down, apply the same format to weekly meetings in each department.
