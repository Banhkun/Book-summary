## Chapter 7: Documenting Processes

The fifth component of the EOS™ is process. **Your company has a few key processes that keep it running—together, they constitute your unique “way” of doing business**.

Many entrepreneurs neglect this component and allow their way of doing business to develop haphazardly; people do their jobs in whatever way they see fit. This creates inconsistencies and inefficiencies as well as never-ending headaches for you, as the owner.

In contrast, **honing your processes so they run without constant oversight frees you to focus on building your business rather than being mired in its details**. Also, when you have a defined way of doing business, you make your company more scalable and valuable in the event you decide to grow or sell it.

There are three steps to systematize your business:

  1. Identify your key processes.
  2. Document each process.
  3. Ensure that everyone follows the processes.



#### 1) Identify Key Processes

Your leadership team needs to identify the processes for carrying out every major activity of your business. List the processes on a single sheet of paper and agree on what you will call each one, so there won’t be confusion over what anyone is talking about.

Most businesses have processes to handle the following:

  * Human relations
  * Marketing
  * Sales
  * Operations: This breaks down into subprocesses—for instance, warehouse, distribution, customer service, and production.
  * Accounting
  * Customer service and retention



#### 2) Document Each Process

The person accountable for each process should document it. Don’t list every detail, just the most important steps, with a few bullet points for procedures under each. Follow the 80/20 rule: document the 20% of the process that produces 80% of the results.

Here’s an example of documenting an HR process. (Each step should have bullet points, but in this example, bullet points are included only for the first step.)

**The HR process**

  * Step 1: Search
    * Create job description
    * Determine search method
    * Conduct search
  * Step 2: Interviewing
  * Step 3: Hiring
  * Step 4: Orientation
  * Step 5: Performance reviews
  * Step 6: Termination
  * Step 7: Ongoing benefits management



The documentation for each process should be up to 10 pages. Your goal is to keep your processes simple. As you document steps, you may find redundant or unnecessary steps that you can eliminate. For some processes, a checklist may suffice.

While codifying your processes, you may find areas where new software can increase efficiency. But do your research so you get the right technology and don’t waste your money on bells and whistles you don’t need.

#### 3) Ensure Everyone Follows the Processes

Compile all of your documentation into a manual, whether printed or digital. Each process should be a chapter. The title should be “The (your company name) Way.” Train employees in the processes you need them to use.

As the company’s leader, make clear your expectation that everyone, including your leadership team, will follow the processes. Also, show how the new system coordinates everything to make individual jobs easier and the company more successful.

It may help to create a visual of your “way” that illustrates how all of the processes work together.

The benefits of having documented processes include:

  * When everyone follows the same processes, it’s easier for managers to identify and solve problems. Many problems stem from a process breakdown—for example, a customer isn’t billed because a service rep didn’t forward the order to the finance department. You can track the problem to the step that failed and fix it.
  * It positions you to grow the business: with effective processes, you can easily scale up, or increase customers, revenue, and employees.
