## Exercise: What’s Your Vision?

Your business should be guided by a vision, which is based on: your core values; a core focus or purpose; a marketing plan; 10-year, three-year, and one-year goals; and 90-day priorities.

* * *

What are your three core values (think of the values demonstrated by your three “star” employees—some of those are likely your core values).

What is your company’s core focus—what does it do better than anyone else? What functions are you performing that you should consider getting rid of because they distract from your core focus?

What’s your long-term goal—what do you want your company to look like in 10 years (for instance, in terms of revenue, profit, and market share)?

What’s your three-year goal—where should your company be in three years to be on track for your 10-year target?

The key component of a successful marketing strategy (another part of your vision) is knowing your company’s differentiators (three strengths that set your company apart from competitors). What are your differentiators?
