## Exercise: Make Meetings Productive

Meetings are an opportunity to get traction and hold people accountable. But to be productive, they follow a schedule and have a consistent purpose and agenda.

* * *

What meetings do your senior leaders and department heads hold weekly and monthly? How do you feel after a typical meeting (for instance, energized, exhausted, clear on direction)?

On a productivity scale of 1-10, how would you rate most of your meetings? Why did you rate them as you did?

How could you make your company’s regular meetings more productive? Create an agenda for your next meeting using the suggested “weekly meeting agenda” as a model.
