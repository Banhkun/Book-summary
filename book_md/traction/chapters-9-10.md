## Chapters 9-10: Implementing the EOS™

The combination of vision, people, data, issues, process, and traction—the Entrepreneurial Operating System—positions your company to achieve your vision.

This book presented one component at a time in order to make the EOS™ model easy to understand and learn, but that isn't the most effective way to implement it in a business. Based on the author’s experience with hundreds of companies, the following sequence is recommended.

### Implementation Sequence

Implement these seven tools with your leadership team first, in order, before sharing them with other managers and employees.

**1)** **Accountability Chart** (along with the People Analyzer and GWC): Create your Accountability Chart first because it goes to the root of most issues. Determine the right structure, then put the right people in the right positions. With this tool in place, the other tools are more effective.

**2) Priorities** : Once you know who is accountable for what, you’ll set better priorities.

**3)** **Meeting schedule** (including the IDS process, and quarterly and annual meetings): Implement the weekly meeting first. This requires you to choose what’s most important every week and start solving the key problems, using the IDS tool, to gain immediate traction. Start your quarterly and annual meetings based on where you are in your calendar year.

**4) Scorecard** : This takes one to three months to develop and further creates accountability, ownership, and results.

**5)** **Vision statement** (including core values, core focus, 10-year goal, marketing strategy, three-year goal, and one-year goal): The first four tools above create a foundation on which to build your vision rather than pie in the sky. After you’ve established accountability and traction, creating a vision is easier and the result will be more meaningful. Anyway, most organizations have a fair idea of where they’re going already.

**6) Core processes** : After the foundational tools are fully implemented, the next step is to document and train people in your core processes using the three steps.

**7) Everyone has a number** : This is last because without the main tools in place, it’s less effective due to lack of accountability and strong management. However, with the foundation in place, adding a number for everyone increases results.

Once you and your leadership team have mastered the tools, roll them out to the rest of the company, one level at a time. Start with the middle managers who report to the leadership team and present these tools:

  * The vision statement (including core values, focus, marketing strategy, and 10-year target)
  * Accountability Chart
  * Priorities or “Rocks”
  * The structured meeting schedule
  * The Scorecard



If you have multiple locations, site managers need to be fully on board with the foundational tools before sharing them with the next tier at that location.

#### Roll-Out Tips

  * Be patient, it will take time for the system to “click” with a majority of employees.
  * Once you start to gain traction, at some point you’ll hit the ceiling again. Stick with the tools and five leadership abilities, hone them and press on.
  * Decide how big your company should get, rather than aiming for growth for growth’s sake
  * Meet once a month to ensure partners are still on the same page with where the company is going.
  * Do an organization checkup twice a year to see where you are in implementing the EOS™. The goal is to continually make progress. When you find gaps between where you are and want to go, add them to your issues list for solving; some may become quarterly priorities.
