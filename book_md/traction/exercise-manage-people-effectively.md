## Exercise: Manage People Effectively

To operate effectively, your business needs a structure that clearly defines functions and roles and establishes lines of accountability. Then people must be put in positions that match their capabilities.

* * *

In your organization, what function or functions are you performing (integrator, visionary, or both)? Are you performing any roles better suited to a department head?

What are the key roles of each department head in your company (for example, customer retention or quality control)? How can you clarify any roles that are overlapping or confusing?

Who is your most difficult employee? Assess the employee using the GCW test (do they “get” their job, want it, and have the capability to do it well)? What should the next step be if they fail to meet one of the criteria?
