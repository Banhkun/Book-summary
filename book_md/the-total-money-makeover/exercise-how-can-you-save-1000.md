## Exercise: How Can You Save $1,000?

Everyone needs a rainy day fund because financial emergencies will come up, and if you borrow to cover them, you’ll only create worse problems for yourself. You should immediately create a $1,000 emergency fund.

* * *

What can you do to save $1,000 (for example, hold a yard sale, stop eating out, carpool to save gas money, work extra hours)?

Where will you put the money so it’s accessible when you need it, but not so accessible that you’ll spend it in a non-emergency?

What will be the biggest temptation to spend it for non-emergency purchases? How will you resist this?
