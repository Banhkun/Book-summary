## Chapter 3: Obstacle #2—Myths About Debt

**The second obstacle to gaining control of your finances is the widespread belief that debt is useful and normal** —that everyone has it. In addition to this belief, there are a variety of related myths that encourage different types of borrowing.

You must reject these views of debt before you can get control of your finances. Society encourages us to take on debt starting as young adults and to carry debts throughout our lives. There are several reasons:

  * **Our culture promotes instant gratification.** Although it’s human nature to want things right away, mature people delay short-term satisfaction for a bigger payoff later. But society encourages immaturity by urging you to get what you want now, before you can afford it, by borrowing.
  * **Financial institutions, stores, and other lenders promote borrowing to get what you want because they benefit when people owe them money.**
  * **Debt has become so ingrained in our thinking that most people believe debt is normal** and can’t imagine living without it. We don’t know how to get a car, buy a home, or go to college without debt. Most can’t imagine living without a credit card. (Americans have about $900 billion in credit card debt.)



So debt is widely viewed as the way to do things. We’ve bought into it to such an extent that we get defensive if we hear anything negative about debt. But the borrower is the slave to the lender. **Your income is your primary means of building wealth, and when it’s tied up in debt payments, banks gain and you lose**. If you invested your income, you could build wealth and security. How much discretionary money would you have each month without debt payments?

Here are some of the biggest myths about debt that you must give up:

### Myth #1: Debt Is Useful

**The biggest myth about debt is that it’s a tool or leverage you can use to build wealth** —for instance, to get a car, home, or start a business that will be a foundation for building your wealth, that is, an investment in your future. It’s smart to use other people’s money, we’re told.

However, debt doesn’t usually make you more prosperous. It creates risk that, over time, builds and erases any initial advantage.

**If you want to be wealthy, you should do what wealthy people do instead of believing myths pushed by lenders**. Three-quarters of the Forbes 400 wealthiest people in America told pollsters that the best way to build wealth is to stay out of debt. Millionaires live below their means and pay cash.

Three of the biggest lenders at the time this book was written—Sears, JCPenney, and Ford—were founded by people who actually opposed debt. For example, Henry Ford thought debt was a lazy way to get things; his view was so strongly held that his company didn’t offer financing until a decade after GM did. Today, credit is one of Ford’s (and any car company’s) biggest profit generators.

### Myth #2: You’re Just “Helping Out”

**Many people think they’re helping friends or relatives by loaning them money.** But a loan will be a barrier in your relationship because it creates a power dynamic where the borrower is the slave of the lender.

If you’re the borrower, the loan can create resentment or shame if you can’t pay it back. If you’re the lender, you’ll be judgmental about how the borrower spends her money as long as she owes you (you wonder why she’s going out to dinner or taking a vacation instead of using the money to pay you back). This applies to parents loaning adult children a down payment, or grandparents loaning a grandchild money.

If you value the relationship more than the money, the best recourse is to remove the master/slave dynamic by telling the borrower that you forgive the loan. But if you do this, make two stipulations: that the borrower pay it forward by helping someone else someday, and that she never loan money to friends or relatives.

In the future, give money to friends if you want to, but remember that a loan will bring more harm than help.

#### Cosigning a Loan

Like loaning money, people often have the impulse to help a family member or friend by cosigning a loan. But there are two big problems with this:

**1) If you cosign a loan, there's a good chance you’ll have to repay it.**

**2) You could end up ruining your own credit.**

Regarding your risk of having to pay it back, consider these facts:

  * Banks _want_ to make loans.
  * They’re good at predicting when someone is likely to default.
  * Despite wanting to make loans, they’ve refused your friend or relative a loan.
  * They only require cosigners when there's a strong possibility of default.



In other words, the bank doesn’t expect your friend or relative to repay the loan—you’re ignoring the bank’s experience-based assessment, maybe because you feel you know the person better and are convinced he’ll pay. But if he needs a cosigner, he can’t afford the payments.

Parents often cosign loans for their children, thinking that they’re teaching financial responsibility—instead, they’re teaching irresponsibility. The message is that it's OK to buy things you can’t afford.

**Besides having to pay back the loan, the cosigner often ends up with ruined credit.** For example, when you cosign a car loan, here’s what can happen:

  * If payments are missed or late, your credit record will be hit each time without notice.
  * If the car is repossessed, it will go on your credit record without notice.
  * If the lender sells the car for less than the amount of the loan, you’ll be on the hook for the difference.



Even if you learn that payments aren’t being made, you can’t force the defaulter to sell the car—it’s not yours, although you have to pay for it.

**If you really want to help someone, don’t cosign a loan—it’s too risky. Just give them money.**

### Myth #3: Quick Fixes Work

**Payday loans, rent-to-own deals, and “tote the note” car lots are examples of predatory lending schemes** intended to exploit low-income people who are looking for a quick fix or instant gratification.

These operations are always located in a poor section of town, because low-income people are the ones most vulnerable to being ripped off this way (wealthy people won’t bite). If you’re poor and you sign on to one of these “deals,” you’ll remain poor. Here’s how the most common scams work:

**1) Payday loans:** This is legal loan sharking. For example, you write a postdated check for $225 (dated for payday). The lender gives you $200 in cash and keeps a $25 service fee (this fee equates to 650% interest annually).

When people can’t pay back their loan, they borrow money to do it from another lender and soon get snared in a web of loans with lenders threatening to sue them for writing bad checks. The only way out is to stop paying and meet with each lender to develop a payment plan, then figure out how to pay the loans.

**2) ‘Tote the Note’ Car Loans:** Tote the Note dealers offer their own in-house financing for people with bad credit. They take a downpayment close to the amount they paid for the car, then charge 18% to 38% interest on a loan for the rest. If the payments aren’t made, they’ll repossess the car and sell it again.

**3) Rent-to-own:** If you succumb to instant gratification by agreeing to rent-to-own something, you’ll pay a high price: average interest rates exceed 1,800%. It works this way: to get something they can’t afford, people rent items at a weekly rate, which seems affordable. Over time, however, they pay far more than the items typically sell for. For instance, they might pay $20 a week for a washer and dryer over 90 weeks, or $1,800, when you could buy new (low-end) appliances for $500 or used ones for even less.

**4) Ninety days same as cash:** Many people believe that signing a “90 days same as cash” deal, where you don’t pay interest for that period, means you’re using other people’s money for free. These deals are popular for furniture, appliances, and electronics. The problem is that most people (over 80%) don’t pay off the purchase in 90 days (or in 30 or 60, if that’s the deal). When that happens, the deal becomes a loan with interest rates of 24% to 38%. In addition, the interest is charged back to the purchase date. Even if you make the payments as scheduled or pay it off early, you may still be charged interest if fraudulent fees were added.

### Myth #4: Car Payments and Leasing Are Unavoidable

Many people believe car payments are simply part of life, that you’ll always be paying on a car. But this is a myth—car payments are both foolish and avoidable.

**Purchasing a new car with loan payments eliminates your ability to build wealth.** Car payments are most people's biggest monthly outlay except for a mortgage, so they diminish or steal more from your income than any other expense.

**Over a lifetime of car payments, you’ll literally spend a fortune.** Most people start paying on a car, then continue car payments on successive cars throughout their lives.

Car payments are worse than a rent-to-own deal. Consider an average monthly payment of $495 over 64 months:

  * If, from age 25 to 65, you invested that amount monthly in a mutual fund with an average 12% return, you’d have $5,881,799.
  * If you just saved $495 a month for 10 months, you’d have $5,000 cash for a used car. If you continued saving and trading up, in less than three years, you could get a $15,000 car—with no payments.



You’re far better off driving older cars and saving your money than making payments forever on new cars. Contrary to what most people think, millionaires typically buy two- or three-year-old vehicles.

#### Leasing a Car

Some people think leasing a car is a good idea because you can lease things that depreciate and take the tax advantage. However, spending unnecessarily to get a tax write-off makes little sense.

Leases seem appealing because you make a smaller down payment and pay less per month. However, **leasing—in effect, renting-to-own—is the most costly way to get a car.** Here’s how car leases work:

  * Your monthly payment covers the loss in the car’s value during the lease, as well as making the dealer a profit (the interest you pay). The average interest rate is around 14%.
  * In addition, you pay a per-mile charge if you exceed the allotted miles, plus penalties for “excessive wear and tear.” You pay through the nose just to return the car—or the dealer will try to roll the penalties into a new lease.



#### Zero Interest

A zero-interest loan on a new car seems like a good deal, but it’s undercut by the fact that a new car loses 60% of its value in four years. You’re losing so much in value, especially compared to buying a used car, that you’re still being ripped off.

For example, a new $28,000 car will lose nearly $100 a week or $17,000 in value in four years—think of it as throwing a hundred-dollar bill out the window each week while driving. Instead, you can get a reliable, late model car that’s already done most of its depreciating.

A _Smart Money_ magazine article explained why car dealers push these kinds of deals:

  * The average dealer profit on a new car bought with cash: $82
  * The average dealer profit when you finance a new car through the dealer: $775
  * The average dealer profit when they lease you a new car: $1,300



**Dealers make their money financing and repairing vehicles, not selling them.**

### Myth #5: Credit Cards Are Necessary

People are often advised, particularly when they’re young, to get a credit card to build their credit. That’s equivalent to saying you need to start incurring debt so you can make it a way of life.

Banks, mortgage lenders, retail stores, and car dealers push this myth because it benefits them.

But **you only need to build credit by borrowing and making loan payments if you want to spend your life making loan payments.**

Many people are proud of having a high FICO or credit score, which reflects how you’ve handled debt, including your debt payment history, debt amounts, length, and so on. However, another way of looking at a FICO score is as an indication of how much you love debt.

In a Total Money Makeover, you won’t use credit, except possibly to pay a mortgage.

Many mortgage lenders do rely exclusively on your FICO score out of laziness. But as of this writing, you could get a mortgage without a FICO score (no credit history), based on other measures, if you looked hard enough.

For a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage, instead of a FICO score, you need:

  * A mortgage company that does underwriting
  * A record of paying your rent early or on time for two years
  * An uninterrupted record of on-time bill paying
  * Two years in the same career field
  * A down payment
  * No previous credit
  * A loan amount commensurate with your income: monthly payments should be no more than a quarter of your take-home pay



#### Credit Versus Debit Cards

Another credit card myth is that you need a credit card to rent a car, make a hotel reservation, or shop online. But you can almost always do these things with a debit card associated with your checking account. Check with car rental companies in advance—most take debit cards, but a few don’t.

Of course, before you can buy anything with a debit card, you have to have the money in your account. But buying only what you can afford and not going into debt are central to the Total Money Makeover. A debit card does virtually everything a credit card does—except get you into debt.

Another myth is that a debit card is riskier to use than a credit card—this has almost become an urban legend. However, Visa requires that banks issuing Visa debit cards provide the same protections against theft or fraud as they do for credit cards. To get it, be sure to run the card as a credit transaction (not using your PIN).

#### Paying Off Your Card Monthly

Another credit card myth is that paying your bill in full every month gives you free use of other people’s money.

But while they may intend to, **60% of people don’t pay their full credit card bills each month.** Thus, if companies can get you to accept and use a card (by giving prizes and points), they stand a good chance of making money on you. And offering rewards doesn’t cost them much because people often don’t claim them—for example, 90% of airline miles go unclaimed, according to MSNBC.com.

**People also spend more when using credit cards than when paying with cash** —for example, a study found that people spent 47% more at McDonald’s when using credit than with cash.

But credit card use leads to debt and worse. **An American Bankruptcy Institute study found that 69% of people who filed for bankruptcy cited credit card debt as the reason.**

Millionaires pay cash; less-smart people use credit cards.

#### Credit Cards for Teens

Parents often encourage teenagers to get a credit card, supposedly to learn financial responsibility. But getting **a credit card teaches teens to buy what they can’t afford and incur debt, which is financially irresponsible and launches a lifetime of debt.**

Young people, as potential life-long interest payers, are key targets for credit card companies, which portray getting a credit card as a rite of passage. It’s important for lenders to snag them early in life, because people tend to stick with the first bank that issues them a credit card. The marketing works: a majority of college seniors have credit card debt well before starting a career.

Credit card companies even work to build brand awareness among children by advertising through toys in hopes of influencing their choices later. For example, several Barbie dolls and accessories come with brand name toy credit cards.

Parents who encourage teens to get credit cards are endorsing something harmful. Instead, they should teach teens to say no to compulsive spending and debt.

### Myth #6: Debt Consolidation Solves Your Problems

When people’s debts become overwhelming, they may turn to services that will consolidate their debts.

Debt consolidation is appealing because it can lower interest on some of the debt, and you have a single smaller payment. But there are several problems:

  * You still have the debt—you just rearranged it.
  * While your payment may be lower, you’ll be paying over a longer period.
  * While you feel as though you’ve addressed the problem, you’ve only treated the symptom. You have to change your habits of overspending and buying on credit. One debt consolidation firm estimated that after someone consolidates their credit card debt, it grows back more than 75% of the time because they haven’t changed their behavior.



Your Total Money Makeover requires changing your view of debt, and getting and staying out of debt.
