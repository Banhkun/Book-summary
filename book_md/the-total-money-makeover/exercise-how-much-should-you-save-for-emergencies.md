## Exercise: How Much Should You Save for Emergencies?

You should have an emergency fund large enough to cover three to six months of expenses, enabling you to manage for up to half a year without an income. Depending on your circumstances, your emergency fund should be between $5,000 and $25,000.

* * *

Based on your personal circumstances, how much do you need to save for an emergency fund? (Consider factors such as your income, whether or not your income is stable, and whether or not your job is at risk.)

Where will you keep your emergency fund (it should be readily accessible)?

What is your biggest obstacle to saving this amount of money? How can you overcome it?
