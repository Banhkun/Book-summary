## Chapter 13: Live Differently From Everyone Else

If you follow the Total Money Makeover, you’ll become wealthy within a few decades. While it’s an enormous relief to be out of debt and financially secure, be aware that having wealth can get you into trouble in several ways.

**1) You may become overly entranced with it.** Money and the stuff it buys won’t bring you happiness. A person obsessed with money is just as enslaved as a person deeply in debt.

**2) Wealth will reveal and magnify your true character.** If you’re a jerk, money will make you an even bigger jerk. If you’re kind and generous, you’ll be even more so with your wealth. If you feel guilty about having money, your guilt will grow.

It takes spiritual maturity and character to understand that while wealth is fun, it brings responsibility—whether it ruins your life or helps you do good is up to you.

While money isn’t the answer to the meaning of life, it isn’t evil either, as many religious people erroneously believe. This belief is used to justify living a financially unhealthy or mediocre life.

It’s wrong to love and trust money to provide things it can’t provide: happiness, satisfying relationships, and spiritual or emotional well-being. But it’s also wrong to reject money and the good it can do. Further, this thinking would leave all the world’s wealth to evil people.

**As a good person, it's your duty to build wealth and do good with it in order to keep it from bad people** —for instance, drug dealers and pornographers—who would otherwise use it for evil purposes.

### A Life Makeover

By now, you can see that **the Total Money Makeover is about more than money; it makes you face up to who you are in the mirror.** Because personal finance is 80% behavior and 20% knowledge, you’ll either remake your life—or continue to be miserable.

Based on the experience of tens of thousands of people who followed the steps in this book, you should have hope that you can overcome money problems and live free of debt, break the cycle of debt in your family by not passing on debt to your children, have a secure retirement, and give to others.

It starts with applying common-sense principles. Anyone can do it, however financially dire their circumstances—even you.
