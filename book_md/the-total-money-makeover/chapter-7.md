## Chapter 7: Step #2—The Debt Snowball

**The big problem with debt is that it ties up your income with making payments, which keeps you from building wealth**. You need to get rid of debt so you have control of your income and can put it to work for you.

It’s fairly easy to accumulate wealth when you don’t have car payments, a mortgage, and credit card or medical debt. To see how this works, consider the average person with a $50,000 annual income and the following payments:

  * $850 house payment
  * $180 car payment
  * $165 student loan payment
  * $185 credit card debt payment
  * $120 other payments



Total: $1,995

But if you invested $1,995 a month in a growth-stock mutual fund, you’d be a millionaire in 15 years; it would grow to $2 million in five more years, to $3 million in three more years, $4 million in two and a half more, and to $5.5 million in two more years—a total of 28 years.

The key is to get out of debt so you can start investing. This is probably the toughest of the money makeover steps—it requires the most effort and sacrifice, plus your relentless, single-minded focus.

### The Debt Snowball Process

The debt snowball method is the way to pay off debt. It’s easy to understand, but it takes effort and commitment to pull it off. Tens of thousands of Total Money Makeover converts have proven it works. There are two steps:

1) **Make a list of your debts, in order from the one with the smallest balance to largest**. Exclude only your mortgage, which will be addressed in another step, described in Chapter 11. A form is available for downloading here.

2) Each month, **apply every extra dollar you have to the smallest debt until it’s paid off.** Make the minimum payment to stay current on all other debts.

After the smallest debt is paid, apply the payment you had been making on it, plus any additional money you have, toward paying off the next smallest debt. When the second debt is paid off, apply the payment amounts from the first two debts, plus any other money you can find, to the third debt on your list, and so on.

Each time you pay off a debt, you increase the amount you can pay on the next one—your payments continue to snowball until your debts are paid off.

Starting with the smallest debts gives you some quick wins to motivate you, and by the time you get to the largest payments, such as car payments and student loans, you’re in a position to pay over $1,000 a month. You’ll soon be debt-free except for your mortgage.

### Success Stories

Eliminating debt totaling tens of thousands of dollars is daunting, but with concerted effort, it can be done. Here are a few examples from people who applied the Total Money Makeover process:

  * Steve and Amanda, a couple in their early 30s, used the debt snowball over 35 months to eliminate a six-figure debt, including $60,000 in student loan debt, $35,000 in credit card debt, plus loans on two new cars and a mortgage. Steps included selling a vehicle, drastically cutting spending, and taking on extra work shifts.
  * Josh and Amy, a couple in their 20s with two kids, amassed $169,000 in debt due to overspending that included a BMW, rental property, and an expensive vacation. To eliminate their debt, they sold property including the BMW, had a huge garage sale, and cut their monthly spending to just $1,700.
  * Jeff and Teresa, a couple in their 40s, paid off $30,000 in credit card debt in three months using the debt snowball method. They had gotten into trouble because they habitually used credit cards for everything, including gas, food, clothing, and vacation rentals. Going forward, they eliminated their credit cards, downsized their lifestyle, and created a monthly budget.



### Tips for Success

In summary, to make a debt snowball work, you need to create a monthly budget, be current on your loan payments before starting the process, and list your debts from smallest to largest. You need to make two mindset adjustments as well:

**1) Focus intensely on becoming debt-free:** If you’re half-hearted, the debt snowball won’t work. Tell yourself, “I’m getting out of debt, no matter what.” Fully focusing your mind on a goal is as powerful as focusing the sun’s rays with a magnifying glass and setting a piece of paper on fire.

Develop gazelle-like intensity: a gazelle keeps an intense eye on its surroundings to avoid being taken down by a cheetah. Similarly, **your focused attention (or gazelle intensity) on your finances will save you from debt**.

**2) Stop using credit:** While you're working through your debt list, remember that your goal is to eliminate all debt—don’t replace any paid off debts with new debt. **Make a pledge that you’ll never borrow money again**. Before long, you’ll face a test of your gazelle intensity level—you’ll need a major car repair or get the urge to make a big purchase using credit. **To eliminate temptation, cut up your credit cards. You can’t get out of your debt hole by digging it deeper.**

### Questions and Answers

**1)** **What if you’re in such dire financial straits that you can’t come up with any extra money to apply to your smallest debt and start the debt snowball rolling?**

You’ll need to take drastic action. Sell whatever possessions you can get money for: a motorcycle, antiques, collections, baseball cards, or an extra car not used for daily work. If you’re selling a car, choose the one with the most debt. If you have more than a year and a half to pay on a car, sell it. After your Total Money Makeover, you’ll be able to pay cash for the car you want.

Remember your goal is to sacrifice—live differently from everyone else—now, so you can live the way you want to later.

There’s one other way to get a debt snowball rolling: increase your income by working extra hours at your job or taking on an additional job temporarily.

**2)** **While working on a debt snowball, should you stop contributing to a 401(k), even if you get a company match?**

Continuing your contributions, especially to get the company match, might seem like a good idea, but focused intensity on eliminating your debts is more important at the moment. If you are radically focused, you’ll become debt-free and can resume your contributions in a few months. In addition, without your debt payments, you can contribute more to your 401(k).

Keep making your contributions only if you’re in an extremely deep hole that will take you longer than 18 months to get out of.

**3) If you need to draw on your emergency fund, should you stop your debt snowball to rebuild your fund?**

Yes, you should go back to making minimum payments to stay current on all your debts, and focus on rebuilding your emergency fund to $1,000. If you don’t, you won’t be ready for the next emergency and will be tempted to use credit. When you’re finished rebuilding the fund, you can start your debt snowball again.

**4) Should you include a home equity loan in a debt snowball?**

If your home equity loan exceeds half your annual income, don’t include it in a debt snowball.

For example, if you make $40,000 a year and have a $15,000 home equity loan, include it in your debt snowball and pay it off. But if your second mortgage is $35,000 compared to a $40,000 income, you’ll need to handle this in another money makeover step.

If you have small-business debt, it’s probably personally guaranteed, meaning it’s personal debt, whether it's a small-business loan or credit card debt incurred for the business. Include it in your debt snowball.

If you have loans on rental property, exclude them from your debt snowball, but stop buying property. After you pay your home mortgage in step 6, use the debt snowball process to pay off your rental mortgages from smallest to largest; also consider selling some to pay off other debt.

The debt snowball may be the most important step in your Total Money Makeover because:

  * It frees up your income so you can build wealth.
  * It signifies that you’re rejecting the consumer culture of buying what you can’t afford.
  * It indicates you’ve had a change of heart about money that sets you up for success in your Total Money Makeover.
