## Chapter 2: Obstacle #1—Denial

Total Money Makeover success first requires understanding the five obstacles that could hinder you: denial, debt myths, money myths, lack of financial knowledge, and desire for approval. These hurdles stem in large part from what you’ve been taught by society about money. The next few chapters examine each of these obstacles.

The first obstacle is denial. Achieving financial fitness is somewhat like trying to lose weight and improve physical fitness. While this requires intense focus on your goal of resetting your eating or spending habits, you’ll have a tendency initially to downplay just how out of shape you are.

**Most people are in denial about the state of their finances**. You might tell yourself that maybe things aren’t so bad—maybe you’re no worse off than the average person. The unfortunate truth is that most people have financial problems—that counts as average in today’s society, the way being overweight has become average.

You get a lot of social reinforcement for bad financial practices. Financial institutions and retail stores want to give you credit cards or increase your credit limit, so you take it as a sign you’re doing all right financially. Banks are willing to loan you money for the bigger house or new car you want. If you can afford the payments on something, you feel you can afford to buy it.

But this thinking keeps you in average financial shape (moderately in debt) at best. The Total Money Makeover program is about being better than average: it’s about becoming debt-free.

There are two ways to break out of denial: you can wait for a crisis or you can proactively choose change.

**1) Wait for a crisis:** While you can’t argue with the scale when you’re trying to lose weight, you can fake financial health for a while (others will tell you you look great), but eventually your habits catch up with you. A wake-up call can be losing your job or business or suffering a major unexpected expense or health problem. Or, problems or debts may accumulate gradually until they reach a critical mass. Suddenly you can’t pay your debts or meet living expenses, and you can no longer deny that you’ve been skating on thin ice.

Sara and John got such a wake-up call. They felt financially secure with two incomes totaling $75,000 and “typical” debts of student loans, a car loan, and $5,000 owed on credit cards. So they built a new home, but shortly after they moved in, Sara was laid off. Upon losing half their income, they couldn’t deny their financial state and were forced to change their spending habits.

**2) Choose to change:** The alternative to waiting for a crisis is to look in the mirror, acknowledge your reality, and choose to change. Hopefully, this book will motivate you to want better-than-average financial health and to meet the makeover challenge.
