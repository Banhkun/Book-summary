## Exercise: Create a Buying Atmosphere

Helping the buyer convince herself to buy requires asking specific questions that uncover her frustrations, concerns, and needs so you can show how your product will make her life easier—and she’ll conclude that she needs it.

* * *

What are some of the typical questions you ask a potential buyer? Write them down.

How closely do your questions resemble these typical (and ineffective) questions: “How much are you currently paying?” “Are you satisfied with your service?” “What would it take for you to switch suppliers?”

For your next sales call, write down a list of questions you can ask to uncover customer needs and problems that your product can solve. (For example, write questions starting with: What do you look for in choosing a…? How do you determine…? What’s been your experience with…? What would you change…? What’s your biggest hurdle to…? What frustrates you the most about…?)
