## Exercise: Eliminate Your Buyer’s Risk

A risk is anything that makes a customer hesitate to buy. Common risks are: Am I making a mistake and not getting my money’s worth? Will I look bad or get into trouble for making a poor decision? Can I get it cheaper elsewhere, or get something better? Will it work? What if it doesn’t?

* * *

Think about an upcoming sales call. What are the customer’s top three potential risks?

What questions can you ask to get the customer to talk about these risks?

For each top risk, write a short script detailing what you could say to counter or eliminate the risk (for instance, stressing your money-back guarantee).
