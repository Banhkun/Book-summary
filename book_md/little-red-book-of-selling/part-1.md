## Part 1: Practice Success Habits | Principles 1-3

The first three principles of selling involve adopting habits that create success: Motivate yourself, mind your own business, and be alert to opportunities.

### Principle #1: Motivate Yourself

You can’t sell if you don’t constantly push yourself—no one will do this for you because no one else is as invested as you are in whether you succeed. Here are some signs you lack motivation and need to push yourself:

  * You’re in a sales slump and feel that you can’t do anything to get out of it—so you don’t act. 
  * People aren’t calling you back; blaming them for your lack of sales is an excuse to do nothing. 
  * You complain that your company isn’t providing you with training, so you can’t improve. 



In each case, you feel helpless and unmotivated to change your circumstances.

These are all common complaints and behaviors among salespeople—but **_you_ (not your circumstances) are the key to your success:**

  * Instead of complaining that prospects won’t return your calls, learn to leave effective voicemail messages that prompt return calls. 
  * Instead of using the excuse that you’re in a “sales slump,” work harder, make a new sales plan, get a mentor’s or colleague’s assessment of your approach, listen to positive tapes and use positive self-talk, and focus on sales fundamentals.
  * Instead of bemoaning a lack of company training, train yourself: Spend your spare time reading books on selling, presentation skills, positivity, and creativity. 



It’s your duty to set high goals for yourself (beyond your company’s sales quotas) and motivate yourself so that you achieve them. **You should hit your monthly quotas in the first two weeks and pull in new revenue in the last two weeks** , so that your colleagues and bosses are impressed and ask you how you do it. In other words, work your butt off.

#### Motivation Tips

In addition to working hard, do these things to stay motivated:

  * **Mind your attitude:** If you’re having a bad day, it means you’ve let other people or circumstances create a negative attitude. Your attitude affects your actions, which in turn determine your results. So make sure you have a positive attitude that inspires positive actions and expectations even when you first get a “no.” For example, think of a “no” in positive terms—you’ve learned something about the customer that you can apply in your next pitch to him. 
  * **Celebrate effort:** Salespeople like to celebrate when they win big accounts or sign deals. But you should also celebrate the groundwork, such as researching the prospect’s business, that goes into sales. Ongoing hard work is more important than any single win because it creates long-term success.
  * **Take action: You already know what to do and therefore can feel confident in doing it.** Many rules and fundamentals of sales are common sense—for example, doing your homework on the prospect’s business rather than asking her irritating and time-wasting questions such as, “Tell me about your business.” Do what you already know you should do, and learn the things you still need to know.
  * **Don't use lack of time as an excuse:** Saying that you lack time to do something is an indication that you’re avoiding it. Figure out the reason why—for instance, fear of rejection, lack of sales skills, poor self-image, lack of preparation, and so on. Address your real problem, then do what you “lacked time” to do.



### Principle #2: Mind Your Own Business

The second selling principle, minding your own business, is essential to successfully implementing the other selling principles**.**

It’s easy to get caught up in others’ drama at work, whether it involves bosses, colleagues, customers, or vendors. Everyone does it—you’re probably distracted by someone’s issues right now. But besides wasting your finite time, by getting involved, you risk:

  * Perpetuating a pity party or negative attitudes
  * Giving bad advice
  * Making others angry at you by taking sides or saying the wrong thing



When people come to you for personal advice, remember that you’re not a psychologist or marriage counselor; instead of wasting time trying to solve their issues, tell them to get professional help. The only career or job advice you should give anyone is to do something they enjoy and believe in, and give it their all.

Instead of advising, **convert the time you used to spend on others’ problems to focusing on self-development and your career.** It’s one of the best ways of reclaiming time that’s going to waste and using it to achieve at a higher level.

### Principle #3: Be Alert to Opportunities

Avoiding other people’s dramas and focusing on self-development doesn’t mean being oblivious to _everything_ going on around you. The third selling principle—being alert to sales opportunities—requires paying attention to your surroundings and to potential customers and networking contacts around you. In fact, paying attention in _this_ way is part of a salesperson’s job.

People often focus inwardly—for example, on how they look, what others are thinking about them, something they’re worried about, or something they need to do later. But when you’re focused inwardly, the world and its opportunities are out of focus to you.

For instance, conferences and events are obvious opportunities to network. But even then, few people are fully alert to the possibilities for meeting key people. Instead of keeping a lookout for and ensuring they meet key players, many attendees focus on drinking, spending time with friends, looking for food, and so on.

Instead of focusing inwardly, imagine yourself wearing antennas that constantly scan your surroundings for opportunity. **In every situation, activate your antennas—useful new contacts or sales leads can pop up while you’re waiting in airports, restaurants, lobbies, and elevators, or while you're attending a child’s school event.**

For example, the author met actor Hal Linden in the men’s room at La Guardia Airport. He made a joke that made Linden laugh and the two then caught a cab together into the city. While the author didn’t win any business from Linden, Linden did pay for the cab. The point of this example is to be ready to seize the opportunity wherever you are.
