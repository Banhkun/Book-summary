## Exercise: Practice Success Habits

The first three principles of selling involve developing success habits. They are: Motivate yourself, mind your own business (don’t get caught up in others’ drama), and be alert to potential sales and networking opportunities everywhere.

* * *

Of the first three principles of selling, which one do you struggle with or neglect the most, and why? For instance, do you have a tendency to complain about customers not returning your calls, or do you often feel you’re in a slump (indications you lack motivation)?

How has neglecting this principle undercut your success? Conversely, how could practicing it increase your future sales opportunities or success?

How can you practice the principle this week? How can you remind yourself to practice it?
