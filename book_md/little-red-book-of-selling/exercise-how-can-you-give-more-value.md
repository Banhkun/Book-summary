## Exercise: How Can You Give More Value?

Salespeople must focus on giving value in two ways: 1) By giving value personally (for example, by sharing connections or expertise), and 2) by articulating how their product delivers what the customer values most.

* * *

What are some ways that you personally give, or could give, value to people in your network?

Thinking about the product or service you sell, what specific value does it provide for customers (for instance, increased sales, productivity, profit, a better image, and so on), and how?

How can you focus your next sales call on this value?

If a potential customer questions or complains about your price, how can you redirect the conversation to your productâ€™s value? Write down a script for what you can say.
