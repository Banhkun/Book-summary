## Part 2: Prepare for Success | Principles 4-5

The next four selling principles involve preparing for sales success. Principles 4 and 5, branding and networking, are closely related in that they overlap and complement each other.

### Principle #4: Develop Your Brand

**Potential customers “buy” the salesperson first, then buy what you’re selling.** They buy your knowledge and expertise, the value you provide, your character, integrity, trustworthiness, and so on. To establish your knowledge and value and make them widely known, you need to develop a strong personal brand.

When you have a strong brand, customers are loyal to you, prospects call _you_ , you get appointments with higher-ups more easily, and you get more “yeses” to meetings and sales than your competitors do. You _attract_ sales success.

Personal branding isn’t difficult, although training classes often make it seem that way—it just takes hard work. **Branding is increasing people’s awareness of you and your strengths. It encompasses putting your name on everything you do** , with the goals of:

  * Establishing yourself as an expert, resource, and innovator in your field
  * Earning a positive reputation in the business community that accrues to your company and product
  * Being seen as a leader in your field and the community
  * Differentiating yourself from others in your field
  * Creating demand indirectly for your product or service



The author built his brand as a sales expert and resource over the years, in part through networking activities such as:

  * Offering himself as a frequent speaker to business, trade, and civic groups
  * Joining community boards and organizations in leadership positions
  * Building his network by identifying those who could help him, then offering them something of value (for example, tips, expert advice, or introductions to useful contacts) _before_ seeking their support



The next chapter goes into networking in more detail.

Besides networking, the author’s branding efforts included:

  * Registering his name, gitomer.com, online (he even registered misspellings of his name.)
  * Writing a regular newspaper column of sales advice, which expanded to 90 markets
  * Adopting a policy of giving value before asking for anything and even without asking for anything (giving value is selling principle #9, which is discussed later in this summary.)
  * Creating a brief verbal pitch about what he does and how he can help
  * Dedicating time to brand-building
  * Multiplying the impact of his activities whenever possible—for example, giving a speech and donating the fee to charity, or donating a scholarship to an organization favored by one of his top clients.



#### Additional Branding Tips

In addition, the author recommends doing the following to develop your personal brand and impress potential customers:

  * Have a highly distinctive business card—if people don’t say “wow, great card” when you give it to them, redesign it.
  * **Whatever you do, do it in a creative and memorable way** (using creativity, the seventh selling principle, is discussed in the next chapter).
  * Use your activities and social media (for example, writing a blog), to put yourself in front of the people you want to do business with.
  * Work to become the best in your field.



Ultimately, **having a strong personal brand is the difference between having to sell and having people _seek out what you’re selling_ (you and your product).**

### Principle #5: Network

As previously noted, the fifth principle of selling—networking—works hand in hand with branding. Both are about becoming known. Networking (building relationships and meeting new people) is an essential business function for salespeople that usually takes place outside of regular business hours. Those unwilling to devote additional time to business after hours lose out to those who do.

The benefits of networking include:

  1. Becoming known by movers and shakers
  2. Connecting with sales prospects
  3. Making new contacts and building relationships
  4. Making genuine friends
  5. Getting sales leads
  6. Getting and giving referrals
  7. Building your reputation and advancing your career 



#### Where to Network

**The first rule of networking is to go to events and places where your customers and prospects are likely to be.** When you run into customers at an event, they can introduce you to prospects like themselves, who are likely to be interested in what you offer.

Tried-and-true networking venues include:

  * Chamber of Commerce after-hours mixers
  * High-level Chamber events, such as annual awards dinners and economic summits
  * Business seminars and classes such as Dale Carnegie courses
  * Civic organizations, such as Rotary and Kiwanis (become a leader, not just a member to increase your exposure to more people)
  * Cultural events like concerts and theater performances
  * Charity events
  * Trade shows and conferences (be a presenter—again, to increase your exposure)
  * Private clubs, such as country clubs
  * Fitness clubs
  * Golf and sporting events



#### How to Network

**Be ready to network when you arrive at the event.** Preparation is 90% of success, so be willing to put in the time to first do your homework.

  * Figure out who’s likely to be at the event you’re targeting and what you can offer them. 
  * Have a 30-second pitch ready about what you offer, tailored to your audience.
  * Be relaxed—save your intensity for business hours. Networking should be purposeful leisure.
  * When you’re talking to someone, pay attention to them. Looking around while you're talking to them is rude.
  * When you’re free, tune in to your surroundings and further opportunities (apply principle #3, being alert). 
  * Spend two-thirds of your time with people you don’t know.



(Shortform note: To learn more about how to network, read our summary of Never Eat Alone.)

#### Networking Versus Cold Calling

**Networking is the best way to start a business relationship.** Connecting face-to-face with a prospect is more likely to get you a meeting with them than cold calling (calling people you’ve never met to ask for a meeting).

In fact, networking eliminates the need for cold calling, which is ineffective and therefore wastes time. Cold calling interrupts the prospect, putting them in a negative frame of mind. Further, because salespeople hate doing it, cold calling leads to job turnover. In contrast, networking at a trade show allows you to meet more good prospects than you could reach in a year of cold calling. If you make a good face-to-face impression on someone, they’ll probably take your phone call later and agree to a meeting.

(Shortform note: For an opposite view of cold calling and tips for success, read our summary of New Sales. Simplified _._)
