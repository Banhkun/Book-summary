## Exercise: Consider the Role of Psychedelics in the World

Now that you’ve learned about the role psychedelics have played in cultures throughout history, consider what role they might play in the world today.

* * *

Knowing the importance they’ve had in many cultures, and the benefits they’ve offered people, why do you think most psychedelics are illegal in much of the world today? Do you think they _should_ be illegal?

Do you think psychedelic rituals could be incorporated into religious practices in your society? If so, what would that look like?

Considering the research to date, do you think psychedelics should be legalized for use in mental health treatment? Why or why not? What restrictions should be placed on their use for this?
