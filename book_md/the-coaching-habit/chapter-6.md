## Chapter 6: The Commitment Question: “What’s The Cost of Saying ‘Yes’?”

In a fast-moving, highly competitive work environment, employees are often asked to take on more and more tasks, even when their plates are already overflowing. For example, they’re asked to sit in at a meeting, to join a committee, or to take part in out-of-office activities on top of their existing responsibilities. Despite being overloaded, they tend to say “yes” to more tasks because they associate being busy with being successful, and it’s often hard or awkward to say “no.”

When you see team members contemplating an opportunity or additional responsibilities, you can **help them make the best decision by asking them the sixth essential question: “What’s the cost of saying ‘yes’?”**

### Why This Question Is a Good Coaching Habit

According to psychologists, two factors lead to poor choices when it comes to deciding whether or not to take on new tasks. First, people believe they can do more than is actually possible. Second, people tend to overvalue what they have.

In the workplace, these two factors show up as team members who are overwhelmed because they don’t have a realistic understanding of the commitment needed for all the new tasks coming their way, and they’re unwilling to let go of anything they’re already doing.

Asking, “What’s the cost of saying ‘yes’?” leads a person to evaluate and be realistic about the time, energy, and resources he’ll need to expend to accomplish a task. It also leads him to reflect on the value of his pre-existing tasks, and whether he’s willing to sacrifice them to fully commit to another task.

(Shortform note: Read our guide to Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow to learn more about the psychological phenomena directing our decision-making.)

### How to Make It a Habit

A team member who’s considering taking on additional tasks should trigger you to ask, “What’s the cost of saying ‘yes’?” Then, you can guide him to make an informed decision with two further steps:

##### 1) Ask Him to Reflect On the 3Ps

Have him outline the _projects_ he’ll need to give up to take on this new responsibility, the _people_ who will be affected by his decision, and the _patterns_ and behaviors he’ll need to overcome to accomplish the new task.

##### 2) Give Him the Tools to Say No

Explain that there are two ways to turn down new opportunities that make the process a bit easier.

**1) The “slow yes”:** In response to the offer of a new task, he should ask questions that give a clearer picture of the commitment required, such as, “What’s the timetable?” and, “If I can only commit x hours, what would you like me to do?” Such questions will lead to one of four outcomes:

  * He finds out that he doesn’t have a choice and has to do it anyway
  * He gets some illuminating answers that will better help him make a decision
  * He buys himself some time to think about it
  * He’s left alone and someone else is asked to do the job. 



**2) The “diplomatic no”:** Make saying no less awkward by refusing the _task_ rather than the _person_. For example, you might say, “It looks like I have to say no to _this project_ ” instead of, “It looks like I’ll have to say no to _you._ ”
