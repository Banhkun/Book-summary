To keep from getting overwhelmed, try practicing and mastering one new habit at a time. Which of the seven essential questions will you practice this week?

It’s easier to build a habit when you meet minimal resistance. Which team members will be the most receptive to the coaching habit that you’re trying to build?

Describe a specific trigger that will prompt you to ask this question. (For example, when one of the team members listed above sends a lengthy email, you’ll respond by asking them to articulate their central challenge.)
