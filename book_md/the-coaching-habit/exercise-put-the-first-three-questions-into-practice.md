## Exercise: Put the First Three Questions into Practice

You can use the conversation starter, the follow-through question, and the laser beam question in one session to have an insightful conversation. But first, you have to be aware of your triggers and articulate both your old and new habits.

* * *

Describe a time you tried to open a conversation with a question such as, “What’s on your mind?” How did your team member respond? (For example, they acted closed-off or talked about vague, big-picture issues or dumped information on you.)

What bad habits did you react with, and what was the result? (For example, you didn’t try to pry any further with your closed-off team member. As a result, a small problem you could have helped with was allowed to build up into a huge, expensive issue.)

How would asking, “Anything else?” or “What’s the central challenge for you?” have helped you better coach the team member toward a solution?
