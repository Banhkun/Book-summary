## Exercise: Uncover the Needs Hidden By Wants

Sometimes, good coaching depends on seeing a team memberâ€™s _needs_ underneath their expressed _wants_. Practice responding to wants with solutions to needs.

* * *

Describe a time an employee expressed a want to you. What was the want? How did you respond?

Which of the nine needs (recall: affection, creation, recreation, freedom, identity, understanding, participation, protection, and subsistence) could this want have been hiding?

How could you have better responded to the want in a way that addressed the need?
