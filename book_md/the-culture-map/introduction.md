## Introduction: The Eight Ways to Measure Cultural Differences

In an increasingly globalized world, understanding other cultures is an essential business skill. However, there are few systematic methods for analyzing and dealing with specific cultural differences.

In _The Culture Map_ , Erin Meyer defines eight areas in which cultural differences are most likely to lead to misunderstandings in business communications. She also theorizes about why such differences occur and presents strategies for working with people from different cultures. According to Meyer, when you have a thorough understanding of cultural differences and methods to navigate them, you can avoid misunderstandings and be more successful in your business and management dealings.

> **How Cultural Competence Saves Lives**
> 
> Understanding other cultures is important not only in business but in healthcare as well—in fact, it’s so important that healthcare workers first created the term “cultural competence.”
> 
> Healthcare depends on proper communication between the doctor and patient. But a lack of cultural understanding complicates the message and causes wires to cross. For example, a patient who comes from a culture where doctors are high-status may not express her questions about her diagnosis for fear of embarrassing the doctor. A culturally unaware doctor may interpret this silence as a sign that the patient fully understands her diagnosis—resulting in this doctor unintentionally providing subpar medical care. So it’s critical for healthcare workers to understand the cultures of the people they may encounter.

### The Eight Axes of Cultural Difference

According to Meyer, there are eight major axes on which cultures can differ: Communication, Feedback, Thinking, Leadership, Decision-Making, Trust, Disagreement, and Time Perception.

Meyer has developed scales, which we’ll call axes or spectrums, as a way to visualize the degree of difference in each category. On each axis lies a potential spectrum of behavior, and each end of the axis is the direct opposite of the other end. For example, on the Disagreement axis, one end of the axis represents “confrontational,” while the other end represents “avoids confrontation.” Similarly, on the Feedback axis, one end represents “direct negative feedback,” while the other end represents “indirect negative feedback.” Meyer positions countries on each axis based on anecdotal evidence and her research at INSEAD.

(Shortform note: As discussed, Meyer asks for a huge amount of trust from her readers: She doesn’t reference any peer-reviewed studies from INSEAD. A potential reason for Meyer’s lack of research is the difficulty of empirically measuring cultural differences. Any study methodology would likely be flawed because the methodology itself would be influenced by cultural factors. Furthermore, studying every country in the world is a colossal undertaking.)

Meyer visually represents the axes in a “culture map.”

> While a great resource for visual learners, some readers find Meyer’s culture map problematic. The most common critique is that, in her chapter on Thinking, Meyer uses the axis only to explain cultural differences in thinking among Western cultures. Asian cultures, according to Meyer, use a third form of thinking that she doesn’t represent on an axis. Therefore, the visual is ineffective for determining cultural differences between non-Asian and Asian cultures. Other reviewers find the visuals overly complicated and confusing.

> We’ve modified and streamlined the image of the culture map to make it easier to interpret and use. You can find Meyer’s map by reading _The Culture Map_ or purchasing access to her mapping tool on her website.

We’ll devote a chapter to each cultural axis.

#### Critiques of Meyer’s Approach

Some argue that, even in a relatively homogenous culture, the behaviors deemed “acceptable” in that country may vary widely, so you can’t accurately locate the culture of a country at a single point on an axis. However, Meyer argues that while individual and regional differences do exist, they still fall under a countrywide spectrum of acceptable behavior. Therefore, we can place a culture on the axis by finding the midpoint between the extremes of what people consider appropriate in that culture. She further asserts that this range encompasses both regional and individual differences in a country.

(Shortform note: Evaluating cultures based on a midpoint seems reasonable. However, Meyer doesn’t share the range of behaviors she considered for each country. It’s possible for cultures to share the same midpoint even if their ranges differ dramatically. Imagine that the range of acceptable behavior in Culture A ranges from negative five to five, but in Culture B it ranges from negative one to one. Zero is the midpoint of both these ranges. So by Meyer’s logic, these two cultures have the same midpoint even though the first has a lower range of acceptable behavior. Given this fact, Meyer’s use of the midpoint could be misleading.)

A crucial element of understanding how to use these axes is _cultural relativity_. Cultural relativity is the idea that you cannot evaluate a culture’s position on the axis independently. You can only evaluate it in relation to another culture’s position on that same axis.

For example, say you’re from Country A and working with someone from Country B. If both countries A and B tend to avoid confrontation, you might assume that you don’t need to worry about cultural misunderstandings in the disagreement category. However, if Country B is slightly more confrontational than you are on the axis, assuming that Country B works exactly like yours could be problematic. What matters is not _where_ Country B lies on the axis, but _how far away_ it is from Country A.

(Shortform note: Although cultural relativity and cultural relativism sound similar, these terms express opposite concepts. In academia, cultural relativism is “the ability to understand a culture on its own terms and not to make judgments using the standards of one’s own culture.” Although Meyer doesn’t recommend judging the other culture, her scale is most effective if you have another culture to compare it to.)

In her introduction, Meyer also addresses two common criticisms of her work. First, many argue that attributing people’s traits to culture reinforces stereotypes, so you should ignore cultural influence and evaluate people individually. But Meyer argues that this is counterproductive. Even if we’re unaware of them, we all have cultural biases. So you might think you’re evaluating someone independently of cultural influence—but in reality, you’re evaluating them based on your own cultural norms. In order to accurately assess someone’s actions in the workplace, you need to know how culture influences both you and the people you’re working with.

(Shortform note: If you’re already fairly culturally competent, you may not think you need further cultural education. In this case, you may want to consider cultural humility instead. Coined in the healthcare field, cultural humility refers to the idea that understanding other cultures is a lifelong learning process: Even the most culturally aware people are still susceptible to unconscious biases. Luckily, research shows that we can start to change our own biases once we understand them. Strategies for discovering and combating our own biases include taking association tests and diversifying the perspectives around you so you have a better understanding of how others view the world.)

The second common criticism is that lots of people grow up multiculturally, so Meyer’s framework isn’t sophisticated enough to encounter everybody you’ll meet in the workplace. But in her introduction, Meyer suggests that by reading her book, multicultural people can learn how the various cultures they grew up with influenced their personalities. For example, someone who grew up in France and Canada might communicate like the French but follow Canadian ideals about leadership. So Meyer’s framework does encompass multiculturalism—but you have to evaluate each axis individually instead of all eight together.

(Shortform note: This probably works up to a point—for example, if you or your parents immigrate to a different country, you could assess how two different cultures affected your upbringing. But we now live in a world where several different cultures can influence someone. For example, you could have parents from two different cultures, grow up in a third culture, then spend most of your career in a fourth culture. So while Meyer’s suggestion makes sense to a degree, it may be more trouble than it’s worth for some people.)
