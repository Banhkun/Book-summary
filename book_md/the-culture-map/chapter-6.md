## Chapter 6: Building Trust Across Cultures

Trust is an essential part of successful business relationships.

However, different cultures build trust in different ways. Without a clear understanding of how a particular culture builds trust, you are prone to misunderstanding the nature of your relationship with your business partners. In other words, you might think that you have a more or less significant relationship than you actually do.

In this section, we’ll first discuss the two ways in which different cultures build trust, and why those different methods develop. We’ll then discuss one of the reasons it can be so difficult to determine the depth of your relationship with someone. Finally, we will present several strategies you can use to build trust in different cultures.

### Two Styles of Trust: Cognitive and Personal

Meyer separates how cultures build trust into two types: task-based, which we’ll call cognitive, and relationship-based, which we’ll call personal.

(Shortform note: Be careful not to confuse these with task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership styles. Task-oriented leadership focuses on helping people get the task done, while relationship-oriented leadership values the relationships on the team. While similar to the two types of trust, these are specific to leadership styles, whereas cognitive and personal trust are useful in every business relationship, even when there isn’t a specific leader.)

#### How Cognitive Cultures Build Trust

Business relationships in cognitive cultures are rooted in cognitive trust. **Meyer describes cognitive trust as trust that develops based on behaviors. Is the other party good at their job? Do they follow through?**

However, this also means that **cognitive cultures strictly delineate their personal and professional relationships.** According to Meyer, many members of cognitive cultures will actively avoid developing a personal relationship with people they work with in order to avoid conflicts of interest.

(Shortform note: For example, people in cognitive cultures might consider hiring a relative or somebody who you were introduced to through a relative to be a conflict of interest. But in other cultures, this might be the only way you got the interview in the first place.)

Meyer contends that **a key element of cognitive cultures is what happens after the professional relationship is severed**. People from cognitive cultures still work to establish rapport with their colleagues and clients through icebreakers and socializing. But if somebody at your company is fired in a cognitive culture, this tends to signify the unceremonious end of your relationship. (Shortform note: This is usually due to people feeling awkward, but can be a more official ending. One American woman found herself struggling to remain friends with a former coworker because their ex-boss had asked them to cut contact. This is an extreme and awkward case in cognitive culture, but would be absolutely unthinkable in certain places around the world.)

People view members of cognitive cultures as superficial and inauthentic because knowing someone for years doesn’t actually mean you know them at all.

Countries where cognitive trust is the norm tend to have established legal systems and include the United States and the United Kingdom. Meyer argues that this is no coincidence:**if you have reliable legal recourse when your business partner wrongs you, her personal character becomes less important**. You assume that she’s reliable because she’s good at her job—otherwise, you wouldn’t be doing business with her. And on the off chance she isn’t, you can always sue. In this context, investing time in getting to know each other on a deep personal level becomes at best inefficient and at worst a waste of time.

(Shortform note: Although people from cognitive cultures might be more inclined to pursue legal recourse than other cultures, it’s often considered an unwise decision. For example, many people hesitate to sue their employers because they're worried that if a new potential employer finds out about the lawsuit, they’ll never get hired again.)

#### How Personal Cultures Build Trust

Business relationships in personal cultures are rooted in affective or personal trust. Meyer describes affective trust as trust that develops based on how you feel about the other person. **Affective trust is the trust that people of all cultures feel towards their family and friends. But in personal cultures, it's also the cornerstone of business relationships.**

In personal cultures, people build trust slowly. They don’t use icebreaker exercises, which develop only superficial trust. Instead, this type of culture values deeper, long-lasting trust.

Meyer contends that professional relationships in personal cultures don’t end the way that they do in cognitive cultures. Rather, professional relationships extend through years and through different companies.

(Shortform note: Researchers suggest that trust has three parts: competency, honesty (or integrity), and benevolence, the idea that someone is acting in your best interests. It’s likely that although both types of cultures value honesty, cognitive cultures place a higher value on competence and personal cultures place a higher value on benevolence. After all, in many cognitive cultures, the idea that a business is doing its best for you would be considered a joke. So if you're working in a personal culture, focus on increasing your benevolence.)

If you fire Ivana in a personal culture, her ex-colleagues will likely hold a send-off party for her. They’ll certainly maintain a professional relationship with her, and might even follow her to her next company. The same may hold true for Ivana’s clients because they value her more than the company she works for.

(Shortform note: Another reason to focus on the quality of your business relationships when working cross-culturally is because firing practices differ across cultures. The United States famously hires employees at-will, so they can be fired for nearly any non-discriminatory reasons. But most countries have strict rules about whether someone can be fired at all—so you might be stuck with people you dislike for a long time.)

Critics of personal cultures think that it’s inefficient to spend so much time building these relationships. However, the emerging markets that tend to value personal trust do so for a very specific reason, according to Meyer. Emerging markets tend to have less reliable legal systems, so you don't always have official recourse if somebody wrongs you. Therefore,**to avoid being wronged, you need to get to know the true characters of the people you work with**. Once you’ve invested time into building personal relationships, you’ll be more confident taking business risks with them (and because they know you personally, they’ll be less likely to be wrong).

(Shortform note: Investing time in your personal relationships at work has several benefits, especially if you have a “best friend.” Gallup research found that people with best friends at work reported seven times more engagement at their jobs. They were also healthier and did better work than their lonelier peers.)

Countries where personal trust is the norm include the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China).

### Why It’s Hard to Define Your Relationship: Peach vs Coconut Cultures

One reason that establishing effective cross-cultural business relationships is so difficult is because **different cultures indicate the depth of their relationship in different ways**. These cues aren’t necessarily related to where the culture lies on the trust-building spectrum.

Meyer cites a common model for dividing cultures into two types: peach cultures and coconut cultures.

(Shortform note: The peach/coconut model appears to have been influenced by the “specific v. diffuse” dimension of Trompenaars’s model of national cultural differences. This dimension describes how readily people share their private lives. But the model is a cultural communication framework that describes several other dimensions of cultural difference, including how people deal with each other, how they view their environment, and how they perceive time.)

Peaches are soft on the outside but have a hard pit. Similarly, **citizens of peach cultures are outwardly friendly. However, they can be incredibly hard to get to know** because they protect their true selves in a “hard pit” reserved for a select few. Other cultures may feel cheated by peaches, because they’ve shared so much of themselves and think they’re developing a close relationship when the peach doesn't think it’s close at all. Peach cultures include the United States (a cognitive culture) and Brazil (a personal culture).

A coconut has a hard shell. But crack it, and you'll be rewarded with its soft inner meat. Similarly, **people from coconut cultures seem initially distant, especially to foreigners. It takes time to get to know them.** But once you crack the shell, you can develop a long-lasting, deep relationship with them. Coconut cultures include Russia (a personal culture) and Germany (a cognitive culture).

(Shortform note: In a separate article, Meyer describes how peach and coconut cultures have different social norms. For example, asking how you met your husband is acceptable in peach cultures but unacceptable in coconut cultures. She recommends that coconuts learn how peach culture works in order to avoid feeling cheated. In contrast, peaches should feel free to act normally when sharing themselves but refrain from asking any potentially intrusive questions.)

### Strategies for Building Trust in Different Cultures

In this section, we will share Meyer’s strategies for building trust in both cognitive and personal cultures.

However, most of Meyer’s strategies focus on building trust in personal cultures. Meyer has two reasons for this.

First, since today’s emerging markets (BRIC) tend to have personal cultures, Meyer thinks that learning how to build affective trust is more important for modern-day business professionals.

(Shortform note: South Africa was added to BRICS in 2010, four years prior to _The Culture Map_ ’s publication, but Meyer doesn’t mention it in her axis or her acronym. This is a pattern throughout her book: Meyer rarely describes African cultures in _The Culture Map_. But South Africa is also likely a personal country, as South Africans are unlikely to meet you unless you have some personal connection to them.)

Secondly, Meyer thinks that **affective trust-building is a generally useful skill when working with different cultures.** When you have a personal bond with someone, they are more likely to forgive and teach you about the inevitable cultural errors you make.

(Shortform note: Affective trust is also beneficial in cognitive cultures. One study whose participants were all located in the United States suggests that “in the client-project manager relationship, affective-based trust factors can supersede cognitive-based trust factors in a client’s perception of ‘good quality’ project performance.”)

#### How to Build Trust in Cognitive Cultures

**Choose the most efficient way to communicate.** Cognitive cultures tend to value efficiency over connection. So try sending an email instead of calling. If you do call, don’t be afraid to talk about your personal life—but keep it shorter than you might be used to.

(Shortform note: Even in cognitive cultures, people struggle to decide when to email and when to call. Try choosing your communication method based on how quickly you need an answer.)

**Shorten your meals.** Sharing a meal is a great way to bond with others. But inform your partners if the meal will last longer than 90 minutes, and try to keep it to 60. (Shortform note: Restaurants in countries where long meals are rare may kick you out after a set period. If you’ll exceed these times, consult the restaurant in advance.)

**Let people go home.** The fact that your colleagues don’t want to join you on a night out is normal behavior and generally not indicative of how much they respect you. If they visit you but want to return to their hotel after meetings, don’t take it personally. (Shortform note: Staying out all night with your coworkers may be good business in your culture, but other cultures may view this as unprofessional behavior. Learn and follow the norms of the country you're working in.)

#### How to Build Trust in Personal Cultures

**Visit.** It will likely come as no surprise that it's easiest to build trust with someone in person. If you are able, visit the people you’ll be working with. Leave room on the agenda for socializing. And when you arrive, follow the other strategies on this list to ensure it's the most effective visit possible. Moreover, when people from different cultures come to meet you, entertain them no matter how busy you may be. Establishing a relationship now will help you avoid problems in the long run.

(Shortform note: In her book, Meyer describes how one American manager was confused why her European colleagues set up one-on-ones to meet with her when they were in town, even when they didn’t have anything to talk about. If you find such one-on-ones uncomfortable, flip the script and invite your colleagues to lunch or to drinks instead. You may feel more comfortable establishing the type of bond they desire in a more relaxed setting.)

**Look for connections.** The best way to build affective trust is to find similarities between you and your business partner. If none jump out at you, pay more attention. What do they have in their office? What can you find on social media? You might need to use loose connections or do some research on your own. For example, if they love movies, watch the most popular movies in their country right now and ask for their opinion.

(Shortform note: How can you build affective trust remotely? One management consultant’s strategies for your own team members include having a virtual space where people can hang out, such as a non-work Slack channel, or creating a buddy system to help onboard new virtual employees.)

**Let your hair down.** When someone from a personal culture invites you out, this is your cue to reveal your true self. They have turned their professional selves off; it is time for you to do the same. Don't worry about being politically incorrect, saying the wrong thing, or getting too personal. Skip the business, and just have fun.

(Shortform note: Think you can’t be yourself because you don’t know these people yet? Think again. _Dare to Lead_ argues that trust doesn’t come after vulnerability; rather, they occur simultaneously. Specifically, when someone reaches out to you and you choose to engage with and respond to their vulnerability (instead of ignoring it), you earn their trust and the right to be vulnerable with them in turn. So go ahead and be vulnerable!.)

**Drink.** In many cultures, drinking alcohol together is essential to forming business relationships. This is especially true of East Asian cultures, where frank communication is discouraged in the boardroom. By drinking alcohol and letting yourself go after business hours, you show that you have nothing to hide and are therefore trustworthy. But never discuss your drunken antics elsewhere. What happens at the bar stays at the bar.

(Shortform note: Meyer describes in detail the role alcohol plays in Japanese business culture. But there are indications this role is changing as new bars in Tokyo serve exclusively non-alcoholic drinks. If you don’t drink but need to build relationships in a culture that values alcohol, research similar establishments there.)

**Spend time on meals.** Meals shared with people from personal cultures can stretch to several hours. Remember that these are essential to building trust, so resist the urge to classify them a waste of time. Meyer recommends using this opportunity to get to know your colleagues personally. And if you happen to be hosting someone from a personal culture, spend more time planning and sharing the meal than you might otherwise.

(Shortform note: To reduce the chances of accidentally offending your business partners, brush up on the culture’s table manners. And remember that the length of the meal doesn’t always reflect how much food is provided. If you’re used to scarfing down lunch at your desk, pace yourself. Otherwise, you might find yourself waiting with an empty plate for hours while your colleagues savor their food.)

**Use the phone.** Emails might be efficient, but they’re not good at deepening personal relationships. Meyer suggests calling people from personal cultures, especially if you’re still in the process of establishing your personal relationship. If you’re speaking with someone new or someone you haven’t spoken to in a long time, you may need to have several phone conversations before bringing up the business matter at all.

(Shortform note: Meyer's book doesn't mention video chatting, but it might be your best option. One study of young women found that after meeting in-person, video chat was the format in which they felt most bonded to their friends. You may argue that a study between friends is not applicable to business relationships, but this is precisely the type of trust that is needed in personal cultures. That said, another study showed that having Zoom meetings is less efficient than simply getting on a phone call, so consider the purpose when choosing your communication method.)

**Follow the other person’s cues.** When you do call your business partner, don't merely exchange pleasantries for five minutes before getting to the point of the conversation. While this may feel natural to you, you may offend your foreign colleague. Avoid such misunderstandings by letting your business partner direct the conversation. Meyer also recommends using a similar strategy in your emails by imitating the structure of the emails you receive. For example, if they always write a long paragraph asking about your health, add one to the emails you send too.

(Shortform note: This likely works due to social mirroring, the idea that people who like each other copy each other. (We discussed this previously in our leadership chapter.) Just be subtle when you mirror someone. If they notice you’re doing it, they might feel manipulated.)

**Utilize your network.** According to Meyer, cold calling and emailing tend to be ineffective strategies in personal cultures. If you need to speak to someone you don't know from a personal culture, go through your network. You are far more likely to receive a response if you can find a mutual connection to introduce you. This strategy is especially effective in Arab cultures.

(Shortform note: If you have no connections in common, use your knowledge of different cultures to your advantage. For example, you might find through Linkedin that your desired contact has a colleague from a cognitive culture. You may have better luck cold calling or emailing them and asking for an introduction once you’ve established a rapport, instead of going to your desired contact directly.)
