## Chapter 4: Leadership Across Cultures

According to Meyer, leadership styles differ drastically across cultures. Understanding these leadership styles is critical for a number of reasons. If you’re a manager, Meyer argues that it’s your responsibility to adapt your leadership style to what your subordinates are used to. But even if you’re not, knowing how leadership works in different cultures can help ensure you give a good impression and don’t offend anyone.

In this section, we’ll first discuss how Meyer divides cultural leadership styles into two extremes: egalitarian and hierarchical, and how those leadership styles develop. We’ll then present strategies for working and leading in different kinds of cultures.

### Two Styles of Leadership: Egalitarian vs Hierarchical

According to Meyer, countries tend to follow either an egalitarian or hierarchical leadership style.

The leadership style preferred in a country reflects the amount of “power distance” expected in that country. Power distance, a concept introduced by pioneering cultural theorist Geert Hofstede, measures how hierarchical a country is and how its citizens value authority.

The citizenry’s expectations of how power is distributed determine whether a country prefers an egalitarian or hierarchical leadership style.

> **How Hofstede Represents Power Distance**
> 
> Like Meyer, Hofstede created a visual, quantifiable representation of power distance. In Hofstede’s Power Distance Index, each country has a number that indicates how high or low their power distance is. Malaysia, with an index of 104, has the world’s highest power distance. But the country with the most power distance mentioned in Meyer’s book is Nigeria, which only has an index of 77. Meyer’s tendency to focus on countries with broader business profiles like Nigeria is reasonable in a text geared towards businesspeople. (In 2011, the Goldman Sachs executive who coined BRIC deemed Nigeria one of the next major emerging markets.) Still, it may have been more effective to focus on some of the world’s outliers in some of her axes.

#### Defining Egalitarian Leadership

**In an egalitarian culture, the power distance is low. In other words, everybody is equal​​—even in the workplace.**

Companies in egalitarian cultures tend to have a flat organizational structure. People speak as easily to the CEO as they do to the lowest-ranking employee. (Shortform note: Another feature of egalitarian cultures that Meyer doesn’t mention is that its members are more likely to act on their own and ask for forgiveness instead of permission.)

In meetings, everybody’s ideas have equal value. The boss’s rank doesn’t protect his/her suggestions from criticism. Problems are pushed down to the people who know them best. (Shortform note: International management consultancy Sinickas adds that meeting participants speak informally and from the heart. In contrast, hierarchical cultures prefer scripts in meetings and presentations.)

The boss uses external cues to indicate that he/she is ‘one of the guys,’ such as by dressing casually or forgoing an office. (Shortform note: These external cues start early in some egalitarian cultures. In the Netherlands and Sweden, students call teachers by their first names.)

Most people claim they prefer to be led and to lead in an egalitarian style. But in practice, leaders who aren’t used to egalitarian followers find them disrespectful. And employees often view egalitarian managers as weak and unable to provide direction. (Shortform note: One Stanford study suggests that people prefer hierarchical leadership styles because the familiarity of hierarchical relationships makes them easier to understand. Whereas egalitarian relationships can be confusing to navigate, in a hierarchy, everyone’s roles and level of authority are clear.)

#### How Egalitarian Cultures Develop

Meyer hypothesizes that two major factors influenced how today’s egalitarian cultures developed.

The first factor is historical. The most egalitarian cultures in the world are concentrated in Northern Europe, which was historically dominated by the Vikings. The Vikings were very modern in their ways: Everybody got a say in major decisions, and Iceland, which they founded, is one of the world’s first democracies.**Meyer argues that the ideals behind the Vikings’ political system remain evident in the egalitarian leadership styles of the cultures they once ruled.**

(Shortform note: The Vikings are popularly thought to have had more gender equality than their contemporaries. Does modern-day workplace egalitarianism also equate to gender egalitarianism? Sometimes, according to the Women's Workplace Equality Index, but it’s not a perfect match. For example, Denmark and the Netherlands are both high-egalitarian cultures with high women’s workplace equality. However, Israel is high-egalitarian but lower in women’s workplace equality. Conversely, Japan and Nigeria are both hierarchical with low workplace equality, but hierarchical South Korea has very high workplace equality.)

The second factor is religion. Egalitarian cultures tend to be more Protestant. **Meyer notes that Protestant countries broke away from the strict structure of the Roman Catholic Church, allowing them to develop non-hierarchical systems. F** urthermore, Meyer states, Protestants value the individual’s relationship with God, and argues that these ideals are evident in the leadership styles of the cultures they dominate.

(Shortform note: Other key features of Protestantism also elevate the role of the individual, which further supports Meyer’s argument. Protestants believe that the Bible and Scripture are the highest religious authorities, while Catholics also follow the Church’s teachings. Furthermore, Protestants believe that people are saved through faith only. Catholics find salvation in practices that require a hierarchical relationship, such as confessing their sins to a priest.)

#### Defining Hierarchical Leadership

**In a hierarchical culture, the power distance is high. In other words, your rank matters.**

Companies in hierarchical cultures have clearly defined levels, and the employees stick to them. They talk to their immediate boss and subordinates but receive permission to talk with anybody further up or down the chain. (Shortform note: The expectation of giving/receiving permission sometimes results in a “kiss up/kick down” leader” who is excessively harsh to subordinates and overly submissive to his/her managers. This may be a red flag to watch for in hierarchical cultures.)

In meetings, the boss’s idea is the most important. **Subordinates won’t speak unless explicitly requested to do so—and if they disagree with the boss, they keep their thoughts to themselves.** Problems are pushed up to the boss so everyone can follow his or her vision and direction. (Shortform note: Meetings may also look physically different. Sinickas recommends holding different meetings for managers and non-managers, as well as having a podium for the speaker, when working in hierarchical cultures.)

The boss signals his/her authority through status symbols such as a corner office. Subordinates value these symbols; they signify that the boss deserves respect. In a hierarchical culture, if a boss deserves respect, the subordinates by extension also deserve respect. (Shortform note: Education is another highly regarded status symbol. But in some hierarchical cultures, it’s only the name that counts. China has a famously grueling university entrance exam. But once you’re accepted, it’s historically very rare to be expelled—even if you’re failing.)

Notably, especially in Asian hierarchical cultures, **respect is a two-way street. It is not just the subordinate’s duty to obey.** **Rather, the boss is responsible for the success and well-being of his employees.** He is often viewed as a paternalistic figure. (Shortform note: Viewing your boss as a parent can happen quite literally, even in non-hierarchical cultures. The attachment styles we share with our parents extend to our adult working lives, and there are even instances of work transference where we mistakenly extend our patterns with our parents to our bosses.)

#### How Hierarchical Cultures Develop

According to Meyer, the historical reasons that hierarchical cultures developed differ between Europe and Asia.

Firstly, t**he more hierarchical European cultures (Spain, Italy, and France) were all part of the Roman Empire.** Ancient Rome had many class-based social and political systems. Meyer argues that these systems laid the foundation for a hierarchical system in these cultures that is evident in their modern-day leadership styles. (Shortform note: The Roman Empire lasted for 1000 years, so these class-based systems weren’t always the same. For example, near the end of the Roman Empire, non-Italian-born citizens could be invited to the Senate. But although the details of these hierarchies evolved over time, the hierarchies themselves existed quite consistently.)

Similarly,**the strong influence of the Roman Catholic Church on these European countries also helped establish today’s hierarchical system.** As evidence, Meyer notes that the Roman Catholic Church is extremely hierarchical, with individuals speaking to their priests and bishops instead of directly to God. (Shortform note: It’s also notable that even the highest powers in historically Catholic countries still answered to the Pope. In other words, everybody was in a hierarchy—even at the top.)

**But in Asia, Meyer argues, modern-day hierarchical leadership styles reflect the philosophies of Confucius**. Confucius thought that in order for societies to function smoothly, ranks and responsibilities had to be clearly delineated and strictly adhered to. According to Meyer, this Confucian influence over large swathes of Asia explains why so many Asian countries lead hierarchically in business. (Shortform note: Confucian ideals about filial piety are also used as justification for non-democratic styles of leadership—the ultimate hierarchy—especially in China. But some interpretations of Confucius’s writing argue against submission, arguing that Confucianism allows people to not only choose their leaders but also rebel against bad ones.)

### Strategies for Working in Cultures With Different Leadership Styles

#### General Strategies for Working in Hierarchical Cultures

**If you need to speak with someone several levels above or below you, always get permission from the person in between.** Then, make sure to copy that person on any emails you send. This way, your email recipient understands that they can respond freely without violating local business etiquette.

(Shortform note: Pay attention to your tone in emails—especially when emailing someone of similar rank. Don’t write anything that might be interpreted as bossing them around. People in hierarchical cultures are particularly sensitive to suggestions of unearned authority.)

**In hierarchical cultures, there are often subtle ways in which rank is expressed in business.** For example, in Japan, the lowest-ranking person always operates the elevator buttons, while the highest-ranking person stands directly behind him/her. Learn these rules well so you don’t unintentionally offend your colleagues or clients. You should also learn the non-subtle ways too, like proper bowing etiquette in Asian cultures.

**Err on the side of caution and refer to people by their last name unless they indicate otherwise.** And don’t insist that people call you by your first name, since this can introduce unnecessary discomfort in your relationship. Consider a compromise like “Ms. Jane'' instead. (Shortform note: Many hierarchical countries, like South Korea and Japan, have language tenses that indicate politeness—you speak, quite literally, differently to someone based on whether they’re above or below you in rank. If you're speaking English, referring to people by their last name or having them refer to you by their last name may be one of the few immediate ways you can show respect.)

#### How to Lead in a Hierarchical Culture

**Take your responsibility to protect seriously.** Your subordinates’ faithful obedience doesn’t give you license to treat them poorly. Hierarchical leadership works best when the leader protects and mentors their subordinates well. (Shortform note: Of course, the idea that leaders need to protect their subordinates isn’t exclusive to hierarchical cultures, with one article attributing it to the American 1967 business book Organizations in Action.)

**When you need your team’s input, tell them before the meeting happens.** If they know in advance that you want their honest opinion, they’ll do their best to respect you by providing it. They’ll also have more latitude to consult with their colleagues. (Shortform note: You could also consider soliciting anonymous opinions. Try setting up a dummy email account or Google document where people can express their thoughts privately.)

Even if you’ve requested people’s input beforehand, **call on people whose opinions you want to hear in meetings.** People used to hierarchical leadership styles tend not to volunteer their input unless specifically asked. (Shortform note: But skip this strategy if you’re an external presenter. Calling on people in front of their bosses could embarrass them.)

Alternatively, **consider removing yourself from the meeting entirely. Instead, have someone present the meeting’s conclusions to you later on.** Your subordinates will feel more comfortable expressing their ideas honestly if you’re not present. (Shortform note: But remember that there may still be hierarchical relationships at play that affect the meeting results. Hierarchical relationships can be based not just on job title but also on factors like gender, age, or years at the company.)

#### General Strategies for Working in Egalitarian Cultures

Remember that **speaking with someone several levels above or below you is likely totally normal** —no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel. (Shortform note: If you’re particularly intimidated by somebody, try comic visualization: Picturing them in a funny situation encourages your brain to turn its stress response off.)

**Copy people on your emails on a need-to-know basis.** Copying the boss unnecessarily may make an egalitarian employee feel like you’re trying to make them look bad or that you think they need extra oversight. (Shortform note: Some people worry that if they don’t copy their boss on emails, they can’t keep their boss informed. Try some other strategies, like sending your boss occasional recaps of your exchanges.)

#### How to Lead in an Egalitarian Culture

**Learn and adopt the external cues that indicate that you’re ‘one of the guys.’** For example, call people by their first name and insist they call you by yours. Using last names may be overly formal and stiff to someone from an egalitarian culture. (According to Meyer, this is true of Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and Australia, but can vary regionally in the United States and the United Kingdom.) (Shortform note: This may reflect the psychological concept of social mirroring, the idea that we unconsciously copy people we like. Many texts recommend mirroring others’ gestures consciously in an attempt to get them to like you.)

**Meyer also recommends several strategies that fall under the 5-step method ofManagement by Objective,** a framework developed by management expert Peter Drucker in the 1950s. Although she mentions the term “management by objective,” Meyer doesn’t present her strategies using the step-by-step sequence Drucker did. We, however, will use the 5-step framework because it’s easier to understand.

**​​Step 1: Set goals for your team.**

**Step 2: Share these goals with your team.**

**Step 3: Ask your employees to set their own goals.** Approve them as long as they support the team objectives you’ve shared. Meyer recommends this specifically because people from egalitarian cultures feel more comfortable with a facilitator rather than the traditional hierarchical leader. Similarly, she recommends facilitating instead of leading meetings, too.

(Shortform note: Meyer merely recommends that these goals be “concrete and specific.” But modern-day versions of Drucker’s strategies tend to recommend specifically SMART goals. SMART is an acronym used to represent Specific, Measurable, Acceptable, Realistic, and Time-Bound goals.)

**Step 4: Monitor your employee’s progress on those goals.** Meyer recommends adjusting the frequency of your check-ins based on the employee’s progress—not an element of Drucker’s strategy.

**Step 5: Assess your employee’s progress, and reward them as necessary.** Meyer specifically recommends financial motivation like bonuses.
