## Epilogue: What to Keep in Mind to Work Effectively Across Cultures

In the epilogue, Meyer presents several strategies to use when working across global teams.

In this section, we’ll combine those strategies with some of the other, more general strategies she suggests in previous chapters. First, we’ll explain how to combine the axes so you can effectively determine how two cultures differ. Then, we’ll present general principles to keep in mind when working globally. Finally, we’ll present strategies you can use when managing cross-cultural teams.

### Understanding How Two Cultures Differ: How to Use the Axes Together

The axes described in this book offer a useful tool you can use to compare two cultures.

To do so, **Meyer recommends looking at all eight axes simultaneously.** Evaluate where each culture lies on each axis. Then, ask yourself: On what axes are these cultures similar? Where are they furthest apart?

In order to mitigate the frustration caused by cultural differences, **focus your attention on the axes that lie furthest apart.** By following the strategies presented in this book, you can prevent misunderstandings from forming and/or address the issues that have already begun.

(Shortform note: Meyer uses the visual of the “culture map” to help the reader combine these scales. While visual learners may find this helpful, it’s not necessary, and may be visually confusing, to draw a line connecting all the axes. It’s sufficient to look at each of the eight axes independently to evaluate which need the most attention.)

### General Principles for Working Effectively Across Cultures

**You must first understand your own culture.**

Meyer argues that the first step to becoming an effective cross-cultural businessperson is to understand how your culture works and how it differs from other cultures.

Why? We tend to assume that everybody works the way that we do because our way is the ‘normal’ way. It’s only when we first understand how our culture is unique in some capacity that we become more able to appreciate and work with the differences in other cultures.

(Shortform note: Meyer focuses exclusively on national cultures, so in this strategy, she’s referring to understanding only how your country’s culture has affected your work. But this finding is also true for other kinds of cultures that we may be parts of. In addition to understanding our national culture, looking at what other kinds of cultures—our gender and generation, for example—have influenced us is also an essential business skill.)

**Be wary of lumping cultures together for the wrong reasons.**

Many of us assume that cultures that are geographically close to each other must be similar. Sometimes, this is true—Japan and South Korea are both high-context cultures. But we’ve seen several examples throughout this summary that don’t fit that pattern. For example, France and Germany share a border. However, France is a higher-context culture, while Germany favors low-context communication.

As such, Meyer reminds us that **geographical proximity is not necessarily an indication of cultural similarity.** Be wary of acting the same way in different places just because they're close to each other.

(Shortform note: Why might cultures that are near each other share similar features? We’ve seen throughout the summary that sometimes, it’s because they have a shared history—like they were both part of the Roman Empire. Another reason may be that they have similar landscapes. The academic discipline of cultural geography is based on the idea that landscapes and cultures have a circular relationship: A country’s landscape influences the culture that develops there, and this culture influences the landscape in turn.)

Meyer also cautions against lumping cultures together because they’re similar in one respect.

For example, Australia and Spain have similar attitudes towards feedback and fall in the middle of the feedback spectrum. As such, you might be tempted to assume that they also have similar attitudes about communication. This is not the case. Australia is one of the lowest context countries in the world, but Spain falls in the middle of the communication spectrum as well. So if you communicate to a Spaniard just as you would to an Australian, you might offend the Spaniard.

So, Meyer states, it's important to **consider each spectrum individually. Don’t create relationships between countries where there are none.**

(Shortform note: Remember, too, that just because cultures are similar in one spectrum doesn’t mean the same behavior will be tolerated in both. One example is communication: High-context cultures both send unspoken messages, but the same words can have dramatically different meanings if the cultures’ histories and social norms differ dramatically. Another is scheduling: If you assume that since being five minutes late in one monochronic culture is no big deal, you can be five minutes late in all of them, you’re in for a surprise.)

**Be patient and flexible.**

Adjusting your behavior to others’ cues, especially when you don’t always understand them, requires patience and adaptability. But when you can utilize these skills effectively, you will be a powerful asset to any organization. (Shortform note: Struggling to become more patient? Practice by waiting for things you’re excited about. The more you wait, the more patient you’ll become.)

**Remember that, while culture is an essential piece of the puzzle, it is only a piece.**

Our personalities aren’t defined exclusively by culture, but we are all heavily influenced by the cultures we grew up in. So in an increasingly globalized world, **the** **ability to discern between individual quirks and evidence of a cultural pattern is an essential leadership skill.**

This is nothing new: Leaders have always needed to separate generally accepted ideas about human behavior from the reality of the individuals in front of them. What's new is the increasing likelihood that we will encounter people in the workplace with cultures vastly different from our own.

While this can be greatly challenging, it can also be greatly rewarding, as you learn new practices and ways of thinking that enrich your life.

(Shortform note: If culture is just another piece of the puzzle, it follows that learning to become a better leader in general can also improve your effectiveness at managing people across cultures. But as we’ve seen, effective business leadership differs among cultures, so following traditional Western business advice may backfire. We’ve previously suggested reading business/leadership books from the country you’ll be working with. But for more generally applicable leadership advice, consider reading Sun Tzu’s _The Art of War_. Since the original text is geared towards military conflict in Asia, you may find it easier to interpret these strategies to fit an intercultural context than you would a regular business book.)

### General Strategies for Managing Cross-Cultural Teams

Throughout her book, Meyer presents several strategies both managers and non-managers can use when working with cultures unfamiliar to them. However, in her epilogue, Meyer focuses mostly on strategies managers can use when their teams need to work with different cultures or consist of people from different cultures.

In this section, we’ll present the key strategies Meyer recommends when creating and leading cross-cultural teams.

#### Strategies for Creating Cross-Cultural Teams

**Determine whether diversity is necessary.**

While diversity is great for collaboration and innovation, a team that needs to deliver a product efficiently may be better with members who understand each other's cultures easily. Meyer urges you to seriously consider whether a diverse group is necessary for your needs, since diversity necessarily invites conflict.

(Shortform note: You might also consider the nature of your project. Cultures differ in their attitudes towards technology and how it should be involved in their environment: Control cultures view technology as a positive tool to control their environment, subjugation cultures are wary of technology and generally prefer their current, natural environment, and harmonization cultures strive for some form of balance between the two. So if you’re working on a project that involves controlling the environment with technology, you might resist hiring diversely.)

**Find or become a cultural bridge.**

People on your team who have experience working or living multiculturally can help people who are new to working outside their culture—especially if you train them well. Alternately, with the knowledge you’ve learned from this book as well as your own experiences, you too can become a bridge and help your team members gain the understanding necessary to work effectively with cultures.

(Shortform note: Meyer doesn’t specify how to train your cultural bridge. But if they’re multicultural, one place you can start is by having them evaluate where each culture they’re familiar with is on each spectrum, then deciding where their personal views fall. Having a crystal-clear view of which culture influences which aspects of their work personalities will help them identify which aspects to amplify or alter when dealing with each culture.)

Meyer also suggests potentially limiting cross-cultural contact to only the bridges on your team. If you only need to communicate with different cultures occasionally, having just a few people do so reduces the chances of miscommunication.

(Shortform note: Use this strategy with caution. For example, if you’re working with a hierarchical culture, you may offend your foreign business partners by having a lower-ranking bridge communicate with them.In this case, use the bridge as an in-house cultural consultant instead.)

**Consider the makeup of your team strategically.**

If you control the makeup of your team, try to limit the number of cultures on the team. Fewer cultures means fewer opportunities for clashing. (Shortform note: On the one hand, consider selecting cultures that complement the skills you need on your team. If you need to make many decisions quickly, you might tend towards hiring people who decide individually. On the other hand, remember that there are many benefits of creating a diverse team, and the pros may outweigh the cons.)

That said, be careful of having large groups of the same culture represented on a multicultural team. This can result in cultural cliques and sow discord. Meyer even suggests rotating people through different work locations, if applicable, to avoid cultural cliques. (Shortform note: If you can’t rotate work locations, assigning seats at meetings is a simpler way to enforce physical separation and a commonly recommended method for combating workplace cliques.)

#### Strategies for Leading Cross-Cultural Teams

**Talk about your differences.**

According to Meyer, when people understand that their culture influences how they work, they become better at working with people from different cultures. Presumably, this is because it externalizes what others perceive as their faults, so they take criticism less personally and become more open to adapting. To kickstart this conversation, Meyer suggests having a casual team meeting or dinner where you discuss what you’ve learned in this book. You can also ask your team to read a few chapters.

She then recommends asking discussion questions like: How do you think our different cultures affect our teamwork? How can we use our understanding of our differences to improve our teamwork?

For this to be most effective, Meyer recommends grace, humility, and humor. Laugh at your own culture, praise the other, and speak from a place of learning instead of judgment. You want your team members to feel comfortable speaking honestly.

And don’t fret so much if your team doesn’t come to a conclusion. What matters is that you’ve opened the door to this conversation.

> **How to Lead High-Stakes Conversations**
> 
> Does the idea of leading such a conversation intimidate you? That’s natural. Conversations about cultural differences are rife with opportunities for disagreement, and they can get extremely emotional if people get defensive. _Crucial Conversations _suggests several strategies to use during exactly this type of high-stakes emotional conversation. For example, try clarifying exactly why you’re having this conversation at the meeting and why it’s mutually beneficial for all of you. Explaining that it’s not a scolding but an opportunity for mutual collaboration will help your team feel safe and pave the way for a productive conversation—especially if you have people from hierarchical cultures on your team.

**Create the right processes.**

Just as organizational culture can sometimes supersede national culture, so too can team culture supersede national culture. (Shortform note: If you feel uncomfortable messaging this to your team, emphasize that no cultural trait is inherently “bad.” It just may not be appropriate to meet your team’s specific needs. We saw this with Korean Air. By switching their in-air language to English, a low-context organizational culture superseded the high-context national culture, and resulted in a drastic improvement in Korean Air’s safety record. While English isn’t inherently better than Korean, it was the more appropriate language for Korean Air’s purpose.)

You can use this to your advantage by creating processes that work with your team. Refer to the strategies suggested in Chapter 1 regarding communication and Chapter 5 regarding decision-making.

The best time to try this is when your team first starts working together and before cultural clashes are allowed to simmer underneath the surface. But the second best time is now.

(Shortform note: _Atomic Habits_ explains that habits are triggered by various environmental cues. That may be why it’s best to develop the right processes when you first start working together. If you haven’t had a chance to associate your normal habits with new environmental cues yet, it might be easier to associate new patterns of behavior with those cues.)

Not all cultural differences, it seems, are surmountable with the correct processes. In her chapter on reasoning, for example, Meyer suggests that team members read the relevant chapter of her book and then adapt the best way they can—but she doesn’t specifically discuss developing persuasion processes. Why not? Perhaps because this would involve changing the way you think and logic—a daunting and nearly impossible task.

But when you can, such as with scheduling or decision-making, creating the right processes is a good way to limit the cultural clashes on your team.

**Assign tasks based on cultural strengths.**

Understanding how your employee’s cultural background influences their work can not only improve how your team works, but it can also be beneficial in other ways.

Meyer recommends assigning tasks and projects based on an employee’s cultural strengths. For example, if you have a client who highly values a personal relationship but you consider it a bit of a burden, assigning someone from a personal trust culture to that client may help both your client, yourself, and your employee.

(Shortform note: Meyer doesn’t mention that it’s generally considered unacceptable to make someone do something just because of their cultural background. Consider a compromise instead. Explain the situation to the employee in question, and ask how they’d feel about working with that client. In the situation above, if your employee happens to be introverted, they might opt out. And now you’ve learned more about how your employee’s personal traits interplay with their cultural background.)
