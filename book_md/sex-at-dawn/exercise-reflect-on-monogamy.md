## Exercise: Reflect on Monogamy

Ryan and Jethá believe that monogamy isn’t “natural” and may not be the best approach for every relationship. Take a moment to reflect on your feelings about monogamy.

* * *

Growing up, what kinds of relationships were modeled to you? Did you see any examples of consensual non-monogamy?

How did the evidence in this guide impact your views on monogamy? Were you surprised by anything you read?

Would you be willing to consider ethical non-monogamy in your current or future relationship? Why or why not?
