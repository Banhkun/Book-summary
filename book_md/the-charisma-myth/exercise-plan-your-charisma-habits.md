## Exercise: Plan Your Charisma Habits

Cabane argues that anyone can learn to be charismatic by putting in the time and effort to practice specific habits. Get specific about the habits you want to create.

* * *

Evaluate your current conversational skills according to the components of charisma: mindfulness, authority, and goodwill. (For example, is it easy for you to stay mindful in conversation, or are you easily distracted? Are you confident and authoritative around others, or more shy and insecure? Do people find you friendly and approachable, or more distant and aloof?)

Based on your above evaluation, identify the area of your charisma that needs the most improvement. Then, note down three of Cabane’s strategies that are the most relevant to you. (For example, if you’re low on authority, consider reframing negative thoughts or using expansive, confident posture.)

To build charismatic habits, you need to identify specific “cues” that can trigger these strategies. Like Pavlov’s bell, what can serve as a reminder for you to practice Cabane’s advice? Write down a potential “cue” for each of your three strategies. (For example, if you want to make confident posture a habit, plan to straighten up every time you walk into a new room.)
