## Exercise: Generate Valuable Ideas

DeMarco suggests that you can get into the mindset of an active producer by considering ways to improve the value of products and services that you use.

* * *

Think of one product or service that you spend your money on. What value does it offer? What problem does it solve? (For example, you might spend your money on software that helps you to manage your taxes.)

Why do you choose this product or service over what other competitors offer? (For example, you might choose it because it’s the cheapest or most accessible option.)

What additional features would this product benefit from? What would make it more convenient to use? (For example, your tax software might benefit from an auto-save feature so that you don’t have to manually input your personal details every time you use it.)

What skills, knowledge, or assets could you apply to create an improved version of this product or service? (For example, you may have the funds to hire a software designer to help create your own version of this software.)
