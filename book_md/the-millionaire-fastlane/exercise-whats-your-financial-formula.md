## Exercise: What’s Your Financial Formula?

DeMarco argues that all financial strategies fall into one of three formulas—Insatiable Consumption, Hopeful Accumulation, and Active Production. This exercise will help you clarify what formula you’re currently using.

* * *

According to DeMarco, there are two possible motivations that explain why you want money: the desire to look rich and the determination to create and enjoy wealth. What motivates you to earn money and why?

Consider your spending habits, any debts you owe, and any savings or investment accounts you hold. Are you spending more than you earn, saving most of your income, or investing money into businesses and assets to generate an income? Why do you choose to manage your finances in this way?

DeMarco argues that _how_ you use your time to earn income impacts your ability to achieve your financial goals. What's the current relationship between time and your income? For instance, do you earn a set wage based on the number of hours you work, or do you spend just a small amount of time working on projects that create commission or passive income? Detail all of the ways in which you earn an income and the role of time in each.

Consider your answers to the previous questions—what financial formula are you following? Write down any thoughts or feelings you have about DeMarco’s assessment of this formula.
