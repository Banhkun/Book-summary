## 1-Page Summary

Writing in the 1990s, venture capitalist James Davidson and banker and journalist William Rees-Mogg predicted that the first quarter of the 21st century would bring sweeping changes to the global economy and the very structure of human civilization. In _The Sovereign Individual_ , they explain both their predictions and the rationale behind them. One of their most significant predictions is that **nations will fragment into millions of city-states and even individual estates with sovereign-nation status**. The owners of these sovereign estates are the “sovereign individuals” from whom the book draws its title.

(Shortform note: The word “sovereign” in this context means “having governmental authority,” such as the power to make or enforce laws, levy taxes, fight wars, and make treaties with other sovereign states or entities.)

Davidson and Rees-Mogg base their predictions on what they call “megapolitics,” the theory that forms of government and economies are dictated mostly by circumstances, such as climate and the resources that are available. In this case, they argue that **information technology is rapidly making new resources available to people in ways that will inevitably change how they relate to each other politically and economically**.

In this guide, we’ll first consider the authors’ explanation of megapolitics. Then we’ll look at their assumptions and predictions about the technological resources that would become available after the turn of the 21st century. That will put us in a position to understand and discuss their predictions for the future, particularly the rise of sovereign individuals. Given that we’re writing this guide at about the time Davidson and Rees-Mogg expected most of their predictions to be realized, we’ll also take stock of how close their predictions are to being fulfilled. And we’ll provide additional context and insight from books like, _Predictably Irrational_ , _The 33 Strategies of War_ , and _The Bitcoin Standard_.

### Megapolitics: How The Economics of Force Shape Civilization

Davidson and Rees-Mogg contend that civilizations throughout history have been shaped mostly by their circumstances, including environmental factors like climate and technological developments that create new ways of doing things. Thus, **if you can understand how circumstances are changing, you can predict how society will change**. This is the basis of their predictions for the rise of sovereign individuals and other changes in the 21st century.

According to Davidson and Rees-Mogg, **the circumstances that dictate how people can make the most money impact society the mos** t. This is because most people tend to do whatever they think will enable them to accumulate the most wealth. So if circumstances change, creating a new way of earning money or changing which businesses are most profitable, society will change too, as people adapt their behavior to increase their wealth.

**Circumstances that affect the armed forces (such as weapons technology) are also highly significant in shaping society**. And factors that affect the armed forces also affect wealth, because armed forces are used either to protect wealth or to obtain it by force. In the authors’ view, taking wealth by force includes taxation, as well as armed robbery, protection rackets, extortion, and so on.

(Shortform note: In _The 33 Strategies of War_ , Robert Greene takes this concept a step further, arguing that _anything_ someone else does to coerce or manipulate you is, philosophically, an act of war—whether it’s the government compelling you to pay taxes, a salesman trying to manipulate you into making a purchase that benefits him more than you, or something else. Based on this premise, he explains how you can adapt military strategies for use in business or everyday life.)

Thus, if military technology and other relevant circumstances give large armies a decisive advantage over smaller forces, then civilizations will tend to coalesce into large nations that can field large armies. Similarly, if large businesses are more profitable because technology and circumstances dictate large economies of scale, then big businesses will become the norm as they out-compete smaller businesses. This was the case during the industrial age, which Davidson and Rees-Mogg identify as the period from 1500 to 2000 AD.

But if different technology or different circumstances make small businesses more profitable than larger ones, then big businesses will tend to fail or fragment while small ones take over the market. Similarly, if small armed bands can contend effectively with larger forces that take more resources to maintain, then sovereign states will tend to be small. Large nations, if they exist at all, will be more like loose coalitions of smaller sovereign entities. The authors contend that this was the case during the medieval period (which they identify as 1000 to 1500 AD).

They also believe that **new and soon-to-be-available technologies are changing circumstances to favor smaller entities again—both economically and militarily**. This is why they expect that many nations will fragment into smaller sovereignties in the 21st century.

> **Predicting Irrational Behavior**
> 
> In _Predictably Irrational_ , psychology professor Dan Ariely argues that many models of human behavior and civilization are flawed because they assume that humans will make rational choices as they seek to better themselves. Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s theory of megapolitics arguably makes this assumption. Ariely contends that actually, humans tend to make _irrational_ choices, and these irrational choices follow predictable patterns.
> 
> But while Ariely’s perspective contrasts with Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s on how rationally humans will seek to better themselves, it corroborates the idea that humans respond _predictably_ to circumstances. It also provides a mechanism to explain why societies often take longer to respond to changing circumstances than you might expect.
> 
> For example, suppose a new technology undermines economies of scale by making it possible for an individual to produce a product one unit at a time for the same unit cost as a large factory, and with lower overhead. A perfectly rational company would adopt the new technology and dissolve its large factories to reduce overhead costs and thereby increase profits. However, many companies will respond in a predictably irrational way—because of the “endowment effect” that Ariely describes, people tend to overvalue what they already have—in this case, expensive factories. Thus, in practice, many manufacturers would miss the window of opportunity, only to be out-competed in the long run by small startups who adopted the new technology.
> 
> Or suppose new communications technology enables armed forces to coordinate their activities better, increasing the advantage of larger armies over smaller ones. This makes it rational for small districts to merge or form military alliances with each other. But as leaders consider their options, Ariely explains that they will feel pressure to make decisions more on how these decisions will be perceived than how much benefit they will actually provide—again, a predictably irrational response.
> 
> Perhaps they refuse some of the alliances that would have been most beneficial because of cultural biases or because they feel the need to preserve their national identity. This won’t negate the advantages of large army size that the new technology confers, and so, in the long run, civilizations will still tend to coalesce by merger, alliance, or conquest. But it will make the transition slower—and potentially more violent.
> 
> As we’ll discuss more later, Davidson and Rees-Mogg anticipate that the coming geopolitical changes will be accompanied by a lot of violence. And many of Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s predictions seem to be taking longer to come true than they predicted. Ariely’s insights into humans’ predictably irrational behavior help to explain the delay and provide additional reasons to expect that major changes may take place violently instead of smoothly.

### Technological Assumptions

Now that we’ve covered the basics of how circumstances and technological developments shape societies, we’ll take a look at the specific technologies Davidson and Rees-Mogg expect will transform society in the 21st century. Writing in the 1990s, they expected all these developments to take place by 2025.

#### The Virtual Economy

Davidson and Rees-Mogg predicted that commerce and financial assets would increasingly migrate from localized physical economies into the online virtual economy. Furthermore, **the online economy would be largely beyond governments’ ability to tax or otherwise regulate** , for three reasons.

First, assets and businesses that exist in cyberspace aren’t tied to any particular location. This means that no nation really has jurisdiction over them, because governments (as we know them) exercise authority over areas with well-defined geographical boundaries. If you’re running a business that’s all online, and the government tries to interfere with your business, you can just move to a different jurisdiction where they won’t bother you.

Second, the authors expect that encryption technology will make online transactions completely private—no one except the parties involved in the transaction would know who did business with whom or how much money changed hands. This would make reporting your income from online transactions strictly voluntary, since there’s no way the government can find out about it unless you tell them.

Third, **Davidson and Rees-Mogg expect that online transactions will increasingly be conducted with digital currencies** , rather than fiat currencies that are controlled by national governments. They envision these digital currencies as encrypted receipts for gold or other commodities with stable value. They would be issued by a new breed of banks whose business is all online and whose infrastructure is distributed across many locations in many different countries. Again, this would put them largely beyond the reach of tax authorities or other government regulators, because if any one of their locations was threatened with regulation, they would simply close it.

Collectively, **these changes will give small, mobile businesses and individuals a competitive edge over large companies** that are heavily invested in physical infrastructure. This is because their immobile infrastructure makes them vulnerable to taxation and other regulations that online-only businesses can easily avoid.

> **Progress Check: The Virtual Economy**
> 
> Some of the authors’ predictions have proven correct, but others have not yet come to pass.
> 
> Consistent with Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s prediction, it has indeed become practical to run some businesses online without a physical office. For example, a YouTube channel can be a profitable business that you can run while traveling the world, or from anywhere with an internet connection. Other media companies and software companies can also be organized online, with workers telecommuting and no physical office.
> 
> However, _most_ businesses still remain tied to a physical location, with physical assets such as factories or warehouses that are difficult to move, and thus are subject to a particular government’s oversight. One metric illustrating this is that only about 15% of retail business is done online in the US, and this fraction has remained constant since 2020.
> 
> Contrary to Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s predictions, the rise of e-commerce has made transactions _less_ private, rather than more private. In principle, encryption technology could now facilitate private communications and transactions over the internet, as the authors predicted. However, in practice, most payments are processed by credit card companies, which track every transaction and make a significant portion of their revenue by selling transaction data to companies that use it for targeted marketing. Arguably, the authors’ prediction that encryption would make tax reporting optional could have come true if tax evasion had proved more lucrative than targeted marketing, instead of the other way around.
> 
> The authors’ prediction that digital currencies would replace fiat currencies proved only partially correct. In the late 1990s, Paypal’s original vision was to do just that—create a digital currency that could replace the US dollar in online transactions. But they found it easier to start by facilitating online payments in US dollars, and other payment processors like Square and Stripe followed suit. With the rapid growth of online payment processors that dealt in fiat currencies, developing digital currencies became less important.
> 
> Digital currencies such as Bitcoin have since been developed, but they have not yet displaced fiat currencies on a large scale, as the authors anticipated. And it remains to be seen if they ever will. A few countries, such as El Salvadore and the Central African Republic, have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. However, others, such as China and Egypt, have prohibited their people from using cryptocurrencies.

#### Computerized Warfare

Davidson and Rees-Mogg also predict that **military operations will increasingly take place in cyberspace**. There are two dimensions to online warfare: First, as valuable businesses and financial assets migrate from the physical world to the online economy, they present a target for hackers—the soldiers and warlords of cyberspace.

Second, as physical infrastructure becomes increasingly computerized, it, too, becomes vulnerable to hackers. Instead of torpedoing a battleship, you could hack into its computerized control systems and shut it down, or even make it self-destruct.

The transition from physical war to cyberwar will diminish the significance of army size in deciding the outcome of wars. This tends to favor smaller nations, or at least removes the military advantage that larger countries have had.

> **Progress Check: Computerized Warfare**
> 
> Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s predictions about the _technology_ of cyber warfare have proven quite accurate. Perhaps the best example of a cyberweapon deployed since they made their predictions is the “Stuxnet” virus, which disabled about a thousand uranium enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran in 2009. The attack was likely an attempt to cripple Iran’s nuclear program, thereby preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. However, no one has publically assumed responsibility for the attack, and the exact origin of Stuxnet remains unknown.
> 
> However, despite the demonstrated capabilities of cyberweapons like Stuxnet, computerized warfare has not displaced conventional warfare to the extent that Davidson and Rees-Mogg predicted. There could be multiple reasons for this.
> 
> First, as we noted above, the cyber economy has not yet displaced the physical economy to quite the extent they anticipated, and so cyberspace is not yet valuable enough to become the _primary_ battleground for military conflicts.
> 
> Second, it may be that coding advanced cyberweapons is more difficult and labor-intensive than the authors expected. If that’s the case, then they don’t level the military playing field as much for small players, and so the small players have less incentive to develop them. However, as AI increasingly becomes a force multiplier for programmers, perhaps advanced cyberweapons will soon become available to people with more limited resources, just as Davidson and Rees-Mogg predicted.

#### High-Powered Virtual Assistants

Finally, Davidson and Rees-Mogg expect that **virtual assistants (bots, algorithms, and AIs) will replace many professional workers, such as lawyers, doctors, and administrative assistants**. These virtual assistants will greatly increase your individual capacity for getting things done because they will work tirelessly on your behalf without wages or living expenses and with unswerving loyalty.

They could also be weaponized as a deterrent to people who might wish to harm you or take your wealth: If you have an army of virtual detectives and virtual hackers that are programmed to perform investigations on your behalf and launch a cyberwar against anyone they find to have wronged you, that gives people an incentive not to wrong you. And your virtual assistants will continue to function after your death, so if someone murdered you, your AI would avenge your death. Again, this knowledge will act as a deterrent to would-be murderers.

By acting as force multipliers, **AI virtual assistants will enable individuals and small, efficient organizations to do as much work as larger, less-efficient organizations**. This will give small businesses higher profit margins than large corporations. For that matter, it will also make small, efficient security forces a match for large national armies.

> **Progress Check: Virtual Assistants**
> 
> Artificial intelligence and related algorithms have advanced a lot since Davidson and Rees-Mogg made their predictions in the 1990s, but as of 2023, they haven’t reached the level that the authors predicted they’d attain. While AI tools are beginning to extend information workers’ productivity in much the way that Davidson and Rees-Mogg predicted, they’re still a _limited_ force multiplier because they only solve specific problems and require very specific instructions.
> 
> As Peter Thiel explains in _Zero to One_ , the main reason for this is that computers only excel at certain things, like crunching numbers. But while computers outperform humans at numerical calculations, humans have a decided advantage over computers at things like object recognition and value judgments. He argues that programmers have wasted a lot of time trying to make computers mimic human behavior, instead of focusing on applications that computers are better suited for.
> 
> Some of the behavior that Davidson and Rees-Mogg expected from virtual assistants is easy for humans but hard for computers. For example, tasks like conducting a criminal investigation or designing a marketing campaign involve a lot of data collection and prediction (which AI is good at) but also some judgment calls, which AI can’t make very well.

### Predicted Changes

Davidson and Rees-Mogg believe that the technological developments we just discussed will have a profound impact on social structures in the 21st century. As circumstances change to favor small, efficient organizations over large ones, both economically and militarily, they expect nation-states and national governments to decline and ultimately disappear. **Nations will be replaced by millions of city-states and sovereign individuals**. During the transition, they also anticipate a general increase in crime and violence throughout the world. We’ll break down the reasoning behind each of these predictions in turn.

#### The Decline of Nations

After the end of the medieval era, feudal monarchs disappeared because new technology gave nation-states an economic and military advantage over them. Davidson and Rees-Mogg assert that nation-states will soon disappear in the same way, and for the same reasons, as new **technology renders them economically unsustainable and makes their military power irrelevant**.

##### Economic Insolvency

We’ve already discussed how Davidson and Rees-Mogg expect economic activity to migrate from local and national markets that governments can tax and regulate to encrypted online markets that are beyond government control. If this migration makes paying taxes largely voluntary, **most national governments stand to lose their largest source of income**.

This is a serious problem because, as Davidson and Rees-Mogg point out, most national governments are already deeply in debt. They attribute government debt largely to the welfare-state mentality, whereby the government is expected to levy disproportionately high taxes on the rich, distribute some of the money taken from the rich to the poor, and fund extensive public works. The cost of welfare projects already exceeds tax revenues, forcing governments to endlessly borrow money.

And the situation is only going to get worse for welfare states. Not only will the online economy allow people—especially wealthy people, who pay most of the taxes in developed countries—to avoid paying taxes, but **the authors also expect the income gap between rich and poor to increase significantly in most countries**.

> **The Role of Bitcoin in the Decline of Nation-States**
> 
> Given that Davidson and Rees-Mogg attribute much of the prospective decline of nation-states to economic insolvency, the ongoing prevalence of fiat currency is probably one of the major reasons that nation-states have not yet dissolved.
> 
> As Stephanie Kelton explains in _The Deficit Myth,_ governments that issue their own currency face negligible consequences from running a deficit. This is because a nation that issues its own fiat currency (currency whose value isn’t pegged to another nation’s currency or a commodity like gold) can never run out of money. A nation can always create more money to fund its programs or pay its debts (as long as it doesn’t issue so much money so quickly that it triggers runaway inflation). This allows welfare states to fund almost unlimited programs.
> 
> As long as nation-states control the money supply, they can remain in control of their own economies, and their sovereignty remains difficult to challenge. Davidson and Rees-Mogg implicitly acknowledged this but predicted that proprietary digital currencies would replace national fiat currencies. This hasn’t happened yet, partly because of technical limitations on transaction volume or speed and partly because cryptocurrencies have not yet established the same level of credibility or acceptance as fiat currencies like the US dollar have.
> 
> The credibility issue stems mostly from the fact that when private companies such as banks or crypto companies issue their own currency, they often issue more of it than they can back with gold or other commodities. This leads to devaluation of their proprietary currency when the discrepancy is discovered, fostering distrust.
> 
> However, as Saifedean Ammous points out in _The Bitcoin Standard_ , Bitcoin is one digital currency that is truly decentralized. There is no company, government, or other entity that can alter the global supply of bitcoins or even reverse a bitcoin transaction that has taken place. So, at least in theory, Bitcoin solves the credibility concern. Ammous recommends that Bitcoin be adopted as a global reserve currency (a standard to which all other currencies are pegged). He argues that this would curtail wasteful and counterproductive government spending by eliminating fiat currencies. If Bitcoin is ever adopted as a global reserve currency, as Ammous recommends, that would be a significant milestone in the transformation that Davidson and Rees-Mogg predict.

The reason for increasing income inequality is that virtual assistants will enable a smaller number of highly skilled people to do a much larger fraction of the work. **As conditions increasingly favor small, efficient companies, there will be a push to increase efficiency throughout the economy**. This will result in elimination of many bureaucratic or otherwise unproductive positions, and compensation will increasingly be based on output, rather than hours worked. Jobs where you get paid just for showing up will disappear. As such, exceptionally **productive people will see their incomes rise, while everyone else sees a loss of income**.

So the rich will get richer, the poor will get poorer, and **a larger fraction of the population will be poor**. This will make welfare programs increasingly infeasible, as the number of eligible recipients skyrockets while most of the funding disappears. And governments won’t even be able to soften the blow by printing more money and inflating their currency, because fiat currencies will become worthless as the online economy switches over to private digital currencies.

> **Unproductive Jobs**
> 
> Analysts have expressed varying perspectives on the subject of unproductive jobs. As we’ve discussed, Davidson and Rees-Mogg believe that many jobs are unproductive, and they attribute this to economies of scale giving big businesses and big governments the advantage. They argue that larger size inevitably reduces efficiency and increases bureaucracy to some extent, and welfare states make the problem worse with frivolous programs that create frivolous jobs.
> 
> In _Bullshit Jobs_ , David Graeber agrees industrialized nations are full of unproductive jobs, but cites automation as one of the root causes: Because industrial automation allows fewer workers to do more work, there simply isn’t enough productive work to keep everyone busy. If Graeber is right, virtual assistants would only make the problem worse. If it only takes a few people to do all the world’s work, then most people will end up being unproductive.
> 
> That said, Graeber also echoes Davidson and Rees-Mogg’s assertion that welfare states are the worst offenders when it comes to creating frivolous jobs. And the future of unproductive positions is probably linked to the future of welfare states: If the state remains strong as AI enables fewer people to do _all_ the work, then unproductive jobs may become even more common, as Graeber would predict. But if nation-states collapse as Davidson and Rees-Mogg anticipate, then perhaps a handful of sovereign individuals will do _all_ the work, claim _all_ the income, and leave the unproductive masses to a rather grim future.

##### Military Obsolescence

As we noted earlier, Davidson and Rees-Mogg expect warfare to become increasingly computerized, which will diminish the significance of traditional military size and firepower. This, too, will contribute to the decline of nation-states, because a nation’s sovereignty is ultimately based on its ability to defend itself against other nations.

Today’s nations rely on standing armies and physical weapons for national defense. But the authors expect that **online communities and even highly skilled individuals (aided, of course, by their virtual assistants) will soon be capable of waging cyberwar** just as effectively as today’s most powerful nations.

> **Cyberwar as an Extension of Guerrilla Warfare**
> 
> To understand the implications of cyberwar in more detail, it’s worth cross-referencing books on military strategy. Cyberwar, as Davidson and Rees-Mogg describe it, could be the ultimate form of guerrilla warfare because hackers can attack from anywhere in the world without exposing themselves.
> 
> As Robert Greene explains in _The 33 Strategies of War_ , guerrilla warfare has always been a favorite way for smaller forces to defy large military powers. Armed guerrillas operate in small, mobile groups. They attack vulnerable positions or infrastructure suddenly, and then go back into hiding so that their more powerful opponent never has a clear target. Meanwhile, the larger force remains vulnerable, not only because it’s more visible but because it takes a lot of infrastructure and supplies to sustain a large force, creating many targets for the guerrillas.
> 
> If weaponized AI advanced to the point that hackers could disable and destroy armament and supporting infrastructure at will, then traditional war machines would become little more than an expensive liability.

#### The Rise of Micro-Sovereignties

The authors contend that **as nation-states decline in the 21st century, millions of micro-sovereignties will rise to take their place**. These could be city-states, or even individual estates where a wealthy person gets to decide what laws apply on her own property.

These small communities of high-productivity individuals will be much more economically efficient than today’s welfare states. And as conventional warfare is replaced with cyberwar, they will be just as capable of asserting and defending themselves as today’s sovereign nations.

That said, Davidson and Rees-Mogg expect that most micro-sovereignties will be formed by mutual agreement on terms of secession, rather than by revolution and military force. As national governments become increasingly bankrupt and incomes become increasingly difficult to tax, the option of selling or leasing sovereignty to individuals or other entities will become increasingly attractive. Eventually, **today's national governments will sell off or lease out practically all of the territory over which they currently exercise sovereign control**.

The authors explain that once this has taken place, there will be at least three types of micro-sovereignties.

> **Fulfilling the Social Contract with Micro-Sovereignties**
> 
> _The Social Contract_ proposed by Swiss political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 1700s provides some additional perspective on why a state might fragment into micro-sovereignties. Rousseau argued that the only ethically justifiable government was one formed by a “social contract,” a mutual agreement of individuals to join together and form a society for their common good. In Rousseau’s view, a state exists for the good of _all_ its citizens, so a government that works for the good of _some_ (even the majority) of its citizens but to the detriment of others is not a legitimate government. He also contends that _every_ state eventually reaches this point, causing governmental collapse and subsequent formation of new social contracts.
> 
> When Davidson and Rees-Mogg claim that some individuals would find it beneficial to purchase sovereign control of their own lands from the national government, they imply that national governments are no longer working for the good of _all_ their citizens. Instead, modern welfare states work to benefit some of their people at the expense of others—particularly the wealthy, who pay a disproportionate share of the taxes. Thus, based on Rousseau’s analysis, they have already lost their legitimacy. As these illegitimate states die, communities with mutual interests will form new social contracts, creating new states. And if some individuals choose _not_ to enter into any new social contract because they have enough resources to be completely autonomous, they would become sovereign individuals.

##### Competitive City-States

**Many micro-sovereignties will be city-states or regional governments that compete for citizens the way businesses compete for customers**. Basically, they will be service providers that provide the kind of infrastructure and protective services currently provided by governments. Each micro-sovereignty will probably cater to a unique set of preferences to differentiate itself from its competitors. For example, one might advertise itself as a drug-free zone with strict regulations on pharmaceuticals, while another advertises itself as a drug freedom zone with no restrictions on pharmaceutical chemicals or recreational drug use.

(Shortform note: Davidson and Rees-Mogg may have derived their idea that competitive city-states would choose to specialize in unique services or benefits from the economic principle of market “positioning.” In theory, every unique market sector where free-market competition operates will eventually establish a clear market leader, so it’s advantageous to differentiate your product enough that you can position it as the leading product in a unique market sector. Positioning has traditionally applied mostly to private companies, but Davidson and Rees-Mogg expect that it will increasingly become relevant to nations as well.)

**Most of them will probably charge their residents a flat annual fee rather than trying to tax incomes,** for two reasons: First, flat rates will be more competitive, because residents will compare the cost and benefits of living in different micro-sovereignties and choose the ones that offer the best value. Second, as we’ve discussed, encryption technology will make it virtually impossible for governments to keep track of individuals’ incomes anyway.

(Shortform note: If tomorrow’s city-states have to compete for citizens the way today’s companies compete for customers, that could give rise to a variety of creative taxation systems in addition to the flat-fee taxes that Davidson and Rees-Mogg foresee. This is because, as Larry Keeley and his coauthors explain in _Ten Types of Innovation_ , pricing structures and revenue streams are one of the 10 standard areas where companies can innovate to differentiate themselves from competitors. For example, perhaps some city-states would lease the right to monopolize sales of food or retail goods to generate income so they could operate without any tax revenue and attract more citizens.)

##### Sovereign Individuals

**Other micro-sovereignties will be individual estates of the wealthiest and most productive individuals**. As technology puts them in a position to defend themselves and their assets from crime and military aggression better than any government can, they will find it cheaper to assert their own sovereignty, rather than live by the terms of another sovereign entity and pay for protection through taxes. As such, they, too, will purchase or lease sovereign control of their own property.

> **What Will Sovereign Individual Estates Look Like?**
> 
> Though Davidson and Rees-Mogg spend a great deal of time explaining why they expect wealthy individuals of the future to gain personal sovereignty and the advantages it would afford, they don’t provide a very detailed picture of what day-to-day life would look like for a sovereign individual. We can infer that they either felt these details were too difficult to predict with certainty, or else didn’t mention them because life for wealthy individuals wouldn’t actually look much different after gaining sovereign status.
> 
> Many wealthy people already live in gated communities, so their geographic borders would be easy to establish and probably already protected by walls. It’s not unusual for utilities like electrical power lines to cross national borders, so sovereign individuals could potentially import most of their utilities. This would obviate the need to build their own infrastructure, and individuals would probably rely on the same utility companies they used before they gained sovereignty.
> 
> And if you’re a sovereign individual without other citizens living in your domain, you wouldn’t need law enforcement or judicial capabilities. So perhaps the difference between being a wealthy citizen and a sovereign individual would be little more than a change in billing structure: You lease sovereignty for a flat rate instead of paying income taxes, and maybe you pay your utility bills a little differently too.

##### Cyber-States

**Some online communities may exercise powers similar to those of a sovereign state without controlling any physical territory**. For example, they might make their own laws, offer judicial services to settle disputes between their members, and defend their members from other governments that might threaten them.

> **Are Platforms a Stepping Stone to Cyber-States?**
> 
> Although today’s tech giants make no claims of holding sovereign nation status, they arguably already bear some resemblance to the cyber-states that Davidson and Rees-Mogg describe. For example, platforms like YouTube already have community guidelines and terms of use that could be seen as cyber laws applicable to their users. They also have internal mechanisms for resolving disputes, such as copyright claims, which perform a function similar to courts.
> 
> Platforms enforce their rules and rulings through mechanisms like demonetization and deplatforming, which can be financially devastating to users who’ve built a business on the platform and depend on it for income. For example, Jason Ethier may have lost over half a million dollars of annual income when his YouTube channel was demonetized in February of 2020.
> 
> Most platforms also make it much easier to conduct business with other users on the platform than with people on other platforms, creating virtual borders and barriers to cross-platform that can have a similar effect to the restrictions countries impose on imports and exports. To address concerns that this gives large platforms an unfair advantage in the market, the EU recently passed a law requiring platforms to open up their borders, so to speak: They will be required to provide cross-platform functionality of certain services, ensuring fair market competition once the law takes effect. It remains to be seen if they will actually comply, as enabling cross-platform interoperability will be extremely expensive, both in terms of up-front development costs and lost profits.
> 
> Davidson and Mogg might predict that this conflict of interest between tech giants and EU regulators will create an escalating power struggle in which the big tech companies will eventually declare their platforms sovereign cyber states, obviating any obligation to comply with national laws.

#### Transitional Violence

Davidson and Rees-Mogg hope that the era of micro-sovereignties will ultimately be one of greater peace and individual freedom than the era of nation-states has been. As we’ve discussed, they also expect most micro-sovereignties to be born out of peaceful treaties rather than violent revolutions. But they warn that **during the period of transition from nation-states to micro-sovereignties, there will likely be an increase in crime, terrorism, and other acts of violence** throughout the world.

This is because one of the functions of government is to deter crime by providing law enforcement services. As national governments fall apart, law enforcement services will break down, removing this deterrent to crime.

Meanwhile, lack of funding will oblige welfare programs in welfare states to reduce or suspend benefits at a time when many people will see their real income decreasing. The authors expect low-skilled office workers to take the largest loss: Many of them hold positions that provide comfortable middle-class income, but they will be replaced by virtual assistants.

Some of these people may become desperate enough to turn to crime as an alternate source of income. Others may resent the social and technological developments that cost them their livelihood enough to engage in terrorism or violent protests.

And still other people will see the social and governmental transitions as something that must be resisted to preserve nations as a matter of principle. The authors assert that national identities are somewhat arbitrary, but are still an object of loyalty for many people. So **nationalist ideology will also drive opposition to change** , and some of the opposition will likely rise to the level of terrorism or paramilitary aggression.

> **Preparing for the Transition**
> 
> If Davidson and Rees-Mogg are right, there will be a period of time in the near future when criminal violence and terrorism become more common. At the same time, government services like welfare and law enforcement may not be unavailable. When that happens, what can you do if you’re not wealthy enough to have a robotic defense network that you can activate as you declare the sovereignty of your own compound?
> 
> You can prepare for a transitional period of elevated violence much like you would prepare for any natural or man-made disaster. Basically, the goal is to make your lifestyle as resilient as possible by making sure you have backup sources of everything you need. That way you can keep your options open if outbreaks of violence disrupt the services and infrastructure that you would normally rely on.
> 
> Specific needs for which you should consider backup options include food, water, medicine, commodities like toilet paper, sources of heat and electricity, means of communication and transportation, and security measures. Some of these, like food and medicine, you can easily stockpile, giving you reserves to draw from in an emergency. Others, like electricity and transportation, might require a little more investment or creativity to build in backup options. But there are still ways to address them, such as installing solar panels on your roof.
