## Exercise: Cultivate Successful Thoughts

Hill suggests that you can train your subconscious mind to work in alignment with your goals by habitually thinking successful thoughts. This exercise will walk you through his process for achieving this.

* * *

Your subconscious mind is more likely to create success if you adopt a positive attitude. Write down at least three things that inspire you to think positively.

Creating a vision of what you want to achieve gives your subconscious mind a clear direction to move toward. Write down a specific goal that would make you feel successful if you achieved it.

Affirming and visualizing yourself as already having achieved your goal convinces your subconscious mind that you’re capable of achieving it. Reflect on a specific skill or quality that you imagine your future successful self possessing and write at least one affirmation to support it.

Taking constructive actions to achieve your goal focuses your subconscious mind on exactly what you need to do to make progress. Consider how you might break your goal down into daily tasks and write down the first action you’ll take toward achieving it.

Working within a team to achieve your goal helps your subconscious mind access and leverage the knowledge and expertise of all your teammates. Consider the people you know and write down at least one person who could help you achieve your goal.
