## Identifying Deeper Beliefs

After the first session, you can begin building a cognitive conceptualization of the patient, linking the whole pathway of

  * Formative experiences 
  * To core beliefs 
  * To **intermediate rules, assumptions, and beliefs**
  * To coping strategies
  * To automatic thoughts and reactions



As you develop your understanding of this, share them merely as hypotheses. Avoid making the patient feel categorized or put in a box.

We’ll discuss investigating both intermediate beliefs and core beliefs.

### Identifying Intermediate Beliefs

**Given the same core belief, people may have different intermediate beliefs**.

  * Say two patients have the same core belief, “I’m not good enough to accomplish my goals.” One patient may have the intermediate belief, “I should work as hard as I can at all times.” Another patient may have a very different belief, “I should lower my goals so I don’t get disappointed.”
  * Why do different intermediate beliefs arise? This can be because of genetic predisposition or environmental cues early in life.



**How to identify intermediate beliefs:**

  * The patient may voice the belief, as an automatic thought or when directly asked about intermediate beliefs.
  * Provide the first part of an assumption, and the patient fills it in.
    * “If I don’t get an A, then ___.”
  * Spot patterns to automatic thoughts—an intermediate thought may drive many of these automatic thoughts.
  * Use the downward arrow technique: Ask what the automatic thought means to the person. (Asking what the thought means **about** the person tends to show the core belief.)
    * Example questions: “If that’s true, so what?” “What’s so bad about…” “What’s the worst part about…”
  * Use questionnaires like the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale or Personality Belief Questionnaire.



Keep probing until you cause a negative affect in the patient, or the patient repeats her answer. This is about as deep as you can go.

**Educate the patient about beliefs:**

  * Show the patient how beliefs are learned and can be changed.
    * Ask the patient to think about someone who has different beliefs. Clearly the other person learned different beliefs, and so they’re not absolute rules. Also, clearly the other person isn’t a failure (or whatever the extreme belief would lead the patient to believe about herself).
  * Examine the advantages and disadvantages of beliefs.
  * Ask if this is an idea the patient would like to change.



#### Modifying Intermediate Beliefs

In comparison to automatic thoughts, modifying intermediate beliefs may require more persuasion than just Socratic questioning. The key is to **clarify the dissonance of the patient’s beliefs** ; deeper beliefs may require more visceral and narrative depictions.

Here are a range of techniques to use to try to modify the student’s intermediate beliefs:

  * **Phrase the rule/belief as an if-then assumption** —this makes it easier to spot the logical fallacy.
    * “If I ask for help, I’ll be seen as weak.” vs “Don’t ask for help.”
  * Present more functional beliefs, that are more qualified versions of the old belief
    * “If I don’t get an A, I’m a failure.” can be turned into “If I don’t get an A, I’m just human, and I still tried hard. It’s better than 0%.”
  * Use Socratic questioning.
    * “Let’s say there are 2 people with the same problem. One does [the maladaptive behavior] and feels worse. The other does [a functional behavior] and feels better. Who’s the more competent person?”
  * Set up a behavior experiment.
    * Act “as if” the belief weren’t true. Then reflect on how that behavior makes the person feel.
  * Role play as the patient’s intellectual side and emotional side, with each of you taking a side and swapping turns. As the intellectual side, you explain the rational approach to the situation. As the emotional side, you convey the emotional reaction and automatic thoughts.
    * Explain the rationale to the patient that this will let you see what’s really maintaining the belief.
    * Be the intellectual side first, to give an example of rational reasoning for the patient. The patient will start as the emotional side.
    * After the role play, switch sides. The patient will voice the more functional intellectual thoughts. As you play the emotional side, use the patient’s own words—this will help highlight the dysfunction of the patient’s emotional thoughts.
  * Cognitive continuum—establish that the situation isn’t binary, and the patient is likely better on the scale than absolute zero.
    * Ask where she is on the scale. Then ask whether there is someone who is worse, and what that person would be doing. Keep drilling until it’s someone who’s at absolute zero. (For example, if the patient is worried she’s an academic failure, absolute zero may be someone who goes to zero classes. The patient can see that she’s better than this person.)
    * This technique is useful for patients with “all or nothing” cognitive distortions.
  * Ask the patient to imagine another person with a different belief. Then if the patient respects that other person, help her model that belief for herself.
  * Ask the patient to counsel someone else in her situation, such as:
    * Someone she knows who has the same issue
    * Imagining if their child had the issue
  * Self-disclosure—you’ve gone through a similar situation before and came up with a solution.



**After developing a new, healthier belief, assign homework for the patient to look for situations to practice the new belief and behavior.**

Don’t worry about extinguishing the bad behavior entirely. Reducing the belief level to 30% or below is usually sufficient.

### Identifying Core Beliefs

Core beliefs are the central beliefs that people hold about themselves and the world. They are often formed at an early age. As with intermediate beliefs and automatic thoughts, they can be both positive and negative.

In mood disorders, negative core beliefs can be activated at all times, in contrast with “normally functioning” people, where negative core beliefs are activated only occasionally.

**Core beliefs tend to be categorized into three types** :

  * Helplessness
    * “I want to achieve more, but I’m not capable of it.”
    * “I’m vulnerable.”
    * “I’m a victim.”
    * “I’m a failure.”
  * Unlovableness
    * “I’m not worthy of being loved by others.”
    * “I’m undesirable.”
    * “I’m bound to be alone”
    * “I’m defective, therefore others won’t love me.”
  * Worthlessness
    * “I’m bad. I’m fundamentally not worthy of good things.”
    * “I’m evil.”
    * “I don’t deserve to live.”



As you try to elucidate a patient’s core belief, try to categorize it into one of those three types. A statement that’s too general can be clarified to fit into the correct category.

  * For example, the patient may offer the core belief, “I’m not good enough.” This can mean either “I’m not good enough to achieve more,” or “I’m not good enough to be loved.”



Core beliefs are often formed through early childhood experiences. To elucidate these experiences:

  * When a patient recounts a recent situation that causes negative affect, ask her to vividly imagine the present situation to intensify the affect. Ask where she feels the affect in her body.
  * Then ask when the earliest she can remember feeling this feeling in the past was.



#### Techniques to correct core beliefs

All the techniques used to address automatic thoughts and intermediate beliefs can also be applied to core beliefs.

In addition, here are techniques used particularly for core beliefs:

**Set positively adjusted core beliefs, rather than extreme positive core beliefs.**

  * Turn “I can’t do anything right” into “I can do most things right, and there’s a good reason for when I get something wrong.” 
  * Do NOT turn it into “I can do everything right.”



**Keep a Core Belief Worksheet with two columns:**

  * Evidence supporting new belief
    * The patient may struggle to volunteer evidence for this, so have her reflect on other people doing the behavior. If the patient sees someone else doing something positive, ask whether she’s also doing it herself and should give herself credit. Or visualize someone else doing what she’s doing, and ask if she’s doing something similar.
    * Any behavior that, if not done, would be negative data, belongs in positive data. For example, a struggling student might not consider going to class positive data, but if she didn’t go to class, she’d consider it negative data.
  * Evidence that would have supported the old core belief, but a reframing makes it no longer as negative.
    * “I got a B on the test, **BUT** this isn’t a total failure. If I were _really_ incompetent, I wouldn’t be here.”
    * “I didn’t understand something in class, BUT the teacher may not have explained it well, and I didn’t read about it.”



**Historical tests of the Core Belief**

  * Look back on major periods of the patient’s life to find evidence that supports or contradicts the core belief.
  * Summarize each major period, often with reframings of the core belief to be more qualified.
    * For example, “during high school, I was highly functioning. In college, I struggled more, but I still graduated and made it out.”



**Role play an early childhood experience.**

  * Rationally discuss alternative explanations for the experience.
  * For example, say a patient’s mother yelled at her for poor grades, because the mom was embarrassed among her peers.
    * The therapist role plays as the younger patient, but mounts a rational resistance against the traumatizer. The patient plays the role of the traumatizer (here, the parent). The roles switch.
    * The patient then role plays as an older version of herself sitting beside her younger self. “What does older Annie say to 7-year-old Annie?” “7-year-old Annie, do you believe her?”



Note that negative core beliefs of patients with personality disorders are usually more difficult to modify.
