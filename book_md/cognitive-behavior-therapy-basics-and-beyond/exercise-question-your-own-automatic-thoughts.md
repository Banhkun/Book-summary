## Exercise: Question Your Own Automatic Thoughts

Reflect on automatic thoughts you have and how they might be improved.

* * *

Think about a time in the past day or so where you felt a negative emotion about yourself (like self-doubt, anxiety, or sadness). What was going through your mind just then?

How did that thought make you feel?

What’s the evidence that your thought is true? What’s the evidence on the other side?

What’s an alternative way of viewing this situation? What’s the worst that could happen?
