## Planning for Termination and Relapse Prevention

CBT is intended to be fixed in duration, **teaching the patient to be her own therapist**. Make this known to the patient at the beginning, to prepare for the expectation.

To help ease the transition, help the patient attribute positive changes to herself, not to the therapist or external causes.

  * The patient needs to develop confidence about her ability to solve her own problems.
  * The patient is the one who puts in the work, so the therapist should get only a portion of credit.



As sessions near the end, patients should anticipate setbacks and anticipate how they will respond.

  * Chart out the patient’s likely affect over time. This can look like the southern border of the US—Texas and Florida are troughs with lows.
  * Role play how the patient will feel during a setback. Ask how they predict they’d feel. In response, answer the thoughts and create coping cards.



Make a list of tools the patient has employed to deal with stressful situations:

  * Identifying, responding to automatic thoughts
  * Using thought records
  * Scheduling activities
  * Techniques for relaxation, distraction, and refocusing



Guide the patient to conduct self-therapy sessions, consisting of a template similar to normal therapy sessions. A template might include:

  * Review of past week, mood check
  * Review homework
  * Review current problems and engage in problem solving
  * Set new homework
  * Schedule next therapy session



Prepare for the taper off of sessions like any other stressful situation.

  * Elicit advantages and disadvantages of tapering therapy, with disadvantages reframed.
    * “I might relapse” can be turned to “If I’m going to relapse, it’s better for it to happen while I’m in therapy so I can learn how to handle it.”
  * Help respond to any distortions, such as catastrophizing a relapse.



Schedule booster sessions.

  * Having these pre-scheduled may motivate the patient to do homework in between.
  * It reduces anxiety about being on their own.
  * Assign questions to answer before booster sessions about what work has done in between, and how problems were handled.
