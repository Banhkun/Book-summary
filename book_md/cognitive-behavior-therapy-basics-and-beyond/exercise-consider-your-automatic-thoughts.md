## Exercise: Consider Your Automatic Thoughts

Automatic thoughts can arise for all people. Think about what automatic thoughts you have and how they affect your emotion.

* * *

Think about the last time you felt an automatic negative emotion in response to a situation. What was the situation? What were you feeling?

Picture the situation vividly. What thoughts do you remember thinking at the time?

Did more thoughts continue to pile onto the original negative thought? What were these thoughts?
