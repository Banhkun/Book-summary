## Exercise: Create a Self-Care Plan

Recall that Maté believes that the best way to heal your ADHD is by re-parenting yourself (taking care of your physical and psychological needs). In this exercise, you’ll create a plan to put that advice into action.

* * *

What are you already doing to take care of yourself? Consider both your physical needs (e.g., nutrition and exercise) and your psychological needs (e.g., self-acceptance and restorative recreation).

Do you think your current self-care routine meets your needs? Why or why not?

What realistic steps can you take to improve your self-care regimen?
