## Exercise: Focus Your Thought-Energy on What You Want

According to Chopra, when you focus only on what you want to experience, your thought-energy flows to and creates those very things. In this exercise, we’ll determine what you want and how you can focus on it.

* * *

What one thing would immediately improve your life experience and make you feel successful? (For example, you might feel successful if you find a satisfying job that pays well.)

What’s your motivation for wanting this thing? (For example, do you genuinely believe that having this thing will bring you joyful success, or do you feel pressured to meet external expectations?)

What are your current thoughts about this thing? Do you expect to get it or do you have doubts? Explain why.

If you’re having doubts, consider the content of your thought-energy— _what_ you’re thinking about and _why_ you’re thinking about it. How could you make your thoughts more positive to encourage the thought-energy to flow? (For example, instead of thinking, “I really need a job because I don’t have money,” you might think, “I’d love to apply my skills to a job I care about _and_ get paid for it.”)
