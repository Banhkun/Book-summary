## Exercise: Do Amazon’s Principles Apply to Your Place of Business?

Bezos explains that Amazon’s success comes from its dedication to customer service, its focus on planning for the long term, and its willingness to innovate despite the risks and the cost. Think about the place where you work, whether you’re an owner, manager, or employee, and how these principles might apply to your business or organization.

Who are the customers at your place of work? Does your organization prioritize their experience over any other concerns? If so, how, and if not, what does your business value more highly?

How far ahead does your organization plan—quarterly, yearly, or longer? What is the longest-term goal that you’re working toward, and how does it reflect your company’s mission?

Do you feel that new ideas and innovative gambles are welcome at your workplace? What new ventures have you been a part of, and how did the organization react to their failure or success?
