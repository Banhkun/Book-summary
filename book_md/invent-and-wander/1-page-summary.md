## 1-Page Summary

In 1994, a young programmer named Jeff Bezos took a chance on himself, quit his steady job, and founded the first online bookstore. Three decades later, his business—Amazon—is one of the giants of the internet, valued at over $1 trillion, and has utterly revolutionized the retail marketplace while pioneering the field of online computing. Always looking toward the future, Bezos leveraged his Amazon fortune to found Blue Origin, a business through which he’s pushing the frontier of commercial space exploration.

_Invent and Wander_ , published in 2021, is a compilation of Bezos’s letters to Amazon shareholders, combined with excerpts from interviews and speeches Bezos has given. It features an introduction by Walter Isaacson fleshing out details on Bezos himself. Bezos’s writings and speeches chronicle Amazon’s meteoric rise from a niche online retailer to the ubiquitous digital superstore of the 21st century, while also illustrating Bezos’s values and insights into innovation and business success.

Bezos has been ranked as one of the most effective CEOs in the world. From his humble beginnings as a software developer, he caught the internet wave of the ’90s, survived the dot-com crash of 2000, and grew his net worth to over $200 billion by 2020. His coauthor, Isaacson, is a popular biographer known for his books on Leonardo da Vinci, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, and Bezos’s rival in the space race, Elon Musk.

In this guide, we’ll explore the history of Amazon as it grew from a seed in Bezos’s mind to a thriving online marketplace that disrupted the brick-and-mortar retail industry while also becoming an invaluable resource for cloud-based computing that other businesses rely on. We’ll also delve into the principles that Bezos says are central to Amazon’s success—customer focus, long-term planning, and a drive to innovate for the world of tomorrow.

Beyond the world of Amazon, we’ll contrast its success with that of other innovative online companies and examine where Bezos’s management decisions align with or diverge from those of his contemporaries. Because Bezos presents an insider’s view of Amazon, we’ll hear from outside voices who are critical of Bezos’s leadership style and the impact that Amazon has had on its competitors, its workers, and the environment.

### The Rise of Amazon

Bezos’s story is the story of Amazon, the business he founded in 1994. Though Bezos doesn’t take all of the credit for the company’s success, it was he who shouldered the risk of creating an online retail store in a decade that provided a wealth of opportunities that many of Bezos’s contemporaries squandered. Pulling from Amazon’s shareholder statements and Isaacson’s biographical sketch of its founder, we’ll trace the company’s history from Bezos’s childhood to Amazon’s modest early days in Seattle. These reports chart Amazon’s survival through the internet bubble and the Great Recession, as well as the company’s rapid expansion as it added an increasing number of services, both for its customers and its business partners.

> **The Roadblocks in Amazon’s Future**
> 
> Bezos’s letters detail Amazon’s response to the two major crises that would jeopardize its prospects. The first of these would be the dot-com crash of 2000. As online businesses took off in the ’90s, investors poured money into scores of tech startups, inflating their stock in what would become known as the internet bubble. Economic factors during 1999 and 2000, including higher US interest rates and a recession in Japan, triggered an investment slowdown in internet businesses. The lack of easy liquidity revealed the dot-com industry’s shaky underpinnings, prompting investors to sell their stock and causing business values to plummet. Many companies that had been overvalued soon fell apart without investor support.
> 
> The next financial crisis Bezos addresses in his letters is the Great Recession of 2008, which impacted the global economy, not just the online sector. This time, the downturn resulted from an investment bubble in the US housing market that, when it collapsed, brought down several large investment banks. During the economic shock, homes lost value, people lost their jobs, and consumer spending—which is Amazon’s lifeblood—dramatically decreased. Not only did the recession of 2008 reduce how much money consumers spent, but it shifted their preferences toward cheaper brands and discounted products such that in many areas of the economy, spending would not rebound to prerecession levels for many years.

#### Meet Jeff Bezos

The future multibillionaire Amazon founder was born on January 12, 1964, while his 17-year-old mother was still attending high school. **Bezos’s path to wealth and recognition was fraught with financial risk,** and quantifiable success would be a long time coming. Bezos and Isaacson trace Bezos’s early family influences, his childhood interest in science and computers, and his fateful decisions during college and after that altered the path of his future.

Bezos’s mother, Jacklyn Gise, became pregnant with him while still in high school. She was only allowed to graduate because Bezos’s grandfather fought for her right to attend, but her success was due to her resilience, which Isaacson says she passed on to her child. At college, Jacklyn met and later married a Cuban immigrant named Miguel Bezos, who adopted Jeff as his son. By the age of 10, Jeff Bezos was already tinkering with computers and the rudimentary internet of the 1970s, an interest that his mother encouraged. During summers at his grandparents’ ranch, **Bezos learned values of perseverance and resourcefulness** —as when his grandfather went out of his way to fix things on his own rather than paying someone else.

(Shortform note: Bezos shares the status of having been adopted with another computing industry leader, Steve Jobs. In Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, he relates that unlike Bezos, Jobs wasn’t raised by either of his biological parents, but just as Bezos felt about his father, Jobs thought of his adoptive parents as his true parents. While Isaacson doesn’t draw any link between Bezos’s adoption and his personal development, Isaacson argues that Jobs’s adoption left him feeling abandoned and specially chosen at the same time. That dichotomy played a role in shaping Jobs’s conflicted nature—a pitfall that Bezos seems to have avoided.)

##### The Computer World Beckons

In college, Bezos started by studying physics, but he says he wasn’t able to process the math at a high enough level to follow that career. Instead, he switched to computer science, which would determine the course of the rest of his life. After college, Bezos’s first job was writing software for a Wall Street hedge fund. (Shortform note: Despite the many prospects for computer science students like Bezos in the ’90s, the number of graduates in that field peaked in 1986 and declined until 1997, with an upward spike in 2000 just in time for the internet bubble to pop.)

The work was stable and provided steady income, but while there, **Bezos learned that the fledgling World Wide Web was growing at an exponential rate.** Like many others, he sensed an opportunity and hit upon the notion of an online retail store. Isaacson writes that Bezos starting his own business meant leaving the security of Wall Street behind, but that Bezos did so because of the fear that he’d always regret not taking the chance.

> **The Internet Gold Rush**
> 
> Though the internet officially began in 1983, with its predecessor ARPANET dating back to 1969, the World Wide Web didn’t publicly launch until 1993, when its creators at the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) made the web’s source code free online. In the first year of the web’s existence, the number of servers hosting websites grew from 500 to over 10,000. Those first years saw the birth of early web browsers such as Netscape and internet directories such as Yahoo. It was during this time that Bezos and others recognized the World Wide Web as uncharted territory for business entrepreneurs.
> 
> Another businessman who came to the same conclusion as Bezos was his future rival Elon Musk. In Isaacson’s biography of Musk, he writes that Musk turned away from pursuing a Ph.D. for fear of missing the rising tide of the internet market. Instead of going into retail like Bezos, Musk developed the Zip2 business database, which he sold to finance his second venture, the online bank that would evolve into PayPal. Whereas Bezos would remain in the internet arena after the heyday of the 1990s, Musk would leave to follow other pursuits until buying the Twitter social media platform in 2022.

#### Amazon Is Born

Bezos praises American culture for encouraging and supporting entrepreneurs like himself, but that didn’t make starting his business any less of a risk. For most of the first decade of its existence, Amazon stood on shaky financial ground, and it survived by putting its focus on the customer experience and experimenting with new services and products. In Bezos’s annual shareholder letters, he covers Amazon’s genesis, how it expanded its business model and user base, as well as how it weathered the dot-com crash at the turn of the century.

Bezos developed Amazon’s original business plan not to be a rigid blueprint but to let himself think through his company’s potential problems. Bezos says he selected books as the first product to sell because **an online bookstore could offer a wider selection than any physical retailer.** With an initial investment from his parents’ life savings, Bezos moved to Seattle—not only because it was a computing industry hotbed, but for its proximity to the country’s biggest book wholesaler.

(Shortform note: Though most people think of California’s Silicon Valley as ground zero for the computer revolution, Seattle was also a hub of innovation, especially in software development. Its suburb Bellevue, Washington became home to Microsoft in 1979, which poured millions into Seattle’s economy and attracted legions of software professionals. Even into the 2020s, Seattle leads the rest of the US in employment growth in the technology sector.)

Like so many other new technology entrepreneurs in the ’80s and ’90s, Bezos started his business from his garage. Amazon’s website went online on July 16, 1995, offering access to nearly every book in print. Even without advertisement, orders started pouring in from all over the world.

(Shortform note: Even before Amazon went online, brick-and-mortar bookstores were already being disrupted as book superstores Barnes & Noble and Books-A-Million opened outlets across the US and outcompeted other chains such as Borders in addition to many independent booksellers. Another major shift in the publishing world was the rising popularity of audiobooks, which went hand in hand with the increasing variety of portable media players people owned. The internet pioneer in downloadable audiobooks was the ’90s tech startup Audible, which Amazon would buy in 2008 for $300 million.)

##### Putting Customers First

Isaacson writes that Bezos focused on the mission of making Amazon a uniquely customer-first company. Because the internet of the ’90s was still maddeningly slow, Amazon compensated by lowering prices and making its website as easy to use as possible. The company went public in 1997, and Bezos reached out to his customers to find out what else Amazon could sell. Their responses were all over the map, and **Bezos realized that Amazon could apply its business model to all sorts of products.** In 1998, it branched out into music sales while opening distribution centers in Europe. Despite Amazon’s success, Bezos argued that the company shouldn’t be complacent. It was still relatively small compared to its traditional retail competitors.

(Shortform note: Amazon’s May 1997 IPO (initial public offering of stock), just short of two years from the business’s inception, may seem at first glance to be fast for a startup. In 2022, the average time between a company’s founding and going public was over five years. However, during the boom of the 1990s, some companies were able to transition out of the venture capital stage very quickly. Amazon’s retail rival Overstock went public three years after launch, whereas the web browser Netscape’s IPO took place only 16 months after the company was founded. Bezos doesn’t comment on Amazon’s IPO, perhaps because in the tech world of the time, such rapid investment wasn’t unheard of.)

In his 1999 letter to shareholders, Bezos informed investors that **hordes of new users would shortly be pouring onto the internet** and that Amazon was well-positioned to bring them into its customer base. In addition to new business, the company’s repeat business kept growing, and non-book products now represented the majority of its sales. Revenue shot up 90% during the holiday shopping season, and without having physical stores to maintain, Amazon could efficiently keep up with demand. With its platform well-established, it became increasingly easier to add new product lines to the Amazon store.

(Shortform note: Though the figures vary by source, the number of people using the internet skyrocketed after the birth of the web, from 16 million in 1995 to 350 million by the turn of the century. The percentage of that number representing potential Amazon customers would expand even more quickly with every new region of the world added to Amazon’s growing distribution network, which Bezos recognized as early as his first letter to shareholders. Today, over 4 billion people are online, with much of the growth since 2005 due to expanding internet access throughout Asia, where Amazon is making inroads in the 2020s.)

#### Bust and Boom

But all was not well in the online business world. During the downturn that was to come, **Amazon survived because of its mission to constantly build on its relationship with customers.** While acknowledging that the internet bubble was hard on Amazon’s investors in the short term, Bezos explains the positive signs in Amazon’s actual financial numbers, how the company’s business model was better poised for success than those of other online stores, and how pioneering in whole new markets opened up Amazon for even greater successes.

Isaacson recounts that 1999 marked the beginning of what would be known as the “dot-com crash,” when most of the internet startups of the ’90s proved to be unprofitable and went out of business. (Shortform note: As technology companies, including Amazon’s competitors, started going bankrupt at the end of the 1990s, it wasn’t venture capitalists who suffered, but everyday investors who weren’t made aware of how badly their tech stocks were overvalued. The recession that followed was exacerbated by the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, but the US economy rebounded with the help of quick action from the Federal Reserve System.)

Amazon shares dropped from $106 in 1999 to $6 in 2001, and **though industry experts predicted Amazon’s collapse, Bezos kept his eyes on its actual value,** measured by customers, sales, and cash flow. He reassured investors that Amazon was sound by showing that financially it was performing better than ever. Although Amazon consistently lost money during the years it spent ramping up, it ended 2000 with $1 billion in cash and a record-high score on the American Customer Satisfaction Index.

(Shortform note: The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) that Bezos references in his shareholder letters was created in 1994 as a project at the University of Michigan to track and measure the customer experience of American households relating to a range of industry sectors including retail, health care, utilities, and financial services. Whereas Bezos uses Amazon’s ACSI scores to measure the company’s relationship with its customers, the aggregate ACSI score for all the industries measured in the study serves as an indicator of the general mood of US consumers toward the economy. The average ACSI for the American economy peaked in the 2010s before plummeting sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic.)

##### The Turnaround

In 2001, Amazon posted its first profitable quarter. Bezos reports that the internet bubble shut down some of its online partners who dealt in a smaller array of merchandise. The lesson learned is that **online retail is all about scale** —it’s harder for single-product sellers to compete than anyone anticipated. Through trial and persistence, Amazon learned how to enter new markets while keeping costs down, and in contrast to storefront retailers, Amazon’s fixed costs don’t go up as sales increase. This means that the more that Amazon grows, the less financial “friction” it experiences per sale. Unlike its floundering niche-market competitors, Amazon grew until its cost of doing business was relatively low when taken on a per-sale basis.

> **Scaling Up for Success**
> 
> Bezos isn’t the only one to recognize the unique cost advantages of scaling upward in the online marketplace. In _Blitzscaling_ , Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh analyze the common factors of several internet companies—Uber, Facebook, and AirBnB—that succeeded by expanding rapidly and dominating their corner of the market (with Amazon’s corner being online retail).
> 
> These companies’ business models all rely on having a large number of potential customers, high amounts of revenue in relation to the cost of their services, and efficient use of consumer word-of-mouth to attract new customers. Although rapid online growth can be a winning strategy, as it certainly was for Amazon, Hoffman and Yeh say to watch for warning signs that a company’s growth is outpacing its resources. Those signs include a declining growth rate, decreasing productivity, and increasing administrative costs, all of which Bezos works to avoid at Amazon.

#### Forging Ahead

The next economic hurdle Amazon faced was the Great Recession of 2008. During this downturn and the decade after, Amazon held its course and continued to grow. Bezos highlights three of Amazon’s business innovations that blossomed into permanent, successful programs that have shaped Amazon’s character in the 21st century—Marketplace, Prime, and Amazon Web Services—while explaining how Amazon faced the Covid crisis and continues to flourish in the shifting online economy.

##### Business Innovations

Launched in 2000, Amazon Marketplace grew out of attempts to host third-party vendors on Amazon’s platform. In its early years, Amazon partnered with other sellers so customers could access goods that Amazon itself didn’t keep in stock. After trying business models that separated outside vendors’ products from Amazon’s offerings, **Amazon Marketplace placed third-party merchandise side-by-side with Amazon’s products.** Rather than diminishing Amazon’s profits, Bezos argues that Marketplace is a win for all participants. It encourages healthy competition that results in better deals for customers while allowing Amazon’s partners access to a global distribution network that they never could have built themselves.

(Shortform note: Though Bezos presents Amazon Marketplace as a panacea for customers and third-party sellers, not everyone agrees with his assessment. In 2023, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit alleging that Amazon has built an illegal monopoly that prevents third-party sellers from offering lower prices, coerces vendors into using Amazon’s fulfillment service, and overcharges businesses who have no choice but to sell through Amazon. Amazon responded that the FTC’s lawsuit mischaracterizes Amazon’s relationship with third-party sellers and that it could result in higher prices and slower deliveries for consumers.)

Another risky venture was **Amazon Prime, a customer loyalty program that coupled discounts with free shipping on most items.** From its conception in 2005, the initial financial projections for Prime suggested it might be a financial boondoggle, and Bezos admits that Prime was risky because if it failed, it would be hard to roll back without incurring customer resentment. Instead, Prime was a smashing success. It turned out that customers were eager to pay an annual premium for the convenience it offered, as well as its added perks such as rapid delivery and streaming video. For many users, Prime made ordering online preferable to shopping in stores.

(Shortform note: Financial analysts who break down the consumer cost of Amazon Prime agree that it represents a bargain, depending on how you make use of the service. If used primarily for its free shipping aspect, you would have to order enough packages per year to recoup the annual membership fee in saved shipping costs. If used for its digital streaming aspects, its pricing is comparable to that of competitors such as Netflix and Disney. However, Amazon Prime’s critics point out that its selection is limited, its rapid delivery service is harmful to the environment, and its discounts and ease of use may promote irresponsible impulse buying.)

Amazon’s third major innovation is completely separate from its retail identity. Initiated in 2006, **Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides on-demand cloud computing tools** that businesses can access on a pay-per-use basis. Bezos explains that AWS grew out of Amazon’s attempts to solve its own computing problems. Once the company’s software team designed the digital tools they needed, they realized that other companies would need them as well. The first AWS customers were small business start-ups that couldn’t afford their own IT departments, but soon, even large corporations turned to AWS to save costs. Though AWS started as a sort of side hustle, it now represents a significant pillar of Amazon’s standing as an economic giant.

(Shortform note: Whether knowingly or not, when starting AWS, Bezos followed a practice articulated in 1985 by management expert Peter Drucker. In _The Essential Drucker_ , he explains that when an established company is experimenting with a new type of business venture, it should create the new program as a separate entity and treat it as a startup rather than an expansion of the existing enterprise. If the side venture succeeds, it can then be brought under the company’s larger umbrella, and if it fails, its negative returns won’t impact the success of the parent business.)

##### Crisis and Competition

In 2020, **the Covid pandemic drove home how important Amazon is to its customers.** Online retail let people order basic necessities without risking exposure from in-person shopping. However, Bezos says that unlike the normal increase in business that comes with holiday shopping, the surge of online ordering during the Covid lockdown caught Amazon off guard. The company hired almost 200,000 new workers prioritizing delivery of essential goods. Amazon’s Marketplace worked to clamp down on third-party vendors engaged in price gouging, while AWS provided cloud computing to government agencies, medical researchers, and emergency call centers, as well as schools and businesses that had to rapidly switch to online work.

(Shortform note: As people turned to online ordering during the lockdown, Amazon prospered while other retailers struggled. However, because Amazon workers were deemed essential and remained in the workplace with little access to clear health and safety information, the pandemic had an unexpected side-effect—the unionization of Amazon’s workforce. Workers came together online to speak up about workplace safety concerns and organized strikes to demand better working conditions and stronger safety measures. Amazon responded with anti-union pressure, but its workers’ attempts to organize have been upheld by US labor officials.)

While Amazon took the lead in online retail, its success didn’t crush its competition—instead, **Amazon changed the nature of retail and created new markets for other businesses to pursue.** Major competitors like Walmart have now moved into online retail while offering services that Amazon can’t, such as curbside order pickup. By normalizing at-home delivery, Amazon created an avenue for companies such as Instacart that let grocery stores become online vendors. Bezos insists that he isn’t dismayed by the increasingly crowded online marketplace because he doesn’t believe that the competition detracts from Amazon’s value. Rather, the online retail market is still growing, as is Amazon’s overall share.

(Shortform note: Despite Bezos’s statements welcoming competition, Amazon and its chief rival Walmart are racing neck-and-neck to be the US’s top retail business. In 2023, Walmart outpaced Amazon in revenue ($573 billion to $514 billion), business innovation, and environmental sustainability, while Amazon ranked higher in customer service and digital sales. Though Amazon long ago eclipsed eBay in terms of revenue and volume, eBay still remains competitive as an outlet for third-party sellers to find a customer base. Meanwhile, Amazon’s up-and-coming overseas competitor Alibaba is dominating in some global sectors, specifically the Chinese market, and has more active users worldwide.)

### The Cornerstones of Amazon’s Success

When Amazon made over $100 billion in sales in a single year for the first time, Bezos reported that they’d achieved that volume faster than any other business. Instead of taking credit for that himself, Bezos attributes Amazon’s success to its workers and to the company’s culture, which he says was created by Amazon employees through their collaboration with each other, rather than being set from on high. In his writings and interviews, Bezos extols the values of that culture, which include intense customer focus, long-term planning, and a willingness to take risks and innovate.

(Shortform note: As Amazon shows, culture is integral to success—and a healthy group culture needs to be nurtured by management if a business is to flourish. In _The Culture Code_ , Daniel Coyle identifies three cultural ideals that executives should foster to make their businesses thriving workplaces. These include making workers feel valued and interconnected with the group, allowing team members to develop trust by showing vulnerability on the job, and giving the whole organization a purpose so that everyone can work toward the same goal. It’s this third ideal that Bezos articulates the most, as we’ll see in the following section.)

#### It’s All About the Customers

From the start, Bezos declared his intention that Amazon should be the most customer-friendly business in the world. In practice, that means **putting customers first is the guideline for every business decision.** Bezos describes his deep respect for Amazon’s customers, how their needs drive the business to constantly improve, and how customer focus dictates Amazon’s expansion into new territories and markets.

Bezos starts from the assumption that customers are intelligent—they know the difference between good and bad service, and they can see through any flimsy marketing campaign that might try to brush away a company’s faults. Therefore, **the only way to build a good brand is to always give customers a positive experience.** No matter the customer, there are always certain constants—people like having a variety of options, paying less for them, and receiving what they order quickly. These constants demand that Amazon’s team meet high expectations in everything they do and teach those expectations to every new employee.

(Shortform note: Bezos’s chief marketing strategy isn’t focused on selling specific items to customers as much as selling the “Amazon experience.” In _Superfans_ , Pat Flynn describes this strategy in detail, arguing that the quality of your customers’ experience is more important than how many customers you have. Once customers become “superfans” of a service, it becomes part of their identity that’s embedded in their daily routines. These customers become active marketers for your company, provide your business with vital feedback, and can ensure your company’s overall longevity. The steps for turning customers into fans boil down to the essentials of good customer service—establish a connection and provide something of value.)

##### Always Doing More

Amazon pushes to never stop improving because **customer expectations always go up.** Bezos argues that striving to keep up with its customers rather than aiming to beat the competition forces Amazon to keep innovating even in markets where it already has a commanding lead. Some companies focus on doing one thing and doing it well, but that can give a business tunnel vision. By placing themselves in their customers’ shoes, Amazon’s teams must constantly learn new areas of expertise, which then branch out into whole new markets and services that customers will enjoy. Expanding into new markets is key to keeping Amazon’s customers happy as well as bringing more into the Amazon fold.

(Shortform note: Bezos’s continual expansion of Amazon’s services and the markets in which it operates is a strategy that many companies employ as a bulwark against financial downturns and organizational stagnation. In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone cites the examples of companies like Google, Walmart, and Coca-Cola who work to make themselves omnipresent so that virtually no one is unaware of their existence. By constantly expanding—and in a sense, overcommitting their resources—companies are forced to excel and innovate in order to survive and deliver on their promises. The end result is a business that can weather any economic downturn, because staying competitive is baked into its culture.)

Other ways Amazon draws in new customers, as well as building trust with those it has, include some practices that seem counterintuitive—such as letting customers post negative product reviews, displaying third-party products that may be cheaper than its own, and proactively informing customers when they could get a better deal than what they’re currently paying. While each of these practices results in a short-term revenue loss, **their cumulative impact is an increase in customer loyalty, positive brand associations, and more future sales.**

(Shortform note: While it’s true that companies require short-term revenue to pay their bills and keep the lights on, fixating on short-term profits can blind a business to more important issues. In _Zero to One_ , Peter Thiel argues that entrepreneurs should grow their businesses based on 10- or 20-year projections, even though short-term targets are easier to set and measure. In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink points out that emphasizing short-term profits leads to short-term thinking, showing that companies that obsess over quarterly earnings spend less on research and development—boosting their short-term numbers at the expense of long-term viability.)

#### Taking the Long View

To maintain Amazon’s market leadership, Bezos and the rest of his leadership team focus on the company’s success in the future, not on its current quarterly statements. Bezos explains his insistence on making decisions that pay out in the long run, how this reflects an “ownership” mindset, and why many of his long-term decisions are, by necessity, judgment calls.

As early as Bezos’s first letter to shareholders in 1997, he warned investors that **Amazon would often engage in practices that incurred short-term losses.** The point was to quickly take a lead in the market, which could only be done by building Amazon’s brand, growing its number of repeat, loyal customers, and encouraging more and more sales through its site. He acknowledged that for purely technical reasons, online shopping in the ’90s was still frustrating, so Amazon made up for that by reducing prices and increasing its selection. Nevertheless, the company had to be careful when cutting prices to minimize its losses as it grew.

(Shortform note: In general, new businesses should expect to lose money for several years before becoming profitable. That doesn’t mean that the company’s founders or investors will lose money during that time. Business owners may pay themselves a salary as part of their company’s regular expenses, and investors may receive fixed interest payments on their investments as the company grows. Even successful companies don’t record profits for two or three years, although Bezos reports that Amazon took over five years to reach that goal.)

Bezos says that Amazon executives spend more time setting customer service goals than they do poring over financial reports, because creating value for customers results in greater business returns over the long haul. Short-term speculators don’t appreciate this mindset, but **Bezos believes that good investors think like owners** and should therefore be on the same wavelength regarding Amazon’s long-term ambitions.

(Shortform note: Bezos’s attitude toward long-term investors reflects the guiding philosophy of business mogul Warren Buffett. In _The Essays of Warren Buffett_ , he drives home the idea that owning stock means owning a piece of a real-world business, which he advises holding on to and taking responsibility for so long as the business is well-operated and produces a steady rate of return. Buffett famously derides short-term traders who treat investments like gambling chips. Bezos, like Buffett, places value in investors who prioritize long-term business goals over short-term fluctuations in the market.)

##### Making Long-Term Decisions

The tricky part about planning ahead is that it’s impossible to predict the future, even with all the customer data and financial projections in the world. Therefore, Bezos admits that **many long-term decisions boil down to judgment calls.** When making a gamble—such as whether to experiment with a new service or build a new distribution center—Bezos uses the customers’ interest as his guiding star, assuming that if something Amazon does results in better deals for customers, it will eventually benefit Amazon too, even if the returns won’t be evident for years. Though some of these bets have been controversial—such as sharing website space with third-party vendors—Bezos’s judgment has paid off more often than not.

(Shortform note: In _Blink_ , Malcolm Gladwell backs up Bezos’s assertion that intuitive judgments can be as strong as slow, deliberate, well-reasoned decisions. Gladwell explains that when using intuition, our minds perceive patterns based on snapshots of data while disregarding extraneous details. Intuition can be influenced by unconscious bias, but Gladwell argues that making good intuitive decisions is a skill you can improve through practice and learning to recognize when gut-based decisions are and aren’t appropriate. For Bezos, running a trillion-dollar business surely provides opportunities for both.)

#### The Will to Innovate

The biggest gambles requiring the most judgment revolve around some form of innovation. Bezos places innovation at the core of Amazon’s identity and culture. He explains innovation’s crucial role in keeping Amazon fresh and energized, how innovation is driven by both customer needs and industrial trends, and why failure is an acceptable, necessary cost.

Bezos’s central business philosophy is that **no matter how established your company is, you should always act as if it’s a startup.** The alternative is complacency and stagnation, whereas a startup mentality brings energy and a gung-ho attitude to stay ahead. This doesn’t just apply to the boss, but to every employee, because the next innovative insight could come from anywhere in the organization. For example, Bezos writes that Amazon Prime, which paid for itself by the sheer volume of business it generated, was first suggested by a low-level programmer. For this reason, all employees must be empowered to think for themselves and come up with risky ideas. If not, they may quit and innovate for your competitors instead.

(Shortform note: While Bezos celebrates the fact that innovative ideas can come from anyone, he doesn’t describe the process by which new concepts are brought forward. However, in _Creativity, Inc._ , Ed Catmull details the steps and hurdles to do the same thing at Pixar. Catmull acknowledges that many employees are uncomfortable giving feedback or suggesting ideas, so managers have to send the clear message that innovative ideas that fail are tools for learning and won’t result in negative reprisals. Unproven ideas are often risky, but Catmull says that nurturing them to fruition requires focusing on what makes them exciting and working through the problems as they crop up.)

When innovating, Bezos says that it’s important to keep ahead of sweeping industry trends, such as the development of artificial intelligence, but it’s equally important to **be so aware of customers’ needs that you can guess what they want before they know it.** This involves a process that Bezos calls “wandering”—inventing new products and services with only a vague notion of whether they’ll be successful. This process of trial and error isn’t as haphazard as it sounds, but it’s driven by Amazon’s employees’ insights about how customers engage with the world and what potential innovations might create opportunities for Amazon and its users.

(Shortform note: A famous practitioner of Bezos’s forward-looking innovation style was Steve Jobs, cofounder of Apple Computers. In Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, he comments that under Jobs’s leadership, Apple rarely did market research, since Jobs was convinced that the market didn’t know yet that it needed the new products he was pushing. This proved true for such game-changing innovations as the iPod music player and the iPhone, though not all of Jobs’s products turned out to be winners, most notably the NeXT academic computer station, which was an unmitigated flop.)

##### The Value of Failure

Of course, not every innovation will work and failure is to be expected. Bezos differentiates between _bad_ failure, such as poor customer service, and _good_ failure which comes from taking potentially profitable risks. **The goal with any experiment is to fail as quickly as possible** so you can learn what doesn’t work, correct it, and do better. For instance, Amazon’s successful Marketplace program grew out of two earlier failed attempts to bring third-party partners into Amazon’s platform. When a company grows as large as Amazon has, Bezos insists that it has to fail bigger too, or else it isn’t challenging itself hard enough. With the resources at Amazon’s disposal, Bezos expects it to experiment and fail in new, astonishing, billion-dollar ways.

(Shortform note: Bezos’s principle of “failing as soon as possible” is applicable to any business, especially new ones. In _The Lean Startup_ , Eric Ries presents a systematic way to go about it, based on the premise that a brand-new business doesn’t know what its customers want or how they’ll use it. Therefore, Ries describes business practices like a scientific experiment—start with a hypothesis about how customers will relate to your product (based on the most minimal version of it you can make), test your product’s performance in the market, then learn what you can from what you’ve done so far and make any changes that your data shows are needed.)

### Looking to the Future

Amazon’s success has made Bezos one of the richest people on the planet, but his ambitions don’t end there. Bezos wants to use his wealth to be a positive force for change in the world. He discusses his thoughts about the social responsibilities of big business and how he’s using Amazon and his aerospace company Blue Origin to improve climate conditions on Earth while laying the foundation for future space-based endeavors.

Industry giants like Amazon are often disparaged for their success, which Bezos argues isn’t helpful or fair. **Because of its scale, Amazon can have a positive impact on the world** in ways that individuals and nonprofits simply can’t. One way that Amazon has sought to fulfill its responsibilities to society is by raising its wages above the minimum required and challenging other businesses to follow suit. Beyond that, Amazon offers paid tuition for employees pursuing advanced education, while extending paid leave to employees’ family members whose own jobs may not provide the same. In addition to setting an example for other companies, Bezos writes that such policies are good for the recruitment and retention of dedicated workers.

(Shortform note: What Bezos doesn’t acknowledge in his shareholder letters are the numerous employee complaints leveled against Amazon over the last 10 years. Some of these relate to ergonomic injuries sustained by Amazon warehouse workers, which led to an investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Other issues involve allegations that Amazon underpays employees and encourages a high turnover rate to avoid issuing raises. Some Amazon workers have even made reports of racially abusive working conditions to the Equal Employment Opportunity commission. In 2021, Bezos defended Amazon’s workplace practices while acknowledging that it had work to do regarding helping its workers succeed.)

Amazon’s industry leadership extends into environmental issues. Bezos prides himself that **Amazon was the first business to sign the 2019 Climate Pledge,** despite the fact that its reliance on packaging and shipping makes it a carbon-intensive industry. To meet its climate goals, Amazon designed one of the world’s most complex systems to track and reduce its carbon emissions. In addition, Amazon’s internal goal is to be carbon neutral by 2040, investing in renewable energy and a fleet of electric delivery vehicles. If it can achieve this, Amazon can pressure others to meet the same standards and even supply the technology to do so.

(Shortform note: Despite Bezos’s pledge in 2019, Amazon’s carbon footprint grew from 2019-2021, with emissions only dropping in 2022 by less than 1%. In 2023, Amazon dropped its benchmark goal to make half of its deliveries carbon-neutral by 2030. For its environmentally minded customers, Amazon marks sustainably sourced products with a special climate badge on the search results page. Bezos also started the philanthropic Earth Fund with a personal pledge of $10 billion supporting grants for sustainability and conservation projects.)

#### Bezos’s Future Missions

Beyond saving the planet, Bezos believes that humanity’s survival depends on spreading our civilization into space. To foster this, Bezos founded his aerospace startup Blue Origin to develop reusable spacecraft for ferrying astronauts and cargo into orbit, with constant improvements in energy efficiency and cost savings. Bezos says that **to colonize space and thrive there in the future, the groundwork must be laid in the present,** which he hopes to accomplish through his companies’ culture of constant innovation. After all, Bezos points out that Amazon itself wouldn’t exist without the online infrastructure built by the digital pioneers who came before.

> **Still Wandering and Inventing**
> 
> Bezos’s Blue Origin is one of several competing commercial spaceflight companies, including SpaceX and Virgin Galactic. Blue Origin’s reusable New Shepard rocket was grounded after an unmanned launch failure in 2022, though previous flights had successfully carried passengers into suborbital space. Nevertheless, Blue Origin’s larger New Glenn rocket has been selected by NASA to launch a probe to Mars in 2024 and has been tapped to develop a lunar landing module for future manned missions to the moon.
> 
> In 2021, Bezos retired from his role as Amazon CEO, passing the reins to Andy Jassy while remaining in place as the executive chairman of Amazon’s board. He’s made massive stock donations to nonprofits, with plans to divest most of his fortune to philanthropic groups in the future. Meanwhile, Bezos has appointed a new CEO for Blue Origin in the hopes of speeding up its progress in the commercial space race.
