## Exercise: Reframe the Small Stuff

Small worries have the power to take over your thoughts and emotionally exhaust you. Reframe the way you think about them to take away their negative power.

* * *

Describe a small annoyance that’s taking up space in your mind. (For example, it’s been raining for a week, or your child keeps interrupting you while you work from home.)

How can you reframe this irritation as something more pleasant? (For example, you might think about how good the rain is for your garden, or reflect on how working from home gives you valuable time with your family.)
