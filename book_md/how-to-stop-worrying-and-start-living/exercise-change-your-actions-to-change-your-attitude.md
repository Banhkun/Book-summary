## Exercise: Change Your Actions to Change Your Attitude

When faced with a stressful situation, it can be hard to break out of your worrisome thoughts by mental power alone. Adjust your attitude by doing something productive.

* * *

Describe a stressful or worrying situation you’re currently dealing with. (For example, there will be layoffs at your work next month, or you have to get surgery with a long recovery period.)

How are you _worrying_ about the situation? (For example, “What if I’m included in the layoffs? What if I can’t find another job?” or “What if the recovery takes extra time? What if I can’t leave the house?”)

How can you instead _concern_ yourself with the situation and take action? (For example, you freshen up your résumé and start scoping out jobs in your area. Or, you start a new hobby you can continue in recovery and call up your friends to invite them to visit while you’re homebound.)

How do you think these actions will improve your attitude? (For example, updating your résumé reminds you that you have strong, in-demand skills. Scheduling visits with friends gives you an aspect of recovery to look forward to.)
