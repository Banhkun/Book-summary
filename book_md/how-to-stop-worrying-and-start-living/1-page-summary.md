## 1-Page Summary

In the bestselling classic _How To Stop Worrying and Start Living_ , Dale Carnegie—author of _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ —offers timeless advice and practical methods for cultivating a happier, more worry-free mindset.

In this guide, we’ll first explore what causes worry and how it negatively impacts your mental and physical well-being. We’ll then explore Carnegie’s solutions for living a happier, worry-free life in four parts:

  * **Part 1: Focus on One Day at a Time** explores how limiting your focus to the present alleviates worry and promotes mental clarity.
  * **Part 2: Analyze Your Worries** explains how to approach specific worries to calm your concerns and come up with constructive solutions to your problems.
  * **Part 3: Cultivate a Positive Attitude** clarifies how a negative attitude contributes to stress and habitual anxiety and presents methods to approach life more optimistically.
  * **Part 4: Manage Three Common Worry Triggers—Criticism, Work, and Finances** suggests preventative measures against common causes of stress and anxiety.



### Introduction: The Cause and Effect of Worry

To effectively combat worry, it’s important to understand what causes it. According to Carnegie, **the cause of worry is simple: It’s a result of focusing outside of the present** —overthinking the past and harboring anxiety about the future.

(Shortform note: Carnegie’s definition of worry differs slightly from that of psychologists, who assert that all worries, even those focused on the past, concern future events. You only worry about the past in terms of how it might affect your future.)

Each morning, you’re granted a limited amount of time and energy to focus, get things done, and make the best of your day—there’s only so much you can handle mentally and physically. However, Carnegie explains, worrying about the past and future creates _additional_ burdens that use up your limited time and energy and distract you from focusing on what you need to do today.

(Shortform note: Psychologists back up Carnegie’s claim that worrying squanders your mental energy: Worrying triggers neural activity in the regions of the brain required to direct attention and concentrate. The more you worry, the more neural activity it requires—leaving you with insufficient neural resources to concentrate on everyday tasks.)

Carrying the weight of your worries overwhelms you, creates fatigue, and results in irrational thoughts that make small concerns appear more serious than they are. As a result, it creates unnecessary stress and anxiety.

(Shortform note: While it’s true that worry contributes to stress and fatigue, psychological research shows that worry and stress feed off each other—creating more of a _cyclical_ relationship than Carnegie suggests. This is because stress and fatigue reinforce your inclination to worry: Feeling stressed or tired makes you feel overwhelmed and impels you to focus negatively—for example, on what’s not going well or bad things that _could_ happen. This train of thought further increases your worries.)

Though the cause of worry is simple, Carnegie emphasizes that its effects on your health are not. Over time, **even small, daily worries deteriorate your mental and physical health:** you may experience symptoms such as depression, anxiety, ulcers, headaches, insomnia, cardiac issues, diabetes, and rashes.

(Shortform note: Research on stress clarifies how worry contributes to health problems. Worrying tricks your body into believing that you’re in danger and triggers it to release stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones prepare you to fight or flee from “danger” by pumping extra fuel (sugar and fat) into your bloodstream. However, since your worries rarely relate to life-threatening situations that require a burst of physical activity, your body doesn’t use these hormones and fuel. They end up accumulating in your bloodstream and interfering with how your body regulates vital functions—contributing to numerous mental and physical complications as Carnegie suggests.)

### Part 1: Focus on One Day at a Time

Since worry results from focusing outside of the present, Carnegie’s first solution to overcome worry and safeguard your mental and physical health is to practice living one day at a time. Limiting your focus to one day at a time shuts out worries about the past and future and ensures that you only carry one day’s worth of stress at a time. Shedding the weight of your worries preserves your energy, encourages mental clarity, and allows you to manage each day more efficiently. As a result, it cuts unnecessary stress and anxiety from your life.

(Shortform note: According to Eckhart Tolle (_The Power of Now_), focusing on the present moment provides far more benefits than just alleviating worry: It allows you to accept your life as it happens and maintain a feeling of inner peace and happiness. This is because practicing present-moment awareness calms your internal monologue, thus reducing critical thoughts you have about yourself or your experiences. Since your critical thoughts often impede your ability to feel satisfied, quieting them inevitably improves the way you think about yourself and your circumstances. As a result, you find it easier to accept your moments as they occur instead of finding reasons to resist them.)

In addition to reducing stress and anxiety, Carnegie claims that focusing on one day at a time increases your happiness in two ways: First, it allows you to feel more engaged in your present life. Second, it helps you effectively prepare for the future. Let’s explore each of these benefits in more detail.

#### Benefit #1: Living One Day at a Time Helps You Experience Life as It Occurs

Carnegie claims that giving “today” your full attention allows you to engage more deeply with your life as it is now. It’s human nature to dream about the future. However, it’s easy to get lost in your hopes and fantasies for a far-off, attractive future. This future focus impedes your ability to notice and appreciate what’s going well for you _now_ and prevents you from engaging with your daily life in a meaningful and joyful way.

For example, as a child, you’re eager to grow up. As a teen, you're desperate to gain some freedom. In college, you fret about your future. During your career, you resent work and dream about what you’ll do when you retire. Looking back, it’s difficult to remember the joyful moments because you were too focused on the future to experience them as they occurred. On the other hand, focusing on one day at a time helps you appreciate where you are _now_ and engage more meaningfully with your life as it happens.

(Shortform note: While it’s true that being overly focused on the future can distract you from engaging with your life, research suggests that thinking about an ideal future can help you to experience more meaning and satisfaction now. This is because it motivates you to make thoughtful decisions that improve your present experience. However, **this only works if your ideal future requires actions that enhance your life now**. For example, viewing your future self as calm and centered motivates you to work on practicing mindfulness today—thus increasing your ability to find meaning in your life. On the other hand, choosing future goals that require intense effort or sacrifice will make the present feel like nothing but a means to an end.)

#### Benefit #2: Living One Day at a Time Helps You Effectively Prepare for the Future

Carnegie concedes that it’s necessary to _prepare_ for the future, but warns that this isn’t a reason to _focus_ on the future. He explains that a focus on the future is useless for adequate preparation because there’s no such thing as a certain future—the best you can do is try to predict what _might_ happen. Basing plans on predictions wastes your time and energy and impels you to worry about multiple possibilities that you can’t control. This way of thinking clutters your mind and scatters your focus, making it difficult to think constructively about what you have to do today. More importantly, it destroys your chances of enjoying peace of mind _now_.

Instead, he argues, **effective preparation for the future comes from focusing on and making the best of the present**. The _only_ thing you can control in life is the present moment, so the most effective way to prepare for the future is to do tasks to the best of your ability _today_. Over time, this daily commitment to doing your best creates successful results that alleviate future worries for you. For example, instead of worrying if you’ll have enough in your retirement fund in 30 years, focus on ways to start saving today—such as creating a budget.

> **Maintain Presence While Planning for the Future**
> 
> Psychologists agree that worrying about multiple future possibilities can dominate your thoughts and destroy your peace of mind. They suggest two additional ways to make future plans while maintaining present moment awareness.
> 
> **Break the future down into small chunks:** The future feels more uncertain the further ahead you look. Breaking the future down into small manageable chunks, such as one day at a time, narrows the possibilities of what might happen and keeps your thoughts grounded in reality.
> 
> **Practice switching your perspective:** Reconnecting with what you’re working towards makes today’s tasks feel more meaningful. While focusing on doing your best now does improve your future, sometimes it’s difficult to feel engaged or motivated by the work. During these times, think about what you’re working towards—your ideal future—and then refocus on how your work in the present is contributing to it.

### Part 2: Analyze Your Worries

While focusing on one day at a time alleviates worries and offers many advantages, it can be difficult to put into practice, especially when you run into stressful situations. Carnegie argues that in these cases, you can lessen your worry by analyzing your situation. The process of analysis neutralizes negative emotions created by worry—such as fear, panic, or dread—by breaking worrisome situations down to their basic facts. This helps you to view your situation objectively and come up with solutions to resolve your concerns.

(Shortform note: Carnegie’s method of analysis is similar to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which focuses on asking questions to assess the rationality of uncomfortable thoughts about a situation. This process helps you to examine and challenge your worries so that you can find more positive ways to think about your circumstances. The more you question the validity of your worries, the less likely you are to accept them as facts and allow them to rule your emotions.)

Carnegie suggests a three-step process to analyze and constructively resolve your worries: gather objective information, analyze your information, and take action to calm your worry.

#### Step 1: Gather Objective Information

Carnegie suggests gathering all the information you can about the situation to clarify _exactly_ what you’re worried about. Otherwise, you’ll end up focusing on vague possibilities that increase your worries, keep you stuck on “what-ifs,” and lead you to base decisions on false information.

He stresses the importance of gathering _all_ the facts, not just those that confirm your thinking. It’s often tempting to only seek out and use information that validates your assumptions, but this prevents you from seeing the situation from all sides and leads to uninformed decisions. On the other hand, gathering all the information allows you to consider the situation objectively and helps you face your worries constructively. To encourage objectivity, Carnegie suggests pretending you’re gathering facts for a friend or to argue a case in court.

(Shortform note: Research clarifies why you might seek out information that confirms your thinking: Cognitive biases influence the way you judge everything you perceive. Biases are the result of your brain’s attempt to make quick judgments based on your past experiences. While there are many different types of cognitive biases, each influencing you in different ways, they all **restrict your thoughts to what you know and have experienced** —limiting your ability to objectively assess alternative perspectives. Lateral thinking methods—strategies that rely on your imagination—make it easier to consider all sides of a problem. They restrict the influence of cognitive biases because they employ the creative side of your brain: an area where your biases don’t operate.)

#### Step 2: Analyze Your Information

Carnegie suggests writing out all your information so you can easily review and sort through all of the facts. Use the information to pin down exactly what you’re worried about—that is, define the situation you want to resolve. Then, ask yourself what you can do to resolve the situation. List all the possible solutions you can think of and decide which will have the best possible outcome.

> **Define Worries and Find Solutions by Asking Strategic Questions**
> 
> Tony Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) offers a practical way to sort through the facts to define your worry and come up with solutions: Ask yourself problem-solving questions:
> 
>   * **What’s good about this situation?** This shifts your mindset from being worried about the circumstance to what you can learn from it.
> 
>   * **What needs improvement?** This question looks for ways to resolve your worry, presupposing your circumstances will improve.
> 
>   * **What am I willing to do to improve the situation?** This question generates specific actions toward resolution.
> 
>   * **What am I willing to stop doing to improve the situation?** This question identifies disempowering habits getting in the way of resolution.
> 
>   * **How can I enjoy the resolution process?** This question encourages you to find pleasure in resolving the cause of your worries and motivates you to take immediate action.
> 
> 


#### Step 3: Take Action to Calm Your Worry

Once you’ve decided on a solution, Carnegie recommends taking immediate action. Delaying prolongs your worries and may give you time to second-guess yourself. On the other hand, taking immediate action focuses your energy on the solution and strengthens your confidence to follow through with it.

It’s important to note that taking immediate action doesn’t mean solving the entire problem at once—Carnegie suggests you start on what you _can_ do. For example, if you’re worried about your health and decide to change your unhealthy habits, you can’t revamp your entire lifestyle right away. However, you _can_ start cutting soda out of your diet immediately.

(Shortform note: When faced with a large problem, you may feel that a small, achievable task isn’t immediate or significant enough to make a dent in your problem. However, in _The Kaizen Way_ , psychologist Rober Maurer affirms that you’ll find it easier to overcome your problems if you begin by taking a very _small step_ toward the large solution you intend to achieve. He adds insight into why this increases your chances of success: Small actions are more likely to bypass your brain’s instinctive reaction to resist focusing on unwanted tasks because they’re easy to commit to and implement. For example, it’s easy to find multiple excuses to avoid going for a 30-minute run but not so easy to resist jogging on the spot for one minute.)

### Part 3: Cultivate a Positive Attitude

Now that you understand how analysis combats _specific_ stressors, let’s discuss how cultivating a positive attitude inhibits _nonspecific_ worries and general anxieties. According to Carnegie, vague worries and anxieties require this different approach because they’re difficult to analyze. This is because they don’t stem from actual circumstances—specific issues that you can gather facts about.

Rather, these worries stem from a negative attitude. He explains that **your attitude determines how you perceive and react to your circumstances.** The more negative your attitude and the more pessimistically you approach life, the more worry and anxiety you feel: You perceive small issues as large concerns, react by worrying incessantly, and focus on what you _don’t_ have. On the other hand, the more positive your attitude and the more optimistically you approach life, the less power worry has over you: You find it easier to ignore small issues, react to real concerns rationally and productively, and remain focused on what’s going well in your life.

(Shortform note: Neil Pasricha (_The Happiness Equation_) mirrors Carnegie’s argument that your worries spring from a negative attitude. He clarifies why you might be inclined to think negatively, despite knowing its drawbacks: To ensure survival, your ancestors had to constantly stay alert to danger and think about food and shelter. Letting their guard down made them vulnerable to predators and competitors. Though you don’t face the same risks now, your instinct to avoid danger hasn’t evolved. However, instead of protecting you from threats to your survival, this instinct now encourages you to focus on “threats” such as what you don’t have and what needs to improve. This negative focus convinces you that you have endless reasons to feel worried and unhappy.)

Carnegie suggests two approaches to cultivate a positive attitude and suppress the influence of vague worries and anxieties: Manage your attitude toward irritations and concerns, and adopt new habits to maintain a positive attitude. Let’s explore these methods in more detail.

#### Approach #1: Manage Your Attitude Toward Irritations and Concerns

Small concerns and irritations can easily escalate into worrisome situations when you fail to nip them in the bud. In this approach, Carnegie offers four ways to reframe your thoughts about these issues so that you can approach them positively and prevent unnecessary worry from taking root in your mind.

**Think rationally:** Assess the likelihood of your worries occurring in reality. Carnegie explains that your imagination inspires worries that rarely come to pass. Questioning their likelihood interrupts your imagination from taking over and encourages rational thoughts that ground you in reality.

(Shortform note: Research backs up Carnegie’s claim that most worries rarely occur in reality. A recent study revealed that 91.4% of the things we worry about don’t come true.)

**Focus constructively:** Consider how to mitigate, improve, or learn from your concerns. Carnegie argues that reacting emotionally to issues magnifies their importance—thus, exacerbating your worry. On the other hand, thinking objectively about what you can do to improve or learn from these issues calms down your negative emotions and prevents unimportant matters from escalating into large problems. This process trains you to focus on what you can control to better your circumstances—providing opportunities to make the best out of _any_ situation.

(Shortform note: Stephen Covey (_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_) suggests a practical way to think objectively and make the best out of your circumstances. When faced with a problem, think about what steps you can personally take toward solving it. This helps you more easily distinguish between concerns beyond your control (like your kids getting sick) and issues you can improve or solve (like organizing to work from home so you can take care of them.)

**Accept the past:** Forgive and forget unwanted past experiences. Carnegie argues that ruminating on the past is useless. No amount of worrying changes what you or others have said or done in the past. However, these worries clutter your mind and contribute to feelings of stress in your present. Accepting that everyone makes mistakes—you included—helps you let go of the past and release unnecessary tension. This helps you focus productively on what you can do now to better your circumstances and make the best out of your present.

(Shortform note: Covey offers a complementary way to move forward from concerns about the past: Be accountable for your regrets. Instead of dwelling on unwanted experiences, reflect on _how you can change_ to avoid repeating them. Making a conscious attempt to understand the contributing factors to your regretful experiences illuminates how to avoid repeat scenarios: If your regret relates to your actions, alter your behavior. If it relates to other people’s actions, alter the way you communicate with others.)

**Set limits:** Determine how much time and energy you’re willing to spend worrying about habitual issues by weighing up how much you _care_ about them. Carnegie suggests that this process forces you to consider how much time these small matters are really _worth_ and prevents you from wasting unnecessary energy on habitual worries and frustrations.

(Shortform note: Once you’ve determined how much time and energy a worry deserves, psychologists recommend sticking to your limit by scheduling a time for it and setting a timer. As long as the timer’s running, feel free to worry to your heart’s content. But, as soon as the timer goes off, redirect your focus to something more productive.)

#### Approach #2: Adopt New Habits to Maintain a Positive Attitude

We’ve just discussed how to positively approach day-to-day issues in a way that alleviates worry. In this approach, Carnegie broadens the scope and suggests practical ways to focus your attention on maintaining a generally positive attitude. The more positive your attitude is, the easier it is to deal with irritations and concerns without feeling worried. He suggests four ways to maintain a positive attitude:

**Be yourself:** Feel comfortable with who you are. According to Carnegie, striving to be someone different by imitating others makes you feel anxious and unhappy. He suggests that you can resolve this tension by developing and expressing the skills, passions, and interests that make you who you are.

(Shortform note: Psychologists confirm that authenticity (the ability to express who you really are) is essential to your overall sense of well-being. Studies reveal that authentic people are generally happier than inauthentic people because they experience more positive emotions, have higher self-esteem, enjoy better relationships, feel more satisfied, and have lower stress levels.)

**Be too busy to worry:** Occupy your mind with productive and positive thoughts by keeping yourself mentally and physically busy. Carnegie claims that it’s impossible to think of more than one thing at a time. Therefore, it’s impossible for negative (pessimistic) thoughts to intrude on your mind if it’s already occupied with positive (optimistic) thoughts.

(Shortform note: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (_Flow_) clarifies how keeping productive inhibits negative or worrisome thoughts. The more you direct your attention on a task, the more absorbed you feel in what you’re doing. Beyond focusing your mind on positive thoughts, as Carnegie suggests, this sense of absorption connects you to the _present moment._ This makes it difficult for your mind to wander and get distracted by thoughts about the past or future—where, as we’ve seen, worry and anxiety live.)

**Practice kindness:** Commit to doing at least one good deed every day. Carnegie explains that thinking of ways to benefit others offers two advantages. First, it distracts you from thinking about yourself and your worries. Second, acknowledging your positive impact on others makes you feel good about yourself.

(Shortform note: Scientific research confirms that practicing kindness does make you feel good about yourself. When you give (knowledge, assistance, time, or money) with the intention of helping others, you activate the same parts of your brain that are stimulated by pleasurable activities such as eating good food or having great sex.)

**Have faith:** Develop your spiritual connection to a higher power by engaging in quiet reflection and prayer. According to Carnegie, belief in a higher power coupled with regular contemplation and prayer alleviates worry because it makes you feel supported. It provides an outlet to share your fears and concerns and helps you articulate and understand the cause of your worries. This cathartic process calms down anxiety and makes worries feel more manageable—making it easier to find solutions to resolve your worries and maintain a positive attitude.

(Shortform note: Research studies confirm that prayer calms your nervous system and makes you less reactive to negative emotions. Like Carnegie claims, it fosters a sense of connection (with a higher power, the environment, and other people), allows you to feel emotionally supported, and encourages you to let go of your worries for a time. If the idea of praying to a higher power makes you feel uncomfortable, researchers recommend imagining yourself having a heart-to-heart conversation with someone you trust. This will allow you to benefit from the positive effects of prayer without giving your mind something to resist.)

> **Positivity Takes Practice**
> 
> The process to cultivate a positive attitude may not be as easy as Carnegie makes out—the approaches discussed in this chapter, while useful, skim over the need for some deeper reflection.
> 
> Changing your mindset is challenging because your thoughts and your attitude reinforce one another to create an internal feedback loop that’s difficult to break out of: **Your thoughts determine your attitude** (dwelling on worries makes you feel pessimistic) and **your attitude determines your thoughts**(you feel pessimistic so you dwell on your worries).
> 
> Research reveals that making an effort to become more aware of your thoughts allows you to disentangle yourself from this feedback loop. Instead of feeling as if you’re stuck within an uncontrollable cycle of worries, **your awareness allows you to change your thoughts objectively**. Pairing this conscious reflection with Carnegie’s methods can greatly improve your success in cultivating a more positive attitude.

### Part 4: Manage Three Common Worry Triggers—Criticism, Work, and Finances

We’ve just discussed how to cultivate a positive attitude and alleviate general worries and concerns. An added benefit of adopting a worry-free attitude is that it frees up mental energy to address habitual causes of stress and anxiety that may crop up in your life. Carnegie identifies three habitual worry triggers—criticism, work, and finances. In this final part of the guide, we’ll suggest ways to manage and neutralize anxieties triggered by each of these three areas.

#### Manage Worry About Criticism

Most people, when criticized, react negatively—becoming angry and defensive or worried about what others think of them. Carnegie argues that criticism has the potential to teach valuable lessons and reacting negatively prevents you from learning them. Learning to control your reactions to criticism prevents negative emotions from spiraling out of control and helps you benefit from what it has to teach you.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Thanks for the Feedback_ clarify why managing your response to criticism is important. Your ability to succeed, both personally and professionally, depends in large part on your ability to seek, understand, and incorporate feedback into your life. Individuals who control their negative response to feedback enjoy many benefits: They have happier relationships, find it easier to adapt to their circumstances, and feel more satisfied at work.)

He suggests three ways to control your negative reactions, create less stress, and benefit from criticism:

**Critique yourself:** Carnegie recommends regularly examining and criticizing yourself to build awareness of areas to improve. This helps you learn from your mistakes privately instead of publicly and prepares you to receive criticism from others more constructively.

(Shortform note: Social psychologists offer some practical advice on critiquing yourself _constructively_ : Don’t focus on finding fault with _who you are_ —this makes you feel powerless to change your behavior and more sensitive to criticism. For example, believing that you’ll never be good at something because you’re not intelligent. Instead, criticize specific, changeable behaviors. Focusing on modifiable behaviors directs you to specific actions you can take to improve both yourself and your circumstances—and it helps you to respond more rationally to criticism. For example, realizing that you’re not good at something because you haven’t learned the basics.)

**Consider the critic’s intention:** Carnegie suggests considering the intention behind the criticism—is it to help or berate you? If the intention is to help you, accept it as legitimate and ask yourself what you can learn from it. If it’s to berate you, remember that people often dish out unfair criticism in an attempt to feel more powerful and important. Reframe this sort of unjustified criticism as a compliment because you’re clearly doing something that’s _worth_ their attention.

(Shortform note: Psychologists suggest a way to judge, learn from, and resolve your feelings about any criticism you receive. Split a sheet of paper into four columns. In the first column, write down the criticism word for word without imposing your interpretation over it. In the second column, write down everything that upsets you about the feedback. In the third column, write down why the critic might be right—consider her perspective and what you can learn from it. Finally, in the fourth column, write down what you’ll do next—you might apply the feedback, ask for clarification on what you can improve, or decide that the criticism’s not worth getting upset over and let it go.)

**React by doing what feels right to you:** While it’s tempting to please critics in an attempt to avoid future criticism, Carnegie argues that it’s a waste of time. No matter what you do, someone will find a reason to criticize you. He suggests basing your decisions and actions on what’s right for you. Acting according to your own judgment increases self-confidence and decreases the tendency to worry about other people’s opinions.

(Shortform note: Another way to think about this is to consider what’s motivating you. Some experts believe that all behavior is driven by the need to fulfill one of two motivation types: intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from your internal self: You engage in an activity because it makes _you_ happy (for example, you blog about topics that interest you regardless of whether or not your content attracts subscribers). Extrinsic motivation comes from your environment: You engage in an activity because you receive an external reward for doing it and it’s what _others_ want from you (for example, you blog about topics that _don’t_ interest you because you’re afraid your subscribers will lose interest).)

#### Manage Worry About Work

It’s important to get a handle on work-related worries because you spend so much of your time and energy at work. When work-related worries build up, they create stress that impacts your ability to enjoy all aspects of your life. Carnegie suggests two methods to reduce your worries about work and boost your overall happiness.

(Shortform note: Career experts clarify how work-related worries impact your ability to enjoy other aspects of your life. First, as we’ve previously discussed, stress creates a number of health problems that impact your ability to relax and feel happy. Additionally, the stress you feel at work bleeds over into your personal life—it undermines your confidence, lowers your motivation, impacts your ability to relate to others, and damages your sex life. All of these effects prove that it’s worth getting a handle on work-related stress if you want to experience more happiness and satisfaction in your life.)

##### Method #1: Make Work More Enjoyable

Boring work is a significant source of negative emotions such as resentment, frustration, and worry. On the other hand, enjoyable work significantly improves your health and overall happiness. It also gives you a competitive edge because you willingly spend time mastering skills that you enjoy—leading to further advantageous career opportunities.

(Shortform note: According to research in the area of positive psychology, Carnegie’s advice to seek out enjoyable work also improves your chances of achieving career success. You’re more likely to feel motivated and experience increased happiness and satisfaction when you pursue career goals that genuinely interest you. This positive mental state allows you to access the best parts of yourself—your unique strengths and talents—and apply them to successfully achieve your goals.)

Even if you don’t particularly like your job, you can consciously make it more enjoyable—he suggests three ways to achieve this.

**Add interest and challenge to your work:** Set goals for yourself or take on extra, more interesting projects alongside your regular work. These small changes often lead to _genuine_ enjoyment that makes you _want_ to work. As a result, your productivity increases and gets noticed by employers—creating opportunities for more interesting promotions.

(Shortform note: Gretchen Rubin (_The Happiness Project_) clarifies how adding interest and challenge to your work leads to enjoyment. First, tackling additional tasks requires extra mental effort that engages your mind. Recall: Mental engagement prevents negative thoughts and worries from intruding on your thoughts. Second, you’re more likely to feel engaged in a task that you’re genuinely interested in. Third, successfully tackling each task increases feelings of self-satisfaction and pride. This combination of engagement, satisfaction, and pride increases your enjoyment at work and your overall happiness.)

**Reflect on how lucky you are:** Remember that you’re lucky to have a job and the income it provides. Reframing your thoughts about work so that they’re as positive as possible boosts self-confidence and motivation and prepares you to approach obstacles with a positive attitude.

(Shortform note: Interestingly, research in neuroscience and positive psychology shows that Carnegie’s method of positively reframing your thoughts about work will heighten your feelings of satisfaction in _all_ areas of your life. According to Shawn Achor (_The Happiness Advantage_), positive thoughts train your brain to find opportunities in adversity and to easily overcome challenges and setbacks. This creates positive momentum in your life and fuels further opportunities to feel happy and satisfied.)

**Pursue enjoyable work:** According to Carnegie, the ideal way to combat work worries is to work in a job you genuinely enjoy. You can change your line of work at any time and make use of your transferable skills.**** There’s no excuse to feel stuck in a single career because there are many fields you can succeed in if you apply yourself.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Designing Your Life_ suggest two ways to find enjoyable work and ease your transition to a new career: First, conduct informational interviews to gain insider information about the career or company you’re interested in. Second, arrange work experience—such as volunteer work or an internship—to get a visceral feel for the job role or company. Both methods provide opportunities to expand your professional network, and they allow you to test out the pros and cons of a new career without having to quit your current job.)

##### Method #2: Establish Constructive Work Habits

Even when you enjoy your work, poor organization and lack of rest can still trigger unnecessary worry. In this method, Carnegie suggests three practical ways to reduce daily work-related stress.

**Rest and relax:** Take regular moments of rest _before_ you’re tired to prevent fatigue, increase efficiency, promote constructive thinking, and make yourself less susceptible to worry. Accomplish this by scheduling frequent breaks into your day. Additionally, reduce physical tension by regularly checking in with your body to identify tight or stiff muscles. Then consciously relax those muscles.

(Shortform note: Research into ultradian rhythms clarifies how taking frequent breaks improves your ability to focus constructively. When your mind’s at work, your brain and body burn sources of energy such as oxygen and glucose. This process creates metabolic waste that accumulates in your system and leads to feelings of fatigue, stress, and irritability. These feelings impede your ability to focus and make you susceptible to worrisome thoughts. Taking 20-minute breaks every 90 minutes allows your body to flush this waste out of your system, restore your energy sources, and revive your ability to direct your focus.)

**Reduce physical and mental clutter:** Remove _everything_ from your desk, except for whatever needs your immediate attention. This eliminates distracting, worrying reminders of everything you need to get done and lets you focus on one problem at a time.

(Shortform note: James Clear (_Atomic Habits_) clarifies how reducing clutter aids your focus. He argues that visual cues in your environment shape your focus and instigate action by tricking your brain into thinking that it’s convenient to act on them. For example, email pop-ups trigger you to automatically check emails. Without them, opening emails requires a conscious decision. Likewise, clearing your desk of all distractions and leaving just one project on your desk makes it convenient to focus your full attention on that single task—removing the need to make a conscious decision to do it.)

Likewise, avoid cluttering your mind: Deal with issues, questions, and problems as soon as they come up. If you can’t attend to them immediately, schedule a specific time to deal with them so that you’re not tempted to mull over them all day.

(Shortform note: Pasricha (_The Happiness Equation_) offers an interesting way to expand upon Carnegie’s method: _Eliminate unnecessary decisions_. He argues that you make hundreds of trivial decisions each day that don’t make you feel happier or help you achieve your goals. Instead, they contribute to feelings of stress and overwhelm because they waste your time and deplete your energy. To eliminate these trivial decisions, first track all of the decisions you make in a day and identify the ones that don’t impact your happiness or goals. Then, consider how to remove them. For example, instead of wasting time deciding how to sign off every email, automate the task by creating a default email signature.)

**Prioritize and delegate tasks:** Plan ahead and schedule each day to accomplish obligations in order of their importance. Knowing your priorities allows you to focus energy on what needs to get done and reduces worries caused by inefficient action. Delegate anything that doesn’t require your personal attention. Entrusting others to help reduces your workload and gives you less to worry about.

> **How to Prioritize Tasks**
> 
> Like Carnegie, Brian Tracy (_Eat That Frog!_) recommends that you prioritize tasks to avoid unnecessary stress. He suggests a practical way to determine which tasks are important and which ones don’t require your attention: Prioritize your to-do list using the ABCDE labeling method. List all of your tasks and label each as follows:
> 
> **A—must do:** Not doing these critical tasks _will_ create serious negative consequences. For example, meeting an essential deadline.
> 
> **B—should do:** Not doing these necessary tasks _may_ create negative consequences. For example, returning a non-critical call.
> 
> **C—would be nice to do:** These tasks don’t impact your goals and don’t matter. For example, attending general meetings with no specific agenda.
> 
> **D—to delegate** : These tasks don’t need your personal input. For example, responding to general inquiries that an assistant can handle.
> 
> **E—to eliminate:** These tasks are unnecessary distractions. For example, checking emails every fifteen minutes.

#### Manage Worry About Finances

Money is an essential need so it’s no surprise that it triggers feelings of worry. It’s easy to assume that _lack_ of money creates worry and that having _more_ money resolves your concerns. Carnegie argues that lack of money isn’t to blame for your worries. Rather, poor financial management, overspending, and focusing on what you _don’t_ have triggers worry. If you don’t rectify these causes, your finances will always trigger worry, no matter how much you have. He suggests two methods to improve your attitude toward what you have, keep your finances under control, and ease your financial worries: control your expenses and create financial security.

(Shortform note: Ramit Sethi (_I Will Teach You to Be Rich_) also argues that good financial management resolves common concerns about money, but concedes that it can be challenging to get a handle on your spending. According to him, there’s a psychological reason underlying the tendency to mismanage money: decision paralysis. You become too overwhelmed to make decisions about your finances when you’re presented with multiple options and opinions about the best way to move forward. To move past this, he recommends that you switch your focus from information-gathering and start taking small _proactive_ steps—such as those we’ll explore in this section—to manage your money more effectively.)

##### Method #1: Control Your Expenses

Carnegie suggests three ways to build awareness of where your money goes, encourage conscious spending habits, and create a sense of security and control to alleviate worries about your expenses.

1) Write down _everything_ you spend your money on for at least one month and then tailor a budget suited to your specific needs.

2) Consider the value of intended purchases in terms of how necessary they are to your well-being—will these things make you happy or create unnecessary debt and worry? Then, research your intended purchases to ensure you get good value for your money.

(Shortform note: Sethi (_I Will Teach You to Be Rich_) adds to this advice by recommending that you use the Mint app to track your spending and the You Need a Budget app to control your expenses. Additionally, he suggests that you focus on spending mindfully: Split your expenses into four areas (fixed costs, investments, savings, and guilt-free spending), decide in advance how much you want to spend in each area, then allocate a portion of your income to each. He argues that this process allows you to spend a portion of your income in any way you wish, even if that includes unnecessary expenses. While this goes against common financial advice, you’re more likely to stick to a budget if you don’t feel like you’re constantly depriving yourself.)

3) Apply for loans only if you can afford to stay up to date with your repayments and maintain a good credit history.

(Shortform note: David Bach (_The Automatic Millionaire_) offers additional advice on reducing stress around loans: Accelerate your repayments. Paying more than the minimum required amount each month cuts the length of time you’re in debt and reduces the total amount of interest you pay.)

##### Method #2: Create Financial Security

Carnegie suggests three ways to protect and build your income to create peace of mind about your financial future.

1) Allocate extra income to savings accounts to create financial security and prevent unintentional overspending.

(Shortform note: Bach (_The Automatic Millionaire_) adds to this advice by suggesting that you arrange to automatically save at least 10% of your gross (before tax) income _before_ you have a chance to spend it. He claims that you’ll quickly get used to living without this money so won’t feel tempted to spend it—and you’ll effortlessly build your financial security.)

2) Safeguard against financial misfortunes by arranging insurance to cover you in unexpected events.

(Shortform note: Scott Pape (_The Barefoot Investor_) provides practical advice on what types of things you should insure: If losing something doesn’t affect your financial security, don’t insure it. For example, if your tablet breaks, you’ll probably be able to replace it without putting yourself at a financial disadvantage. On the other hand, if losing something risks your financial security, you should insure it. For example, if your work computer gets stolen, you’ll lose your ability to work until you purchase a replacement—both factors are likely to put you out of pocket.)

3) Increase your financial security by earning additional income. Consider how to turn your skills and knowledge into a profitable business that fits into your current schedule.

(Shortform note: Carnegie doesn’t elaborate on __ how to turn your skills and knowledge into a profitable business. There are a few practical steps you can take to start earning money on the side: First, identify what you're good at and enjoy doing. Next, identify profitable opportunities in high-growth areas that you’re interested in. Finally, explore ways that you can use your talents to add value to these areas. For example, if you’re good at organizing and you enjoy looking at healthy recipes, there are multiple businesses you can create from this combination, such as a meal-planning service for people who want to lose weight or are on special diets.)
