## Exercise: Make Lemonade

Setbacks become less worrisome when you focus on the valuable lessons they can teach you.

* * *

Describe a current or recent setback. (For example, you got hit with a huge unexpected expense, or your relationship just ended.)

What lessons can you draw from this experience? (For example, you learned how to make a monthly budget and now understand the necessity of an emergency fund. Or, being single is allowing you to learn more about your individual interests and what you want from your next relationship.)

What _positive_ outcome can you draw from this setback? (For example, you were forced to examine your spending which revealed many ways you can save more money. Or, you now have the opportunity to start a relationship with someone whose values better align with yours.)
