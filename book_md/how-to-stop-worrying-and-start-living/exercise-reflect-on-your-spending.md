## Exercise: Reflect on Your Spending

Many people are guilty of “lifestyle creep”—responding to increased income with increased spending on unwise purchases.

* * *

What did your spending look like before your most recent income increase? (For example, going out to eat was a once-a-month luxury, you bought a lot of your clothes from thrift shops, and you lived in a small studio apartment.)

How did your spending habits change once your income increased? (For example, you order takeout for lunch nearly every day and go out for dinner on the weekends, you impulsively buy new clothing, and you recently moved into a bigger apartment in a better neighborhood.)

Which “lifestyle creep” spending can you cut out? Which spending is justified? (For example, you can cut back on going out to eat and takeout, and you know that thrift shopping is much more eco-friendly than buying all-new clothing. Moving to a larger apartment in a better neighborhood is justified as it’s significantly improved your sense of well-being.)
