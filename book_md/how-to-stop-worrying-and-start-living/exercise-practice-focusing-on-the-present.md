## Exercise: Practice Focusing on the Present

Too often, we focus on the unchangeable past and the far-off future rather than fully living in the certain present.

* * *

Describe one way that ruminating on the past disrupts your ability to live in the present. (For example, you worry that you made a bad first impression on a colleague, so you’re withdrawn and uncomfortable while talking to him in the present.)

How can you consciously pull this thought of the past into the present? (For example, “Joe wouldn’t try to chat with me if I’d made a bad first impression. Starting now, I’ll assume he likes me and reciprocate his friendliness.”)

Describe one way that focusing on the future is distracting you from living in the present. (For example, you constantly daydream about moving from the city to the countryside, causing you to miss out on all your city has to offer.)

How can you consciously refocus your thoughts away from the far-off future and onto today? (For example, “I’d _like_ to spend my evening on the porch of a farmhouse, but that’s not where I am right now. Let’s see what interesting events are happening nearby tonight.”)
