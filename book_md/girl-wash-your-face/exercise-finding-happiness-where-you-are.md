## Exercise: Finding Happiness Where You Are

We easily fall into the trap of thinking something else will make us happy.

* * *

The author thought leaving her small town behind and arriving in Los Angeles would make her happy, but her internal struggles followed her. Have you ever made a change in your life that you thought would solve all your problems? What was the change?

When you made the change, did your life improve? Were you happy, or did any internal pain or insecurity remain that you were hoping would disappear? Identify the main thing you feel is holding you back from happiness.

What is an internal change you can take right now to choose happiness instead of chase it?
