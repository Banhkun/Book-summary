## Part 6: Final Thoughts

The thought of his children growing up without him was one of the most difficult for Pausch to bear. Because they were too young for deep conversations about life and death, he simply tried to create memories that would later remind them of his love for them.

Besides spending as much time as possible with them, he created adventures for each child—for instance, he and Dylan went swimming with dolphins. In addition to creating a photo and video record of their times together, Pausch wrote out lists of what he loved about each child. He made videos telling each child what they meant to him.

He admired his son Dylan for being loving and empathetic in trying to comfort other children when they were hurt. He also liked Dylan’s analytical bent, curiosity, and his habit of noticing things and asking detailed questions. Pausch cited his son Logan’s physicality, energy, and gregariousness. He saw Logan as “the ultimate Tigger,” willing to try anything and easily making friends with whomever he met. Though his daughter Chloe was still a baby, Pausch delighted in how different she was from her brothers, for instance, how careful and delicate.

It was important to Pausch not to impose his own dreams on his children, but to let them discover their own paths. As a professor, he’d counseled many students who had chosen majors that pleased their parents and ended up being miserable. His message to his children was: **be what _you_ want to be. Pursue your own dreams and do what brings you joy, regardless of anyone’s expectations**. His hope was that they’d feel his presence with them on whatever path they chose.

Pausch and his wife spent time talking about what her life would be like after he died. He was grateful that his illness, unlike sudden death from a car accident, allowed him time to have those conversations. He urged her to take time for herself, to accept mistakes and forgive herself, to find role models for the children, and to do what makes her happy.

### Dreams Will Come

To wrap up his Last Lecture, Pausch had put his final points on slides in case he became too emotional to speak them. Yet when the time comes to conclude his talk, he feels at peace for having finally said what he most urgently needed to say. In effect, he’d let it all out.

Hiis closing remarks are a summation of his life. Achieving your dreams, he says, isn’t so much about chasing them as about living your life properly. If you do that, “your dreams will come to you.”

He ends with a slide picturing his family, and acknowledges that his talk hadn’t been only for those in the audience, but for his children.

Randy Pausch died on July 25, 2008, at age 47.
