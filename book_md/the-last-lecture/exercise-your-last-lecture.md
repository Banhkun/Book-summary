## Exercise: Your Last Lecture

Carnegie Mellon University and others have a tradition of inviting professors to present a “Last Lecture,” as though it were their last chance to share personal and professional life lessons.

* * *

If you were invited to give a “Last Lecture,” what would your title be? What sentence or phrase sums up your life so far?

Think of a memorable life lesson you could include in your “last lecture.” Was it a success or failure? What was it?

If you knew you had only a few months to live, what would your No. 1 priority be and why?
