## Chapter 6: Connecting the Small to the Systemic

In Chapter 1, we saw that racism is systemic, and examined how its smaller and seemingly more harmless manifestations are linked at the deepest level to the most aggressive and damaging ones. In this chapter, we’ll look in more detail at why racist incidents are not isolated events.

We’ll look at microaggressions, including tone policing, and cultural appropriation to peer beneath the surface of things that may look trivial at first glance.

### What Are Microaggressions?

Microaggressions are **subtle acts of psychological violence against a person because they belong to a marginalized group.** Microaggressions can be directed toward any group (can be racist, sexist, transphobic, and so on), but in this guide we’re specifically talking about racist microaggressions.

Microaggressions can appear harmless on the surface, which makes it easy to deny responsibility or say that someone is overreacting. (Shortform note: In fact, this ambiguity makes things even more stressful for people of color. One 2012 study showed that interacting with a white person who showed subtle racial bias impaired the cognitive functioning of black and Latino participants, while interacting with someone who showed obvious racial bias didn’t.)

#### Types of Microaggressions

Racist microaggressions can be verbal (racist jokes, comments, insults, backhanded compliments, and minimizations) or nonverbal (hair touching, purse clutching, following a customer around in a store, locking car doors as someone passes, overzealous airport security checks, and taxis that don’t stop).

Microaggressions can be indirect. For example, they can present as compliments: “Wow, your English is perfect!”, or “Your hair is so wild and crazy! I love it!”, or “You’re so lucky you’re black. You’ll have no problems getting into college.”

Microaggressions can also be unintentional. Often, people genuinely don’t mean them to be offensive. For example, holding your purse closer when a person of color walks past may be an unconscious reflex, and people who ask “Where are you from?” may be showing their genuine curiosity about people from other places.

(Shortform note: As linguist Robin Lakoff notes, the indirectness and ambiguous intentions of these comments make them particularly difficult to parse: The surface layer seems to be positive, or at least innocent, but the underlying assumption is negative.)

#### The Insidious Nature of Microaggressions

Microaggressions are linked to more extreme forms of racism because they’re both manifestations of the same system.**Microaggressions reveal implicit bias and racist assumptions that might otherwise stay hidden.**(Shortform note: Studies have confirmed this. For example, white people who self-reported as more likely to make a range of microaggressive comments showed significantly more racial prejudice than those who reported that they would not make those comments. The phrase that best predicted feelings of hostility toward black people was “A lot of minorities are too sensitive.”)

As Oluo explains,**the effects of microaggressions are cumulative.** While any single one might be easily shaken off, they add up they create a burden that makes it difficult to function effectively. (Shortform note: Microaggressions have been shown to affect both the mental and physical health of people of color, including Latino Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. These negative health outcomes include pain, fatigue, increased frequency of heart attacks, and symptoms of depression.)

#### How to Deal With Microaggressions

**If you get called out on a microaggression** , Oluo suggests that you stop and think. Question whether an unconsciously racist assumption might have been activated. Ask yourself: “Would I have said this to someone of the same race as me?” Remember that racial trauma is cumulative, and what you did is just one incident in a long line of similar incidents. Apologize, even if you don’t fully understand what you did wrong, and seek more information afterwards on why what you did was offensive.

> **How Can You Tell Whether Something is a Microaggression?**
> 
> If you’re a white person and you feel unsure about whether you might accidentally commit a microaggression, it’s a good idea to do some research first. This Business Insider article lists 14 common microaggressions, explains why each is damaging, and provides suggestions for what to say instead. (Unsurprisingly, the most common suggestion is “say nothing.”) For example:
> 
>   * Microaggression: “You’re so articulate.”
> 
>   * Problem: This rests on an assumption that people of color will by default be less able to express themselves. It also feeds into assumptions about the intellect and leadership capacity of people of color.
> 
>   * To say instead: Feel free to comment positively on the content of the contribution that the person has made, but refrain from linking this to their personal qualities.
> 
> 


**If you’re the victim of a microaggression** , Oluo suggests that you state what happened clearly. (For example, “You assumed I don’t speak English.”) You can also ask some awkward questions: “Why would you say that?” or “I don’t get it. Can you explain it to me?” Remind the person that good intentions aren’t a sufficient defense: “If you really have good intentions, you’ll stop saying this to people who look like me.”

> **Pre-Prepare Some Responses to Microaggressions**
> 
> The Oregon Center for Educational Equity suggests that you prepare a few responses to future racist comments, because freezing up in these situations is common for both white people and people of color. Their sheet of interruptions provides a range of possible responses (some of which are more appropriate to specific types of situations than others). Suggested interruptions include “That’s not funny to me. It sounds racist,” “That’s curious. It sounded like you just said ____ ,” and “I have no idea if you realize the impact of those words.” The authors suggest that you choose a few, memorize them, and then pull them out if you’re a witness to or the victim of a microaggression and can’t think of anything to say.

#### Linking the Literal and the Symbolic

As we’ve seen, microaggressions are important because they act as signposts for problematic assumptions.

In addition to this, **microaggressions often have a metaphorical component** that only becomes evident when we think about them carefully. Small actions can be imbued with symbolic meaning. Two examples of this are hair touching and tone policing.

##### Hair Touching

For Oluo and her friends of color, having people reach out to touch their hair is **one of the more common and obnoxious microaggressions**. As Oluo notes, some of the reasons why hair touching is inappropriate are practical. It’s unhygienic: Hair is dirty, hands are dirty, and touching someone else’s hair is generally kind of gross. You might also mess up the style. Curls are labor-intensive and time-consuming to create, but easy to destroy with a careless touch.

Other reasons have to do with basic bodily autonomy. **Touching someone without their consent is simply not acceptable.** We teach our kids this. Would you walk up to someone and touch them on the shoulder just to see what it felt like? So why would you do that to their hair? (Shortform note: One suggested response to unwanted hair touching might be to do the same thing to the other person and see how they like it.)

And some of the reasons are linked to the racist history of this country. **Black bodies have been exotic curiosities** ever since the first slaves arrived. They were appraised, abused, exploited, and exoticized. Wanting to touch a black woman’s hair because it looks exotic to you is participating in this. And**black bodies were considered property.** By reaching out to touch someone’s hair without their permission, you’re asserting that that person is yours to touch and play with. (Shortform note: Kalonda Mulamba discusses the history of white people’s oppressive attitudes toward black hair in this Medium article, adding that natural black hair can be seen as a form of resistance to white imperialism.)

> **Hair Touching: A Pervasive Problem**
> 
> The hair touching that black women endure is so frequent that it’s regularly mentioned in pop culture. It’s the subject of a song by Solange Knowles and a video game by Momo Pixel. It’s a problem outside the US as well: UK-based speaker, diversity facilitator, and entrepreneur Dr. Mena Fombo, for example, has given a TED talk discussing her experiences of unwanted hair touching.
> 
> In her song about this issue, “Don’t Touch My Hair,” Solange Knowles sings:
> 
> "They don't understand
> 
> What it means to me
> 
> Where we chose to go
> 
> Where we've been to know"
> 
> These lyrics arguably suggest an additional reason why white people shouldn’t touch black women’s hair: because they don’t realize the history and culture that this hair represents.

##### Tone Policing __

Oluo also explains the practice of tone policing:**a series of strategies that turn the focus of a discussion from _what_ someone is saying to _how_ they’re saying it. **Tone policing takes the form of comments like “Okay, calm down,” “Anger won’t get us anywhere,” or “Relax!” (Shortform note: The term “tone policing” became more widely known after a viral explanatory comic was published in 2015 on the _Everyday Feminism_ website.)

As with microaggressions, you might not know you’re tone policing. You might, for example, just think you’re trying to keep the conversation on an even keel. Or you might think you’re simply reminding everyone to be respectful.

But in reality, tone policing paints people’s justifiable emotions about the issues as being distracting or a turnoff. Silencing someone carries the message that they don’t have the right to be heard. And putting conditions on your listening **asserts your right to control the behavior of people of color for your own benefit.**

As Oluo comments, people often refuse to listen to or engage with a person of color because they’re “inflammatory” or “too angry.” The stereotype of the angry black person makes it **easy to minimize or dismiss people who are justifiably angry about their suffering** and that of other people of color. If you dismiss this anger, you’re saying that only people of color who prioritize the comfort of white listeners deserve to be listened to. People of color who _don’t_ prioritize white comfort don’t deserve to be listened to. They don’t deserve equality. But, as Oluo argues, **equality shouldn’t need to be earned through deference to white people’s emotional needs.**

> **Tracing the Perceived Right to Discipline Tone**
> 
> The idea that the acceptability of what someone says about race depends on the comfort level of the white listener harks back yet again to the history of slavery: The main priority for the white person is their own comfort, and the main priority for the person of color should be the comfort of the white person.
> 
> In Chapter 4, we saw that racist law enforcement practices spring from the idea that black people are to be feared, disciplined, and kept under control. In Chapter 5, we saw that black children are subject to higher rates of discipline than white children. **The assumed right to police the tone of people of color is linked to the assumed right to police the behavior of people of color.**
> 
> This perceived right to discipline and control can present in more subtle ways too. For example, who polices the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable in a conversation about race? Ask yourself: Who has the right to control whom? Who has to bend to whose wishes? Every time you tone police, you’re demonstrating that the White Supremacist system is still intact.

Oluo suggests that **when you’re subject to tone policing,** **you should remember that** :

  * Your emotions are natural and justified. Don’t let anyone tell you not to feel angry, sad, or afraid. Your truth is valid and your experiences matter.
  * You have the right to be heard.
  * You do not have to earn your humanity. You deserve to be heard. You deserve to be cared about.
  * You decide how you’ll fight for justice. Nobody else has the right to tell you what to do or control the way you do it.
  * You don’t need anyone’s validation. If someone tries to make you earn legitimacy through the way you express yourself, this is abuse.



> **Managing Your Defensive Reactions: Lessons from _Crucial Conversations_**
> 
> Though _Crucial Conversations_ doesn’t specifically address tone policing or conversations about race, it does offer some clues about what might be going on when people tone police. The authors of _Crucial Conversations_ argue that we’re not very good at talking about issues that are emotional and high-stakes (and, as we’ve seen, the stakes in conversations about race are very high for both people of color and white people, especially when the white person sees the term “racist” as a threat). The authors argue that we’re bad at having these conversations because visible negative emotions in others trigger our fight-or-flight response, which sends blood out to our limbs and away from the problem-solving part of our brain. We also lack the skills and preparation to manage these conversations well.
> 
> Interpreted this way, tone policing may be part of a natural reaction to strong emotions—an attempt to soothe oneself and the other person. But it’s clearly not the ideal response. What are our other options? The authors of _Crucial Conversations_ suggest that we step back and look at the conversation from a different angle. If our brain is stuck spinning its wheels in one particular rut, can we give it a new problem and let it find some traction there? The authors suggest revisiting the common purpose of the conversation as a way to find this distance. They also recommend that you interpret emotion or perceived aggression from others not as an attack but as a signal that the other person doesn’t feel safe. Can you figure out why they might not feel safe? Can you change something about the conversation to make it safer?
> 
> If someone is trying to tone police you and you’d like to explain this to them and continue the conversation, you could try the technique of “contrasting”: using two paired statements that reassure the other person and clarify your own purpose. When contrasting, first you state what your intention _isn’t_. Then you state clearly what your intention _is_. For example: “I’m not trying to attack you personally here. I just want you to understand how angry I am at the racism I’ve experienced throughout my life.”

### What Is Cultural Appropriation?

Cultural appropriation occurs **when members of a dominant culture adopt selected aspects of another culture without respect, background knowledge, or proper attribution.**

Cultural appropriation is a controversial topic. It tends to confuse people, and there’s considerable disagreement about it even among people of the same culture.

#### Why Does Cultural Appropriation Matter?

To explain the impact of cultural appropriation, Oluo gives the example of a white person wearing a Native American war bonnet to a music festival. As she notes, by doing this, that person is trivializing and overriding whole social structures—he’s bypassing the traditional process for choosing a leader to wear these bonnets and claiming the right for himself. (For more information on the careless use of war bonnets, see the box below.)

Oluo also considers the case of a white person who wears dreadlocks because she thinks they look “cool.” By doing this, she’s ignoring the long history of pain and protest that this hairstyle has for communities of color. If she’s complimented on her new hairstyle while a black person is denied a job for the same hairstyle, this highlights the problems with cultural appropriation. (Shortform note: Dreadlocks have multiple cultural origins, so the case for cultural appropriation here may be a little less clear-cut.)

> **Native American Cultural Appropriation: War Bonnets and Vision Quests**
> 
> If we look closely at instances of cultural appropriation, we can see that **at their heart is always the same thing: the rights to ownership of a culture.** If you can take selected elements of a culture and manipulate them for your own benefit, you’re claiming ownership of pieces of that culture. This is a form of theft. One instance in which this theft has been litigated is the lawsuit brought by the Navajo nation against clothing manufacturer Urban Outfitters for a clothing line that included the “Navajo hipster panty.”
> 
> As noted above, Oluo gives Native American war bonnets as another example of cultural appropriation. War bonnets have long been common at music festivals and on the heads of celebrities. However, music festivals are slowly beginning to ban them after extended campaigns from Native American scholars and activists. Cherokee nation scholar Adrienne Keene has published a series of blog posts about this issue, arguing that war bonnet trends stereotype, homogenize, and disrespect indigenous cultures. Keene notes in an interview for this Guardian article that many white people believe that they’re “respecting” or “honoring” Native American culture in these situations (she suggests this cartoon as a pithy summary of that argument).
> 
> There’s also a burgeoning New Age industry of pseudo-Native American vision quests run by “plastic shamans.” A short story by Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo/African-American writer Rebecca Roanhorse considers the ways in which these “vision quests” perpetuate patterns of cultural theft.

#### How Do I Know if Something Is Cultural Appropriation?

To work out whether or not something is cultural appropriation, you can start with the difference between “appreciation” and “appropriation.”**** Appreciation is learning all you can about the aspects of a culture that interest you and participating respectfully. Appropriation is perpetuating the exploitative power dynamics that characterize White Supremacy.

Let’s take rap music as an example. Rap can be traced back to the royal griot oral history traditions of West Africa. As Oluo explains, this musical storytelling style came over with the slaves and influenced blues and jazz before evolving into the style we now know as rap. Rap, along with other black music styles, was originally marginalized by the white mainstream. Black artists who performed in segregated clubs weren’t allowed to use the main entrance and were paid far less than white musicians in the same club.

**For a long time, white people associated rap and hip-hop with crime and blamed it for social problems.**(Shortform note: This argument does not fall completely along racial lines. Black jazz legend Wynton Marsalis, for example, criticized rap on _The Washington Post’s Cape Up podcast_ , calling it a “pipeline of filth”.)

As Oluo chronicles, white people then started imitating rap. They immediately became more famous and more financially successful than their black counterparts, even if they were far less skilled. This white overlay has changed the understanding of what constitutes “good rap,” pushing out talented black artists and making it increasingly difficult for them to succeed.

> **Nicki Minaj and Amandla Stenberg on Selective Racism in the Arts**
> 
> It’s a common observation in creative fields that white people seem to feel comfortable taking the easy, fun parts of black culture without engaging with the struggles of black people. Hip-hop artist and rapper Nicki Minaj comments on this tendency in an interview for a New York Times article. To Miley Cyrus, she says: “You’re in videos with black men, and you’re bringing out black women on your stages, but you don’t want to know how black women feel about something that’s so important?...If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle...then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us.”
> 
> In a similar vein, in a short 2015 video titled “Don’t Cash Crop on My Cornrows,” actor Amandla Stenberg discusses the phenomenon of white people wearing black hairstyles such as cornrows and asks: “What would America be like if we loved black people as much as we loved black culture?”

#### Does This Mean I Can’t Rap, Do Yoga, or Bellydance?

As Oluo says, you can do whatever you like. But before you adopt something from another culture, if you want to do it in a respectful way, it’s a good idea to do your research.

> **How Can I Participate in Cultural Activities but Avoid Cultural Appropriation?**
> 
> The following list can serve as a starting point for respectful participation in activities that have origins in other cultures:

**> * Be honest about your motives. **Is this exploitation for personal gain? Or respectful participation?

**> * Do you understand the meaning of this practice in the original culture?**

**> * Are people in the home culture still being discriminated against for this practice? **If so, what can you do to increase knowledge and respect around this practice?

**> * If someone from the home culture says they’re hurt by what you’re doing, listen to them**. Ask them how you can do better.

> One example of someone who has adjusted her attitude and practice to avoid cultural appropriation is professional belly dancer Nancy Trunzo. In a post on Trunzo’s website, she discusses her initially hostile reaction to a controversial article by Randa Jarrar called “Why I Can’t Stand White Belly Dancers.” When she learned more about cultural appropriation, Trunzo didn’t stop dancing. She did, however, repackage her dance class offerings, stop performing under an Arabic name, and deliberately include more cultural discussions in her dance classes.
