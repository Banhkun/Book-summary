## Chapter 4: Connecting the Past and the Present

Our current system of racial inequality didn’t come out of nowhere. We inherit ways of acting and ways of talking that are powerful and often subconscious. (Shortform note: As James Baldwin wrote in 1965, “the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally _present_ in all that we do.”)

In this chapter, you’ll see how the history of race in the United States continues to shape its current realities. History is still here, embedded in current behavior patterns. How did this White Supremacist system come to be? Who designed it? Who benefits?

### The History of Race Relations in the United States

The original function of White Supremacist beliefs wasn’t to make white people feel good. As Oluo points out, it was to**justify an economic system built on the theft of indigenous land, the genocide of indigenous peoples, and the practice of chattel slavery** (slavery systems in which some people are the personal property of others).

**The goal of all of this was profit for White America**(and white American men in particular). The comfort of one race was built on the pain and discomfort of another. To rationalize the theft, mass murder, and social and economic subjugation, there needed to be a widely held belief that people of color were subhuman. This belief “explained” why actions that would be crimes if a white person did them to other white people were acceptable if the targets were non-whites.

(Shortform note: These views, rooted in a long history of scientific racism, persist. A letter entitled “Are Negroes Closer to Apes Than to Humans?”, sent in 2012 to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, argues that black people should be classified as a different species.)

### From Economic Subjugation to Economic Disadvantage

Slavery meant that the labor of black people did not belong to them. **After slavery was abolished, the racist beliefs that sustained it were redeployed to perpetuate unequal economic realities.** Oluo lists some of the concrete ways in which people of color still face economic disadvantage:

1) Prejudice from college admissions officers may hobble future employees of color before they even start to study in their chosen field. (Shortform note: One 2018 study showed that a student’s history of racial activism while in high school, and specifically activism that’s anti-racist in nature rather than focusing on racial unity, significantly reduces the email response rate from white college admissions counselors on the question of “Would I be a good fit for your school?”)

2) While Asian Americans are generally well represented on college campuses, they may deal with lower acceptance rates because of a perception that they’re already overrepresented in higher education. (Shortform note: A high-profile lawsuit against Harvard University, initiated in 2014, alleged that the university discriminated against Asian candidates because Asian applicants who had higher academic and extracurricular ratings but lower personal ratings (a more subjective measure) were disproportionately rejected. A federal appeals court cleared Harvard in 2020.)

3) Only 15% of Hispanic Americans and 22% of black Americans have a four-year college degree, meaning that the majority of Hispanic and black Americans are ineligible for white-collar jobs. (Shortform note: Oluo doesn’t provide a comparison figure for white Americans. Based on 2017 statistics published by the American Council on Education, figures for the proportion of people holding a bachelor’s degree or higher are the following:

  * Hispanic or Latino Americans: 17.3%
  * Black or African Americans: 24.2%
  * White Americans: 38.0%)



4) If you have a typical “black-sounding” name, you’re significantly less likely to be called for a job interview than someone whose name sounds white. (Shortform note: A 2003 study found that the effect of race was so strong that white men with a criminal record received more callbacks (17%) than comparably qualified black men with no criminal record (14%). In a 2011 study using Arab names, male candidates with classically white names received double the callbacks of male candidates with Arab names.)

As Oluo points out, this initial difficulty in finding work triggers a cascade of negative economic effects.

5) **The net worth of an average white American is13 times that of an average black American and 10 times that of an average Hispanic American. **(Shortform note: Despite perceptions that the wealth gap between black and white Americans is closing, the gap actually tripled between 1984 and 2009. During that period, the median net worth of black Americans rose from $5,781 to $28,500. That of white Americans rose from $90,581 to $265,000. Note that average net wealth estimates can vary across studies due to the differing data collection techniques used.)

6) The poverty rate in Native American communities is more than three times the poverty rate of white Americans. (Shortform note: According to data from the 2018 census, poverty rates by race are as follows:

  * Native American: 25.4%
  * Black: 20.8%
  * Hispanic: 17.6%
  * White: 10.1%
  * Asian: 10.1%)



7) **For every white man’s dollar:**

  * **Black men make 73 cents** (a figure that hasn’t changed since the 1980s).
  * **Black women make 65 cents.**
  * **Hispanic men make 69 cents** (a figure that has decreased from 71 cents in 1980).
  * **Hispanic women make 58 cents**. (Shortform note: In practice, this means that an average Hispanic woman needs to work for over 20 months to bring home the same amount of money that an average white man makes in 12 months.)



These negative economic effects include housing. Some banks, for example, have a history of targeting communities of color through predatory home loans that are designed to end in foreclosures. And houses are worth less in “black neighborhoods,” creating a barrier to mobility out of these neighborhoods. (Shortform note: This problem has worsened, not improved, since the 1980s. In May 2021, a black homeowner in Indianapolis found that when she removed all indications of her race from her house and asked a white friend to stand in for her during an appraisal, the estimated value of the home doubled.)

8) Based on the model minority myth, Asian Americans should be doing well economically. But:

  * While Filipino Americans have a lower poverty rate than white Americans, other groups of Asian Americans (Cambodian, Laotian, Pakistani, and Thai Americans) have a poverty rate double that of white Americans. Among Bangladeshi and Hmong Americans, the rate is triple or more (26-38 percent).
  * Asian Americans tend to do very well in the lower levels of their fields and then hit a ceiling when they try to rise higher. For example, while most successful tech companies have a workforce that’s 35 to 60 percent Asian American, their **white colleagues are more than twice as likely to be promoted to management positions.**(Shortform note: In some professions, such as the law, promotion rates from subordinate to management positions among Asian Americans are the worst of all racial groups.)



All of this shows that **the model minority myth was not created to benefit Asian Americans.** Instead it’s based on the appropriation and exploitation of Asian American labor and the erasure of Asian Americans who don’t fit the stereotype.

### From Slave Patrols to Police Brutality

Oluo states that the original law enforcement agencies in the United States had two functions:**to protect white communities from black ones, and to round up slaves who didn’t comply and send them back to their masters.** White slave owners had the right to discipline any noncompliant slaves using whatever violent means they saw fit. It’s not surprising, therefore, that the first police forces exercised that same discipline on a wider scale.

Contemporary US police forces began as slave patrols and Night Watches. The Night Watches were based in New England. One of their key functions was to manage Native American and black populations. The Fugitive Slave Act empowered the Night Watches to catch escaped slaves. The Slave Patrols were based in the South. Their job was to hunt down escaped slaves and bring them back to their owners for punishment. (Shortform note: Policing in the northern states was based in municipal police departments modeled on English policing systems, while the Slave Patrols had domestic origins.)

Oluo notes that even after the Civil War, **police officers in the South continued to participate in threatening and murderous acts against black populations** , carrying out lynchings, physical assaults, and acts of intimidation as members of the Ku Klux Klan. This acrimonious history of the relationship between police officers and communities of color is still with us. Though the vast majority of police officers today no longer consciously see their job as disciplining and controlling populations of color,**old racist structures still show through as a pattern of attitudes and practices toward people of color.**(Shortform note: As late as the early 1990s, Californian police officers used the acronym NHI (“No Humans Involved”) to talk about cases relating to black men.)

We saw in Chapter 3 that police behavior differs toward whites and people of color in measurable ways. For example, at traffic stops, people of color are more likely to be pulled over, searched, ticketed, and arrested.

As Oluo notes, they’re also **more likely to be subject to unnecessary and humiliating disciplinary measures.** A 2016 study (reported in the Washington Post) found that over 13 months, in traffic stops in which nobody was arrested, police in Oakland handcuffed 1,466 black people and only 72 white people. Another 2016 study found that black people were 3.6 times more likely than white people to be on the receiving end of physical force from police (hitting, choking, pepper spray, tasers, and guns). (Shortform note: This effect was specific to black people. The same study found that other people of color—people of Hispanic, Asian, and other ethnic backgrounds—were subject to force at rates below those of both blacks and whites.)

**One in every three black men and one in every six Latino men go to jail at least once in their lives.** Women of color are also disproportionately likely to be incarcerated). (Shortform note: _The_ _Washington Post_fact-checked the “one in three black men” claim when Bernie Sanders made it in 2015, finding that it was correct in 2001 but that incarceration rates of black men had decreased since. The revised estimate is that one in four black men go to jail at least once. The figure for whites is one in 23.)

#### The Fear Goes Both Ways

Police are part of the community. They share broadly held views that people of color are primitive and dangerous, feeding into an implicit bias against people of color. This bias may be relatively inactive in neutral situations but **becomes active in stressful situations, such as police encounters** , especially with a person who you’ve learned to see as menacing and unpredictable because of the color of their skin. When a white police officer says that he pulled the trigger because he feared for his life, it’s probably the truth. But, tragically, the menace is often imaginary.

(Shortform note: The effect of stress on activating implicit bias has also been measured in a medical context. Overcrowding of the emergency department, for example, seems to increase doctors’ implicit racial bias scores.)

> **Muslim Experiences in America**
> 
> Throughout the book, Oluo goes into detail about the racially charged experiences of black Americans and Asian Americans. However, she doesn’t discuss the experiences of Muslims in the United States, though there seems to be near-universal agreement that this group faces the most discrimination of all.
> 
> Islam in America has a long history—it’s estimated that up to 30% of the slaves who were originally brought over from Africa were Muslim. However, as Moroccan immigrant Laila Lalami notes, Muslims are still seen as “unwanted latecomers” to the country, and their sense of belonging in the United States to this day is tenuous. Muslims were particularly demonized following the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and Muslim arrivals in the United States were targeted in the “Muslim ban” instituted via a series of contested executive orders in 2017.
> 
> During the Trump presidency, there was an increase in expressed xenophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment and a volume of anti-Muslim hate crimes that exceeded post-9/11 levels. One study found that in the days following anti-Muslim tweets from Trump there were specific spikes in racist tweets, negative cable news coverage of Muslims, and the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes recorded in cities across the United States.
> 
> Muslims are regularly targeted in insensitive comments and “jokes” about terrorism, and Muslim political representatives receive a huge volume of hate speech. Despite this, the vast majority of US Muslims are both proud to be Muslim and proud to be American. Muslim Americans are expressing their diverse experiences not only through political activism but also through comics, slam poetry, and music.
