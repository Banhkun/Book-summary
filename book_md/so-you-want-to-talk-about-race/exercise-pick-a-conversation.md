## Exercise: Pick a Conversation

Decide what conversation you’re going to have first.

* * *

What area of racial justice would you like to talk about first? (You could pick an area that you already know quite a bit about, to build confidence, or one that you know little about, to maximize your learning.)

Who are you going to have the conversation with and why?

What do you need to do to prepare for the conversation? (This may include doing some homework, checking your privilege in this area, making sure you’re seeking a range of perspectives, and checking that the person wants to talk.)
