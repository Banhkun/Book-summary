## Exercise: Think About Cultural Appropriation in Your Own Life

Identify some ways in which you might be participating in cultural appropriation.

* * *

What activities do you participate in, items of clothing do you wear, and/or music do you listen to that originated in a non-white culture?

In what ways have you benefited (financially, socially, or otherwise) from these activities? In what ways have other whites benefited? (For example, you might practice yoga, and your membership fee benefits the white studio owner.)

What might you do to offset the effects of this cultural appropriation? (For example, you might learn more about the history of the practice, or confront your biases about the home culture, and/or engage more with members of that culture in your community.)
