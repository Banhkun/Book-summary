## Chapter 3: Seeking a Deeper Understanding

Once we’ve settled on a common language for talking about race, we need to step back and examine how these principles operate in real time.

There are four things we need to examine more closely.

  * First, we need to be able to **track how our repeated experiences solidify into beliefs about how the world works** , and understand that different experiences can lead to different understandings of the world.
  * Second, we need to **dissect our own perspectives** , being honest with ourselves about where they’re limited or faulty. 
  * Third, we need to learn to quiet our own experiences, set aside our filters, and**listen with openness and humility to the experiences of others**. 
  * And finally, we need to understand **why not all hurtful words are the same**.



### Understand that Different Experiences Shape Different Perceptions

Based on our past experiences—especially on repeated or very intense experiences—we make predictions about what to expect in the future. These predictions inform our worldview.

Let’s take the police as an example. **As Oluo notes, if you’re a white person,chances are that most of your encounters with the police have been cordial. **Based on this, you trust the police: You feel comfortable calling them if there’s a problem, and you know they’ll be on your side when they come. After all, it’s their job to protect you.

**If you’re not white, your experiences have probably been very different.** Here are some of Oluo’s experiences with the police:

  * She was first pulled over at sixteen. As the officer walked to the car, she reached over to open the glove compartment to take out her license and registration. The officer put his hand on his gun and yelled “STOP!” When he got to the window, he informed her that reaching for something while a police officer was approaching was a good way to get herself shot. 
  * Several months later, she was pulled over for not coming to a complete stop on an empty road.
  * Once she was pulled over because her registration had expired by one day (still within the month shown on the sticker, so the police officer had initially run her plates for no particular reason).
  * After they pull her over, police consistently ask questions about whether she’s been drinking or doing drugs.



**When Oluo sees police officers on the road, she knows that she’s the most likely target.** This makes it impossible to enjoy driving. And these experiences are not unique to Oluo: Racial profiling that leads to being pulled over for **“driving while black”** is disturbingly common.

And it’s not just about driving. Blacks and Native Americans are three and a half to four times more likely than whites to be killed by the police. Is it any surprise that black people trust the police and believe them to be ethical and honest at a rate of less than half that of whites? This perceptual difference doesn’t come out of nowhere. (Shortform note: This statistic—28% for blacks vs 60% for whites—comes from this study, which also found that 16% of black people reported that they had been unfairly treated by the police in the last 30 days.)

As you can see, this isn’t a matter of deciding whose perception is correct. It’s about understanding that **multiple valid perceptions can exist at the same time**. Police can be dangerous to one group of people and honorable protectors to another. A racist joke can be both a throwaway comment for the person who makes it and a vicious dagger to the heart for the person on the receiving end.

> **Driving While Black**
> 
> Oluo’s experiences with the police while driving are far from unique. For years, black Twitter users have been posting their experiences with the police while driving using the hashtag #DrivingWhileBlack. Common complaints are that police use minor infringements or unusual situations, such as having an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror, driving a luxury car, or driving a vehicle that the police didn’t know how to categorize, as excuses to pull black people over. A 2020 PBS documentary, _Driving While Black_ , explores in detail the freedoms and dangers in driving for black people in the United States.
> 
> A 2020 ABC News analysis of millions of traffic stops in major US cities showed striking disparities in the treatment of black and white drivers. In Minneapolis, black drivers were five times more likely to be stopped than white drivers. Black drivers in San Francisco and Chicago were four times more likely to be pulled over, while in Los Angeles and Philadelphia they were three times more likely to be targeted. (Black pedestrians are also more likely to be stopped: For example, in New York, black people on the street were eight times more likely to be stopped and searched.)
> 
> After black drivers are pulled over, they’re one and a half to five times more likely to be searched (though the probability of finding contraband is less than when whites are searched). They’re also more likely to be cited and arrested. And in police encounters that go wrong, people of color know that they’re far more likely to bear the consequences than the police officer is.

### Dissect Our Own Perspectives

A great deal of our behavior is influenced by forces outside our normal awareness. These include **implicit biases** (subconscious prejudices that affect the way we perceive situations) and our **inability to see the big picture**. The latter mainly springs from ignorance about the realities of other people’s lives.

#### Understand Your Biases

As we’ve seen already, racism is systemic. That means that everyone who grows up in a White Supremacist society is racist in some way.

You can’t help it. It’s part of the culture that you absorbed growing up. It doesn’t mean you’re a hateful person who actively desires harm to people of color. But it does mean that **racism shapes much of what you do and believe without you realizing it**.

> **How Does Bias Work in the Brain?**
> 
> How exactly does this unconscious bias work? In _Biased_ , social psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt tracks the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in racial bias.
> 
> One such mechanism is the “other-race effect”—the fact that our brains become very practiced at differentiating faces of our own race but are usually bad at distinguishing between faces of other races. Eberhardt and her colleagues have observed the other-race effect occurring in real time with the use of imaging techniques such as fMRI. They found that your brain automatically expends more energy paying attention to and remembering faces of your own race (or the race that you saw most while growing up) than to other faces. This effect creates bias because it makes us see people of our own race as individuals worth recognizing, but those of other races as part of a homogenous group.
> 
> Another mechanism that influences bias is categorization. This is when your brain automatically associates emotions or stereotyped beliefs with a particular category of person: for example, linking black people with a feeling of fear or beliefs about crime.
> 
> These processes are automatic and occur far too fast for you to intercept. However, there are a number of ways you can manage your implicit bias. First, you can spend quality time with people of other races, as that’s been shown to change brain activation patterns. You can also disrupt automatic bias by slowing down and intentionally engaging more effortful processing. This shift between what Daniel Kahnemann calls System 1 (fast) and System 2 (effortful) thinking will help you to override any unconscious processing biases you may have.

#### Check Your Privilege

You can start to address racial biases by coming to terms with the disowned pieces of your own behavior and belief systems. First, check your privilege.

You may have been told to “check your privilege” or have heard someone else being told to do this, perhaps as part of an argument. But how exactly do you go about checking your privilege?

Oluo provides the following broad roadmap:

  1. **Start by yourself.** Create a calm, neutral environment where you won’t be interrupted. Be clear about your goal: You’re doing this because you want to—because you want to understand things better and have better conversations (not because you’re in the middle of an argument and someone is forcing you to).
  2. **Write down some of the areas of your life in which the deck has been stacked in your favor.** Consider the following: physical health, mental health, disability, immigration status, class, race, home environment, family background, housing, education, gender, sexuality, conventional physical attractiveness, and anything else you can think of. If you feel tempted to list disadvantages, resist the urge. If you like, you can do this later in a separate exercise.
  3. For each area in which you’ve identified privilege,**think about how these advantages have affected (1) your current position and (2) your understanding of this area**. For example, if you’re cisgender: (1) What social, financial, and other advantages do you enjoy in relation to the transgender population? And (2) How much do you understand about the experiences of transgender people?
  4. **Search for information to fill your knowledge gaps.** Read work by writers in this area, seek out talks, listen to people in your life who haven’t experienced the same privilege. If you’re in a position of privilege, you might not have it totally wrong, but you’re almost certainly missing some key parts.



> **Oluo’s Approach to Checking Privilege: Why Is It Effective?**
> 
> The slow, systematic engagement of conscious thought processes that Oluo suggests above is an excellent way to make sure you’re bypassing knee-jerk reactions and employing Kahnemann’s conscious, effortful System 2 thinking. Step 1 reduces environmental stresses and distractions, which allows the brain to focus more deeply. (Cal Newport similarly advocates creating a calm environment conducive to intensive thinking in _Deep Work._) Step 2 deliberately bypasses the reflex “But I’ve struggled too!” reactions that this kind of activity tends to elicit at first.
> 
> Step 3 focuses your attention on what you don’t know instead of what you do. This is powerful because assumptions are always based on what we _think_ we know, so acknowledging the ways in which we’re ignorant is a deliberate way to destabilize these assumptions. Step 4, the self-initiated search for new information, is an act of intellectual and emotional humility and an opportunity to listen. Steps 3 and 4 should be seen as iterative and lifelong, as learning more always leads us to uncover more areas of ignorance.

**Once you understand your privilege, use it to start breaking down barriers.** Wherever you have privilege, use it for the benefit of those who don’t.

Oluo suggests the following ways to do this:

  * If your privilege has led you to hold a position of authority, use that authority to implement programs to smooth the path for others lacking that privilege.
  * If you’re the target demographic for politicians, ask them what they’re doing for people of color and other underprivileged groups.
  * If you received a private education, use some of the extra money you make to support public schools.



(Shortform note: This Medium article suggests 103 more ways that white people can fight for racial justice, some of which involve the exercise of privilege—for example, working with your HR department to get more people of color hired, moving your money to a black-owned bank, making donations to activist and political groups, divesting investments in prisons and detention centers, and stopping to watch when you see a black person pulled over by the police.)

### Learn to Honor Other People’s Experiences

As well as scrutinizing our own perspectives, we need to learn to truly value the perspectives of others and understand where they’re coming from.

#### The Risks to People of Color of Engaging in the Conversation

As Oluo explains, participating in conversations about race isn’t easy for people of color. Most don’t seek it out, so if someone agrees to talk with you about race, it’s an act of generosity.

Every time a person of color engages in these conversations, they run a range of risks. Oluo lists some of these:

  * Being labeled angry, oversensitive, or paranoid
  * Being treated as a private search engine on racial issues
  * Having their experiences questioned, minimized, or dismissed
  * Reliving traumatic, frightening, or humiliating situations



Experiencing racism is painful, and in talking about it you’re asking someone to revisit that pain.

Why, then, do people of color have these conversations? They do it because they have to. They know that nothing will change if they stay silent.

> **The Consequences of Speaking Out Publicly About Racism**
> 
> People of color often experience considerable backlash after talking openly about their experiences. For example, doctor and Olympic athlete Omar Amr wrote about the racism he had experienced playing water polo. He lost friends, had people openly questioning his mental health, and received death threats as a result. After philosopher George Yancy published a gentle open letter in the New York Times to white people asking them to be honest about their internalized racism, he received a wave of hate mail from readers, full of racist epithets and threats of extreme violence. He feared for his safety and needed a police escort to move around the university campus. (Yancy later wrote a book, _Backlash_ , on the response to this piece.)
> 
> Where does this abuse come from? Author of _White Fragility_ Robin DiAngelo argued in a 2011 article that white people are used to experiencing “racial comfort.” They also tend to confuse comfort with safety, which makes even minor threats to comfort feel like serious threats to their psychological safety. To defend themselves against these threats, they may position themselves as victims and use language related to self-defense, such as saying they feel “attacked,” “like a punching bag,” or subject to a “witch-hunt.” White women are particularly skilled at flipping the discussion by weaponizing their tears and emotional reactions. This deft reversal of the aggressor-victim dynamic leaves no space for people of color to explain the mechanics of their original victimization.

### Understand Why All Hurtful Words Are Not the Same

The final principle to keep in mind when we’re deepening our understanding of race is the extraordinary emotional power of certain words. There are two words in particular that tend to trigger intense emotions and reactions when someone is on the receiving end. These are “nigger” and “racist.”

While the reactions might be similar, the words certainly aren’t. Here’s why.

#### Black People Use the N-Word. Why Can’t I?

Words carry emotions and they perpetuate social structures. Every word has a history, and the word “nigger” carries **a particularly ugly emotional history of dehumanization, disadvantage, exploitation, and oppression**.

The word “nigger” comes from the word for “black” in various Romance languages (languages descended from Latin, such as Spanish, French, and Portuguese). From the 1500s onwards, it was used to refer to dark-skinned people. People began to use it in a derogatory way in the late 1700s, and over the next several hundred years, it came to be a hate-charged way to talk about slaves. The word “nigger” was shouted to justify the pain and humiliation of slave whippings, slave hunts, cross burnings, and hangings. (Shortform note: Brando Simeo Starkey argues that the word also came to index slaves’ own internalized oppression, in which they believed the lie that they deserved inferior treatment.)

**Every time a white person uses this word, they invoke this oppressive, violent history.** This applies _no matter what their intentions are_. The effects of this oppressive history are still with us today. This means that the historical weight of this word hasn’t changed.

As Oluo points out, the fact that a black person can use this word and a white person can’t might seem on the surface like a double standard. And it _is_ a double standard—but the reason it exists is to counteract the effects of a much deeper and more serious double standard in the opposite direction. When used by a white person, the word “nigger” invokes the original double standard whereby black people were abused, dismissed, and treated as subhuman—a situation that we’ve seen still exists today in various forms. When used by a black person, the word doesn’t invoke this same double standard.

We first looked at definitions of racism in Chapter 1. Remember that when we’re deciding whether or not something is racist, we need to include the _power structures that support_ the racist bias. **When black people use the N-word, it doesn’t tap into these power structures.** And when it does, it taps into them only to subvert them. That’s why who’s using the word matters. (Shortform note: Some black authors, however, argue that if black people investigated the history of the word more thoroughly, they might change their minds about using it too.)

> **At the Edges of Acceptability**
> 
> While it’s clear that white people should not casually throw around the N-word, some controversial borderline cases highlight the subtleties surrounding its use. For example, is it okay for a white person to use the word when they’re singing along to the lyrics of a black artist? The majority of linguists and black writers argue that it’s not, some giving the example of white rapper Eminem’s scrupulous avoidance of even euphemisms like “nizzle” when performing the work of black artists.
> 
> Author Ta-Nehisi Coates answers a question on similar casual uses of the word by talking about how the words we choose are tied to relationships in all human languages. He gives the example of “bitch”: A friend of his wife’s might affectionately call her “bitch” in a conversation, but that doesn’t give him any desire to do the same, because the word has a particular meaning within that friendship that doesn’t carry over to the marriage. Coates queries the motivation that a white person would have for wanting to use the N-word in the first place: Is it because white people are socialized to believe that everything belongs to them?
> 
> Some examples, however, may be instances of overcorrection. For instance, in Spring 2019, a white professor of creative writing was teaching an advanced seminar on James Baldwin. She asked her students to think about why Baldwin’s original use of the N-word had been changed to “negro” in the title of the 2016 documentary I Am Not Your Negro. She was reported by a white student in the class and formally investigated by the school. In 2016, the books _To Kill a Mockingbird_ and _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ were removed from some Virginia school curricula and libraries because of a complaint about their use of the N-word.
> 
> Black university professor Neal Lester developed a whole college-level class centered around the N-word. As Lester notes, the point of these discussions is not to forbid the word or make it taboo without explaining why. Instead, it’s to make us more sensitive and thoughtful in the way we use language. Instead, it’s “about self-education and self-critique, not trying to control others by telling them what to say or how to think, but rather trying to figure out how we think and how the words we use mirror our thinking.”

#### What if I Get Called Racist?

For many white people,**“racist” is one of the worst insults they can possibly imagine**. (Shortform note: For example, when journalist Dawn Butler called Boris Johnson a racist, she was told this was “extremely offensive.”)

Don’t go into conversations about race terrified of being called racist. Go in with the aim to uncover and educate the racist parts of yourself that you already know are there. And remember that getting called racist isn’t as bad as dealing with the actual effects of systemic racism.

If you get called racist:

  * Stop. Listen. Think. **Hear it as a criticism of a behavior, not as a statement that you’re a terrible person.**
  * Remember that intentions are irrelevant.
  * **Focus on the effects of your actions rather than the action itself.** For example, let’s say you’ve been speaking over someone in work meetings without realizing. The action itself is easy to explain away (“I was just being enthusiastic”; “I just really didn’t agree with you”). It’s much harder to argue with the effect (“Your behavior is undermining me professionally and is part of a pattern of behavior in this workplace that invalidates me as a person of color.”) 
  * Remember that nobody owes you anything. If you want to know more but the other person doesn’t want to engage anymore, find another way to figure it out.
  * (Shortform note: Media and communications professor Rebecca Hains adds an extra step: Express gratitude. If someone has taken the time and energy to explain what you’re doing wrong, thank them for helping you to improve.)



> **Reactions to Being Called Out: The “Boots and Sandals” Analogy**
> 
> Presley Pizzo offers an analogy for thinking about criticism of this type in which she encourages white people to imagine their privilege as a pair of sturdy boots. If you’re wearing boots and someone else is only in sandals, they’ll feel pain if you step on their foot, while you’ll hardly feel anything if they step on yours.
> 
> Pizzo asks: If someone says, “Ouch! You’re stepping on my toes,” what do you do? She reframes common responses to being confronted over racist actions in these terms, for example: “I can’t believe you think I’m a toe-stepper! I’m a good person,” “I’d move my foot if you’d ask me more nicely,” and “All toes matter!” Very few people would respond in this way if they’d stepped on someone’s foot because they know doing so would be unacceptable; so, why should responding to an accusation of racism be any different?

Now that you understand the basics about racism, you can start to make connections that weren’t possible before. You can connect the past with the present (Chapter 4), uncovering all of the ways in which our history is still present today. You can connect the present with the future (Chapter 5) and chronicle the ways in which today’s disadvantage will create tomorrow’s injustice. And you can connect the small with the systemic (Chapter 6), looking at how seemingly insignificant events can accumulate to do considerable damage.
