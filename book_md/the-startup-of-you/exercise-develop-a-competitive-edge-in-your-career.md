## Exercise: Develop a Competitive Edge in Your Career

As Hoffman and Casnocha point out, many startups leverage their unique value to stand out from the competitors and achieve success. Apply the authors' strategies to define your competitive edge.

* * *

What hard assets do you currently have (finances, possessions, and so on)? How might these give you an advantage over others? For example, you might own the latest technologies related to your field.

What soft assets do you have (knowledge, skills, connections)? These might be tasks that other people find difficult but you find easy. What's one specialized skill you can learn that can help you stand out in your field?

Stand out from competitors by identifying your unique values and aspirations. What motivates you? What do you consider important in your life? This might be freedom, the ability to express your creativity, or the promotion of diversity in your field.

What market is your job catering to? What popular or trending market might your skills be valuable in?
