## Exercise: Analyze the Three Components of a Stable Democracy

Fukuyama argues that a stable modern democracy rests on the three pillars of a strong state, the rule of law, and a sense of government accountability. In this exercise, you’ll assess how strongly each pillar is in place in your country.

* * *

How strong is your country’s central state? Is it organized and effective? To what extent is it affected by problems such as tribal interests, nepotism, or patronage?

To what extent does your government obey the rule of law—in other words, is your national government free to act as it pleases, or are there restraints on its power? If there are restraints, what are they based on and how effective are they?

How accountable do you feel your government is to its citizens? Does it face repercussions if it acts against its citizens’ wishes or their best interests?

Considering your answers to the previous questions, what changes or improvements would you like to see in your national government? What would make your government stronger, more stable, more effective, more open, or more responsive to its citizen’s needs?
