## Chapter 5: Clothing

Now that we’ve discussed the big-picture process and the general principles of discarding and organizing, the next 5 chapters will focus on the individual categories (in the correct order!). Each chapter will address discarding first, then organizing. The first category is clothing.

Kondo breaks this category down into subcategories:

  * Tops--shirts, sweaters
  * Bottoms--pants, skirts, shorts
  * Clothes to hang--jackets, coats, suits, dresses
  * Socks
  * Undergarments
  * Bags--handbags, messenger bags
  * Accessories--scarves, belts, hats, jewelry
  * Clothes for specific events--swimsuits, uniforms, kimonos
  * Shoes



If you have a lot of clothes, you can also use these subcategories to help you tackle smaller portions one at a time.

### Discarding

Gather all your clothes from all over your home and put them in one place, on your bed or on your bedroom floor. When you think you’ve finished, ask yourself if there could be anything else hiding anywhere else.

  * Kondo gives her clients a rule: if they find another item of clothing after they’ve gathered everything and sorted through it, that item immediately gets discarded--you didn’t even remember you owned it!



**Don’t be alarmed by how much you have--everyone has way more than they think.** From Kondo’s experience, the _average_ number of clothing items people own is 160.

Then go through all your clothing, item by item, picking each one up and asking if it sparks joy. If it does, it goes in the keep pile. If it doesn’t, it goes in the discard pile. Remember to thank anything you discard.

  * You can start a maybe pile, but try to keep this small. Remember you should feel the answer to whether something sparks joy immediately, and you shouldn’t keep things that don’t spark joy. If you hesitate, chances are high you should discard it. Revisit this pile after you’ve gone through the rest of your clothes and have a better sense of what sparks joy and what doesn’t.
  * **If you’re having trouble, start with off-season clothes.** Because you don’t need these in the immediate future, it’s much easier to be in tune with what sparks joy and what doesn’t. Ask yourself if you’d wear this item right now if the temperature suddenly changed. If the answer is yes, keep it. If the answer is no, or “well...” then put it in the discard/donate pile.



**If your clothing doesn’t spark joy, don’t just turn it into loungewear.** You should still wear things at home that spark joy, not castoffs that at best spark no feelings in you and at worst spark the same negative feelings that kept you from wearing them out of the house. Free up the space and get yourself some nice loungewear, made by companies that specialize in loungewear.

You may worry you won’t have enough clothes to wear if you only keep what sparks joy. But by keeping only what sparks joy, you’ll end up with exactly the amount of clothing you need, or you’ll know exactly what to buy to fill out your newly sparse wardrobe.

### Organizing

(Shortform note: The book has a lot of suggestions for organizing clothes. Try to apply the large ideas, but if a specific recommendation is way too tiresome for the reward, then it’s ok to skip it.)

We generally have two ways of organizing our clothing: folding items to go into drawers, or hanging items in a closet. It might seem like the two options are equally as efficient, but **folding is a more effective way to organize your clothing** (as long as it’s not clothing that demands to be hung, like collared shirts or dresses--we’ll cover that in the next section).

  * Hanging might seem like an easier option to help keep things tidy, but actually having a lot of hanging clothes is one reason why our closets are bursting. Not to mention, when our closets are packed with hanging clothes, getting anything in and out is difficult and creates more mess.



#### Folding

Neatly folding your clothes will help you solve even the most annoying storage problem. Folding has a number of other benefits too:

  * Folding an item of clothing is your opportunity to thank it for providing you support and protection. 
  * Folding allows you to notice your clothes and their condition in detail.
  * As you smooth a piece of clothing out, you touch it with your hands and your energy transfers into it. 
    * Healing in Japanese is te-ate, literally translating to “apply hands.” Touch has power--children are comforted when their parents stroke their heads or hug them, and massages by an actual person are more effective than sitting in a massage chair. Likewise, folding can have a positive effect on our clothes. 



First, visualize what your drawers will look like after you’ve folded everything. The goal should be to see every item of clothing in the drawer at a glance, and be able to grab something easily without messing everything else up.

**The key to achieving that goal is vertical storage instead of horizontal.** This allows you to access your clothing easier, without having to mess up a pile to get to an item on the bottom.

  * You might think this means there are more wrinkles in your clothes, but that isn’t the case. Wrinkling has to do with pressure--if you fold correctly, your clothes will be folded up but the fabric will be taut, and it won’t cause your clothes to wrinkle. 
  * When clothes are folded in a pile, the pile puts pressure on the clothes, and this is actually what causes them to wrinkle--but we’ll be avoiding this by going for vertical storage instead of horizontal.



How to fold correctly: **fold every item of clothing into a simple, smooth rectangle that can stand up on its own.**

  * First, fold both sides of the garment towards the center--fold the left side of your shirt towards the center, then the right side, and then fold the sleeves in whatever way creates a long rectangle.
  * Then, pick up one small end of the rectangle and fold it to the other small end, leaving a small gap.
  * Finally, repeat the step above, folding the garment into smaller halves or thirds. 
  * (Shortform note: It can be hard to understand this folding concept through reading. Here’s the master herself showing you how to fold a number of common clothing items.)
  * Every item of clothing will need a different number of folds to get it into the right shape. It may take some experimentation to find that sweet spot. Keep adjusting the height of the folds until you find the exact right amount for the specific piece of clothing.
    * Heavier items of clothing will need less folds to make them stand up. Thinner items of clothing will need more folds to give them the structure to stand.



#### Hanging

Folding is a better storage solution, but some items of clothing need to be hung, such as dresses, suits, coats, jackets, and any clothing with structure that makes it hard to fold, such as collared shirts.

The basic rule of thumb is **hang clothes by category** , with categories side by side. Have a suit section, a dress section, a jacket section.

You can also **organize your closet so that the items rise to the right**. Lines that rise up to the right make us feel more comfortable, and they create a lighter feeling in us when we see them.

  * Put heavier, longer items of clothing on the left side of your closet, and lighter, shorter items on the right. The order might go: coats, dresses, jackets, pants, skirts, blouses.



#### Socks and Stockings

Don’t ever tie up your stockings, and don’t ball up your socks.

  * Balling your socks up--where we put two socks together and then fold the top of one sock over both--ruins the elastic in your socks over time. And if, like Kondo and the Japanese religion of Shinto, you believe that all inanimate objects have souls and feelings, being balled up and thrown on top of each other in a drawer is a horrible existence for your socks.



**To fold socks:**

  * To start with, unball all your socks!
  * First, place one sock on top of the other. Fold in half, then again in halves or thirds.
    * For low-cut socks, you only need to fold them twice.
    * Ankle socks, fold three times.
    * Knee socks or higher, fold four to six times.
  * You can fold the socks in accordance with the height of the drawer they’re in.
  * Then store the socks standing up on edge, with the swirls of the folds visible on top.
  * Folded this way, socks will take up a fraction of the space they used to.



**To fold stockings:**

  * Fold them in half lengthwise so the toes are touching. Then fold the rectangle in half widthwise. Then fold it into thirds and make sure the toes are on the inside and not the outside of the folds and that the waistband protrudes a little from the top. Then roll the stockings up to the waistband. 
  * The waistband should be on the outside if you’ve done it correctly. The stockings should be stable and firm, like a sushi roll. 
  * Fold knee-high stockings the same way. For thicker tights, don’t fold into thirds, fold into halves.
  * When you arrange stockings in the drawer, the swirl of the roll should be facing upwards.
    * A shoebox is a great internal divider for stockings in a big drawer. This will help them not slip out and unroll.



#### Seasonal Clothing

Kondo doesn’t go in for seasonal storage. It’s an outdated custom that was more necessary before we had temperature controlled indoors.

If you want to keep your clothes as neat and tidy as possible and keep only clothes that spark joy, you should **aim to keep all of your clothes in your closet all year round**.

  * This prevents you from forgetting what you have and buying off-season clothes that you don’t need.



Don’t over-categorize your clothes by season--categorize by material of clothing, all cotton together, all wool together, cotton-like and wool-like close to each of those respective categories. Again, this will save you from forgetting what you have.

If you really don’t have enough space, try storing only purely seasonal items away first: swimsuits, sun hats, gloves, heavy scarves.

  * Most people store off-season clothing in plastic bins--these are the worst storage units because they become a hassle to open up, and then we never see the contents. Plus, usually, stuff gets put on top of plastic bins like this, and then it takes too much effort to get into them.
  * Kondo recommends purchasing a set of drawers if you have so much off-season clothing you need a storage solution. You can store your clothes in here using the principles we already covered, and then they’re easy to access and easy to see.



#### Bags

**The best way to store your bags is in other bags.**

  * Yes, this contradicts the goal of seeing everything in a category at a single glance, but it vastly reduces the space bags take up, helps your bags keep their shape since they’re filled, and makes it easier to access them faster than some other methods of bag storage.



Store bags in similar bags to further reduce the hassle. For example, make a leather bag stash, putting each bag in the next largest bag, like nesting dolls.

Kondo’s rule is to try not to keep more than 2 bags in any 1 bag, meaning the maximum number of bags in a single stash is 3.

And, if you want to go hardcore, empty your bag every day.

  * Kondo unpacks her bag at the end of every day, though she does admit that sometimes, when she’s very busy and knows she’s just going to use the same things the very next morning, she’ll leave her purse packed.
  * It’s much easier to forget you have something if you leave it in your bag all the time--this is how we end up with a million lip balms in every location.
    * You can just as easily find a single place to store items you put in your bag every day, like a box somewhere in your room that contains your wallet, keys, train pass, and similar items, or make room in the corner of a drawer.



#### Bulk Items

People often buy things in bulk, including clothing, because they think it’s cheaper.

**But if you think of your home as a storage space--one you pay for every month in rent or mortgage--then it’s not necessarily cheaper to store bulk items. You’re paying for these things to take up space.**

Plus, you might think keeping bulk items wrapped, packaged, and tagged keeps them newer until you need them--but in reality, they’d be even newer if you _didn’t_ buy them in bulk, but bought them from the store every time you ran out.

These things _just_ take up space. You don’t actually need these bulk items right now, and the packaging makes it feel less like your space and more like a store.

  * **Your items should feel like they belong to you** \--otherwise, chances are high you won’t end up using them, and they’ll just become something you need to discard down the line.
