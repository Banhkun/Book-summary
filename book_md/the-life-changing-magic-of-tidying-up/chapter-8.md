## Chapter 8: Komono, or Miscellany

Here are the categories that fall under komono:

  * CDs and DVDs
  * Skin care products
  * Makeup
  * Accessories
  * Valuables like credit cards, passports, medical cards
  * If you have a lot of items related to a particular hobby, like skiing, include them here
  * Electrical equipment and appliances like cameras, cords, anything electric
  * Household equipment like stationery and sewing kits
  * Household supplies like detergent, medicine, tissues
  * Kitchen goods and food supplies like spatulas, dishes, pots
  * Any other small categories like tchotchkes, figurines, spare change



Look at the order of that list: it’s an intentional order that goes from more personal items to more communal items.

  * If you live alone, you don’t need to worry about this distinction, but if you live with people, then the order becomes useful. When you get to this category, use this order for maximum efficiency--**it’s easier to calibrate what sparks joy for you alone before you try to work with another person to discard items you share.**



Many of the items in this category are things we keep “just because.” This results in many odds and ends that take up space and clutter our homes.

### Discarding

Here are some common areas of difficulty in this category:

  * Gifts
    * The purpose of a present is to be received, and to convey the giver’s feelings of affection. A gift accomplishes these 2 things at the very moment it’s given, but then a lot of us end up keeping gifts someone gave us that we don’t use or even like. Don’t do this. Thank it for the joy it gave you when you first received it, and discard it. 
  * Cosmetic samples
    * These products are smaller sized and consequently have shorter shelf lives. You don’t want to use expired cosmetics when you’re traveling! Trash them. Get reusable travel sized bottles instead.
  * Electronic packaging
    * Many people save boxes in this category thinking it will make the electronic more valuable if they want to sell it one day, and for some items, it might. But if you think of your home as storage space that costs money to maintain, do you think having the box for that electronic will recoup all the money you paid in the years you let it take up space? 
    * Exception: we mentioned that Apple boxes and similar quality boxes make great organizers, so you might save some of these to use as organizing tools.
  * Cords
    * If you don’t know what a cord is for, you probably don’t need it. Keep the cords you can immediately identify and discard the rest. A tangle of cords just makes it harder to find the one you need.
  * Broken appliances.
    * If it’s broken, discard it. 
    * If you’re worried about disposing of appliances responsibly, look into your local waste management company to see if they do special pick-ups or have a list of what items to recycle. 
    * If you don’t want the money you spent on it to go to waste, see if you have an active warranty on it, or look into getting it repaired. Otherwise, thank it for its service as you discard it.
  * Spare bedding
    * If you host friends and family a lot, you might need more spare bedding than other people. But if you have visitors once or twice a year at most, you really only need one set of spare bedding. Bedding that’s stored away for too long gets musty, and that’s not how you want to treat your guests.
  * Spare buttons
    * Discard these. If you really want to keep the spare buttons, sew them into the lining of the garment right when you get it. If you lose a button, you can always go to the local craft store to find a similar one. Most people, if they lose a button, either keep wearing the garment without replacing it or leave the garment in their closet never to be worn again--even if they have the spare buttons.
  * Health craze products
    * These usually cost a lot of money, which makes us less likely to want to discard them. But let them go if you don’t use them and they don’t spark joy. Thank them for their service--if you actually used them, or if they just gave you a thrill when you bought them--and then discard them with the satisfaction that they’re helping you get healthier right now by allowing you to get rid of them.
  * Freebies
    * Pens with school names, post-its from a doctor’s office, a keychain that you got at a game--unless you’re using these and they bring you joy, discard them. You didn’t purchase them and you don’t need them.
  * Spare change
    * Take it to the bank or put it in your wallet. It’s real money and it can buy you things. Don’t let it accumulate in bowls and containers in various surfaces, and don’t put it in a piggybank or a plastic bag. Chances are you’ll just let it accumulate and then never take it to the bank because it’ll be too heavy or too much of a hassle.
  * Stockpiles
    * Many people keep things they use all the time on hand in their homes, sometimes in extremely high numbers. Hundreds of rolls of toilet paper, 10 back-up shampoos, pairs of socks still wrapped in their plastic. 
    * You don’t need all these stockpiles--you won’t die if you run out of toilet paper. Give your stockpiles to friends who can use it right now, recycle it, or take it to a charitable donation center. 
    * You might think this is a waste of money--you’ll need toilet paper one day in the future, of course, so why not keep it? But these stockpiles take up valuable real estate in your home.
    * **While you might think they spark joy at the idea of always being prepared, they actually speak to an anxiety about _not_ being prepared.** Let these things go.



### Organizing

Kondo doesn’t go into too much detail on how to store many of these items. She mostly reinforces the principles already covered:

  * **Whenever possible, go for vertical storage.**
    * She even stores carrots in her fridge vertically, by putting them upright in the egg holders in her kitchen door. (Shortform note: remember, just apply the principles that make the most sense to you.)
  * **Remember that good storage should show you everything you have in one glance.**
  * **Keep your storage as simple as possible.** Don’t buy complicated storage solutions. Shoe box bottoms could go into cabinets to vertically store things all together and give you easy access to them just by pulling the box out, while shoe box tops can go into utensil drawers to serve as dividers and keep things from sliding around.



#### Bathroom and Kitchen Storage

Kondo doesn’t keep anything in her shower. Yeah, you read that right.

While this may seem extreme, she has good reason for doing so. In keeping with the idea that it doesn’t take much more effort to get things out of their storage space, she keeps shampoos and similar items in a cupboard close to her shower.

  * This makes it easier to clean the shower regularly, since you don’t have to take everything out, and it keeps your shower stuff from getting scummy and mildewy. Grab your shampoo and bring it in with you, then dry it off after you’re done and put it back in the cupboard.



She doesn’t keep her sponge in her kitchen sink, either. She stores detergent and sponges in the cabinet below the sink.

  * This allows the sponge to actually dry out between uses instead of getting wet every time you run the faucet, which makes the sponge last longer without getting musty and mildewy. You can also squeeze your sponge out after every use and hang it on a hook above the sink, where it’ll stay dry.



Kondo also puts her dishes out in the sunlight to dry them, instead of having a drying rack. She has a veranda where she can do this, so you might not have this option. But sunlight is a great, natural disinfectant, and it gets dishes out of your way as they dry instead of taking up counter space.

One common thing people do in kitchens is keep their basic cooking stuff right by the stove--oil, salt, pepper, and other seasonings. Don’t do this. It takes up counter space, and these things get coated in oil spray and food as you cook on the stove.

  * You probably have cabinets next to and on top of your stove, and usually there are small drawers right next to the stove to keep things in. Use these immediate storage solutions.



#### Miscellany Drawers

**Don’t worry too much about organizing these drawers more than you have to.** If you, for instance, put all your stationery items in one drawer, as you continue to use these items, the ones you use more frequently will naturally end up towards the front of the drawer, easier to access, while the items you use less frequently will move towards the back of the drawer.
