## Exercise: Sparking Joy

It can be tough to understand what something “sparking joy” really feels like. Use this exercise to help pinpoint what it feels like to you, and use it to remind yourself what joy feels like once you start tidying.

* * *

Grab something that you know you love. (If you’re a clothes person who loves to get dressed, grab your favorite item of clothing. If you’re a book reader with a personal library, pull out an all-time favorite book. If you love to cook, pick an item you love using.) Whatever the item is, find it, pick it up, and hold it in your hands. Write down what you love about the item, and how it feels to hold it.

Most of us own things we _don’t_ like, or that don’t spark joy. If you’ve got something in your house that you already know doesn’t spark joy, pick it up, hold it, and write down what that feels like. Bonus: write down _why_ it doesn’t spark joy in you.
