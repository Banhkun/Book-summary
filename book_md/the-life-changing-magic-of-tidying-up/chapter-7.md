## Chapter 7: Papers

Papers are essentially any mail or documents that we receive, notes we take in school or outside classes, or manuals and instructions that come with appliances or electronics.

Remember, this category doesn’t include things like love letters or special cards--those are mementos, and go in the last category. And it doesn’t include any books or magazines, but it does include newspapers.

### Discarding

General rule of thumb: **discard all papers.** This takes a lot of the guesswork out!

Here’s a few subcategories people commonly end up holding on to:

  * Lecture, class, or conference materials
    * Ironically, the more notes you have from seminars or lectures, the less you’re actually putting that information into practice. Perhaps holding on to the notes _is the exact thing_ that keeps you from putting the information into practice. The notes become a crutch--you’ve got the information written down, why would you need to remember it or practice it?
  * Credit card statements, utility bills, used checkbooks, and pay slips
    * Once you check the content of these items, you don’t need them unless there is an issue, so discard them. Some people think they might need these down the line in a court case to prove where they spent their money. This is unlikely, but nowadays, you can get all your statements online should this ever arise.
  * Warranties and manuals for appliances
    * Warranties are documents with an end date--save them while they’re active, get rid of them once they aren’t.
    * Ditch the manuals. Read the ones you’re worried about needing, and then ditch those. You can find the manuals online, take these items into shops if they’re having problems, or call stores to have repair people come take a look at them.
  * Cards
    * Don’t save greeting cards unless you need the addresses on them, in which case you can save just one most recent card with the address, or record the addresses somewhere.
    * You don’t need to feel guilty about getting rid of cards that someone sent you. Each card fulfills its purpose the moment it reaches you and you read it for the first time--you are reminded that someone was thinking of you. You probably won’t go through old cards just to remind yourself of that feeling.



### Organizing

**There are 3 categories of papers you might need to keep:**

  * Papers you’re currently using
  * Papers you need for a limited period of time
  * Papers that must be kept indefinitely



Papers you do decide to keep should be further categorized into two groups:

  * **Papers to save** , such as birth and marriage certificates, current leases, vet papers, and insurance policies.
  * **Papers to deal with** , such as letters that need responses, forms to be filled out, or newspapers you’re (actually!) going to read.



**Put papers that you need to deal with in a special place that contains ONLY these papers.** Kondo suggests using a vertical organizer and putting papers in it without separating them.

  * Even Marie Kondo has never successfully and totally emptied her “needs attention” box, but that’s the goal. They should eventually be attended to, and anything you don’t need after that should be discarded, while anything you need to keep turns into the next category. 



**Papers you need get divided into two subcategories: infrequently and frequently used.**

  * You don’t have to put a lot of energy into storing the few papers you have to keep but use infrequently, such as insurance policies or warranties. Since you don’t access them often, put them all into a single clear folder without further categorization.
  * Papers that you use more frequently might be things like newspaper clippings or seminar outlines. These you could put into the clear plastic pages of a file folder.
    * Papers like this aren’t really all that necessary, and it’s easy for this category to get out of hand. Reduce the volume as much as possible to organize them most efficiently.



So you really only need **3 simple places to store each of these 3 paper categories** , and you don’t need to waste time organizing them into smaller categories.
