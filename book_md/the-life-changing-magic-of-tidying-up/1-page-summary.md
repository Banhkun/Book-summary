## 1-Page Summary

Many of us have difficulty keeping our homes tidy because we were never taught how. But tidying is a simple act, and there are actually only a few reasons why we have difficulty tidying. **People who can’t tidy fall into three categories: they can’t get rid of things, they can’t organize things, or a combination of both** \--most of us fall into the last category.

In this 1-page summary we share a high level overview of the KonMari method, but if it’s unclear, there are many more details on how exactly to implement these steps in the full summary.

### Tidying, at a High Level

The basic process is to **discard first, then organize what’s left.**

Most people tidy by going through a small portion of objects first, usually by convenience, and then trying to put that small portion away before they start on everything else. Think of a desk: you go through the stuff on top of your desk, discard whatever you don’t need anymore, and then immediately try to put what’s left in the drawers--but then you find the drawers are full and cluttered, because you haven’t gone through everything first, so you give up and the clutter remains.

The KonMari process helps you avoid these stopping points. Don’t do it little by little, **do your whole house in one go** (as much as you can depending on your schedule--it’s fine if it takes up to 6 months).**** And **go by category, not by room**.

For each category, gather **all the items together in a giant pile, discard first, then organize what’s left**.

**Here’s the correct order that makes things mentally easier:**

  * Clothes
  * Books
  * Papers
  * Komono (miscellany)
  * Sentimental items



For each category, go through every single item like so:

  * Pick it up. 
  * Ask yourself, **does this item spark joy?**
    * If it does, keep it.
    * **If it doesn’t, thank it for everything it’s done for you. Then move it to the discard/donate pile.**



After you’ve discarded items in a certain category, then you can move on to organizing what’s left in that category. When you organize, **keep your storage as simple as possible:** use what your home already has, as opposed to buying a lot of complicated storage solutions that ultimately end up cluttering your space more.

Ideally, you should be able to see everything you own at a glance and get whatever you need easily. **Vertical storage is better than horizontal storage** to accomplish this, like books upright on a bookshelf instead of stacked on top of each other--it’s much easier to see all your books and take a single book out when they’re organized vertically.

### Tidying for Each Category

#### Clothing

If you have a lot of clothes or want a more organized approach, break it down into subcategories: tops, bottoms, hanging clothes, socks, undergarments, bags, accessories, event-specific clothing like swimsuits, and shoes.

There are 2 major categories of clothes people have difficulty dealing with: 1) clothes they bought but never wore, and 2) clothes they hope to fit into one day.

  * For clothes you bought but never wore: thank them for teaching you that you don’t like to wear that style of clothing, and discard them.
  * For clothes you hope to fit into one day: clothes that you can’t wear right now are useless to you unless you’re on the verge of being able to wear them and actively working toward that goal. Thank them for motivating you to get in better shape, discard them, and buy clothes that fit you in your current size and spark joy.



Folding and storing vertically is better than hanging in terms of storage. **The goal for folding is to make the smallest, smoothest, simplest rectangle that can stand up on its own.** (Shortform note: There are much more detailed instructions in Chapter 5.)

Some clothes need to be hung, like suits and dresses, and these should be grouped by category.

#### Books

Take all your books off their shelves and out of any piles they’re already in. If you have a lot of books, you can break them down into these subcategories: general books you read for pleasure, practical books you use for reference, visual books like photography or art books, and magazines.

Don’t read any books as you sort through them to discard. This will cloud your judgement.

Many people have difficulty in this category, specifically with books they still intend to read, and books they think they’ll reread again. **Keep only your hall-of-fame books**.

  * If you haven’t read it yet and you didn’t just buy it, you’re probably not going to read it, so you should discard it. If, once it’s gone, you forget about it, then you were right to discard. If you find yourself still wanting to read it, go buy another copy and _actually read it this time._
  * There are very few books we actually reread. This is where the hall of fame idea is helpful. If it goes in your hall of fame and sparks joy every time you read it, keep it. If you liked it but would probably never read it again, discard it.



#### Papers

The general rule is to **discard all papers.**

**There are only 3 categories you should keep:** 1) papers you need to deal with, 2) papers you need for a limited amount of time such as warranties, and 3) papers you need indefinitely such as marriage certificates and insurance policies.

Many people keep things like utility bills or credit card statements. These should be looked at upon receipt to make sure there aren’t any issues, put in the “need to deal with” category to pay the bills, and then discarded.

Many people also have difficulty discarding lecture notes, since they don’t want to lose this information. But we usually put into practice information we’ve learned that’s helpful to us--so if you’re not actively using the information in those papers, you probably don’t need it.

Have 1 place or container for each of the three keep categories, and don’t bother with any further storage. The goal is to discard enough papers that it isn’t a hassle to go through everything you have to find what you need.

#### Komono, or miscellany

This category contains: CDs/DVDs, skin and bath products, gifts, valuables like passports and credit cards, hobby items, electrical appliances and cords, household equipment and supplies, kitchen goods and utensils, and small items like knick knacks and spare change.

This category encompasses a lot of stuff, but it’s also **the category that contributes the most to clutter**. Don’t surround yourself with things that you don’t use and don’t bring you joy.

Go in order from personal items to communal items (the order above roughly goes in the right sequence).

#### Sentimental items

This category includes any item whose primary value is emotional: cards, letters, gifts, photos, objects from your childhood or your children’s younger years, etc.

**Save this category for last, because it is the hardest to discard and store.**

  * Sentimental items are rare, which makes it difficult for us to let go of them, and they usually involve someone else, which can often make us feel guilty for discarding them. 
  * Going through the rest of the process first will help you hone your sense of joy and your ability to decide what to keep and what to discard, which will make this category easier to work through. 



Two major areas of difficulty in this category are photos and gifts.

  * For photos: remember that you don’t need a photo of every second from every vacation or event. Keep only the best handful of photos from every memory and discard the rest. Then put all your photos into albums so you can easily access them and view them when you want to.
  * For gifts: gifts are intended to convey affection from the giver to the receiver. They do this _when we receive them_. You may feel guilty for getting rid of a gift that someone gave you, but 1) the gift has already served its purpose, and 2) the giver wanted to bring joy to your life, so they wouldn’t want you holding on to something that doesn’t bring you joy. 



**Keep the things that spark joy, but be wary of living too much in the past** and not appreciating the present or making room for the future. You’ll always have important memories in your mind. If you wouldn’t remember it without the physical reminder, it probably wasn’t an event worth remembering.

### The Lasting Mindset from Tidying

**If you learn how to tidy correctly, you can transform your home and change how you live your everyday life and perceive of belongings.**

But discarding things and organizing what’s left can help us improve more than just our space:

  * Dialoguing with ourselves throughout this process hones our sense of intuition. 
  * Deciding what to keep or discard hones our ability to make decisions confidently.
  * Keeping only objects that spark joy hones our ability to experience joy, and creates more joy in our lives.
  * Completing this process can even bring us back to big-picture life things that are important to us. 



This process will help you live a more content life--letting go is more important to achieve contentment than adding. The less you have, the more you can **appreciate the things that surround you daily.**
