## Exercise: Visualizing Your Life

Use this exercise to help you visualize what your ideal home looks and feels like.

* * *

What would your ideal space look and feel like? If you’re having trouble answering, try focusing on a specific room instead: what would your ideal bedroom look and feel like? Remember, the more specific you can be, the better.

Visualizing ideal routines can also help us determine how we want our space to look and feel. Imagine you’ve just finished a long day at work: what would your ideal routine be after you finally get home?

Now write down what you would need in your space to make that routine happen. (For example, if you want to meditate after a long day, you might need floor space and an uncluttered room. If you want to get home and be creative, you might want a more eclectic space with interesting objects that get your brain going.) What kind of space does your routine speak to, and what would you need to make it happen?
