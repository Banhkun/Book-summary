## Achieve a Reciprocal Relationship

**The key to a successful relationship is for both partners to feel equally fulfilled and loved** —it should be a win/win relationship. Both partners should be equally motivated to give love to and receive love from one another.

### Learn to Motivate Your Partner

If you feel unloved in your relationship, you might need to motivate your partner to show you the kind of love you need. The first step is to understand how men and women are motivated differently in love:

  * Men are motivated in love when they feel needed by their partner. 
  * Women in love are motivated when they feel cherished by their partner.



If your partner is feeling unfulfilled in your relationship, you might need to motivate yourself to show love to your partner in a different way:

  * Men must learn how to give. 
  * Women must learn how to receive. 



#### Men Are Motivated by Being Needed

On Mars, men operated with a win/lose philosophy. Every man looked after himself and his own needs. Life on Mars was like a game of tennis—each man not only wanted to win, he wanted to actively make his competitor lose.

Once men discovered women, however, their view changed. Women instinctively sent out a signal of need to these men: “We need your power and strength. Come to Venus and satisfy everything we are missing.” The men were motivated to overcome their fear of dependence. All of a sudden, their capacity to sacrifice and serve the needs of someone else was awakened. Once in love, men were suddenly motivated to serve others to the best of their ability. They experienced their partner’s happiness as their own. **Men started to develop a win/win philosophy. They learned how to give.**

Unfortunately, because the signal of need is a subconscious instinct for a woman at the start of a relationship, many women neglect to keep sending that signal of need.**** Not being needed is torture for a man in love. **When a man stops feeling that he is needed, he becomes passive, uninterested, and ungiving.** He goes back to his win/lose way of thinking and chooses to satisfy his own needs at the expense of his partner’s.

##### Why Men Have a Win/Lose Philosophy

A man’s deepest fear is the idea that he is incompetent or inadequate. That is why men put so much emphasis on proving their power, autonomy, and achievement. Subconsciously, men fear reaching out and giving in a relationship because it leaves them vulnerable to failing the woman they love.

That is why men developed a win/lose philosophy—they thought that by not caring about the needs of others, they wouldn’t be at risk of failing to fulfill those needs.

**A man will not be ready to open up and give love until he realizes that it is OK to make mistakes.** A man must feel accepted and encouraged to risk putting himself out there.

Unfortunately for many men, their hesitance to give freely results in their partner’s resentment. That resentment feels like blame to a man and confirms his fear that he isn’t good enough.

#### Women Are Motivated by Adoration

On Venus, women operated with a lose/win philosophy—women are willing to sacrifice personally to help another woman win. Everyone on Venus did their best to nurture one another’s needs.

Once women discovered men, however, they began to see another way of doing things. Men taught women the joy of being taken care of and the importance of receiving emotional support from someone that didn’t need caring for in return.**** These women were motivated to stop being martyrs. **They started to develop a win/win philosophy and learn how to receive.**

Unfortunately, many women carry their instinctual lose/win philosophy into their relationships. **A woman who consistently gives more than her partner will not feel adequately cherished in the relationship.** She will become exhausted and unappreciative. Often, she will blame her partner for her unfulfillment.

##### Why Women Have a Lose/Win Philosophy

Women have a deep fear of being abandoned, judged, and rejected. Subconsciously, women feel unworthy of receiving support. Depending on others is difficult for women because being ignored or dismissed after expressing need would confirm their deepest fear that they are unworthy of the support they desire.

That is why women on Venus developed a lose/win philosophy—they thought that by sacrificing their own needs for others, they would become worthy of love.

**A woman will not be ready to open up and receive from her partner until she realizes that she is worthy and deserving of love**. Unfortunately for many women, they don’t come to the realization that they are worthy until they have exhausted themselves from years of giving too much in a relationship.

#### Men and Women Are Motivated by Boundaries

Because men are naturally hesitant to give and women are naturally hesitant to receive, it can be difficult to establish boundaries in a relationship. But **setting boundaries is essential to building a reciprocal relationship and avoiding resentment.** Setting boundaries means regulating how much _you_ give, as opposed to expecting your partner to give more and keep the score even.

If you feel you are in a nonreciprocal relationship and holding resentment towards your partner, you’ll need to go through these three steps to heal the relationship:

  1. **Motivation:** First, both you and your partner need to become motivated to make the changes necessary to heal the relationship. The woman will need to feel understood and cherished. The man will need to feel needed and trusted to make the necessary changes. 
  2. **Responsibility:** Next, both you and your partner need to take responsibility for your role in building a non-reciprocal relationship. The man will have to take responsibility for not giving enough support. The woman will have to take responsibility for not setting boundaries for how much she can give and for not asking for what she needs to receive. 
  3. **Practice:** The final step is to practice setting and respecting limits with your partner. One of the most important aspects of this step is learning how to express feelings in an honest yet respectful way. Both you and your partner will need to understand in advance that mistakes will be made. 



Here are some examples of how you can practice setting boundaries, respecting boundaries, and expressing your feelings in an honest yet respectful way:

  * Practice telling your partner when you deserve to be treated better. For example, “I don’t appreciate the way you’re speaking to me. Please stop yelling, or I will have to leave the room.”
  * Practice saying no to requests that will make you resent your partner. For example, “I need to relax right now. I’m sorry I can’t help you.” 
  * Practice telling your partner what you need instead of expecting him to instinctively know. 
  * Practice allowing your partner to change and adjust her expectations. 



As a woman, once you learn to set boundaries for your partner, you will be motivated to forgive past disappointments and ask for support in the future. By communicating your needs and your limits, you’ll realize your worth and become more open to your partner.

As a man, once you learn to respect your partner’s limits, you will be motivated to make changes and give more. As you realize that you are allowed to make mistakes, you’ll feel safe to reach out and give your partner the support she needs.

### How to Get the Support You Need

Many relationship troubles stem from unfulfillment. **If you feel unfulfilled in your relationship, it might be because you aren’t asking what for what you need.**

Men and women both have trouble asking for support from their partner. But women find it even more frustrating to ask for help or support than men do because women want to receive love _without having to ask_ , like they did on Venus.

Here are some commonly asked questions from women that illustrate women’s reluctance to ask for support:

  * Why should I have to ask for help when I don’t ever wait for him to ask me for help?
  * Why should I be so appreciative of his help when I’m still doing so much more? 
  * If he loves me, why doesn’t he offer to help me before I ask him to?



The answer to all of these questions is that men come from a different planet and therefore give and receive love differently. Men typically do not offer help unless asked to do so because they want to respect others’ autonomy.

Because women are usually the ones in the relationship that have the most trouble requesting support, this chapter is written directly to women. But men should learn these principles, as well, to understand their female partners better.

Asking for support can be challenging, but you’ll be successful when you go through these three steps:

  * Step One: Ask for what you’re already getting in a new way.
  * Step Two: Ask for more support and accept no for an answer.
  * Step Three: Ask for what you want assertively. 



#### Step One: Ask For What You’re Already Getting in a New Way

In order to get more in your relationship, you must first acknowledge what you’re already getting from your partner. Identify the little things that your partner consistently does for you, and practice asking for them in advance. Then show him a lot of appreciation when he completes each task.

This is only step one, so don’t expect him to give you any unsolicited support and don’t ask for anything more than you already get from your partner consistently. **This step is about getting your partner used to being asked for help in a non-demanding way.** You are reconditioning your partner to say yes to your requests by making him confident that he will be appreciated for his support.

##### Tips for Asking a Man for Support

The five elements of a good request are:

  * **Timing:** Make sure to ask for something _before_ your partner thinks to do it. And once you ask him, don’t expect him to respond right away. 
  * **Attitude:** Make your request in the most positive way you can. Avoid asking in a demanding or resentful tone, or your partner will feel unappreciated before he has even started. 
  * **Brevity:** When you make a request, don’t give a list of reasons why you’re asking. The longer the request, the more likely your partner will resist because it will feel like a list of reasons why he _must_ do something. **Assume that he will say yes without convincing.** This will make him feel trusted. 
  * **Directness:** Make sure you are actually making a request, not just stating a problem and expecting your partner to offer a solution. For example, instead of **saying** “There are a lot of groceries in the car,” you should **ask** “Would you please help me bring in the groceries?” 
  * **Wording:** When you make a request, replace the word “could” with the word “would.” Remember, men from Mars value their abilities. Asking a man if he _can_ or _could_ do something is insulting and irritating to men because men value competence. 



> **Example of an Improved Request**
> 
> **Unsuccessful request:** “There are a lot of grocery bags still in the car. I need them if I’m going to make dinner. Could you go get them?”
> 
> **The problem:** This request is too long, has too many justifications, and uses “could.”
> 
> **Successful request:** “Would you please bring in the rest of the groceries from the car?”

##### Could Vs. Would Requests

Although many people use “could” and “would” interchangeably, they mean and imply different things. “Could” indicates the _ability_ to do something, whereas “would” indicates a _willingness_ to do something.

To many women, a request beginning in “could” sounds more polite and less demanding than one with “would.” But men respond much more positively to “would” requests.

To a man, “could” sounds weak, manipulative, and untrusting. Because a man knows that he _could_ physically complete the task, the request sounds insincere, like his partner is trying to back him into doing something he wouldn’t otherwise do.

Women should think about it this way: How different would it be if your partner said “no, I _can’t_ help you” instead of “no, I _won’t_ help you.” It would be insulting to hear your partner say he “won’t” help, because that is a personal rejection, rather than an inability to support you.

Here are some comments from men about could vs. would requests:

  * When my partner says “could you mow the yard?” I take it literally. Of course, I _could_ do it, I am capable of it. When I say that I could do it, it doesn’t feel as though I’m making a promise. But when my partner says “would you mow the yard?” and I say yes, then I am making a promise to actually complete the task. 
  * When a woman says “could you do this for me?”, I feel free to be honest and say no. But when a woman says “would you please do this for me?”, I get more motivated to try and help. 



#### Step Two: Allow Your Partner to Say “No”

Once you have practiced making existing requests in the right way and showing your appreciation, your partner’s love needs should be fulfilled and he should be ready and willing to increase his ability to offer support. You’re ready to move onto Step Two.

In this step, you purposely ask for support when you can sense that he will say no. Then you accept his rejection with a simple “OK” or “no problem.” You are conditioning your partner to realize that he can say no to a request and still earn your love. This is important, because **when men have the freedom to say no, they will be much more likely to say yes.**

You should _only_ make requests at this stage if you can comfortably accept no for an answer. Resist the urge to ask for anything that your partner cannot deny you without making you upset. Here are some examples of appropriate requests at this stage:

  * Normally, you pick up the kids from school so that your partner doesn’t have to stop what he’s working on. Next time, you ask him “Would you please pick up the kids from school today?” If he says no, with or without a reason, you simply say “OK” and pick them up as usual. 
  * Normally, you do the dishes after dinner while your partner watches TV. You’ve always wanted to ask him to help, but you know he hates washing dishes and will probably say no. Next time, say “Would you help me do the dishes tonight?” If he says no, graciously say “no problem” and do them yourself as normal. 



When your partner says no and you respond with loving acceptance, he will award you points (as described in “How to Score Points With a Man”). **Next time, he will be more responsive to you when you make a request because you have made him feel loved.** On the other hand, if you don’t make these requests, your partner will never know how often you really need his support.

#### Step Three: Ask Assertively and Wait For a Yes

Once you have practiced making requests in the right way and your partner has learned that he is free to say no, you are ready to move on to Step Three. Steps One and Two were like a warm-up and Step Three is like a stretch—your partner has to stretch and become more flexible in order to make room for your new requests.

**In this step, you finally learn to assert your power and get what you need from your partner.** The key elements of this step are:

  * A long, silent pause. 
  * A second request, if necessary. 



This is how you make a request in Step Three:

When you make a request and your partner resists by grumbling (discussed below), instead of responding with “OK” (like you did in Step 2), you should continue to stand there with your partner and take a long, silent pause. Be accepting of his resistance, don’t portray any disapproval or frustration. Remain silent even if he scowls or grumbles. If necessary, calmly and confidently make your request again. **Be assertive—make your request with trust that he will support you if he is able.**

Eventually, because of the programming Steps One and Two, your partner will come around and respond positively to your request.

##### Why Men Grumble

In Step Three, you will notice your partner’s tendency to grumble. **Grumbling, moaning, or mumbling is a man’s way of working through your request.** Remember, he is stretching—he is considering what you need him to do versus what he would rather be doing. The more focused he was on what he was doing at the time of your request, the more he will grumble.

You should not take grumbling as a sign of your partner’s unwillingness to support you. If he was unwilling, he would have already said no. Simply pause and stay silent through the grumbles. Resist the urge to say things like “just forget it” or “I have to do everything myself.”

##### Ask Again, When Necessary

Sometimes, after a man lets out his grumbles he will come around and say yes to your request without any further prompting. But other times, he will resist by trying to argue his way out or turn the request around on you. **Be tactful—calmly and succinctly let your partner know that your need is just as important as his. Then, make your request again.**

Here are some examples:

  * You’ve made a request and remained silent through your partner’s grumbles. Then he says “I’m too rushed. Can’t you do it?” You should respond “I’m rushed, as well. Would you please do it?” Then take another long pause. 
  * After a few grumbles, your partner responds to your request by saying “I don’t feel like doing that right now.” You calmly respond “I don’t feel like it either. Would you please do this for me?” Follow with a long pause. 



Just like in your first request, avoid validating your second request or convincing him it’s important. Don’t try to make your need seem _greater_ than his, only equal to his. Match his resistance with a brief statement. Then ask (don’t demand) again for what you need.

**If for any reason, your partner still denies your request, go back to Step Two.** Graciously accept his rejection. Letting it go this time will earn you points for your next try. Just because you think you’ve moved on to Step Three doesn’t mean you can forget what you learned in Steps One and Two: asking the right way and accepting no for an answer.

Through this entire process, it is important to remember that your male partner comes from Mars—he needs to feel independent, accepted, and worthy in order to be satisfied in love. If it seems like your partner is overly sensitive about being asked for help or overly concerned with being controlled, you want to be gentle when programming him to give you more support. Your partner will eventually be happy to learn how to fulfill your needs.

> **Example: Successful Programming**
> 
> One night, John was getting ready for bed when his wife, Bonnie, asked him to go to the store for milk. John immediately began to grumble and try to get out of it. When Bonnie stayed silent and stuck to her request, John angrily left for the store.
> 
> On the way to get the milk, John’s attitude suddenly changed. He stopped being angry and started looking forward to the feeling of accomplishment he would get from completing a task. He felt proud of himself for doing something for his wife. He even felt happy as he walked through the store.
> 
> When he arrived home, Bonnie was happy, too. She showed her appreciation with a hug, a smile, and a thank you. John felt loved. So the next time Bonnie asked John to go out and get milk, he grumbled less before agreeing to go. The third time Bonnie asked for milk, he said yes without grumbling at all.
> 
> A week after his third trip to the store, John noticed that Bonnie was low on milk, so he offered to go get some. But Bonnie said that she was already planning to go to the store herself. John couldn’t believe it, but he was actually disappointed. Bonnie’s love and appreciation had programmed John to _enjoy_ going to the store for milk.
> 
> This successful programming began that very first time Bonnie requested that John go to the store. **If she had been less appreciative when John returned, he might not have said yes the next time she asked for milk.** And he wouldn’t have realized how much he actually liked being able to provide something for his wife.
