## Exercise: Consider Your Happiness

Bartlett says that the internet, social media, and algorithms are selling a false dream of happiness and success that don’t actually exist. Contentment and fulfillment in life, love, and work come from being true to yourself and pursuing things that are meaningful to you.

* * *

Reflect on a time you saw something online or on TV that made you feel envious or bad because you didn’t have it. Describe what it was, how it made you feel, and what, if anything, you did to try to get it.

Now think about something in your life that you’re grateful for. What is it and why are you grateful for it?

Think about how you felt in the first situation versus the second. Do you spend more of each day feeling the first feeling or the second? What’s one step you can take to change that? (For example, by limiting your media intake, spending more time in nature, or connecting with friends.)

If you were to make this change, how do you believe it would affect your happiness, success, or love life?
