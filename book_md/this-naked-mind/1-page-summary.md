## 1-Page Summary

In _This Naked Mind_ , Annie Grace reveals the real reason it’s so hard to quit drinking: We often see alcohol as a drink that enhances life experiences and makes us happy, relaxed, and confident. Although in reality, alcohol does none of these things, Grace explains that our unconscious minds still cling to these false beliefs that alcohol is _good_. To break free from alcohol dependence, you must change your unconscious beliefs and see alcohol as it truly is: an addictive drug that poisons your mind and body. When you change your beliefs, you’ll overcome addiction by no longer _wanting_ to drink, and you’ll enjoy a fulfilling life free of alcohol.

Grace is a speaker, coach, and founder of _This Naked Mind_ , which offers resources and programs for quitting or cutting back on alcohol. After becoming the youngest vice president in the history of a multinational company, Grace developed a dependence on alcohol. By changing her subconscious beliefs about alcohol, she went from drinking two bottles of wine at night to being happily sober.

In this guide, we’ll first explore why people struggle with alcohol addiction by explaining what alcohol does to the body and how addiction works. Then, we’ll discuss ways to change the false unconscious beliefs we have about alcohol and recover from addiction without needing formal treatment or rehabilitation. Along the way, we’ll compare Grace’s advice with that of other addiction experts and provide additional practical tips for applying her recovery approach to your life.

### Part 1: Understand the Truths About Alcohol and Addiction

Before we look into ways to deconstruct society’s misleading messages about alcohol, it’s important to understand how alcohol and addiction work. In the following sections, we’ll discuss common misconceptions about alcohol, why everyone’s at risk for addiction, and how a denial of that fact leads to alcohol abuse.

#### Society Misrepresents Alcohol and Addiction

Grace writes that society misrepresents alcohol addiction in two ways: First, it conditions us to believe that alcohol is less dangerous or addictive than it really is. Second, it makes us believe that addiction only happens to people who can’t control their drinking, and that we who _do_ have control are safe from it. Because of this, many people are unaware of the dangers of drinking and the risk of addiction. Let's look at these two misconceptions in more detail.

(Shortform note: Research supports Grace's argument that people largely underestimate the dangers of alcohol and the risk of addiction. According to one study, although 71% of US adults believe alcohol affects drinkers negatively, most think that the effects of alcohol are only _somewhat negative_ rather than _very_ negative. This way of thinking isn’t limited to America, either. Alcohol abuse is a global problem, affecting around 107 million people.)

##### The Dangerous Truth About Alcohol

First, Grace points out that society often differentiates alcohol from other drugs, leading us to believe that it’s less harmful than substances like heroin or cocaine. However, Grace argues that this is dangerously misleading: Contrary to what society would have us believe, **alcohol is a highly addictive drug, and it affects everyone’s mind in the same way.**

(Shortform note: If alcohol’s so dangerous and addictive, why did humans start drinking it? Some evolutionary scientists cite the drunken monkey hypothesis to explain why humans developed a unique taste for alcohol. According to this hypothesis, our early ancestors lived in forests and ate large quantities of fruits, which naturally contain alcohol. Alcohol indicated that fruit was ripe and had a strong smell, which helped our ancestors find fruits more easily. However, humans later learned to make drinks containing higher levels of alcohol than were naturally found in fruits. These levels of alcohol were more than our bodies evolved to handle, thus leading people to develop alcohol dependence.)

Grace defines addiction as a habit you can’t break, even when you know it’s bad and want to stop. Alcohol causes addiction by affecting your brain in several ways:

**1\. Alcohol activates the pleasure center in your brain** and causes it to release dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that motivates you to seek rewards—in other words, it makes you crave more alcohol. However, contrary to popular belief, dopamine doesn’t bring you any enjoyment itself.

(Shortform note: Like our taste for alcohol, dopamine also had an evolutionary function. In _The Willpower Instinct_ , Kelly McGonigal explains that dopamine helped our ancestors survive by encouraging them to pursue beneficial things. For example, when they saw food, their brains would release dopamine, which would motivate them to hunt or gather the food. However, dopamine also drives addiction because it makes you more impulsive, causing you to take more risks. It also makes you anxious when you don’t pursue the reward.)

**2\. Your tolerance increases the more you drink.** Over time, you become less sensitive to the effects of alcohol and need to drink more to feel relief or enjoyment. This is because your body is always trying to stay in a stable and balanced state (a process called homeostasis). When you drink alcohol, you artificially stimulate the brain's pleasure center. In reaction to this, your brain releases chemicals that dull this stimulation in its efforts to maintain homeostasis, reducing the pleasure you get from the alcohol.

(Shortform note: You might wonder why your body stops you from having too much of a good thing, like pleasure, but maintaining homeostasis is essential for survival. It allows you to function optimally regardless of changes in your environment. For example, if you’re outside on a hot summer day, your body produces sweat to cool you to the ideal body temperature. Your body regulates your mood in the same way because staying in a high or low mood requires more effort and energy. This is why, when alcohol overstimulates your brain’s pleasure centers, your brain tries to counteract this excessive stimulation.)

**3\. You feel worse when alcohol leaves your system.** Grace adds that each time you take a drink and it leaves your body, you’re left with an empty and unpleasant sensation that drives you to remedy it by drinking more.

(Shortform note: According to psychiatrists there are several reasons you may feel discomfort after drinking: Alcohol causes your brain to release a calming chemical called GABA, but when it wears off, you feel even more anxious. It also causes your body to produce stress hormones to normalize blood sugar levels after drinking. And when you experience these effects, you tend to get poorer sleep, which can also make you feel worse the following day.)

**4\. It damages your decision-making skills.** Grace writes that alcohol impairs your prefrontal cortex—the part of your brain that helps you make good decisions and control your impulses. The more you drink, the harder it is to resist another drink.

(Shortform note: One way to strengthen your prefrontal cortex and improve your impulse control is through meditation. In _The Willpower Instinct_ , Kelly McGonigal explains that meditation increases blood flow to your prefrontal cortex, allowing it to grow and become more efficient at processing. She suggests you do a five-minute daily meditation practice in which you quiet your mind and focus on your breathing.)

##### Alcohol Addiction Can Happen to Anyone

We often think alcohol addiction only happens to people with certain weaknesses or defects and that most people can control their drinking. But Grace writes that**anyone who drinks alcohol can and will become addicted if they drink enough of it.** Grace explains that there aren’t specific genes or personality traits that cause some people to become addicted while others don’t. The only difference in how alcohol affects drinkers is how fast or how slow addiction sets in.

(Shortform note: Although Grace argues that there aren’t genes or traits that lead people to become alcoholics, there are factors that put some people at greater risk of addiction than others. In _Quit Like a Woman_ , Holly Whitaker writes that people who experience inner pain—such as trauma, marginalization, or mental health issues—tend to rely more on alcohol to cope and are thus at greater risk of developing an addiction.)

Believing that addiction is abnormal, and self-control is all that’s needed to drink responsibly is harmful, Grace argues. It causes people to deny or hide their drinking problems for fear of being judged. This belief also makes it harder for people to see that alcohol is the real problem, not them, and recognize their addiction before it gets out of control.

(Shortform note: Research shows the stigma toward people with alcohol use disorder has been relatively unchanged in the past decades. Some experts think that one of the reasons for this persistent stigma is that people tend to view addiction as a binary: You either have an addiction or you don’t. This oversimplified view makes it hard for people to recognize they have a problem and seek help. To reduce this stigma, some experts argue that we must encourage people to recognize that alcohol addiction falls on a spectrum rather than view it as a black-and-white label.)

### Part 2: Change Your Subconscious Beliefs About Alcohol

You might know consciously that alcohol is a dangerous drug that can hook anyone who drinks it. But Grace argues that this knowledge is often not enough to stay sober after you quit alcohol. You also need to **change your subconscious mind, which still thinks that alcohol is good and that abstaining from it means losing something valuable**.

(Shortform note: In _Behave_ , Robert Sapolsky agrees with Grace that your subconscious beliefs shape your behavior. He explains that people naturally follow the values and beliefs of the culture they grow up in, often without questioning them. This means that if you don’t actively challenge your beliefs, you’ll inherently accept how society portrays alcohol as true. This explains why it’s important to examine and change your subconscious mind, as Grace suggests.)

But what unconscious beliefs might you have? Grace writes that alcohol is a big part of Western society and culture. Drinking is common in many cultural traditions—from weddings to football games. On top of that, advertisements, friends and family, movies, and social gatherings all lead you to the false conclusion that alcohol is good.

(Shortform note: Research reveals how glorified alcohol is in American culture: According to one study, almost one in four songs on Billboard’s Hot 100 list reference alcohol. In addition to this, alcohol marketing in movies has doubled in the last two decades. In _Quit Like a Woman_ , Holly Whitaker explains why alcohol marketing is so abundant: Most alcohol brands are owned by one of 16 companies, making the alcohol industry highly competitive.)

Grace argues that as long as you subconsciously think alcohol is good for you, quitting will be hard. **To live a life free of alcohol, you must challenge your beliefs that alcohol has any value or benefit** , understand where those beliefs come from, and question the reasons you drink. Once you see alcohol as a poison, not an antidote, you won’t want to drink anymore.****

(Shortform note: Grace’s aims to help you change your beliefs about alcohol by exposing the myths and misconceptions many people have about drinking, but you can also apply a general framework for questioning your beliefs and opinions on any subject. In _101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think_ , Brianna Wiest suggests you ask yourself several questions: When did you first encounter this belief? How does this belief affect how you judge yourself and others? How would your life change if you believed the opposite? And how would your best self think about this issue?)

Let’s explore some beliefs that lead people to drink and discuss why alcohol doesn’t provide the benefits that people believe it provides.

#### False Belief #1: Alcohol Tastes Good

Some people claim to enjoy alcohol because of its taste. But Grace writes that it’s not the alcohol that they like but the flavor of other ingredients in their drink—such as the juice or the sugar. In fact, **many people _dislike_ their first sip of alcohol, which should be a sign that it’s bad for us.** Our taste and smell are two senses that warn us about things that are bad for us or could make us sick, such as rotten foods and, in this case, alcohol.

However, we ignore our senses and continue consuming alcohol because of the societal conditioning we’ve received throughout our lives. We reason that, despite its taste, alcohol must improve our lives in some way because so many people drink it. We’re even told that we must _acquire_ a taste for it. However, the unpleasant taste, in fact, makes us feel safer from addiction because we assume we can’t become addicted to something that we don’t enjoy the taste of.

> **The Factors That Shape Our Taste Preferences Are Complex**
> 
> Grace writes that the bad initial taste of alcohol is a sign that it’s bad for us, but other experts point out that the subject of taste is slightly more complicated than that. They state that our survival needs play only one part in influencing our taste preferences. While it’s true that inedible, rotten, or poisonous foods often have a bitter or sour taste, plenty of healthy foods, like certain vegetables, are also bitter. Therefore, just because people tend to like or dislike the tastes of certain foods doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re good or bad for us.
> 
> We commonly assume that certain substances like alcohol or coffee are acquired tastes, but experts argue that _most tastes are actually acquired_. Acquired tastes include any foods we grow to like that don’t initially appeal to our innate biological desires—for example, yogurt, hot sauce, or ginger. Thus, we learn to like these foods just as we learn to like alcohol.

For other people, it’s less about the taste of alcohol itself, but how alcohol makes _other_ foods taste. However, Grace argues that alcohol doesn’t improve the flavor of food, but actually makes it worse. She explains that alcohol numbs your taste buds, making them less sensitive to the flavors of food.

(Shortform note: Although drinking alcohol may not enhance the taste of foods, it does tend to increase your appetite. Studies show that people tend to eat more after drinking alcohol for several reasons: Alcohol is believed to inhibit the effects of leptin, which is a hormone that reduces your appetite. Also, some research indicates that alcohol stimulates the neurons in your brain that activate when you’re starving.)

#### False Belief #2: Alcohol Is Healthy in Moderation

Another belief people hold is that drinking in moderation is actually good for health. However, Grace writes that this isn’t true: **Drinking any amount of alcohol is bad for your health.** She explains that alcohol affects your body in many negative ways: It slows your brain functioning, hinders your ability to regulate emotions, weakens your heart, increases the risk of blood clots, damages your liver, weakens your immune system, and can even cause cancer and early death.

(Shortform note: Alcohol can harm the health of anyone who consumes it, but studies show that women are more at risk of suffering from the negative health effects that Grace lists. Experts say this is because of several factors: First, women’s bodies have proportionately less water and more fat than men. Water helps dilute alcohol, while fat retains it. This means that alcohol stays in higher concentrations and for longer periods in women’s bodies. Another factor is that women have less of an enzyme that breaks down alcohol before it enters the bloodstream. Because of this, they typically have higher blood alcohol levels than a man who drinks the same amount.)

If alcohol has such harmful effects, why do some studies show that drinking is good for your health? Grace explains that alcohol does have some medicinal properties, but they aren’t great enough to outweigh the harms of drinking. She elaborates that there are much better alternatives that can provide the same benefits without the risks. For example, drinking juice that’s rich in antioxidants will likely give you the same benefits as drinking wine.

(Shortform note: Like Grace, many experts question the belief that moderate drinking is healthier than abstaining from alcohol completely. They argue that the studies that support this belief are flawed and misleading. These studies imply that moderate alcohol consumption leads to better health when other factors actually account for these health differences. People who avoid alcohol often do so because of existing health problems, disabilities, or lower income levels, whereas people who drink moderately tend to be wealthier and have healthier habits.)

#### False Belief #3: Alcohol Relaxes You and Improves Your Mood

Grace claims that many people also drink because they believe alcohol helps them relax and feel happier. They think alcohol can make their problems go away or make them forget about them. However, Grace challenges this belief and says that alcohol isn’t a real solution:**Drinking only dulls your feelings and thoughts for a short time—it doesn’t change anything about your situation or emotions.** When the alcohol wears off, you’re left with the same issues that made you unhappy or stressed in the first place, prompting you to drink even more to find relief.

(Shortform note: Alcohol not only fails to solve any problems, but it can also prevent you from growing as a person. In _Untamed_ , Glennon Doyle describes how she had used alcohol to cope with her strong emotions, and she argues that you should embrace even the most painful emotions rather than try to numb them. She explains that your emotions can teach you a lot about yourself, and painful emotions are often the best guides to becoming the most authentic version of yourself.)

Not only does alcohol fail to provide any real solutions to your problems, but it tends to worsen your mood. The more you rely on alcohol to bring you happiness and relief, the harder it becomes for you to naturally feel good. To truly relax and improve your mood, Grace writes that you must tackle the source of your stress or unhappiness. Using alcohol to handle your problems only leads to more problems and more drinking.

(Shortform note: In _The Upside of Stress_ , Kelly McGonigal writes that avoiding stress is harmful because it only causes _new_ stresses. Rather than rely on substances like alcohol to give you temporary relief, McGonigal suggests you adopt a more positive stress mindset to effectively overcome challenges. You can do this by thinking about your resources (such as your strengths, positive memories, loved ones, and so on), connecting with others, focusing on a purpose bigger than yourself, and talking about your stress more openly. Transforming your stress mindset can empower you to tackle the source of your stress rather than avoid it by drinking.)

#### False Belief #4: Alcohol Helps You Function Better

Another reason people drink is because they think it makes them the best versions of themselves, helping them be more interesting, confident, or better at sex. They think alcohol helps them overcome fears or shyness, allowing them to make new friends at a party or talk to a crush. However, Grace writes that **alcohol actually causes you to function worse.** It may help you care less, but it ultimately numbs your senses, lowers your inhibitions, and prevents you from thinking clearly.

(Shortform note: The reason alcohol _impairs_ rather than improves your functioning is that it’s a central nervous system depressant. Depressants are drugs that slow your brain functioning and neural activity. The opposite of depressants are stimulants, which increase energy and alertness. Although alcohol is classified as a depressant, it initially provides stimulating effects, which reduce social inhibitions and may trick you into believing that you’re functioning better. However, it ultimately slows your brain activity and does the opposite, impairing your cognitive functioning.)

Grace writes that shyness and fear are natural and even helpful emotions. They help us decide what’s appropriate to say and do. They also motivate us to prepare well for challenging tasks. By numbing these emotions with alcohol, we not only miss out on their benefits and perform our tasks poorly, but we also risk our safety and well-being as well as others’. Grace writes that alcohol not only reduces sexual desire and performance, but it also increases the likelihood of dangerous behavior, like sexual assault.

(Shortform note: In _Talking to Strangers_ , Malcolm Gladwell explains that drinking alcohol not only prevents you from knowing how to act and express yourself, but it also prevents you from understanding _others_ accurately, which becomes dangerous for sensitive situations like those that involve sexual consent. These effects happen because alcohol affects your brain and puts you in a state of myopia. In this state, your attention narrows so that you only focus on the immediate present and no longer consider future consequences.)

#### False Belief #5: Alcohol Enhances Social Experiences

Another reason people drink is that they believe it makes social experiences better and more enjoyable. Grace points out that alcohol is so strongly associated with celebration in society that we assume the joy we feel is due to the alcohol. What many of us don’t realize is that **the joy comes from spending time with others and doing activities that you enjoy, not from drinking.**

(Shortform note: Some research shows that the belief that alcohol enhances social experiences and makes people happier is largely due to the placebo effect—when you take a drug and experience the desired outcome not because the drug works but because you _believe_ it works. In the study, people who believed they were drinking (despite having received nonalcoholic drinks) reported feeling more inebriated while those who believed they were drinking nonalcoholic drinks (while given actual alcoholic drinks) reported fewer symptoms of inebriation. This suggests that the alcohol itself doesn’t increase enjoyment, but rather the expectation and belief that alcohol will do so.)

Grace challenges you to think back to the happy memories you had before you started drinking. Doing this will help you realize that you don’t need alcohol to enjoy yourself. You can also try not drinking during one social gathering. You’ll likely find that social experiences are even more fun and rewarding when you’re sober, Grace writes.

(Shortform note: A growing movement called sober curiosity calls for people to be mindful and question their relationship with alcohol, even if they don’t struggle with alcohol dependence. Like Grace’s suggestions, this movement encourages people to reflect on widely accepted beliefs about alcohol, form their own opinions, and seek alternative ways to have fun or relieve stress. Establishments have caught on to this movement as well, and if you want to try Grace’s experiment to not drink during one social gathering, you could consider going to a sober bar.)

### Part 3: Become Sober Without Formal Treatment

Now that you’ve learned the truth about alcohol, addiction and the misguided reasons why people drink, let’s discuss Grace’s method for recovering from alcohol dependence. According to Grace, **quitting alcohol by yourself, without any formal treatment, is much more effective than traditional recovery programs.**

Popular programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) make you feel as though you have to _accept_ sobriety, which makes you feel powerless and creates a sense that you’re losing something valuable by not drinking. However, when you choose to quit of your own volition and by changing your unconscious beliefs, you feel more at peace with your decision and are less likely to want to drink again. You _choose_ rather than _accept_ living without alcohol because you know that alcohol has nothing good to offer and that life is better without it.

> **Can You Mature Out of Addiction?**
> 
> Some experts argue that quitting alcohol on your own is not only more effective than traditional recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous, it’s often the _natural_ outcome for alcohol addiction. They call this “maturing out of addiction,” and explain that, as people grow older, their brains become more risk averse, so high-risk behaviors like drinking alcohol become less attractive. This, along with other life changes like getting a new job or having children, enables many people to quit without needing formal treatment.
> 
> In addition to changing your unconscious beliefs to recover spontaneously from alcohol, they also suggest you build up your resources and use strategies that activate your prefrontal cortex. For example, you can try “urge surfing,” which entails waiting out your cravings for 10 minutes. You can also stay busy with other activities to distract yourself and find alternative ways to soothe yourself instead of using alcohol (such as treating yourself to a nice meal or a massage).

#### Commit to Quitting Alcohol

You might wonder whether you can have the occasional drink instead of quitting alcohol completely. However, Grace argues that **it’s better to commit to quitting alcohol completely than to drink moderately.** She provides several reasons:

First, as we’ve discussed, alcohol is an addictive drug that gradually changes your brain. You can’t tell when you’ll become physically dependent on alcohol. Because you can’t control how your brain reacts to alcohol, moderation is hard to achieve.

(Shortform note: Many addiction experts agree with Grace that quitting alcohol completely is the safest approach and that anyone who drinks is at risk of developing an addiction. However, they argue that moderation can be a good first step, or even long-term goal, for people who want to quit alcohol. They say moderation should be an option because alcohol addiction is complex—people’s experiences differ, and they struggle with different alcohol-related problems. This option, however, is most suitable for people with less severe alcohol problems who haven’t been physically addicted to alcohol or other drugs.)

Second, Grace argues that decision-making is a draining and stressful mental activity. When you drink moderately, you must constantly decide when and how much to drink. Moreover, alcohol impairs your judgment and makes it easier to lose control of your drinking. By making a firm commitment to stop drinking, you free yourself from the ongoing dilemma of whether to drink or not.

(Shortform note: In _The Willpower Instinct_ , Kelly McGonigal explains why making decisions drains your mental energy: It requires your brain to go into pause-and-plan mode, which activates your higher-level thinking and interrupts the impulsive instincts of your fight-or-flight response. According to McGonigal, using our pause-and-plan mode and exercising willpower takes a lot of energy. When the glucose that fuels your brain drops, your brain switches off higher-energy functions like your willpower. She says this is why most people have higher self-control in the mornings and lower self-control in the evenings—which is also when people are more likely to drink alcohol.)

#### Find Pleasure in Abstinence

Once you’ve challenged your unconscious beliefs, you should no longer have a desire to drink. All that’s left to do is to make the commitment and quit drinking. Once you decide to quit alcohol, you might wonder how you can stay sober when other people are drinking around you. According to Grace, you don’t need to avoid settings where alcohol is present. All you must do is**remember the harmful truths of alcohol and addiction.** When you remember the true nature of alcohol, you’ll realize that giving it up isn’t a sacrifice but a pleasure, and you won’t even feel tempted to drink.

(Shortform note: To remind yourself that alcohol is harmful, consider creating positive affirmations that refute the unconscious beliefs you had about drinking. In _Manifest_ , Roxie Nafousi defines positive affirmations as statements that promote positive beliefs and explains how to create them: Think of an unhelpful belief and state the opposite. For example, if you think alcohol gives you confidence, your affirmation might be “I have the strength and courage to overcome any challenge and achieve my goals without alcohol.” When you recite your affirmations regularly, they’ll gradually replace your negative beliefs, Nafousi writes.)

To quit drinking without formal treatment and remind yourself that life is better without alcohol, consider some of Grace’s suggestions.

**1\. Accept that you have an emotional or physical dependence on alcohol.** As we’ve discussed, alcohol is a drug that affects your mind and body. Depending on your level of dependence, you may experience withdrawal symptoms that can be difficult to deal with. If you’re struggling with withdrawal, Grace recommends you seek medical help or go to a rehabilitation center.

(Shortform note: Acknowledging that you have a dependence on alcohol can be hard to do. If you’re struggling to find acceptance of your alcohol addiction, consider joining a support group. Also, quitting alcohol abruptly can cause severe withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, so many experts advise you to consult a medical professional before you do. If you’re worried about these risks, you can consider seeking a professional drug detox program, which can help you ease withdrawal symptoms.)

**2\. Accept that alcohol does nothing good for you.** Grace urges you to regularly challenge your unconscious beliefs about alcohol. When you recognize that alcohol has only caused pain and that being sober enhances your life, you’ll eliminate your desire to drink altogether. When you view alcohol as the dangerous and harmful substance it is, you’ll find it much easier to live without it.

(Shortform note: In addition to dismantling unhealthy beliefs about alcohol, it may also help to build up _healthy_ beliefs about yourself. In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach writes that addiction stems from the desire to escape feelings of inadequacy. She encourages you to accept yourself for who you are, including your imperfections. By cultivating self-worth and fully embracing who you are, you’ll realize you don’t need alcohol or any other substance to feel happy, fulfilled, and successful.)

**3\. Start living life without alcohol.** You may feel uncertain about quitting alcohol, but Grace writes that that’s normal. You just have to commit to not drinking, even if only for a period of time. When you do, you’ll discover the benefits of living alcohol-free and recognize that life is better without alcohol.

(Shortform note: To give yourself some extra support as you embark on your alcohol-free journey, some experts recommend you track your sobriety using recovery apps. These apps can provide you with accountability, help you see your progress, and boost your motivation during difficult times.)
