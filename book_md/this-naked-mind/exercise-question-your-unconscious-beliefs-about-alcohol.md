## Exercise: Question Your Unconscious Beliefs About Alcohol

According to Grace, your unconscious beliefs about alcohol can make it hard to commit to sobriety. Reflect on these beliefs and whether there’s any truth behind them.

* * *

Describe your drinking habits. When, where, and why do you typically drink alcohol?

What is one unconscious belief that might influence your drinking habits? For example, if you drink alcohol when you come home from work, you might unconsciously believe that alcohol relieves stress.

Grace argues that your beliefs about alcohol are often shaped by the society you grow up in. What do you think has influenced this belief you have about alcohol—for instance, perhaps your favorite TV show portrays characters drinking to relieve stress after work?

How does drinking actually make you feel? Does alcohol provide you with the benefits you hope to get from it?

Instead of drinking, what can you do to satisfy your needs or desires? For example, you could take a walk or do a meditation practice to relieve stress.
