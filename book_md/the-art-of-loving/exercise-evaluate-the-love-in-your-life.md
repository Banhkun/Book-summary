## Exercise: Evaluate the Love in Your Life

Now that you understand the difference between false love and genuine love, take a moment to evaluate your own loving relationships.

* * *

Think of a significant relationship in your life, either with a romantic partner, a close friend, or a family member. Briefly describe the relationship and how you feel toward this person.

Think back to the four requirements of genuine love (nourishment, responsiveness, acceptance, and understanding). How do you demonstrate these qualities to your loved one? (For example, maybe you nourish your child by cooking for them, or understand your best friend by picking up on their emotions even before they do.)

How does your loved one demonstrate these qualities to _you_?

Based on your answers, do you think false love or genuine love characterizes your relationship? Why?
