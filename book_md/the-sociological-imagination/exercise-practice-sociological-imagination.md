## Exercise: Practice Sociological Imagination

Consider your own society and life experience to practice using sociological imagination.

* * *

Describe a personal problem in your life that you think might connect to a larger social problem. (For example: You might have student loan debt.)

Look up the problem you described on the internet. Does it seem common? What are some common causes people suggest? (For example: At graduation, 54.6% of US students will have some student loan debt. Experts suggest that some of the causes are harsh loan practices, the rapidly rising cost of college in the US, and growing income inequality.)

Briefly read about the history of your problem. Is it recent? How has it changed over time? (For example: US student loan debt has tripled in the past 10 years.)

Based on your previous answers, how does your personal problem relate to larger social problems? How could you address the social problems it connects to? (For example: You might recognize how your personal financial challenges relate to the terms of your student loans. Some people try to address this problem by arguing for student loan forgivenessâ€”others argue for a reevaluation of how necessary college education is or for schools to teach greater financial literacy and debt management skills.)
