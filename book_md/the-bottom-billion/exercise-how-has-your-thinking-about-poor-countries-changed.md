## Exercise: How Has Your Thinking About Poor Countries Changed?

In _The Bottom Billion_ , Paul Collier identifies four traps that lock the least developed nations into poverty (conflict, natural resources, being landlocked, and poor governance). He also enumerates four ways to help poor countries overcome these poverty traps.

* * *

What new insight into Collierâ€™s identification of four poverty traps was most meaningful to you and why?

How have your views changed, or not changed, after reading the guide and why?

In your opinion, which of Collier's proposals (foreign aid, military intervention, laws and charters, trade policy) have the most merit, and which seem the most problematic? What is your reasoning for your choices?
