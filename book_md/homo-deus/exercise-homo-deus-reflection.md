## Exercise: Homo Deus Reflection

After reading through the research and predictions of _Homo Deus_ , work through the following reflection questions.

* * *

Do you believe that human beings are algorithms, or do we possess something (for instance, a soul, consciousness, or self-awareness) beyond data processing? Explain your answer.

What trends and predictions concern you the most and why? (There were many predictions covered in this book, including the erosion of democracy, the automation of the workforce, the development of biological inequality, and the loss of personal privacy.)

If advanced algorithms become intelligent enough to know you better than you know yourself, how do you think society, economics, politics, and daily life will change?
