## Chapter 4: The Creation of Meaning

**To maintain imagined orders and ensure mass cooperation, humans have used storytelling to create meaningful narratives that allow them to dominate other species and control one another.** About 70,000 years ago, Sapiens gained the power of cognition, allowing them to share stories that only existed in their heads. These stories consisted of tales of divine beings and ancestral spirits. While these tales remained relatively local, they provided Sapiens an advantage over other beings such as Neanderthals by giving them a stronger sense of community and purpose.

**Following the Agricultural Revolution, larger tribes required more powerful stories.** The “gods” now dictated everything from legality to behavior. For example, in Sumeria, the people would work for individual gods. One person might work in the temple of Enki, while another worked on the farm of Inanna. Each god had its own set of rules and requirements that guided the actions of their workers.

### Developing Meaning Through Writing

Without a clear, universal text, entities such as the Sumerian gods had limited power over humanity. There were no written laws or practices, so people relied solely on the words of priests for guidance. However, these priests had no way of remembering everything their divine beings required, and thus they couldn’t create a centralized system of belief.

**This changed with the invention of writing.** Writing allowed humans to organize themselves into complex structures. For example, in a modern hospital, a receptionist gives a patient forms to fill out. These forms are then given to a nurse, who then performs preliminary tests. The results of these tests and the original forms are then given to a doctor who determines if further examination or action is necessary. Each person has a specific role to play that requires the recording and sharing of information.

With new organizational abilities came the development of some of the world’s most astounding historical accomplishments. For example, in ancient Egypt, pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhat III oversaw the creation of a man-made reservoir that contained 13 trillion gallons of water (for reference, Lake Mead, the largest man-made reservoir in the United States, contains only 9 trillion gallons). Using stone tools and manual labor, the development of this artificial lake was the result of the strict organization of tens of thousands of laborers over the course of decades, a feat that would not have been possible without the use of written reports, uniform instructions, food and tax records, and managerial literacy.

**As writing became more commonplace, written records were held in higher esteem.** In ancient Egypt, officials determined the strength of their harvest, the morale of the people, and the success of their armies based on written reports. In the modern era, governments have taken this even further, determining the validity of one’s citizenship based on a passport, their marriage based on a certificate, and their posthumous desires based on a will.

**There have been times where the sanctity of the written word has saved lives.** For example, in 1940, Portuguese cônsul Aristides de Sousa Mendes disobeyed orders from his superiors and issued visas to tens of thousands of people looking to flee the Nazi invasion of France. Though the visas were merely stamped pieces of paper, the government didn’t revoke any of the visas Sousa Mendes issued, resulting in the largest rescue operation by a single individual during the Holocaust.

**There have been other times where the sanctity of the written word has had disastrous consequences.** For instance, in 1958, Mao Zedong demanded that the agricultural industry double or triple its output. Fearing for their lives, local officials inflated the numbers they sent to Beijing, resulting in the government believing that their grain production was 50% higher than it actually was. The government increased the export of rice, thinking that they had more than enough to feed their people. Unfortunately, because the reports were inflated, the supply of food ran out quickly, leading to the worst famine in Chinese history and resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of people.

> **The Living Myth**
> 
> In ancient Egypt, the development of currency created a more universal method of paying for goods, collecting taxes, and wielding power. At the same time, writing allowed people to share complex stories. Through the combination of these two, the “living myth” was born.
> 
> A living myth was someone with great wealth and influence whose power increased as people shared exaggerated stories about them. In ancient Egypt, the greatest living myth was the Pharaoh. In the mid-20th century, the greatest living myths were the likes of the Beatles and Elvis Presley. These living myths grew in popularity because of the stories that were created around their talents, wealth, and image.

### Developing Meaning Through Religion

**Rather than changing beliefs to match reality, many powerful leaders used writing to change reality to match their beliefs, allowing them to appear infallible and ignore their mistakes.** This practice is most apparent within religion. Because many use religion as their guide to reality, religious founders could dictate the way they wanted people to behave and interact by claiming that a “divine being” demanded it.

By creating a “holy text,” they created a version of reality that could be shared and followed by large groups of people. When these texts were at the height of their popularity, those who obeyed religious teachings were rewarded, either with promises for the afterlife or earthly power. Skeptics, on the other hand, were labeled heretics and killed for their rejection of the holy teachings.

While it may be easier in the modern era to reflect on historical religious behavior as “extreme,” try looking at it from the perspective of someone in that era. For example, if every successful person you knew was a devout Christian, you might be more willing to believe that Christ is the path to success. If you then followed the laws of Christianity and became successful, that would likely solidify your beliefs in the Christian teachings. If someone were to then be punished for challenging Christianity, you would probably accept their fate as the result of their sins.

**Theistic religions gained more popularity than animist or pagan cultures because they created stronger meaning through divinity.** Theistic texts told their followers that they were the “chosen” ones, and that, by following the laws of a divine being, they would be given great rewards for all eternity. These perspectives developed strong narratives still believed to this day.

For example, many ancient scriptures insist that women are meant to be subservient to men. For a long time, this belief restricted women from holding jobs, appearing in court, or having individual rights. While many have rejected this idea in the 21st century, a large number of churches and mosques still teach this perspective, instructing their followers to obey.

#### Religion in the Modern Era

**Religion doesn’t have to revolve around supernatural or superstitious beliefs.** Rather, religion is defined as an all-encompassing story that creates ethics and laws within a human structure. In this sense, “religion” includes scientific, economic, and socio-political ideologies. These structures create order, generate ethical perspectives, and allow for large-scale cooperation.

For example, an extremist Christian may justify his hatred of Muslims using the words of God as a guide. Similarly, a neo-Nazi may justify his hatred of minorities by using the words of Hitler as a guide. In both situations, the person is led by strong beliefs that adhere to guidance created by a specific narrative.

**In the modern era, human beings still rely on religion to guide their perspective.** While fewer people believe in the grandiose stories of theistic religions, perspectives on nationalism and economic theory now drive people's actions. For example, people once fought and died over the debate between Catholicism versus Protestantism. In the 20th century, people fought and died over the debate between capitalism and communism. One war was fought over theistic religion, while the other was fought over economic religion.

Religious followers always think their perspective is the right one. This leads to tension and conflict between different religious factions, as each system of belief is mutually exclusive. For example, Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the sole way to heaven, just as capitalists believe that free-market economics is the best way to run an economy.

##### Religion Versus Spirituality

While many associate religion and spirituality with one another, they actually promote conflicting perspectives:

  * **Religion is an agreement.** Each person fulfills a specific role, and, in return, religion provides answers to the big questions in life. Religion focuses on the group, not the individual.
  * **Spirituality is a journey.** Each person has their own individual experience and searches for their own answers to the big questions in life. Spirituality focuses on the individual, not the group.



**With this in mind, spirituality is actually the enemy of religion.** Religion requires followers who are willing to adhere to a uniform set of rules, creating large-group cooperation. Spirituality promotes the individual, which destroys the structure necessary for religious unity.

##### Religion Versus Science

**While many view science and religion as enemies of one another, science relies on religion to create ethical boundaries.** While scientists can discover the solutions to physical problems, they can't objectively determine the ethical ramifications of their actions.

For example, in 1992, the Chinese government began the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. The dam was being built to generate billions of dollars worth of electricity. However, the creation of the dam would result in the flooding of over 200 square miles that contained villages and towns as well as archaeological sites and animal habitats. While science could solve the problems of actually creating the dam, it couldn't solve the ethical problems surrounding its construction. For this solution, political leaders had to rely on socio-economic religion (communism) to weigh the creation of electricity against the loss of property and ecological environments.

**Both science and religion are more interested in power and order than truth.** Both seek to change the world around them rather than just accept their fate. For example, when faced with a plague, neither group will simply accept the “truth” of a deadly plague. Instead, both groups will aim to find solutions. Religion will likely rely on prayer and community support, while science will likely turn to testing to find a cure.

##### Religious Narrative

**While science relies on religion to create boundaries, it also keeps religion in check by scrutinizing the narratives religion uses to guide followers.** Throughout history, religious stories have contained three parts:

  1. **Ethical judgments:** statements that dictate what’s right and wrong, such as “murder is wrong.”
  2. **“Factual” statements:** statements that use religious text, history, or scientific perspective to create a fact, such as “God said thou shalt not kill.” Note: These statements aren’t always an _objective_ fact. They often offer a perspective _framed_ as fact. Examples of “factual” statements are: “Life starts at conception” or “Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” While these statements are factual to followers of the religion, they’re not provable by science.
  3. **Guidelines:** statements that combine ethical judgments and factual statements to guide followers in a particular direction, such as “Christians should be pro-life.”



**While science has no bearing on ethical judgments, the scientific community _does_ have bearing on factual statements. **For example, religious organizations often decry homosexuality as an act against God, using holy texts as their guide. However, many scientists have questioned the validity of most holy texts and have pointed to homosexuality in other animals to refute this perspective. By scrutinizing a religion’s “factual” statement, the scientific community is able to disrupt the narrative.

> **Science and Religious Fanaticism**
> 
> In the modern era, people often align the values of science with secularism. **However, historically, some of the greatest eras of scientific advancement took place in regions with extreme religious control.**
> 
> For example, in the 1600s, London and Paris were filled with religious fanatics who persecuted or slaughtered people for holding different religious beliefs. Conversely, cities such as Cairo or Istanbul were multicultural and religiously accepting. Despite the tolerance exhibited by both Cairo and Istanbul, the Scientific Revolution of the 1600s occurred in London and Paris, the heart of religious fanaticism at the time.
