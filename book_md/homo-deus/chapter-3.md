## Chapter 3: The Myths of Human Superiority

**People want to believe that they are fundamentally superior to other animals.** While there are imbalances between different races, ethnicities, and cultures, people typically believe that human life is more sacred than animal life.

For example, an American citizen may have better access to healthcare, education, and civil liberties than an Afghani citizen, but this doesn’t mean that the American life is more valuable than the Afghani life. However, compare a human’s life to the life of a cow, and most people would argue that the human’s life is more valuable than the cow’s life.

**In this chapter, we'll continue to explore the historical justifications for human superiority, examine the modern research that refutes it, and learn the true reason humans dominate the earth**. Throughout history, people have pointed to three differentiating reasons for human dominance: our soul, consciousness, and self-awareness.

### The Human Soul

**Most theistic religions point to a God-given soul as the justification for human superiority, giving people the freedom to abuse and slaughter animals for their own gain**. However, despite searching extensively, modern science has found no evidence that people have a soul. In fact, theories such as Darwin’s theory of evolution directly contest its existence.

While theists believe that the soul is an independent entity that hasn’t changed throughout the course of human history, evolution implies that humans are changing all the time and aren’t capable of eternal characteristics. They’re made up of ever-evolving parts that interconnect with the rest of the body.

For example, the human eye consists of dozens of separate, intricate parts that have developed over thousands of years. Each part can be traced back through time to create an idea of how the eyeball evolved. The development of the eye can also, then, be connected to the evolution of the human body and the way that human senses have changed throughout history.

**If the soul has no parts, isn’t connected to the physical body, and doesn’t change, it didn’t develop as a result of human evolution.** Therefore, the likelihood of its existence is slim to none.**** Some claim that the human soul just “appeared” one day, but that creates a litany of other questions:

  * Who was the first person with a soul? 
  * Were they born with it? 
    * If so, how did a baby suddenly develop a soul when neither of its parents had any evidence of one?
    * If not, who gave the baby a soul?



### The Human Consciousness

**If they assume the soul is non-existent, people will then use consciousness as their justification for human superiority.** Consciousness is the combination of thoughts, emotions, and sensations that create subjective experience. For example, if you watch someone trip and fall, you may feel concern for the person’s safety while another observer may find the situation humorous.

There _is_ evidence that consciousness, unlike the soul, exists. Everyone has active thoughts, feels emotion, and experiences sensations. For example, if you step on a nail, you’ll likely feel pain along with shock, frustration, or anger.

**There are two fundamental characteristics of consciousness: sensation and desire.** Robots and computers carry out complex tasks but feel no sensations or cravings. Therefore, they don’t possess consciousness, which allows people to feel superior. However, unlike computers, animals _do_ feel sensations and cravings similarly to humans. People know this but justify their dominance by claiming that animals experience a “lesser” consciousness.

Dating back to the 17th century, people have claimed that animals experience the world in a purely instinctual way. According to this argument, animals lack subjective experiences and, therefore, possess an inferior consciousness. Though this theory is popular, there is little evidence to support it.

**In reality, scientists know little about consciousness, human or otherwise.** Modern science suggests that consciousness is likely the result of electro-chemical reactions in the brain, but no one knows for sure how this translates into subjective experiences.

Some claim that, if consciousness can’t be explained, then perhaps the concept of consciousness needs to be discarded. However, this perspective ignores the validity of subjective experiences. For example, if someone’s assaulted, they’re going to have an emotional and subjective response to their experience. Negating consciousness as a whole denies their experience.

**The most popular theory of the 21st century states that, while consciousness has moral and social importance, it’s likely just the byproduct of neural processes of the brain.** Essentially, this equates consciousness to mental pollution. While this is a vague and poorly fleshed-out theory, it’s the best scientists have been able to come up with in the 21st century.

#### Human Consciousness Versus Computer Consciousness

**People have no way of knowing how consciousness is created or if artificial intelligence will one day gain the power of consciousness.** After all, if consciousness is truly the byproduct of neural pathways and electric currents in the brain, what’s stopping the same development from occurring with wiring and circuit boards?

In the 20th century, computer scientist Alan Turing developed a test to determine whether a computer was sentient, which he called the “Turing Test.” In the Turing Test, a subject talks with both a computer and a person. According to Turing, if the subject can’t determine which is the person and which is the computer, then the computer should be considered sentient.

> **Life Inside a Simulation**
> 
> If experiences are dictated solely by electric currents, then the theory that humans could one day exist in a lifelike simulation is quite possible. Hypothetically, you could simulate the neural pathways in a person’s brain using advanced technology, creating the illusion of an environment. In fact, with an infinite number of virtual worlds and only one “real” world, there’s even a possibility that humanity is already living in a digital reality.

#### Human Consciousness Versus Animal Consciousness

**Though humans often claim to possess higher brain functionality, human and non-human animal brains function in a similar way.** In fact, many animals such as dogs and cats can pass a modified version of the Turing Test. While this doesn’t prove consciousness, it strongly suggests that animals likely experience consciousness in a similar way to humans.

**Industries such as the agricultural industry reject this claim.** By maintaining that animals don’t possess consciousness, they can continue to disregard the emotional and social needs of their livestock. For example, if a cow isn’t conscious of its surroundings, a farmer can argue that keeping it in a narrow stall isn’t cruel because the animal will have no emotional response to its experience.

**Other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry accept this claim but not for the animal’s benefit.** They use the premise that animals share similar brain patterns to humans to experiment on them before moving to human trials, conducting tests that would be seen as “unethical” if performed on people.

For example, researchers once placed rats in a water-filled beaker one-by-one. They’d watch them struggle to get out until they eventually stopped trying. However, with some of the rats, they took them out of the water before the threshold at which other rats gave up. They then dried them off and fed them before placing them back in the water. These rats struggled slightly longer on their second plunge. Researchers believed that this was because they felt hope, and they wanted to use the chemicals in the rat’s brain to create a potential antidepressant for humans.

### The Human Self-Awareness

**Assuming that animals possess consciousness, people will then refer to self-awareness as their justification for superiority.** Self-awareness is the ability to think about one’s past and future, then communicate those thoughts to others. Many claim that animals lack self-awareness because they always exist in the present, reacting instinctively to the world around them.

For example, a young squirrel will bury nuts even if it's never experienced a winter before. Researchers claim that this is because it's responding to an internal instinct rather than actively planning for the future.

**However, people don’t know how other animals think or communicate.** Just because animals can’t communicate their thoughts about the past or the future doesn’t mean that they don’t have them. In fact, _humans_ often think about their past or future without verbalizing it, yet people assume that they have self-awareness regardless.

Some studies suggest that animals _do_ think about the past and the future to some extent, but they’ve never been able to produce concrete evidence. For example, a chimpanzee named Santino would hide rocks and other objects that he would later throw at zoo visitors. He would strategically plan where and when he hid items and seemed to adjust his strategy based on the actions of the visitors and his caretakers. This implies that he had actively considered his past experiences to plan his future attacks.

**While people shouldn’t needlessly humanize animals, it’s important to note that animals are not that different from us.** They can communicate and form relationships, implying that they likely possess more self-awareness than we give them credit for. Animals can possess great intelligence, but their way of processing information is different.

For example, a horse in Germany named Clever Hans once shocked audiences by correctly answering math questions. While many assumed the horse had grasped the German language, he was actually reading body language. He’d see that he was asked a question, then would tap his foot and observe the tension in the questioner’s body until he tapped the correct amount. He exhibited self-awareness by using his past experiences and ability to communicate via body language to inform his future decisions, just not in the way that people initially thought.

### The Reason for Human Superiority

**Flexible, large-scale cooperation—not the human soul, consciousness, or self-awareness—is likely the cause of human dominance of the planet.** Humanity has a much greater ability to communicate and cooperate than any other species:

  * While ants and bees cooperate in large groups, they follow strict regimens and lack the flexibility to create new and innovative ways of working. 
  * While elephants and chimpanzees can operate with flexibility, they only cooperate in small groups.



#### Revolution and War

**Historically, humans have used their ability to flexibly cooperate to dominate both animals and other people.** Power is usually maintained by the side that can adapt to its surroundings while maintaining strong communication and organization. For example, in pre-Soviet Russia, 3 million noblemen controlled 180 million commonfolk. Despite the commoners having greater numbers, the Russian elite worked hard to ensure that “lower-class” citizens never learned to cooperate with one another.

However, these great powers can be toppled when attacked by an equally well-organized force. These forces are often small but know how to use public unrest and resistance to their advantage. Even if they don’t garner mass support, well-organized groups know how to manipulate the anger and frustration of the public to accomplish their own political goals.

For example, in the late 1980s, Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu tried to show his might by holding a televised speech in front of thousands of his people. However, when one person began to “boo” the dictator, thousands quickly joined in. Seeing an opportunity, Ceausescu’s political opponents took advantage of the public unrest and claimed leadership over the “revolution.” Ceausescu was removed from power, and his political opponents took control. However, the people who booed in the square never saw the fruits of their political demonstration because, just as Ceausescu had done, the new leaders kept power within their party and didn’t share with the “commoners” they claimed to champion.

#### Creating Stable Mass Cooperation

**Mass cooperation requires the use of “imagined orders,” or rules and restrictions that people believe to be real, even if they’re not grounded in an objective reality.** To fully understand “imagined orders,” you must understand the ways in which people perceive reality:

  * **Objective reality:** a reality that can be proven by science and exists regardless of one’s personal beliefs. For example, gravity is an objective reality. Science has proven the existence of gravity, and it will continue to exist regardless of society’s opinions.
  * **Subjective reality:** a reality that can’t always be proven by science but feels real to a person or group. For example, pain is a subjective reality. The way that you experience pain is personal to you and may not reflect the way that _other_ people perceive pain.
  * **Intersubjective reality:** a reality that relies on the communication and communal agreements between large groups of people. For example, money is an intersubjective reality. Human beings have attached worth to otherwise worthless materials. Take away its manufactured worth, and a dollar bill is just a piece of paper.



**“Imagined orders” rely on intersubjective reality.** Governments and religious entities attach meaning to stories, laws, and gods, creating imagined orders in the process. Once they’ve created the orders, they set punishments and rewards for obeying them.

For example, the Catholic Church says that practitioners have to go to confession. Failing to attend could cost even the most devout Catholic their spot in heaven. By threatening eternal damnation for disobedience, the Catholic Church protects its imagined order.

Time usually unravels intersubjectivity from objectivity. In fact, it’s easy to embrace past imagined orders as “intersubjective.” For instance, most people accept that the gods of the Greeks and the Romans were purely mythological, even though they were seen as actual gods by people at the time.

**However, most people don’t want to believe that their current beliefs are intersubjective.** By removing “objective” meaning, intersubjectivity removes power from “imagined orders” and threatens stability on a national or global scale.

For example, if soldiers no longer believe in the imagined order that dying for your country is noble, they may lose meaning and stop fighting. While they may be controlled by the threat of court martial, if this feeling spreads to hundreds or thousands of soldiers, a country’s military could collapse because it relies on this intersubjective belief to exist.

**Without imagined orders, society could collapse into chaos and anarchy.** For example, if the dollar bill suddenly stopped holding any meaning, the entire economy would collapse. No one would know how to move forward because the imagined orders that people had created to exchange goods and services would no longer exist.
