## Chapter 1: The New Goals

To understand how far humanity has come and where it could possibly go, we must first look at the obstacles that have hindered human progress in the past. **For millennia, human beings struggled with three serious problems: famine, plagues, and war.**

These issues contributed to the deaths of millions of people and resulted in the rise and fall of global empires. However, in the modern era, we’ve mostly overcome these three problems through technological and medical advancement, using**** information and technology to address life-threatening issues and improve our way of life.

Note: This stance _isn’t_ implying that famine, plague, and war don’t cause death in the 21st century. Instead, it’s claiming that the effects of the three aren’t nearly as deadly as they’ve been in the past.

### Famine

**Until the 20th century, famine could easily result in 5-10% of a nation’s population starving to death.** Resources were scarce, transportation was too slow to rely on imported food, and governments tended to reserve provisions for the elite. This meant natural disasters, stolen livestock, or razed farmland were a death sentence for many people.

For example, famine struck France between 1692-1694. While King Louis XIV and other elites lived comfortable lives in Versailles, 2.8 million people (15% of the population) died of starvation. The common folk resorted to eating anything from stray cats to boiled grass.

**In the last century, leaps in technology and transportation have made famine a non-issue in most areas of the world.** While malnutrition is still a problem in some regions, a lack of food doesn’t usually result in death. For example, in France, while 6 million people (10% of the population) don’t know where their next meal is coming from, few actually die of starvation.

**In many areas of the world, populations struggle more with overeating than starvation.** In 2010, malnutrition and famine led to the deaths of about 1 million people worldwide. Comparatively, obesity led to the deaths of about 3 million people worldwide. This access to food means that there are no more _natural_ famines, only _political_ ones. Every country on the planet can provide basic resources for its people. If a group starves to death, it’s likely because someone in power wanted them to.

### Plagues

**Before the advent of modern medicine, disease was an unexplainable phenomenon.** People had little to no understanding of bacteria and viruses and, therefore, viewed disease as a punishment from a divine being. They prayed to gods for salvation and, often, didn’t think to take any other action to combat the illness. The lack of knowledge and medical resources led to the deaths of millions of people a year up until the mid-20th century.

For example, in the early 16th century, European explorers brought smallpox and other infectious diseases to the Americas. Because they hadn’t built an immunity to the disease, the Mayan and Aztec civilizations experienced devastating losses in their population. For reference, in 1520, the indigenous population of the Mexican region was 22 million. In contrast, in 1580, the indigenous population was under 2 million. Both the Mayans and the Aztecs attributed the cause of death to the anger of the gods and believed that prayer and sacrifice were the only ways to combat the illness.

**Today, human beings have a much better understanding of infectious diseases.** Doctors and medical professionals have the resources and knowledge to combat illness and protect people from contracting diseases. Even as pathogens continue to mutate, doctors are constantly making new discoveries that keep them ahead of the curve.

When disease begins to spread, people no longer blame the gods. Instead, they put pressure on governments and medical institutions to find solutions.**** Significant medical and technological advancements led to lower child mortality rates and disease eradication.

**When compared to the pandemics of the past, modern pandemics don’t carry the same level of severity as their predecessors.** For example, in 2014, the WHO labeled Ebola “the most severe public health emergency seen in modern times.” However, the epidemic was mostly handled by 2015 and only resulted in 11,000 deaths worldwide.

(Shortform note: While this book was written before COVID-19, the point is still applicable. The coronavirus pandemic would have likely resulted in more severe consequences if the medical community didn’t have the proper knowledge and technology to study the virus and understand its transmission. Read about Harari’s response to COVID-19.)

### War

**Historically, human civilizations adhered to the “Law of the Jungle,”** or the concept that brute force is necessary to superiority or survival. This led to regular conflicts stemming from the need for resources, the desire to colonize, or the belief in religious expansion. This concept was prevalent through WWII, and it forced governments, businesses, and citizens to plan their futures around inevitable war.

However, in the second half of the 20th century, war became less prevalent in most areas of the world for two reasons:

  * **Going to war creates the risk of mutually assured destruction.** Mutually assured destruction would be the result of two countries using nuclear weapons against each other. For example, if the United States were to use nuclear weapons against Russia, Russia would likely respond by using _its_ nuclear weapons against the United States. With each nuclear attack, each country would be one step closer to ensuring its own annihilation.
  * **The modern global economy relies heavily on the exchange of knowledge and information instead of materials and resources.** Before the mid-20th century, countries relied on raw materials to compete in the global economy. This led them to go to war to gain access to raw materials. However, with the development of advanced technology and transportation, most countries are able to access any resource or material they need without going to war. Instead, value is now usually associated with ideas. For example, China wouldn’t benefit from invading Silicon Valley because there aren’t any raw resources there. Instead, they cooperate with tech companies by agreeing to produce their products, thus generating billions of dollars for their own economy. 



**Because of these factors, war has become the exception, not the rule.** Deaths due to violence have decreased drastically in recent years:

  * In ancient agricultural societies, violence accounted for 15% of deaths worldwide. 
  * In the 20th century, violence accounted for 5% of deaths worldwide. 
  * In the early 21st century, violence accounted for only 1% of deaths worldwide. 



> **Modern Resource-Based Economies**
> 
> There are still countries, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, that rely on a resource-focused economy. These countries _do_ frequently go to war with one another for access to raw materials. For example, in 1998, Rwanda invaded Congo to gain access to coltan reserves. By looting the resource, Rwanda managed to bring $240 million into its economy—a significant amount of income for the small country.

> **Terrorism**
> 
> While most developed countries avoid international conflict and violence, terrorist organizations have no restraint when it comes to developing and using dangerous weapons. However, terrorists are usually people who lack access to real power, using guerrilla warfare tactics to garner attention. They grab news headlines through aggressive acts and goad major countries into conflict by provoking an extreme reaction.
> 
> Think of terrorists as akin to flies that want to destroy a china shop. They don’t have the ability to destroy the shop on their own, but if they can goad a bull into the china shop, they can rely on the bull to destroy it. For example, Islamic fundamentalists in the Middle East goaded the United States into conflict to destabilize the Middle East and eliminate Saddam Hussein. This allowed them to seize power for themselves and flourish in the aftermath of the conflict.

### The New Goals

Over millennia, human beings evolved from _Homo erectus_ , primitive humans that closely resembled primates, to _Homo sapiens_ , modern-day human beings _._ We evolved from struggling to figure out the wheel to exploring the stars. While this extreme transformation is impressive, it’s likely not our final form. **The next step of humanity’s evolution will take us from _Homo sapiens_ to _Homo deus_ , or god-like beings. **

With the old obstacles under control and survival no longer a concern in most areas of the world, we now look toward new goals that will usher in the next phase of human evolution: **immortality, happiness, and divinity.**

#### Immortality

Historically, people have accepted death as an eventuality. Religions such as Christianity and Islam alleviate the fear of death by creating grand depictions of the afterlife offered to those who obey religious standards. Because of these depictions of an afterlife, people haven’t historically focused on preventing death.

**However, modern science suggests that mortality could eventually be avoidable.** Rather than accepting it as inevitable, scientists and doctors believe we can circumvent fatal issues such as disease, war, and natural disasters. This belief drives medical research and scientific exploration. For example, we don’t simply accept that cancer will always lead to death. Instead, we invest millions of dollars and countless hours in developing a cure.

As medical advances continue, people have begun to talk about the possibility of eventual immortality with many large corporations investing in the concept. For example, as of 2015, Google was investing 36% of its $2 billion Google Ventures portfolio in “life sciences.”

**Of course, eradicating death is a far-off goal.** While steps are being taken to discover the secret to immortality, most life science organizations currently focus on expanding life expectancy. For reference, in 1900, average life expectancy was 40; by 2000, it was 70. Using that trend as a guide, some believe that, as early as 2050, people will live twice as long as today.

If we’re able to double our life expectancy in the 21st century, people’s lifestyles will change drastically. Assuming a future life expectancy of 150 years, consider the following:

  * **Life-long partnerships would come into question as the commitment period could more than double.** For example, today, a person getting married at the age of 40 would be with their partner for about 40 years assuming they don’t get divorced. If life expectancy were to double, that person would now be expected to be with their significant other for 110 years. 
  * **The retirement age would be pushed back.** For example, today, the average age of retirement is 65. If life expectancy were to double, the retirement age would likely be closer to 100. This would mean that the younger generations would have to wait longer to introduce new ideas and concepts to the workforce.
  * **Politicians would be in power for longer.** For reference, if life expectancy had been doubled already, Stalin likely would’ve still been in power in 2016. If politicians have the ability to hold office for longer periods, the rate of change in politics would drastically slow as newcomers would have a harder time replacing long-term incumbents.



Is this a realistic vision of the near future? Probably not. While general life expectancy doubled in the 20th century, people lived into their 80s or 90s long before then. Longer lifespans simply became more common because humanity began to solve the problems of plague, famine, and war. **With this in mind, modern medicine hasn’t _extended_ life. It’s simply prevented _premature_ death.**

Regardless, the fight against death will continue to be central in the future of humanity. If people find the secret to immortality, they’ll tap into a lucrative market with infinite demand. The power of immortality would spark socio-political wars and could lead to a class divide unlike anything the world has ever known, separating an immortal elite from the rest of society.

#### Happiness

Historically, people have pushed aside their personal happiness to serve a “greater” purpose. Originally, this purpose was attached to religion. People were willing to put aside _earthly_ happiness in exchange for _eternal_ happiness. Suffering or dying for one’s religion was often equated to a better place in the afterlife. While more extreme believers still suffer for their religion in the 21st century, most people have moved on from that model of thinking.

**In recent history, people’s “greater cause” has shifted to nationalism.** People are willing to put aside _personal_ happiness to provide _national_ happiness. While fighting or dying for one’s country is the most direct example of this, nations demand more than just wartime service. They require the economic involvement of their citizens to develop a higher gross domestic product (GDP), or the market value of all services and products created within a nation’s border, because GDP has historically been viewed as the barometer of a nation’s overall success.

However, in the 21st century, we’ve started to value personal happiness over service to a “greater cause.” Because of this, many have started to question the use of GDP as a barometer of success. While it factors in economic strength, it doesn’t factor in the overall happiness of a nation’s populace. **Many economists, philosophers, and politicians have pushed for the use of a new barometer: GDH, or gross domestic happiness.** Their argument is that a prosperous nation is focused on the happiness of its people, not just the strength of its economy.

For example, in 1985, South Korea was considered a very poor country, but their suicide rates were quite low (nine deaths for every 100,000 citizens). However, as South Korea became an economic powerhouse, their suicide rates almost quadrupled (36 deaths for every 100,000 citizens). Using GDP as the standard, South Korea has become more successful in recent years. However, the increase in suicides suggests that people’s overall happiness may have actually decreased.

As society turns its focus towards GDH, researchers have defined two approaches to developing and maintaining happiness—psychology and biochemistry:

**1) Psychology: Human happiness depends on personal expectation.** Different experiences and lifestyles create different levels of expectation and, therefore, different requirements for happiness. For example, if you’ve unwillingly gone for days without food, you would be overjoyed at the sight of a fast-food burger. However, if you’ve been eating at 5-star restaurants for your entire life, that same fast-food burger may disgust you. Different experiences create a different reaction to the same food offering.

**2) Biochemistry: Human happiness is the result of chemical reactions.** While these internal reactions may be caused by external factors, the human brain is only responding to the chemical reactions occurring in the body. This is why drug use is common in most areas of the world. It creates the chemical responses without the external stimuli. For example, if you play professional baseball and hit a walk-off grand slam to win the World Series, your body would release chemicals that create a particular sensation. However, this same sensation may be experienced by an average person trying the drug ecstasy for the first time. While the external factors are vastly different, the internal chemical responses may be almost the same.

Permanent happiness is not a possibility at the moment. People experience temporary pleasant sensations, then use the rest of their time trying to recreate those feelings. **Ironically, the more temporary pleasantness you feel, the more likely you are to struggle with long-term happiness.** As our expectations become inflated, the things that once provided happiness no longer provide the same satisfaction as they once did.

There are two solutions to this problem:

  * **The “Buddhist” solution:** People must train themselves to experience sensations without allowing them to control their lives. Because sensations are temporary, letting them come and go without leaving an impact reduces the craving for the “next” sensation. 
  * **The biochemical solution:** Drugs can be used to replicate chemical reactions without the need for external stimulation. These drugs can remove negative sensations (a soldier taking anti-anxiety medication to handle PTSD) or create positive ones (a student taking ecstasy before going out). 



**Humanity currently relies more on the biochemical solution.** Prescription drug use is higher than it's ever been, and the illegal drug market is booming across the globe. Through the scope of economics, governments determine which of these biochemical manipulations are good and which are dangerous:

  * “Good” drugs allow citizens to contribute to society and the economy. They typically remove negative sensations and allow citizens to focus on gaining pleasant sensations through life, work, and education. These drugs include solutions for depression, anxiety, and ADHD. 
  * “Dangerous” drugs prevent citizens from contributing to society and the economy. They typically create pleasant sensations, removing the incentive to find happiness through life, work, or education. These drugs include cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, alcohol, and marijuana. 



#### Divinity

**Humanity’s quest for immortality leads to its ultimate goal: divinity.** In this context, divinity _isn’t_ a metaphysical existence with unlimited power such as the God of the Bible. Instead, it’s closer to the Greek gods or Hindu devas—flawed but powerful beings who have emotions and limitations.

We’re already accomplishing feats once considered to be “acts of God.” For example, ancient civilizations once considered a healthy harvest to be a “gift from above.” In contrast, modern humans rely on science and technology to create favorable harvest conditions, even when the natural environment is harsh.

In the quest for divinity, humans will likely “upgrade” along the following paths:

  * **Biological: Biological manipulation will likely be the first step toward “god-like” status.** If scientists can discover the biology behind happiness and immortality, they’ll likely be able to manipulate almost anything within the human body through genetic alterations. This means that, for the right price, anyone could become a god-like being with immense strength, intelligence, or sensuality. Today, people are already experiencing the early stages of this development through hormonal manipulation and DNA coding.
  * **Cybernetic: Cybernetic augmentation will likely follow biological manipulation.** Cybernetic augmentation is the combining of organic and inorganic materials in the human body. This would allow people to remove parts of the body that are threatened by decay and replace them with more durable material. It would also allow people to interact with technology around the world with just their thoughts. While this may sound like something out of _Star Trek_ , people have _already_ begun to combine inorganic materials with their bodies. In the medical field, cybernetic limbs and hearts are used to sustain life. In the technological field, “mind-reading” helmets allow people to control devices with**** their thoughts.
  * **Inorganic: Inorganic assimilation may follow cybernetic augmentation.** Taking cybernetic augmentation one step further, inorganic assimilation is the process of moving one’s consciousness into an inorganic body. Neural networks would be replaced with hardware, and people could live in both the physical and virtual worlds at the same time. For example, if a human mind could be transferred to an inorganic body, the newly formed being could hypothetically explore the internet, see out of connected cameras, and move their new form using the electrical impulses generated from the brain. This would allow humanity to abandon its organic form and become practically immortal. Space exploration and recolonization would become a more realistic concept as inorganic material can survive harsher environments than flesh and bone.



**While advancements are typically first created in the name of health, they’re often later used for modification purposes.** For example, plastic surgery was first developed to treat wounded soldiers in WWI. However, after the war, healthy people wanted to use it to modify the features of their body that they viewed as “imperfect.”

In the near future, medical advances will likely continue to lead to modification. Some of the resources used today for unhealthy or wounded individuals may have benefits for the average person. For example, bionic legs currently allow amputees to walk, but they could be used in the future to enhance the speed of a non-amputee.

Further in the future, genetic manipulation is likely going to take the same route. For example, today, doctors use DNA testing and _in vitro_ fertilization to help couples become pregnant with a low-risk child. The next step of this development is DNA replacement, which is already being done through the use of three-parent embryos (a third party provides their DNA to replace defective mitochondrial DNA). In the future, scientists will likely be able to directly modify all pieces of DNA in a lab, creating genetically “perfect” or even “enhanced” babies.

### The Power of History, Knowledge, and Information

**As we strive for the new goals of immortality, happiness, and divinity, we often look to history to shape our decision-making process.** Everything from political views to social norms has been influenced by historical actions. For example, prior to the late Middle Ages, no one kept a private lawn. Private lawns came into existence when French and English nobility wanted to show their status by purchasing land that only had aesthetic value. Because of this historical behavior, lawns are common today in residential, commercial, and public spaces.

**People can use historical knowledge combined with new discoveries to influence their decisions.** This gives them power over their future trajectory if they choose to use it. For example, if a politician receives controversial information about an opponent, they may be tempted to attack them publicly. However, if they also know that, historically, publicly attacking an opponent can lead to losing voters, they may find a more subtle way to release the information. They use both new information and historical knowledge to influence their choices.

**However, while knowledge is powerful, it's of limited use.** Knowledge that doesn’t influence behavior has no purpose, but knowledge that changes behavior becomes irrelevant. To understand this, consider the following:

  * The more information we have, the better we can understand history.
  * The better we understand history, the more knowledge we have to address issues. 
  * The faster we address issues, the more quickly historical knowledge becomes outdated.
  * As historical knowledge becomes outdated, we need to gain more information to better understand history, thus restarting the loop.



For example, Karl Marx used his economic insight to predict that capitalist societies, such as Britain, France, and the U.S., would collapse because of their economic structure. He believed that the working class would revolt against the wealthy and implement a communist structure. However, capitalist countries read Marx’s works and adapted accordingly, bolstering worker’s rights, changing campaign strategies, and integrating unionization into the economic structure. Because these nations adjusted their trajectory, Marx’s predictions didn’t come to fruition, rendering his insight outdated.

#### The Rate of Change

**Because of the ever-increasing rate at which humanity discovers new information, society is changing fast, and it shows no signs of slowing down.** The world is moving ahead at unprecedented speeds and humans have no way of predicting what the world will look like in 50-100 years.

In recent years, technology has already completely changed the way we go about our daily lives. For example, in 1970, people had to rely on landlines, fax machines, and letters to communicate. In 2020, the use of the internet has rendered those three things practically obsolete. In just 50 years, humanity’s primary forms of communication have changed completely.

As the frequency of technological discoveries continues to increase, many people want the rate of change to slow down. They fear rapid change will destabilize the status quo and make their work and aspirations insignificant in an “upgraded” society.

**However, there’s no stopping progress:**

  * First, no one knows how to. While many scientists are experts in specific fields, no one is an expert in every field. Therefore, no one is able to determine the bigger picture. Since no one understands the global system of development as a whole, no one has the power to stop it. 
  * Second, even if someone could stop technological progress, doing so would shut down the entire global economy. The world thrives on technology and information, and freezing developments in those areas would lead to the collapse of the global economic system.
