## Exercise: Should You Use the Slip-Box System?

You now know how and why the slip-box system works—but is it something you actually want to use? Answer the following questions to help you decide.

* * *

Think about the last time you had to write a manuscript in which you shared your original ideas. Describe the process of doing so—from researching to publishing.

What was the biggest challenge you faced during that process? For example, did you have trouble finding evidence for your thesis, or did you face writer’s block?

Is this a challenge that using the slip-box system could have helped you avoid? In what way?

What would be the benefit of avoiding this challenge in the future? For example, a benefit of avoiding writer’s block may be that you feel less stressed about your manuscript.
