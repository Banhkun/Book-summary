## Exercise: Prepare for the Future

We’ve discussed the universal principles about networks that Ferguson infers from world history and how he thinks they’ll shape the future as social media, global e-commerce, and other online networks continue to grow. Now you’ll have a chance to think through what these principles mean for you and how you can use them to your advantage.

Ferguson stresses that non-hierarchical networks (including family ties, professional associations, conspiracies, social media, and so on) tend to undermine the power of formal hierarchies such as governments or business management chains of command. Which hierarchies are you currently part of or subject to? For each one, state whether you would prefer to increase its power, maintain it as it is, or reduce its power, and briefly explain why.

For at least one of the hierarchies you listed above, what other networks or connections of loyalty present the greatest vulnerability to the hierarchy’s power and efficiency? For example, maybe in a certain company, family ties to the founders can short-circuit the formal promotion process for managers in the company hierarchy.

Consider at least one of the vulnerabilities you identified above. What could you do to either mitigate the vulnerability or exploit it, depending on whether you want to increase, maintain, or undermine the hierarchy’s authority?
