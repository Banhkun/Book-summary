## Chapter 11: Clients and the Public

The previous two chapters looked at the advertising industry from the points of view of employees and managers. Now, we’ll look at the industry from the point of view of clients and the public.

### Clients

If you are the leader of a company seeking an ad agency, follow these 10 steps:

  1. **Conduct the search yourself.** Choosing an agency should not be delegated to a committee.
  2. **Look through magazines.** When you see ads you envy, find out what agencies produced them and start a list.
  3. **Watch TV for three nights.** When you see commercials you like, find out what agencies produced them, and add them to your list.
  4. **Narrow down your list by striking off anyone who works for your competitors.** They can’t take you on because it would be a conflict of interest.
  5. **Meet with the heads and creative directors** of the remaining agencies. If you lack chemistry or rapport, strike them from the list.
  6. **_Don’t_ meet with people who will be working on your account.** You won’t be working with them directly, and you won’t be able to judge their competence, so you risk meeting someone you dislike and striking a good agency off the list. For example, a client once passed on Ogilvy’s company because he didn’t like that a copywriter had long hair.
  7. **Ask the remaining agencies to show you their six best print and TV ads.**
  8. **Choose the agency whose campaigns are the most interesting.**
  9. **Offer to pay 1% more than the agency normally charges.** This will get you better service. (_Don’t_ haggle for a lower rate or choose a company because it can buy circulation cheaper. Quality people are worth paying more for.)
  10. **Sign a five-year contract.** This will make the agency like you, and it will prevent you from getting dropped if one of your competitors approaches the agency.



Once you’ve signed with an agency, treat them as follows:

  1. **Don’t interfere with their work.** For example, when Ogilvy was showing a campaign to the chairman of Sears, the comptroller came in and tried to edit the copy. The chairman shut him down.
  2. **Give them an annual performance report.** This will nip problems before they grow too big.
  3. **Don’t set up more than two approval processes.** Otherwise, it will take a long time to get ads approved.
  4. **Be nice to copywriters** —if you don’t like their work, be gentle; if you do, be effusive.



**If your company is too small to be taken on by an agency, you might try recruiting a retired copywriter.** Retired copywriters tend to miss the work and appreciate money.

(Shortform note: In the book, this chapter is presented as an “open letter” advising a company that wants to hire an agency. We’ve summarized it from the point of view of a client.)

### The Public

While clients probably have a favorable view of adpeople, there are many critics of the industry. **Some people think it’s manipulative, insincere, subversive, evil, trivializing, and one professor at the New School of Social Research referred to it as “intellectual and moral pollution.”** Left-wing economists accuse ads of encouraging people to spend money on unnecessary things.

Public opinion on adpeople isn't much better—Gallup found in a survey of 24 professions, **the public ranked adpeople as low as car salespeople and trade-union leaders when it came to honesty.**

Here are some specific complaints about advertising and comments on their legitimacy:

### Complaint #1: Advertising Is Immoral

**According to Ogilvy, advertising is nothing more than a good way to sell; its morality depends on what’s being advertised.** Advertising can have positive effects, such as raising money for good causes like the World Wildlife Fund. Additionally, some agencies even refuse to advertise products that conflict with their principles, such as liquor or cigarettes.

Accusations of manipulation are unfounded. At the time of writing, **only two people had come up with ideas for manipulating audiences, and neither was ever put into practice** :

  1. Market researcher James Vicary came up with the idea of “subliminal” advertising—flashing orders on TV screens so quickly that only the unconscious could pick them up. Vicary never tested it, no one used it, and the British Institute of Practitioners in Advertising banned it even though it didn’t exist.
  2. Ogilvy wondered if hypnotism might be effective in advertising and hired a hypnotist to make a commercial. When Ogilvy watched the commercial, it was so powerful that he burned it.



### Complaint #2: Advertising Is Dishonest

Even if advertisers truly were as unscrupulous as the public seems to believe, **it’s very hard to lie in advertisements. Ads are subject to many codes and go through several levels of approval before they’re allowed to run** , including vetting by lawyers, the National Association of Broadcasters, and other organizations.

If an ad _is_ accused of breaking a code, authorities such as the Better Business Bureau, National Advertising Review Board, and Advertising Standards Authority review the ads. If they turn up a violation, the Federal Trade Commission will prosecute.

#### Advertising to Children

There are even more regulations that advertisers must adhere to when targeting children. Ogilvy mentions several prohibitions at the time of the book’s publication. Ads weren’t allowed to:

  * Tell children to ask their mothers to buy a product.
  * Tell or imply that having the product makes them better than other children, or that other children won’t like them if they don’t have it.
  * Show war, violence, danger, or anything too frightening.
  * Show props or costumes that don’t come with the toy that aren’t common household items.



Ads had to:

  * Disclose if additional products (such as batteries) were needed to make a product work the same way it did in an advertisement.
  * Show a realistic play environment.
  * If the product was breakfast food, there had to be both an audio and video explanation of how it fit into a balanced diet.



#### Political Advertising

Interestingly, **the one type of advertising that has no regulatory overview is political and governmental advertising**(such as for government bonds). This is because political advertising is “protected speech” according to the First Amendment. Networks were forced to run all the political commercials they received, regardless of whether they broke the codes consumer commercials have to adhere to.

**As a result, political advertising _could_ be dishonest. **For example, in the 1964 presidential campaign, Lyndon Johnson made commercials that attacked his opponent Barry Goldwater. The commercials made Goldwater seem trigger-happy and dishonest by purposely taking some of Goldwater’s remarks out of context.

Ogilvy argues that this kind of advertising _is_ evil.

### Complaint #3: Advertising Convinces People to Buy Bad Products

The third myth about advertising is that it convinces people to buy lousy products. Perhaps advertising does _occasionally_ convince someone to buy an inferior product, but it only works once. **As soon as a consumer realizes that a product is bad, they’ll never buy it again.** This isn’t in a company’s best interests—repeat customers are a lot more important to profit than new ones.

### Complaint #4: Advertising Is Uninformative

Ogilvy agrees with this complaint—though factual advertisements do better than ones caught up in slogans and design, at the time of writing, **agencies were tending to create less-informative ads.**

  * For example, when Ogilvy was looking at car ads, he found slogans and general language rather than any concrete information that would help him choose what to buy.



### Complaint #5: Advertising Interrupts

Ogilvy also agrees with this complaint. At the time of writing, the average U.S. household was exposed to 30,000 TV commercials a year. The Sunday edition of the _New York Times_ had up to 350 pages of ads. Some radio stations devoted two-thirds of their airtime to advertising. While**Ogilvy believes too much time and space is being devoted to advertising** , he doesn’t expect it to decrease because it makes media outlets so much money.

### Complaint #6: Billboards Are Dangerous and Ugly

Roadside billboards are a notoriously unpopular method of advertising because they’re distracting and cause vehicle accidents, and they’re ugly and clutter the scenery.

  * For example, in 1958, when vigilantes sawed down billboards in New Mexico, citizens supported them. One citizen said they should have taken out _more_ billboards (they’d cut down seven), and another had been frustrated that the vigilantes had beaten them to the punch—there had been a plan to burn a bunch of billboards later in the month.



**Ogilvy considers billboards a scourge and wants to see them outlawed.** They weren’t even a particularly significant facet of advertising—at the time of writing, billboards were responsible for only 2% of the advertising in the U.S.

However, he predicted billboards wouldn’t go away because:

  * The billboard lobby attacked unsupportive politicians by spreading rumors, donating free space to their opponents, and creating political trouble.
  * The Highway Beautification Act stated that Congress should promote outdoor advertising, and the government used billboards.
  * Removing billboards could be interpreted as denial of free speech.
