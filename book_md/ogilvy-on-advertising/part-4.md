## Part 4: The Greats | Chapter 13: Procter & Gamble

In previous parts, we looked at how to be successful in the advertising industry. Now, we’ll look at some examples of companies and individuals who were successful in the industry and made fortunes.

In this chapter, we’ll look at Procter & Gamble (P&G). At the time of the book’s writing, P&G had huge market shares in many home products, a $700 million advertising budget, an expert marketing team, and $12 billion worth of sales.

P&G was successful because:

  * Most importantly, they made better products than anyone else.
  * They believed that the primary purpose of advertising was to communicate. 
  * They were strategic about what market categories they entered—they didn’t enter anything small and unlikely to grow, and they aimed to dominate everything they did enter. This domination allowed them to access large-volume manufacturing deals, which in turn allowed them to either sell their products at a lower price or have a higher profit margin.
  * They sometimes had more than one product in a particular category.
  * They advertised new brands aggressively.
  * They had large budgets for existing brands.
    * For example, Crest’s budget was $29 million.
  * They used market research and extensively tested their marketing. Once they found something that works, they stuck with it. They continued to test executions of good strategies.
  * They promised only one benefit per ad. If a product had multiple benefits, they ran separate campaigns for each benefit, often simultaneously and in the same medium. (This was contrary to Ogilvy’s suggestion to promise multiple benefits per ad.)
  * Their commercials included a “moment of confirmation” in which an actor reiterated the product’s benefit. 
    * For example, in one commercial, a woman squeezed Charmin toilet paper and talked about how soft it is.
  * They used good commercial crafting: they used demonstrations in 60% of their commercials, familiar language and settings in their commercials (for example, kitchen products are shown in a kitchen, not a lab), they mentioned the brand name early and often, stated and repeated the promise, used supers, avoided celebrities, created characters, and never named the competing brand—they just called it “the other leading” product. They were starting to use music and humor.
  * Their commercials used a lot of words, often 100+ in even 30-second commercials.
  * They didn’t explain why products worked—they found that their consumers were more interested in results than the behind-the-scenes workings.
  * They promised emotional benefits. 
    * For example, they promised that using Dash detergent would make you more appreciated.
  * They spent 45% of their TV budget on daytime, 45% on fringe, and 30% on prime time.
  * They used 45-second commercials as well as 30-second ones because the extra time gave them more opportunities to set the scene and hook the viewer.
  * They advertised throughout the year rather than flighting (alternating periods of six weeks on and off). This reduced costs.
  * They delivered free samples to people’s homes.



While P&G was a powerhouse, they weren’t invincible. Some of their products failed, such as Big Top peanut butter. Additionally, because they were so consistent, they were easy to predict. **The best way to compete with P &G was to have a better product. **For example, the home-perming product Rave, which was marketed by Ogilvy, beat out P&G’s ammonia-containing Lilt because an ammonia-free product was better.
