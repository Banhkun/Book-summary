## Chapter 4: Print Advertising

Print advertising refers to ads that are placed on posters, in magazines, or in newspapers. At the time of the book’s writing, print advertising had some advantages over other mediums:

  * **Cost-effectiveness.** To reach one customer via print advertising, it cost 17 cents. (To reach one customer through a salesperson’s call, it cost $178.)
  * **Less competition.** At the time of writing, TV advertising was becoming more popular and glamorous than print advertising. This meant that there was a shortage of people who really understood print advertising, so even if you only learned the basics, you could outcompete. 
  * **Universality.** Some companies, such as cigarette manufacturers, weren’t allowed to advertise on TV, but anything was permitted in print.



The effectiveness of print advertising is measured by how many people read and remember the ads.

There are five elements to consider when creating print ads:

### Element #1: H**eadline**

**The headline is the most important part of a print ad because 80% of people read only the headline,** not the ad’s copy. Headlines that don’t name the product or what it will do are recalled 20% less often than the average recall. To make your headline effective:

**Tip #1: *Offer a benefit.** Headlines that include a benefit are read by 400% more people than the ones that don’t.

  * (Shortform example: If you sell face cream, use a headline that promises good skin, such as “Make Your Skin Softer.”)



**Tip #2: *Offer information.** Ads with helpful information get 75% more readers than ads that only talk about products.

  * For example, an ad for the cleaning product Rinso gave instructions for how to remove a variety of common stains using Rinso.



**Tip #3: *Contain news about a product.** Ads with news are recalled 22% more often than ads without it. The news can be that there’s a new product, or that an old product has a new use or has been updated. News is especially effective for business advertising because people want to find out about new products. According to a McGraw-Hill study, ads about new products get better responses than articles about new products in journals.

  * For example, baking soda, an old product for baking, was advertised with news about it also working as a fridge deodorizer.



**Tip #4: Include your brand name.** Otherwise, the 80% of people who don’t read the copy won’t know what the ad is for.

**Tip #5: Use buzzwords.** There are certain words, such as “amazing” or “suddenly,” that will always grab the reader’s attention.

**Tip #6: Target your audience.** If your product is niche, name your audience to attract their attention.

  * For example, if you sell asthma inhalers, put the word “asthma” in the headline.



**Tip #7: Mention the name of the city if you’re advertising in a local paper.** People are interested in things that are happening in their region.

**Tip #8: Make the headline only as long as it needs to be.** The research on headline length is conflicting—some sources found the short headlines sold more; others found that headlines with 10 words sold more. Therefore, use whatever length is appropriate for your ad.

  * For example, a Volkswagen ad about quality control used the one-word headline “Lemon” to describe the cars that didn’t pass inspection. “Lemon” made its way into popular usage and is commonly used to describe a bad car.



**Tip #9: Be specific.** Specifics are more persuasive and memorable.

  * For example, when advertising Sears’s low prices, Ogilvy wrote that Sears’s profit was less than 5%, rather than “lower than you’d think.”



**Tip #10: Put the headline in quotes.** This makes people remember the ad 28% more often.

**Tip #11: Use words that generate emotions.**

  * For example, one psychologist found that people reacted to the word “darling,” so Ogilvy used it in an ad.



**Tip #12: Don’t use puns or wordplay.** This can confuse readers.

### Element #2: Imagery

Good imagery is more expensive, but it’s worth the investment because it sells more.

**Tip #1: Choose a good subject for a photo or image.** Ideally, pick something that makes a reader curious or starts a story. If readers have questions about a photo, or the story it starts, they’ll read your ad to find answers. If your product doesn’t suggest a story, make the product itself the central image. Either way, make sure it’s clear what the subject of the photo is.

  * For example, an ad for shirt manufacturer Hathaway had the subject wearing an eyepatch, which created story appeal by making the viewer wonder what the story behind it was: 



![ogilvy-hathaway.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-hathaway.png)

**Tip #2: Focus the image on one person.** People are more interested in close-ups than in crowd scenes.

**Tip #3: Use before-and-after photos.** When Gallup studied 70 campaigns that used these types of photos, all of them increased sales.

**Tip #4: Use photos instead of drawings.** Photos are more credible, easier to remember, and increase readership. There are two exceptions:

  * If you’re advertising in a newspaper with low-quality printing, you might try a line drawing instead.
  * If something is impossible to photograph (like a cross-section of a product), use drawings if the image is crucial.



**Tip #5: Use photos of well-known characters from your TV ads.** This will help people remember your print ads.

**Tip #6: Don’t enlarge human faces.** Readers find this creepy.

**Tip #7: Don’t use historical subjects.** Most readers find them boring.

**Tip #8: Don’t assume everyone shares your interests.** Your own experiences will make you think things are interesting that other people couldn’t care less about.

  * For example, because Ogilvy was a chef, he thought everyone was interested in chefs, so he included them in an ad. It turned out that his target audience, homemakers, wasn’t interested in chefs.



**Tip #9: For consumers, use universally loved images** , such as images of cute babies or animals, or sexy images (but don’t be gratuitous).**_Don’t_ do this in business advertising**—you don’t have to catch people’s attention in business advertising because they intentionally look at ads. While a business product may seem boring to a copywriter, it might be interesting to a company because it’s exactly what they need to solve their problem.

  * For example, chemical company Hercules ineffectively used a photo of women dancing, when it should have focused on the copolymers it advertised:



![ogilvy-hercules.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-hercules.png)

**Tip #10: Be culturally sensitive.** Choose images that are appropriate for the target audience’s sensibilities. For example, few Parisians are offended by images of half-naked women, but a subway ad of a topless woman probably wouldn’t go over well in South Dakota.

**Tip #11: Use images of the people who resemble your target audience.** This will make people of that audience pay more attention because the person in the ad is relatable.

  * For example, if your product is aimed at men, use an image of a man.



**Tip #12: *Print in color.** In consumer publications, printing in color is half again more expensive than black and white, but 100% more memorable. In business publications, color is only a third again more expensive and doubles your readership.

**Tip #13:** If the client doesn’t like your ad, first, try enlarging their logo. Next, use an image of their workplace. **Only as a last resort use a photo of the client.**

**Tip #14: When using images of food, show the final dish, not the ingredients.** More people will read the ad if the photo is of the finished product.

### Element #3: Copy

Copy is the body text of an ad. On average, **only 5% of consumers will read body copy.** When it comes to businesses,**around 10% of trade journal readers read the copy.** These readers will be people who are interested in your product, or who you’ve successfully drawn in with your photo and headline.

To write good copy and maintain your readers’ interest:

**Tip #1: Use the second person singular.** People don’t want to be addressed as if they were in a crowd—when they read, they’re alone.

**Tip #2: Be interesting.** Bored people won’t buy a product. Toilet humor is fine, but don’t make fun of religious figures (some people will find it funny, but others will be shocked).

**Tip #3: Keep the writing simple.** Use short paragraphs, short sentences, and everyday diction. This is especially important for mail-order copy.

  * For example, when Ogilvy was writing a soap ad, he first included the word “obsolete,” but few people in his target audience knew what it meant. He ultimately used “old-fashioned.” 



**Tip #4: Write a story,** not an essay.

  * For example, one Zippo ad told the story of a lighter that had been found in the belly of a fish and still worked.



**Tip #5: *Be specific.** Explain what the product does. Particularly when advertising to businesses, give stats such as percentages or cost savings.

**Tip #6: Don’t use analogies.** They confuse people.

  * For example, if you try to compare your product to a Rembrandt because they’re both masterpieces, people will think you’re selling Rembrandts.



**Tip #7: Don’t use superlatives**. No one believes them.

  * For example, if you claim your product is “the most popular in the country,” no one will be convinced.



**Tip #8: *Use testimonials,** ideally from consumers or experts. Readers remember ads with celebrity testimonials, but they remember the celebrity, not the product, and they’re usually suspicious that the celebrity has been paid to say nice things. Additionally, you can sometimes frame an entire ad around a testimonial.

  * Consumer example: Ogilvy wrote an ad about how Austin cars had saved an anonymous diplomat so much money, he could afford to send his son to private school. (However, an editor eventually found out that the “anonymous diplomat” was Ogilvy, and he had to send his son to a different school.)
  * Business example: Tugboat engineers were impressed by a testimonial from Bud Dacus because he was well-known in the industry and had been working on the Mississippi for 25 years.



**Tip #9: Write about sales and special offers.** Consumers remember these ads better.

**Tip #10: Include prices.** If you don’t, readers will be too shy to go to a store and ask, and they’ll never buy the product.

**Tip #11: Sign the copy with the agency’s name.** While many people oppose this, because a client is paying to advertise themselves, not their agency, Ogilvy has found that agencies make better ads when they’re forced to put their names on them.

**Tip #12: *Use long copy (more than 350 words).** Long copy allows you to include extra facts and suggests that you have important things to say. Long copy is especially valuable for business advertising (because there’s often a lot to talk about) or for expensive products. Make sure your first paragraph contains a hook.

  * For example, Louis Engel wrote an almost 6,500-word ad for Merrill Lynch. It didn’t even include a coupon and it received 10,000 responses.



### Element #4: Coupon

After reading the headline, many readers skip the copy and look for the coupon or special offer. Therefore, **the coupons should contain all the important information including a small image, the promise, and the brand name.**

To encourage people to return coupons (one survey found that twice as many people _intend_ to mail the coupon as actually do), create a sense of time pressure by writing in the coupon that a particular edition of the product is limited, the supply is limited, the price will be going up shortly, or that there’s a special price for responding quickly.

Keep the coupon layout simple—Ogilvy has found that this increases response.

### Element #5: Layout

The layout is the placement of the above four elements on the page. **The goal of layout is to make it as easy as possible for a reader to understand your ad** , _not_ to create something that’s pretty. First, we’ll look at some general information about layout. Then, we’ll look at how it specifically applies to different print media.

#### General Guidelines

To make your ads as legible as possible:

**Tip #1: Don’t set your headlines or ads in all-caps.** All-caps are hard to read because without changes in letter height, it’s hard to recognize words, and people tend to read letter by letter, which is slower.

  * For example, this ad for ABN bank is very hard to read:



![ogilvy-abnbank.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-abnbank.png)

**Tip #2: Don’t overlay your headlines on illustrations.** This makes them hard to read.

**Tip #3: Don’t put periods at the end of your headlines.** This will make people stop reading.

**Tip #4: Make your text block approximately 40 characters wide.** This is how wide newspaper columns are and people find this width easy to read.

**Tip #5: Use fonts that people are familiar with** , such as Jenson, Baskerville, Caslon, or Century.

**Tip #6: Use serif fonts**(fonts that have small strokes attached to the end of larger strokes of letters). They’re easier to read because they help the eye distinguish between letters.

**Tip #7: Keep your margins consistent.** Don’t try to make shapes with the text because it makes the text less legible.

  * For example, these ads are hard to read:



![ogilvy-badtyppography.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-badtyppography.png)

![ogilvy-badtyppography2.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-badtyppography2.png)

**Tip #8: Set your text in black on a white background.** The opposite, white on black, is hard to read. (The only exception is if your ad will be read in a dark place with a single light source, such as a theater, because in this case, white on black is more legible.)

**Tip #9: If your copy is long:**

  * Put a two-line subhead between your headline and the copy. This will encourage the reader to continue on.
  * Use drop-caps (the first letter is larger than the rest of the text). This increases readership by approximately 13%.
  * Keep the first paragraph shorter than 11 words.
  * Include a subheading every two or three inches to create some white space and make the text look more approachable. Subheads should contain enough information that if a reader only reads them and not the copy, the reader will still understand the gist of the story. Additionally, make some of the subheadings questions. These encourage the reader to continue reading.
  * Don’t use justified alignment or try to have every column finish at the bottom of the page. Short lines improve readership.
  * Emphasize important paragraphs by setting them in italic or bold.
  * Use bullets, asterisks, arrows, or marginal marks to make the text look more accessible and therefore increase readership.
  * Number lists of facts rather than trying to awkwardly link them together with connectives.
  * Use 11-point text (font size 11).
  * Include extra line spacing between paragraphs. This increases readership by approximately 12%.



#### Magazine and Newspaper Ads

To increase the effectiveness of magazine and newspaper ads specifically:

**Tip #1: Put the elements of the ad in the natural reading order.** Put the image at the top, the headline below it, and the copy below the headline. If you put these elements in any other order, reading feels unnatural and readership declines (for example, when the headline is above the image, 10% fewer people read the headline.)

**Tip #2: *Include the brand name and what the product will do in the caption.** More people read captions than the copy.

**Tip #3: *Make the ad look like an editorial page.** 600% more people read editorial pages than read ads. To do this:

  * Prioritize text over images.
  * Set the copy in a serif font.
  * Use a three-column layout, with each column being 35-45 characters long.
  * Include captions for all images.
  * Use drop-caps.
  * Use black text on a white background.
  * If a publication insists you include the word “advertisement” on the ad, make it as hard to read as possible by setting it in all-caps, italic, and in reverse type.



Here’s an example of what looks like the front page of a newspaper but in fact is an ad:

![ogilvy-guinness.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-guinness.png)

**Tip #4: *Don’t set the headline too large.** It should be readable at 20 inches away.

**Tip #5: Avoid two-page spread ads.** Spreads cost twice as much as single-page ads and rarely get twice as much response—the Starch Readership Service found that spreads only got a 28% higher rating than single pages. Therefore, it’s almost always a better use of your money to buy twice as many single-page ads instead. Only use spreads if your product is long and you can’t fit a photo of it on a single page, or if your product is low interest—extra space benefits low-interest products more than high-interest ones because it makes low-interest products seem more enticing than they actually are.

  * For example, this hammer is long and wouldn’t fit on a single page, so a two-page ad is appropriate: 



![ogilvy-searshammer.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-searshammer.png)

**Tip #6: Use call-outs if you have a lot of sales points.** Call-outs are short blocks of text that are connected to a specific part of an image by a line or arrow.

  * For example, Aspercreme communicated several sales points in this ad using call-outs:



![ogilvy-aspercreme.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-aspercreme.png)

**Tip #7: Create templates.** Once you come up with a layout that works, keep using it.

  * For example, Ogilvy used one of the following two layouts in all his ads:



![ogilvy-layout1.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-layout1.png)

![ogilvy-layout2.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-layout2.png)

**Tip #8: Don’t use trademarks.** Trademarks were originally invented when everyone was illiterate and the only way people could recognize brands was by looking at symbols. Now that people can read, including symbols is a dead giveaway that the page is an ad, and it creates clutter.

#### Posters and Billboards

At the time of this book’s publication, there had been little research on posters, so Ogilvy only has a few general tips:

**Tip #1:** Create a “visual scandal” by using an image that’s intriguing or surprising.

  * For example, an adhesive company glued a car to their billboard to show how powerful the glue was.



**Tip #2:** Use both the image and words to show what the product does.

**Tip #3:** Set the type as large as possible.

**Tip #4:** Use strong colors.

**Tip #5:** Don’t use more than three design elements.

#### Subway Ads

Ogilvy has one tip for subway ads: **Use long copy.** Only 15% of subway riders in New York bring something to read, so everyone else who didn’t bring material will read your copy. The average person spends 21 minutes on the subway, which gives them lots of time.
