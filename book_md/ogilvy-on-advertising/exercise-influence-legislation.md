## Exercise: Influence Legislation

Corporate ads can change public opinion on issues, which creates pressure on legislators.

* * *

Think of an issue that affects your company (if nothing comes to mind, imagine you’d like the government to provide all companies with a free lunch once a year). How could you simplify this issue?

How could you frame this issue in a way that benefits the public’s self-interest?

How could you present both sides of the issue?
