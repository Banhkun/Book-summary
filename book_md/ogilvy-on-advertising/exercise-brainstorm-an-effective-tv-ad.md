## Exercise: Brainstorm an Effective TV Ad

Some types of commercials are more effective than others.

* * *

Think of a product you’re about to start advertising (if nothing comes to mind, imagine you’re selling a Volkswagen Beetle). What type of commercial (for example, talking heads or a celebrity testimonial) would you use? Why?

How could you emphasize your brand’s name in the commercial? (For example, mention it often or spell it out.)

Would you use music or sound effects? Why or why not?

How could you reduce costs? (For example, consider cutting actors or filming in a studio rather than on location.)
