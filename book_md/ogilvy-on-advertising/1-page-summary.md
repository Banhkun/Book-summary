## 1-Page Summary

After years of working as a salesman, copywriter, and adman, in 1949, David Ogilvy (1911-1999) started his own advertising agency. It became one of the most successful agencies in the world and in 1985, Ogilvy compiled his decades’ worth of experience into _Ogilvy on Advertising_ , in which he covers marketing, crafting good advertisements, and an overview of the industry.

### Marketing and Product Development

**The ultimate goal of advertising is to sell products, but in fact, the best way to increase sales isn’t to advertise effectively—it’s to supply good products.** To create good new products, or improve the products you already have:

  * **Use research.** Research can predict which kinds of products will do well; what smells, colors, flavors, and recipes will be most popular; what features consumers think are most important; what package designs are most attention-grabbing; and what types of products people are no longer interested in.
  * **Improve product quality.** If your research tells you consumers prefer your competitors’ products, you can ask your R&D to improve yours. Especially for food products, improving quality improves sales.
  * **Balance convention and novelty.** Products can fail both because they’re too similar to something that already exists or because they’re too outside-the-box, and no one knows what to do with them. Products that are different versions of something that consumers are already familiar with tend to do well, such as disposable diapers or diet soda.
  * **Give the product a good name.** People’s names (Ford) or descriptive names (Band-Aid) are effective. Make sure names aren’t hard to pronounce, hard to remember, or similar to other names.
  * **Choose an appropriate price and use promotions.** People judge products by their price and think more expensive products are of better quality. 
  * **Put your resources towards your successes.** It’s better to spend your time and money on the products that do well, rather than trying to save flops.
  * **Put a lot of effort into the launch.** According to an advertising expert at the London Business School, consumers alternate buying four or five different brands of a particular product. To get a new product into someone’s repertory, you need to convince her to buy it within a year of its launch.



### The Craft of Advertising

**The primary goal of advertising is to increase profit,** which you can do**** either by attracting new customers or encouraging existing customers to buy your product more often. Effective advertising can be _very_ effective—one copywriter found that a good ad sold almost 20 times as much as a bad one. Even if products sell well on their own, good advertising can increase profit.

  * For example, Listerine sold perfectly well for 40 years. But when it was advertised as a cure for bad breath, sales exploded.



There are some steps to creating good ads regardless of the medium:

**1\. Learn about the product.** It’ll be easier to make associations and come up with potential benefits when you have a solid knowledge base.

**2\. Study your competitor’s ads.** When you come across effective ads, study and copy the techniques used. Particularly study direct-response ads (ads that encourage consumers to contact a company directly to make a purchase) because there’s a clear relationship between advertising and sales—the _only_ factor that affected someone’s decision to buy a product was the ad, so the variables have been tested.

**3\. Engage in research.** Use research to find out what customers think of your company and how much money you need to put into advertising to increase sales. Additionally, use research to find out what product promise will most appeal to consumers who might be your target audience, what promotions or premiums people might be interested in, and what media will get you the most response.

Later, once you’ve released some ads into the world, continue to use research to inform your next campaign. Study whether your existing ads are confusing, how many people read or view them, and at what point people get tired of the message and a new campaign is necessary.

**4\. Choose a brand image.** “Image” is the personality of a product, which stems from its inherent qualities as well as marketing variables such as price, packaging, and advertising style.

  * For example, Jack Daniel’s whiskey projects an image of quality because it’s expensive.



**5\. Come up with big, timeless ideas.** Big ideas will hook consumers and make your competitors jealous. Induce ideas by doing your research and then letting your mind unconsciously connect ideas as you go for a walk, drink, or take a bath.

**6\. Spotlight the product and make it the star.** If there’s nothing different or unique about your product compared to your competitors’ (for example, you sell table salt), make the advertising itself unique, or be extra clear and convincing.

**7\. Avoid working in committees.** Committees tend to overcomplicate things and require compromise, and as a result, the final ad tends to say nothing of importance. Committees also slow down creation.

#### Print Advertising

Print advertising refers to ads that are placed on posters, in magazines, or in newspapers. There are five elements to consider when creating print ads:

**1\. Headline.** The headline is the most important part of a print ad because 80% of people read only the headline, not the ad’s copy. Effective headlines name the product and brand, offer a benefit, offer information, contain news, use buzzwords, target the audience, are specific, appear in quotes, and mention the name of a city if advertising in a local paper.

  * For example, the headline “How to take out stains: Use Rinso and follow these easy directions” was effective because it named the product and brand, and gave information (instructions on how to remove stains).



**2\. Imagery.** Effective images make the reader curious or tell a story. They should be printed in color, focus on only one person, feature well-known characters from the brand’s TV commercials, feature people of the target audience, be culturally sensitive, and when food-related, show the final dish, not the ingredients. Use photos instead of drawings when possible, and use before-and-after photos.

  * For example, the following image for the shirt manufacturer Hathaway was effective because it was a photo, not an illustration, it focused on one person who was a member of the target audience, and the eyepatch suggested a story. Additionally, it was printed in color. 



![ogilvy-hathaway.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-hathaway.png)

**3\. Copy.** Copy is the body text of your ad, and it’s most effective when it’s _more than_ 350 words long. To write good copy, use the second person singular (“you”), keep the writing simple, be interesting and specific, write a story, use consumer or expert testimonials, include the price, write about sales or special offers, and sign the copy with the agency’s name.

  * For example, a Zippo ad about a lighter that had been found in the belly of a fish and still worked was effective because it used the second person, told a story, was interesting and specific, and included a special offer.



**4\. Coupon.** The coupon is the part of the ad that can be cut out and mailed to a company to request more information or to get a special price. Some people skip straight from the headline to the coupon and don’t read anything in between, so coupons should contain a small image, the promise, and the brand name. To encourage people to return coupons, create a sense of time pressure by writing in the coupon that a particular edition of the product is limited, the supply is limited, the price will be going up shortly, or that there’s a special price for responding quickly.

**5\. Layout.** The layout is the placement of the above four elements on the page. The goal of layout is to make the ad as easy as possible to read and understand, not to create something that’s pretty.

To make text more legible and approachable-looking: Make your text block approximately 40 characters wide, set the text in black on a white background, include extra spacing between paragraphs, and use easy-to-read fonts, straight margins, subheads, short paragraphs and lines, drop-caps (the first letter is larger than the rest of the text), italic and bold for emphasis, bullets or numbering, and font size 11. Additionally, make the ad look like an editorial page to increase readership.

  * For example, the following layout is effective because it includes a caption, uses black text on a white background, and uses a three-column layout that looks like an editorial page: 



![ogilvy-layout1.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/ogilvy-layout1.png)

#### TV Advertising

TV advertising refers to commercials. There are six elements to consider when creating TV ads:

**1\. Structure.** The following types of commercials are effective: “slice of life” (two actors argue about a product), expert or consumer testimonials, problem-solving product demonstrations, and “talking heads” (announcer talks about a product). Commercials that include unusual characters or that are funny, sentimental, fact-based, or newsworthy, are also effective.

**2\. Brand and product name.** Mention your brand name early and often. It’s possible (and common) for people to remember commercials but not what they were for.

**3\. Visuals.** Start strong with an imaginative, exciting, or unique scene, show someone using the product, and show the product and its packaging at the end. In food commercials, make the food look appetizing by showing food in motion (for example, pouring syrup over waffles) or using close-ups. Repeat an image in multiple commercials to associate it with your brand. This will help people remember your commercials, brand, and promise.

**4\. Sound.** Use sound effects and avoid voiceovers. Music had no measurable effect, so take it or leave it.

**5\. Supers**(text overlaid across the video). Use these to reiterate your message. Make sure that the titling matches the soundtrack word-for-word.

**6\. Costs.** While Ogilvy hadn’t conducted any research on costs at the time of writing, he argues that the more money that’s spent on commercials, the less powerful they are. Reduce costs by cutting actors and unnecessary complications (like shooting on location).

#### Radio Advertising

At the time of the book’s publication, 6% of U.S. advertising was via radio and there was no way to measure the effectiveness of radio commercials. Ogilvy has the following five tips from a pilot study and his observations:

  1. Make people listen and pay attention by being surprising, funny, or charming.
  2. Talk to the audience as if you were having a conversation in person.
  3. Mention the brand name and what the brand will do early in the commercial.
  4. Repeat the brand name and the promise throughout the commercial.
  5. Make multiple commercials because people typically listen to the radio for long periods and get annoyed when they hear the same thing over and over.



#### Specific Types of Advertising

There are four types of products, services, and companies that have some particular challenges:

**1\. Corporate advertising** is advertising a company separately from its products or services, which can help companies improve their reputation, recruit talent, impress investors, and change legislation. Note that acquiring any of these benefits takes a longer-term commitment to advertising than product advertising does, and that legislative advertising isn’t considered a business expense by the IRS and many networks won’t run it.

**2\. Tourism advertising** encourages travel to foreign countries. When advertising tourism, you’ll have to navigate politics (often the country that’s being advertised wants to present a different image than what tourists are most interested in) and misconceptions or stereotypes about the country.

**3\. Causes.** Ads for causes or charities rarely bring in enough money to even pay for the space or time (though the government and some media outlets sometimes provide free space or time). Advertising for causes is more effective at raising awareness, which makes personal solicitation more likely to succeed.

  * (Shortform example: If a person has already heard of the Red Cross, she’s more likely to donate when a volunteer comes to her door.)



**4\. Commodity products** are industrial products, such as bolts or washers, that have nothing unique about them. The best way to advertise these is to differentiate your company rather than the product from your competitors—offer lower cost or better quality or service.

### Industry Overview

#### Working in Advertising

First: If you’re not passionate about advertising, go do something else. Advertising pays well, but so do plenty of other professions that are easier and don’t require as much passion.

Ogilvy only ever worked in agencies, so this book only discusses agency work. Agencies hire for a variety of positions:

  * **Copywriters** write the prose that appears in ads or the dialogue in TV commercials. They’re the most important (if not the most visible) people in agencies.
  * **Art directors** are responsible for the images and visuals in advertising. 
  * **Account executives** act as a liaison with clients and make sure that everyone else in the agency is doing their jobs. Some of them mainly coordinate, but others are hands-on and come up with ideas.
  * **Researchers** study what makes people read, watch, or remember ads, and what makes ads sell.
  * **People who work in the media department** buy and negotiate for time and space in media outlets.
  * **Creative directors** oversee the production of ads.
  * **CEOs** are responsible for attracting new clients and running the day-to-day operations of an advertising agency.



#### Running an Advertising Agency

To run a successful agency, you need:

**1\. Talented, trained staff.** Try to recruit people who are more skilled than you, smart, good at communicating in writing, and good at leadership. When considering your team as a whole, ensure you hire at least one person who will stir things up and challenge those who are more conventional, and ensure you hire people with a variety of talents so that your agency can produce different types of advertising.

**2\. A solid grip on office politics.** Politics are common in advertising agencies because the atmosphere is so high-pressure. To keep politics from poisoning your agency, fire the worst offenders, force people to talk face-to-face, organize team-building opportunities, and be fair.

**3\. High standards of conduct.** Demand that everyone be punctual, give top performance, meet deadlines, maintain client confidentiality, only buy clients’ products (it looks bad to use competitors’), and never complain about companies (they might remember your or your staff’s names and avoid your agency.)

**4\. A payment system.** You can either charge fees for specific services or an overall commission (the agency is paid by the media outlet the client purchases advertising from).

**5\. Good investments.** Ogilvy recommends you use your profit to open new offices, purchase your office building, or save for hard times. Investing in other companies or buying other agencies rarely pays off.

**6\. Clients.** The best and easiest way to get new clients is to produce good advertising for the clients you already have. Then, you can show your successful work to other potential clients. There are three other ways to attract new clients:

  1. **Presentations.** When a client is interested in your agency, give them a presentation to convince them they want to hire you. During the presentation, mix up the seating so that your team and the client’s team are integrated, don’t read off your notes (practice in advance), and admit your weaknesses before the client notices them (this will make it seem like you’re being honest about your strengths). The day after the presentation, send the clients a letter that summarizes why they should choose your agency.
  2. **Advertise your agency.** The most effective way to advertise an agency is by mailing ads directly to clients. Space advertising can work too, but it needs to be done consistently to have any effect. (For example, Young & Rubicam advertised in _Fortune_ for four decades.)
  3. **Sign up multinational accounts.** If you can get an account that also advertises in foreign countries, you may have the opportunity to get the account worldwide.



**Bad clients can do huge damage to your agency, so don’t take on just anyone, no matter how desperate you are.** Be cautious of, avoid, or drop clients who can’t afford to pay you, have a different company culture, have potential but no current clout, are failing, or are bullies (your staff’s morale is more important than one client).

#### Finding an Agency

If you’re the leader of a company seeking an agency, **start by looking through magazines and watching TV**. When you encounter ads you envy, find out which agencies created them and start a list. Then, narrow down the list by striking off anyone who works for your competitors (they can’t take you on because it would be a conflict of interest).

Meet with the heads and creative directors of the remaining agencies and ask them to show you their six best print and TV ads.

**Choose the agency whose campaigns are the most interesting.** Offer to pay 1% more than the agency normally charges (this will get you better service) and sign a five-year contract (this will make the agency like you and prevent you from getting dropped if one of your competitors approaches the agency).

#### Public Opinion on Advertising

There are many critics of the advertising industry and adpeople. For example, Gallup found that in a survey of 24 professions, **the public ranked adpeople as low as car salespeople and trade-union leaders when it came to honesty.**

Here are some specific complaints about advertising and Ogilvy’s comments on their legitimacy:

**1\. Advertising is immoral and manipulative.** Ogilvy argues that advertising is nothing more than a good way to sell and thinks its morality depends on what’s being advertised. He cited several examples of the positive effects of advertising, such as raising money for good causes. Additionally, at the time of writing, only two people had ever figured out how to manipulate audiences, and neither of them ever used their techniques.

**2\. Advertising is dishonest.** Even if advertisers truly were as unscrupulous as the public seems to believe, it’s very hard to lie in advertisements. Ads are subject to many codes and go through several levels of approval before they’re allowed to run, including vetting by lawyers, the National Association of Broadcasters, and other organizations. Ads aimed at children are even more strictly regulated.

However, **the one type of advertising that has no regulatory overview is political and governmental advertising**. This is because political advertising is “protected speech” according to the First Amendment. Because there are no rules, political advertising _can_ be dishonest.

**3\. Advertising convinces people to buy bad products.** Perhaps advertising does _occasionally_ convince someone to buy an inferior product, but it only works once. As soon as a consumer realizes that a product is bad, they’ll never buy it again.

**4\. Advertising is uninformative.** Ogilvy agrees with this complaint—even though factual advertisements do better than ones caught up in slogan and design, at the time of writing, agencies were creating less informative ads.

**5\. Advertising interrupts.** Ogilvy also agrees with this complaint. At the time of writing, the average U.S. household was exposed to 30,000 TV commercials a year and the Sunday edition of the _New York Times_ had up to 350 pages of ads.

**6\. Billboards are dangerous and ugly.** Ogilvy additionally agrees with this complaint. Billboards are distracting and cause vehicle accidents, and they clutter the scenery.
