## Exercise: Work Cross-Functionally

Think through how you work with others from different teams.

* * *

Have you ever been part of a cross-functional, cross-departmental, or any other team where youâ€™ve had to work collaboratively with people who had different sets of knowledge and/or expertise from yours? Briefly describe the situation.

What special knowledge did you bring to the group? How do you think that your unique perspective contributed to the success of the team?

Did conflicts ever arise within the group because of competing authority or clashing visions between group members with different professional backgrounds and priorities? Briefly describe the situation and how you and others worked together to overcome these challenges.
