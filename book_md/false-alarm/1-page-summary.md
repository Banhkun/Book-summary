## 1-Page Summary

According to progressive media and politicians, climate change constitutes an existential threat, requiring drastic cuts in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to avoid catastrophe. Indeed, the World Health Organization even considers climate change the single largest health threat to humanity. However, Bjorn Lomborg argues that while climate change poses a significant threat, it is not a _cataclysmic one_.

In his 2020 book, _False Alarm_ , Lomborg concedes that climate change will have a notable impact if left unchecked, costing $140 trillion of global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2100. However, he argues that climate activists’ proposed approaches, like sharply reducing fossil fuel consumption, have unintended economic costs that must be balanced with the effects of climate change alone. Instead, Lomborg outlines several more modest recommendations that balance economic and environmental costs.

As the founder of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, a think tank that uses cost-benefit analyses to propose solutions to global problems, Lomborg takes a similarly quantitative approach to climate change. Consequently, he relies heavily on statistical models and academic studies to support his arguments throughout _False Alarm_.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss Lomborg’s assessment of the potential impact of climate change. Next, we’ll proceed to discuss his criticisms of alarmist approaches to climate change, followed by his proposed alternative approaches. We’ll also examine counterarguments by climate activists, clarify points of contention among climate scientists, and discuss the real-world implications of Lomborg’s arguments.

### Methodological Assumptions

To begin, we’ll discuss the methodological assumptions that Lomborg depends on. These assumptions provide an objective measure for evaluating climate policies.

#### Temperature: The Proxy for Climate Change

First, Lomborg asserts that **temperature is the best proxy for climate change**. Admittedly, climate change has numerous effects: It leads to floods, droughts, and rising sea levels. But, these effects are connected to one factor: temperature.

(Shortform note: Although temperature is the main measurement of climate change, scientists use a variety of other measures. For example, they measure average wind speed and direction to evaluate extreme weather events, and they measure precipitation to see further impacts on the climate.)

Lomborg agrees with the scientific consensus that temperatures rise because of CO2 in the atmosphere. Since CO2 lets more heat into the atmosphere while blocking its escape, it increases temperature. Further, because fossil fuels—like coal, oil, and gas—emit CO2 when burned, using them increases global temperatures. Beyond fossil fuels, CO2 can also enter the atmosphere via natural processes, like forest fires or decaying animals.

(Shortform note: Besides CO2, other “greenhouse gases” contribute to rising temperatures. These include methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons. However, CO2 is responsible for over 80% of the US’s greenhouse gas emissions.)

However, global temperature depends on the atmosphere’s _total_ CO2 levels. Consequently, Lomborg observes that **reducing emissions won’t necessarily reduce global temperature** ; rather, it will reduce the _rate_ that temperature increases. And although oceans and forests reduce our annual carbon emissions by about 50% by absorbing CO2, there’s still increasingly more carbon in the atmosphere each year.

(Shortform note: Because the CO2 emitted in the past remains in the atmosphere until it’s absorbed by oceans and forests, global warming wouldn’t cease even if we stopped carbon emissions entirely. Even if that were to happen, scientists estimate that global temperature would still rise by 1.1°F by 2060.)

##### The MAGICC Model

To model the effects of CO2 on global temperature, Lomborg cites the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC), which United Nations’ (UN) climate scientists rely on. This model evaluates different possible emissions outputs, depending on the steps we take to reduce fossil fuels, to predict increases in temperature by 2100.

Using MAGICC, Lomborg observes that **the “middle of the road” scenario—which sees no drastic emissions cuts—results in an increase of 7.4°F by 2100** , compared to preindustrial times. So, 7.4°F is the benchmark Lomborg uses to assess proposed climate policies.

(Shortform note: A 2012 report by the World Bank provides more concrete projections of what would happen if the temperature rises by 4°C (7.2°F) by 2100. For example, they claim that the sea level will rise by about one meter, which would put many low-lying regions underwater and make others uninhabitable. Moreover, the increase in CO2 that the oceans absorb will increase ocean acidification, which will cause many coral reefs to start dissolving. Finally, regions like Amazonia could see a 100% increase in forest fires by 2050 alone.)

#### Gross Domestic Product: The Proxy for Prosperity

Next, Lomborg asserts that **gross domestic product (GDP) is the best proxy for prosperity**. In short, GDP measures the total value of goods and services in a given society.

Although GDP doesn’t measure every aspect of prosperity—like health, education, and life satisfaction—it’s highly correlated with those aspects. For example, higher GDP means there’s more money to invest in healthcare or schools. In general, increased GDP means more flourishing citizens.

> **What GDP Misses: The Value of Human Life**
> 
> While GDP captures many measures of prosperity, it doesn’t reflect the inherent value of human life itself. Further, because climate change could cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year by 2050, evaluating climate policies solely in terms of GDP could lead us to underestimate the weight of these deaths.
> 
> In particular, some have argued that human life is infinitely valuable: There’s no finite value that a human life is worth. Because every human life is equally valuable, they reason that this equality would be an unbelievable coincidence if our value were finite. For example, it’s implausible that every human life is worth some arbitrary sum—say, $4,322,000. Rather, if our lives are equally valuable, it makes sense that they’re infinitely valuable.
> 
> If it’s true that human lives are infinitely valuable, climate policy calculations become messier. For instance, suppose a policy would increase global GDP by $500 billion, but cause 500 deaths to rising temperatures. While Lomborg might recommend the policy on the basis of increased GDP, it’s unclear that _any_ amount of GDP is worth the 500 lives lost.

However, Lomborg observes that GDP and temperature are directly proportional: As GDP rises, countries emit more CO2 as they move from industries like agriculture to manufacturing, and as their citizens gain wealth they spend more on goods and services, which leads to more emissions. Conversely, many policies that reduce carbon emissions result in lower GDP, since countries have to switch from cheaper energy sources, like fossil fuels, to more expensive alternatives, like solar energy.

(Shortform note: Although increased GDP has a statistically significant correlation with increased carbon emissions, other studies observe that, as per capita income increases in wealthy countries, the rate of increased emissions typically decreases. In other words, the relation between average income and carbon emissions isn’t linear: As income increases, emissions increase to a lower extent.)

So, Lomborg concludes that **when we assess climate policies, we must consider the effects of increasing temperature alongside the effects of increasing GDP.**

### Correcting Climate Alarmism

Next, Lomborg argues that _climate alarmism_ —the view that climate change poses an apocalyptic threat—is unfounded. This view is pervasive: A 2019 poll suggests that nearly half of the world believes climate change will end the human race.

To argue against climate alarmism, Lomborg first examines the impact of climate change on extreme weather, then considers the cost climate change will have on global GDP.

#### The Truth About Extreme Weather

Lomborg writes that climate alarmists all echo the same sentiment: Climate change leads to more extreme weather. Opposing this view, he argues that **climate change has had relatively little impact on extreme weather**. In particular, he examines droughts, flooding, wildfires, and hurricanes, arguing that climate change hasn’t exacerbated these phenomena.

(Shortform note: Since 1991, an average of 189 million people each year have been impacted by extreme weather, which experts say has been worsened by climate change. In response, climate activists have even implemented policies to compensate victims of this weather. For instance, UN negotiators established a fund to compensate poor countries that are disproportionately harmed by extreme weather primarily caused by rich countries’ pollution.)

First, Lomborg disputes the claim that climate change has worsened droughts worldwide. He cites the UN’s panel of climate scientists, who found the earth isn’t experiencing more drought worldwide since 1950. Similarly, the United States’ National Climate Assessment found that, in the US, long-term increases in precipitation have actually _decreased_ droughts.

(Shortform note: Since _False Alarm_ ’s publication in 2020, the UN’s analysis of droughts has changed. In fact, the UN’s 2022 report suggests that droughts have increased in severity and frequency by about 30% since 2000. However, they don’t explicitly say whether these droughts are the result of human-induced climate change.)

Second, Lomborg says alarmists claim that climate change has increased flooding. Refuting this claim, he cites the UN’s scientists, who concluded there’s little evidence floods are increasing in severity or frequency. Lomborg concedes that climate change causes increased precipitation, increasing the risk of flooding _in the future_. But, UN scientists recognize flooding is highly linked to river management, so improved river management could mitigate this risk.

(Shortform note: To mitigate flooding, experts recommend a variety of approaches for governments. One obvious approach involves improving floodgates and levees so that rivers don’t flood as frequently. However, other approaches include governmental purchases of high-risk properties so people move toward lower-risk areas, or building elevated structures less susceptible to flooding.)

Third, Lomborg addresses the claim that climate change causes destructive wildfires by pointing out that wildfires have burnt 25% less land globally the last 18 years, as fire management has improved. Nonetheless, he concedes that some areas, like the western United States, have experienced more wildfires from rising temperatures. From a historical perspective, however, this increase is modest—while seven million acres of US land burned in the 2010s, 39 million acres burned in the 1930s. So, though climate change increases wildfires in some areas, its impact is smaller than some suggest.

(Shortform note: One crucial strategy to reduce wildfires is _prescribed burning_. This involves creating small-scale wildfires which burn hazardous materials, like dry kindling and dead trees, that could otherwise allow natural wildfires to spread rapidly.)

Finally, Lomborg denies the claim that climate change causes more frequent and catastrophic hurricanes. He again appeals to the UN’s climate scientists, who recently concluded that hurricanes are not getting more frequent—except in the North Atlantic. However, Lomborg notes that they attributed this increase to air pollution, not anthropogenic climate change.

(Shortform note: Despite the findings of UN climate scientists, a different 2019 study concluded that we can’t explain hurricane activity in the North Atlantic by air pollution alone. Consequently, this opens the possibility that human-induced climate change _has_ affected hurricane activity.)

Admittedly, the financial cost of hurricanes has increased exponentially. But Lomborg argues that this stems from increased development in areas at risk of hurricanes; since 1900, for example, the coastal population of Florida has increased 67-fold. So, climate change itself isn’t responsible for this increased damage.

(Shortform note: In Florida, nearly 40% of those moving into the state are retirees. Experts observe that these retirees often lack smartphones, making it more difficult to communicate evacuation plans to them during hurricanes. So, Florida’s older population may also contribute to increasing damage and death tolls from hurricanes.)

On the whole, Lomborg concludes that **climate change doesn’t heavily impact extreme weather**.

#### The Real Cost of Climate Change

Since Lomborg states that climate change won’t lead to apocalyptic weather, he tries to estimate what its cost will _really_ be. Ultimately, he concludes that on our current trajectory, **climate change will cost about 4% of global GDP by 2100**.

To reach this estimate, Lomborg cites Nobel Laureate William Nordhaus, who developed the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model (DICE) that predicts the economic impact of climate change. DICE predicts the impact of climate change on many areas, like agriculture, energy, and biodiversity. By taking various parameters into account, like CO2 emissions and human adaptation, it calculates the net economic impact of predicted climate change.

(Shortform note: Although DICE enjoys wide acclaim, some have argued that its assumptions are outdated, yielding faulty predictions. In particular, an influential 2020 paper concluded that DICE underestimates the damage of climate change because it uses inaccurate depictions of the carbon cycle. So, even though Lomborg adds 25% to the model’s predictions to account for unexpected damages, his prediction might still be inaccurate.)

Using the middle-of-the-road scenario from MAGICC, which sees the temperature rise 7.4°F by 2100, DICE predicts that our GDP will be 2.9% lower than it would’ve been with no temperature rise. However, to allow for unexpected damages from climate change, Lomborg adds 25% to DICE’s predicted decrease in GDP, yielding a final estimate of a 3.6% drop in GDP. In other words, we can expect climate change to have a significant—but not catastrophic—effect on global prosperity.

(Shortform note: Different models yield different predictions about climate change’s impact on global GDP. For example, in one 2022 study, researchers predicted that climate change would cut 4% of global GDP by 2050, a half-century earlier than Lomborg’s prediction. Because of this variability between predictions, we should approach any individual prediction with caution.)

Going forward, Lomborg uses this 3.6% reduction of GDP as his benchmark for evaluating climate policies. If a climate policy reduces GDP by less than 3.6%, it’s worth considering.

### Misguided Approaches to Climate Change

In light of the predicted costs, let’s discuss Lomborg’s evaluation of misguided approaches to climate change. First, we’ll examine broader, global approaches to climate change, and then we’ll proceed to more specific approaches.

#### Two Paths: Sustainable Development vs Fossil-Fueled Development

On a global scale, we can take various paths to combat climate change. According to activists, we should reduce emissions by investing in green energy and minimizing fossil fuel usage. However, Lomborg argues this approach is flawed; rather, **we should _increase_ reliance on fossil fuels to spark economic growth**.

To defend this claim, Lomborg cites a 2017 study from the UN’s climate panel, which modeled “shared socioeconomic pathways” for the future—global approaches to climate change we could take in the next century. They found the two most promising pathways were the so-called Green Road and Conventional Development; the former involves reducing our environmental footprint by reducing fossil fuel consumption, while the latter sees us create strong global markets and use fossil fuels heavily to support rapid development.

(Shortform note: Although climate scientists widely discuss these shared socioeconomic pathways, some have proposed moving toward more nuanced approaches. For instance, some researchers consider strategies for transitioning to clean energy tailored to individual countries, like China and Mexico. These strategies, they argue, provide more actionable approaches to climate change for specific governments.)

Lomborg concedes that the Green Road has its advantages: It sees GDP per person increase 600% by 2100, to $106,000. But, according to the UN’s climate panel, Conventional Development sees GDP increase 1040%, to $182,000.

(Shortform note: Another influential study points to a similar conclusion, but with slightly different results: Fossil-Fueled Development will increase GDP per capita to $140,000 by 2100, while Sustainable Development increases it to $80,000. With this estimation, the consensus remains the same: Sustainable Development will yield lower GDP per capita than Fossil-Fueled Development by 2100.)

Lomborg recognizes, however, that the Green Road will only raise temperature by 5.8°F in 2100, while Conventional Development will raise temperature by 8.7°F. To adjust for this difference, Lomborg returns to DICE, which estimates that a 5.8°F temperature increase will _reduce_ global GDP by 2.5%, while an 8.7°F increase will reduce global GDP by 5.7%. In other words, the Green Road’s environmental impact will reduce GDP per capita by $3,000, while Conventional Development will reduce it by $11,000.

Taking this reduction into account, the Green Road sees GDP per person increase to $103,000, and Conventional Development sees it increase to $172,000. So, even accounting for the damage from climate change, Conventional Development is the more prosperous path. Lomborg concludes that **climate activists’ preferred approach is not the best path forward**.

> **Extending Shared Socioeconomic Pathways to 2500**
> 
> While Lomborg evaluates competing pathways in terms of projections for 2100, other researchers propose extending projections to 2500. Because some harms might not be evident until 2500, they argue that examining effects of pathways in 2100 could lead to shortsighted decisions.
> 
> For example, one study found that carbon emissions will plateau by 2150 under Sustainable Development, but they’ll keep increasing until 2250 under Fossil-Fueled Development. Consequently, temperatures will rise for longer and at a higher rate under Fossil-Fueled Development than they will under Sustainable Development. Since projections that only go to 2100 don’t represent this information, their pictures of the future costs of climate policies are incomplete.

#### The Green Revolution

Another approach depends on an imminent _green revolution_ , in which renewables like solar and wind will supplant fossil fuels, reducing carbon emissions to zero. Lomborg, however, argues that **the green revolution is an unattainable fantasy**.

First, Lomborg points out that renewables are currently responsible for 11% of energy in the US, with projections estimating we’ll be at 16% by midcentury. These numbers, he argues, don’t suggest a pending revolution.

(Shortform note: Since _False Alarm_ ’s publication in 2020, the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) projections have shifted slightly: In 2022, they projected that renewables will account for 20% of US energy usage by 2050. While 20% still doesn’t sound revolutionary, it’s a notable increase from the projections that Lomborg cites.)

In addition, Lomborg argues that renewables, such as solar panels, can’t provide enough energy to lift poor societies out of poverty. As evidence, he points to the Fijian city of Rukua, which tried to transition solely to solar energy. Ultimately, the solar grid could only power three refrigerators at once, causing widespread failure. Solar panels, he claims, can’t be our main source of energy.

(Shortform note: According to some experts, deeming solar energy insufficient is part of a wider trend of underestimating solar energy. However, while researchers agree that the Rukuan solar grid was unsuccessful, they argue that this wasn’t necessarily because solar energy was insufficient. Rather, they claim that the Japanese company responsible for the solar grid failed to communicate with the village, creating a solar grid that wasn’t attuned to its specific needs. Further, they argue that a tragedy of the commons occurred, where villagers used more than their fair share of electricity, leading to the solar grid’s failure.)

Indeed, even wealthy countries suffer from increased reliance on renewables. For example, Lomborg cites the German _Energiewende_ , an energy policy moving away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. On top of costing $36 billion annually, the Energiewende has led to electric costs of 35¢ per kilowatt, triple the US average. Financial costs like these make it nearly impossible to transition entirely to renewables, even in wealthy societies.

(Shortform note: Though critics point to the Energiewende to criticize transitions to renewables, other experts argue that similar policies can avoid its shortcomings in other countries. The Energiewende phased out nuclear energy and switched to renewables when they were too expensive relative to fossil fuels, but experts suggest that other countries don’t have to repeat these mistakes.)

#### The Paris Agreement

To spark the green revolution, world leaders took a more concrete approach to climate change via the Paris Agreement. Participating countries promised to reduce carbon emissions, with a goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 3.6°F by 2100. Lomborg, however, argues that **the Paris Agreement does more harm than good.**

(Shortform note: In light of concerns over the Paris Agreement, the US withdrew from the agreement in 2020, three years after President Donald Trump first announced his decision to withdraw in 2017. However, this absence was short-lived, as the US rejoined the climate accord shortly after President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021.)

First, Lomborg examines the four entities whose promised carbon reductions amount to 80% of the total reductions outlined in the Paris Agreement: the US, the EU, China, and Mexico. By using Stanford University’s Energy Modeling Forum (EMF), Lomborg estimates the following costs if these countries keep their promises:

  * The US’s promise to cut emissions 26% by 2025 will cost between $154 and $172 billion annually.
  * The EU’s promise to cut emissions 40% by 2030 will cost $322 billion annually.
  * China’s promise to reduce carbon intensity—the percentage of carbon emitted per dollar in the economy—60% by 2030 will cost $200 billion annually.
  * Mexico’s promise to reduce 40% of carbon emissions by 2030 will cost $80 billion annually.



Collectively, this amounts to about $739 billion annually. Because these countries represent 80% of promised carbon reductions, Lomborg assumes that $739 billion is about 80% of the total annual cost of the Paris Agreement. So, its annual cost is around $1 trillion.

(Shortform note: Lomborg also considers another assessment, where the Paris Agreement costs twice as much—$2 trillion annually—because countries implement inefficient climate policies. However, others have argued that it’s illegitimate for Lomborg to simply double projections to strengthen his argument. To avoid this criticism, we’ll focus on his assessment of the model’s actual predictions.)

To see whether the benefits of the Paris Agreement justify the costs, Lomborg cites projections from the UN, which found that—if countries all kept their promises—there would be 64 fewer gigatons, or 64 billion fewer tons, of CO2 in the atmosphere by 2030. Because the UN estimates that temperature will rise 0.8°F for every 1,000 gigatons, Lomborg reasons that **the Paris Agreement could reduce global temperature by 0.05°F.**

If countries extended their commitments to 2100, however, Lomborg concedes that we would remove 540 gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere, causing a 0.4°F reduction in temperature. But, because temperature is expected to rise 7.4°F by 2100, this reduction still means it would actually rise 7°F—nowhere near the stated goal of 3.6°F.

(Shortform note: Climate scientists from the UN generally agree that the Paris Agreement won’t reach its goal of 3.6°F, even if countries meet their promises. However, the UN’s 2022 report disputes Lomborg’s claim that temperatures will rise 7°F by 2100 under the Paris Agreement. Rather, the report found that temperatures are expected to rise between 3.8°F and 5.2°F by 2100. So, Lomborg’s predictions aren’t universally agreed upon.)

Consequently, Lomborg concludes the Paris Agreement is ineffective;**even if every country kept its promises, it would yield minuscule progress** , while costing $1 trillion per year.

#### Individual Sacrifice

In addition to international agreements, climate activists exhort us to make individual sacrifices—like eating less meat, flying less often, and turning off unused lights. Lomborg, however, argues that these exhortations are flawed: **Individual sacrifices do nearly nothing to combat climate change**.

To provide a metric for assessing individual sacrifices, Lomborg uses prices set by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the US’s main carbon marketplace. RGGI limits power plants’ emissions by issuing limited emissions authorizations, costing $6 per ton of CO2.

(Shortform note: RGGI allowances are initially sold via auctions, where power plants bid on allowances, which are then distributed from high to low bids until they run out of allowances. Consequently, the price of RGGI allowances isn’t fixed. Rather, they can be as low as $2.38, or as high as $13 per allowance. Lomborg’s $6 figure is roughly the standard price of an allowance.)

In theory, individuals can cut one ton of carbon emissions by purchasing an RGGI allowance for $6, then not using the authorization—since each authorization that _you_ purchase represents one ton of CO2 emissions that _power plants_ can’t purchase or release into the atmosphere. In turn, Lomborg uses the price of RGGI allowances—$6 per ton of CO2—to evaluate three individual sacrifices: going vegetarian, using electric cars, and not having kids.

First, climate activists suggest that going vegetarian drastically decreases our carbon footprint. However, Lomborg cites studies suggesting that going vegetarian decreases our carbon emissions by only 4.3% per year, on average—about 1,200 pounds of CO2 annually. Since RGGI allows us to purchase one ton of carbon emissions for $6, this means going vegetarian is worth about $3.50 each year.

(Shortform note: Although switching to a vegetarian diet decreases our average carbon footprint, experts caution that some vegetarian foods are still responsible for high carbon emissions. For example, because asparagus is imported to the UK from Peru, Britons are responsible for 5 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of asparagus—greater than the average carbon emissions from chicken or pork.)

Similarly, activists suggest that switching to electric cars will vastly cut emissions. Challenging this claim, Lomborg notes that electric cars often use electricity generated by fossil fuels, and producing them requires more energy than producing gas-powered cars. Weighing the emissions reduction against the energy demands, the International Energy Agency estimates that switching from gas-powered to electric cars cuts eight tons of emissions over the cars’ lifetime. Per RGGI, this is worth about $48.

(Shortform note: Because certain countries rely more on fossil fuels to generate electricity, the carbon emissions of electric vehicles varies by country. For example, one report finds that in countries that use coal to generate electricity, electric vehicles are no more carbon-friendly than hybrid vehicles. However, this means that as countries decarbonize their sources of electricity, the environmental benefits of electric vehicles will increase.)

Further, activists claim that choosing not to fly is crucial to mitigate climate change. Though this point has some merit, Lomborg notes that studies suggest temperature would be only 0.05°F lower by 2100 if we grounded all flights for the next 80 years. In other words, if _nobody_ flew the rest of the century, we’d slow climate change by about one year. And although Lomborg doesn’t assess this sacrifice via RGGI, his point is clear: Choosing not to fly isn’t effective in the fight against climate change.

(Shortform note: In 2018, the Swedish movement _flygskam_ —flight shame—rose to popularity, with activists like Greta Thunberg imploring us to stop flying to mitigate climate change. This movement reflects recent trends, especially in Europe; one 2019 poll found that over 20% of Europeans surveyed had recently cut back on flying.)

Finally, some activists suggest we should stop having children, since they generate enormous amounts of CO2 over their lifetimes. Lomborg admits that one person generates an average of 15 tons of CO2 per year, so children that live to 90 generate 1,350 tons over their lives. Per RGGI, this costs about $8,100. But, Lomborg argues that isn’t enough reason to stop having children, because it doesn’t consider the _benefits_ of children alongside the cost. Since the benefits are immense, he claims they outweigh the $8,100 cost.

(Shortform note: In _Under the Sky We Make_ , climate scientist Kimberly Nicholas agrees that we shouldn’t stop having children to mitigate climate change. However, her reasoning differs from Lomborg. Because children mostly generate carbon emissions in the distant future, and Nicholas thinks we only have until 2030 to avoid climate catastrophe, she concludes that not having children won’t actually help us avoid this catastrophe.)

In light of all these considerations, Lomborg concludes that **emphasis on individual sacrifice is an ineffective approach to climate change**.

### Promising Approaches to Climate Change

Despite the abundance of misguided approaches to climate change, Lomborg argues that there are more promising approaches available. In this section, we’ll discuss his proposals, moving from broader strategies to more specific policy initiatives.

#### Fund Innovation

In the past, Lomborg asserts that we often solved problems via _innovation_ —developing new approaches rather than relying on old ones. The same, he argues, is true of climate change: **We should invest in innovative solutions to climate change**. In particular, he advocates for innovative approaches to energy storage, nuclear energy, carbon capture technology, and geoengineering.

First, Lomborg notes that solar and wind energy are constrained by the weather: Solar panels only generate energy when the sun shines, and wind turbines only generate energy when the wind blows. If we could efficiently store this energy, wind and solar could play a larger part in our energy usage. Presently, however, this storage is prohibitively expensive—adding storage to solar panels more than triples their cost. For this reason, Lomborg concludes that **investing in developing new energy storage solutions could yield high returns**.

> **Pumped-Storage Hydroelectricity: An Old Solution to Energy Storage**
> 
> Presently, the majority of energy storage occurs via _pumped-storage hydroelectricity_ —a process where we pump water into an uphill reservoir, and later release the water downhill, where it goes through turbines to generate electricity. Because we can use solar and wind energy to pump the water uphill, pumped hydroelectricity can “store” solar and wind energy. Indeed, one study found that it can retain 71-85% of the energy initially used to pump the water uphill.
> 
> Lomborg rejects pumped hydroelectricity as a primary source of energy storage, because most energy networks aren’t near two large reservoirs of water at different altitudes. However, others have proposed building artificial reservoirs of water, to make pumped storage more widely available. For example, the Eagle Mountain project in California is attempting to convert abandoned mining pits into water reservoirs, making pumped storage possible despite a lack of natural water reservoirs. So, it’s possible that expanding the old method of pumped-storage hydroelectricity could mitigate current energy storage problems.

Second, Lomborg argues that **investing in nuclear energy is promising** , since it emits no CO2 and poses far fewer health risks than coal, which is a dangerous pollutant. But, because there’s no uniform blueprint and each nuclear power plant is custom built, the cost of building them is high. So, investing in uniform, streamlined designs could yield outsized returns; Lomborg even cites a 2019 study suggesting this investment could cut costs of nuclear energy by two-thirds.

(Shortform note: Beyond providing a source of clean energy, investing in nuclear energy could also spark economic growth by creating new jobs. Indeed, while it’s currently responsible for half a million jobs in the US, expanding the nuclear industry would create even more new positions.)

Third, Lomborg suggests we should invest in technology that captures CO2 in the atmosphere and stores it elsewhere. This technology is similar to what trees do: They absorb CO2, reducing atmospheric carbon emissions. Admittedly, current technology is too expensive—Lomborg points to one 2011 study that found capturing one ton of CO2 would cost $600. For this reason, however, we should invest in researching how to drive down costs.

(Shortform note: CO2 air capture is beginning to play a larger role in climate change mitigation. For example, in 2021 the Swiss company Climeworks constructed a facility, called Orca, which is designed to remove 4,000 tons of CO2 annually via direct air capture. In 2022, they announced plans for an even larger facility, called Mammoth, which is designed to remove 36,000 tons of CO2 annually.)

Finally, Lomborg proposes that**we should invest heavily in _geoengineering_** , the process of artificially reducing the earth’s temperature. In particular, he recommends two forms of geoengineering. First, he recommends “stratospheric aerosol injection,” where we inject chemicals into the atmosphere that reflect sunlight. Second, he recommends “marine cloud brightening,” a process that increases salt particles above the ocean to create clouds with tinier water droplets, making them denser and whiter. Because these clouds are whiter, they reduce temperatures by reflecting more sunlight back into space.

(Shortform note: While Lomborg focuses on geoengineering techniques involving chemicals that reflect sunlight into the atmosphere, other experts consider CO2 air capture—removing CO2 out of the atmosphere—a form of geoengineering. So, although Lomborg views air capture technology as innovation, it could likewise fall under geoengineering.)

Lomborg suggests that we should fund research in both of these areas. His reasons are threefold:

  1. Geoengineering is cost effective: Research for Lomborg’s think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus, suggests that creating a fleet of boats that spray salt water would cost $9 billion, and could nullify the projected temperature increase for this century.
  2. We need to understand the risks: Because rogue billionaires might fund geoengineering on their own, we should research it to discover and avoid unexpected harms.
  3. It could quickly decrease temperatures: Like volcanic eruptions, geoengineering can reduce temperature significantly in the course of weeks.



Admittedly, Lomborg recognizes that we aren’t yet ready to implement geoengineering. But, in light of these three reasons, he concludes that geoengineering deserves further research.

> **Potential Harms of Geoengineering**
> 
> While geoengineering has gained traction among scientists, others advise that there are manifold reasons why we should treat it with caution. For example, scientists expect that some forms of geoengineering, like stratospheric aerosol injection, will further deplete the earth’s ozone level. Moreover, other forms of geoengineering could disturb oceanic ecosystems by increasing the ocean’s acidity.
> 
> Because we can’t easily remove aerosol injections from the atmosphere, these consequences would be difficult to reverse if geoengineering occurs—potentially exposing us to unexpected consequences that are irreversible. However, this supports Lomborg’s proposal for _researching_ geoengineering; we can only determine the effects of geoengineering through in-depth research.

#### Invest in Adaptation

Because CO2 in the atmosphere is also a product of past emissions, which we can’t control, innovation won’t stop climate change entirely. Consequently, Lomborg argues that **we need to adapt to climate change over the coming century**. And though Lomborg discusses various adaptations, we’ll focus on three key ones: adapting to rising sea levels, river flooding, and heat waves.

To start, Lomborg grants that rising temperatures will lead to rising sea levels, placing coastal territories at risk. However, we can meet these rising sea levels with adaptation. For instance, we can build dikes—coastal walls to stop flooding—or pursue artificial nourishment—adding sand to coasts to combat rising sea levels. According to Lomborg, one 2019 cost-benefit analysis found that dikes save $40 per dollar spent, while artificial nourishment saves $111.

(Shortform note: Instead of artificial defenses, like constructing dikes, other experts propose so-called “living shorelines'' as an alternative approach to rising sea levels. In short, living shorelines are combinations of natural organisms and materials tailored to specific coasts. For instance, shores with tame waters can benefit from salty marshes, which combat rising sea levels by absorbing large amounts of water.)

In a similar vein, climate change could increase the risk of river flooding in some areas. To handle flooding, Lomborg recommends various strategies. For example, we could follow suit with Holland, creating floodplains that we let flood to avoid damage to cities. Or, we could invest in more vegetated areas in cities that better absorb water. These investments, Lomborg argues, have promising returns: FEMA found that each dollar spent on flood mitigation would save $6 in damages.

(Shortform note: In addition to creating floodplains, the Netherlands also began widening rivers prone to flooding in 2012 to provide more room for excess water. By constructing dikes nearly 400 meters further inland, they created a new channel for the Waal river to mitigate the risk of flooding. The project’s cost-benefit analysis predicts savings to surpass $295 million.)

Finally, Lomborg notes that heat waves will likely worsen in cities, which contain heat-absorbing asphalt and lack cooling features, like water areas. Because black roofs and asphalt increase temperature, he recommends a simple adaptation—painting roofs and roads with light-colored coatings. According to one model, this could decrease summer temperatures by several degrees in certain cities.

(Shortform note: Because cool roofs reduce temperatures _inside_ buildings __ as well, they reduce energy usage by decreasing the need for air conditioning. Consequently, they aren’t just an adaptation to climate change, but also a direct way to mitigate it.)

Although they don’t reduce carbon emissions, Lomborg argues that **these adaptations would affordably mitigate the effects of rising temperatures**. So, investing in adaptation is an appropriate response to climate change.

#### Cultivate Economic Growth

Investments in innovation and adaptation lessen the impact of climate change, but many countries lack the funds to make this investment. Consequently, Lomborg argues that **creating economic growth in poor countries is itself a promising climate policy**.

> **Concrete Strategies to Stimulate Economic Growth**
> 
> Lomborg doesn’t offer many actionable strategies for cultivating economic growth in impoverished countries. Especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, which damaged economies in many developing countries, such actionables are crucial. To that end, experts recommend a variety of approaches to foster growth, such as:
> 
>   * Invest in training civil servants, like government clerks and regulators. This improves the public sector by creating more competent public employees.
> 
>   * Decrease regulatory and tax barriers that companies have to navigate. This allows businesses to increase efficiency and production more easily.
> 
>   * Open up markets to international trade. This encourages more sales and purchases, leading to increased economic growth.
> 
>   * Fund schools that teach basic skills, like literacy and mental math. This increases average cognitive ability, which is correlated strongly with income as an adult.
> 
> 


As a case study, Lomborg considers two countries: the Netherlands and Bangladesh. These countries are similarly susceptible to flooding—67% of the Netherlands is vulnerable to floods, compared with 60% of Bangladesh. Yet, because Bangladesh is impoverished, flooding is far more destructive there than in the wealthy Netherlands.

To show as much, Lomborg observes that after a flood killed 1,800 citizens in 1953, the Netherlands invested $11 billion in Delta Works—a series of dams and barriers to combat flooding. Since then, they’ve only seen three floods and one fatality from flooding.

Conversely, floods still decimate Bangladesh: Lomborg notes that in 2019, floods displaced 200,000 Bangladeshi. Since Bangladesh lacks funding to combat flooding, it suffers more than the Netherlands, despite being similarly susceptible to flooding. If its economy were more prosperous, Lomborg claims Bangladesh would better adapt to this flooding.

(Shortform note: In 2022, the Bangladeshi government is expected to approve a National Adaptation Plan, implementing policy initiatives that are designed to increase resilience to flooding. For example, the plan involves improving early warning systems for flash floods, while also encouraging joint river basin management with neighboring countries. Between 2023-2050, the plan is expected to cost $230 billion, though donations from global climate funds cover much of that investment.)

According to Lomborg, the points above lead to a general conclusion: **Wealthy countries can better cope with climate change, while poor countries are disproportionately harmed**. Therefore, sparking economic growth in poor countries—even at the cost of increasing carbon emissions—is a promising approach to climate change.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that climate change disproportionately affects poor countries. Consequently, some have gone beyond Lomborg’s recommendation of sparking economic growth and argued that wealthy countries should provide direct financial support for sustainable development in such countries. This financial assistance, they argue, will yield high returns on investment from the climate change it prevents down the road.)

#### Implement a Global Carbon Tax

Beyond general strategies, Lomborg also endorses specific policies about climate change. In particular, he argues that **we should implement a global carbon tax** —a tax that offsets the carbon emissions of the goods we buy. For example, we would pay a tax on Amazon packages proportionate to the carbon emitted in production and delivery.

(Shortform note: Although we haven’t yet implemented a global carbon tax, the European Union (EU) successfully implemented a carbon tax on its constituents. This tax even applies to imported goods; manufacturers that import products to EU countries must pay a fee equal to the carbon tax that domestic producers pay. So, there’s already precedent for a successful international carbon tax.)

According to Lomborg, a carbon tax is necessary to correct market failure. Put simply, market failure occurs whenever we _inefficiently_ distribute goods or services—in other words, whenever the market doesn’t reflect inconspicuous costs of certain products. For instance, market failure occurs if the cost to buy a pack of cigarettes doesn’t reflect the pollution they create.

Similarly, Lomborg asserts that market failure is occurring because prices don’t reflect the carbon emissions created by many products. For example, when we purchase beef, prices reflect the cost of rearing the cow, packaging the beef, and shipping it to a deli. But they don’t reflect the carbon emissions created via this process. A carbon tax would correct this failure.

(Shortform note: Although a carbon tax can correct market failure, cap-and-trade programs provide an alternative approach, in which governments sell a limited number of carbon emissions to the highest bidders. Because consumers can simply pay the carbon tax indefinitely, whereas cap-and-trade systems allow for a finite number of allowances, proponents of cap-and-trade systems note that they provide more certainty about the amount of carbon emissions. However, because cap-and-trade programs use auctions to distribute allowances, they provide less certainty about the _cost_ of those emissions.)

To determine the ideal carbon tax, Lomborg returns to DICE, which predicted that climate change will cost 3.6% of GDP—$140 trillion—by 2100. He concludes the optimal carbon tax would reduce temperature from 7.4°F to 6.75°F. Although this tax would cost about $20 trillion to implement, it reduces the cost of climate change from $140 trillion to just over $100 trillion. In other words, **it would save us $22 trillion overall**.

(Shortform note: In 2020, other researchers argued that DICE, which grounds Lomborg’s predictions, inaccurately accounted for climate damages. After adjusting for these alleged inaccuracies, they found that the Paris Agreement’s original goal—3.6°F—aligned with the economically optimal approach to climate change. So, the ideal carbon tax could be higher than Lomborg suggests.)
