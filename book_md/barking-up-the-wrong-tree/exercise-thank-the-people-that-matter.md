## Exercise: Thank the People That Matter

Now that you’ve learned how essential the people you know are to your life, plan how to thank someone who matters.

* * *

Consider your current life circumstances, and write down three things you’re happy about.

Review the answer above and name one person you could thank for each of those blessings in your life. For example, if you’re grateful for your spouse, you might name the person who introduced you.

Review the above list. Who do you want to thank the most and why? For example, you may want to thank the friend who introduced you to your spouse because you’ve had an especially hard time recently, and your spouse has been so helpful to you.

Plan one action you can take to thank this person within the next week. For example, if they live close by, you might schedule a coffee date. Alternatively, if they’re far away, you might look into flights or simply schedule a call.
