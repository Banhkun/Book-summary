## Exercise: Does Your Workplace Nurture Loonshots?

Bahcall argues that the balance between loonshots and franchises depends on his four rules. Let’s explore those rules in the context of your own workplace. Remember, some organizations combine both phases, and some industries have both loonshot businesses and franchise businesses that work together. If that’s the case for you, keep that in mind as you answer each question.

Overall, would you say that your workplace is in the loonshot phase or in the franchise phase? Or does it combine both phases in some way? Explain how you reached your answer.

Does your workplace value innovators and implementers equally? Does it give both groups what they need to do their jobs? How could your organization improve the balance between the two groups?

What is communication like between the innovators and implementers in your workplace? Do the two sides have a good relationship? Do they communicate clearly and productively? How could they improve their communications?

How much emphasis does your workplace place on process and how much emphasis does it place on outcomes? How does your workplace view failure? What could your organization do to handle failure more productively?

How important is stake in your workplace? How important is rank? Has the relative importance of these two factors changed during your time at this organization?
