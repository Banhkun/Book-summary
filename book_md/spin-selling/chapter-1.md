## Chapter 1: The Evolution of Sales

For over 60 years, sales organizations preached and practiced the conventional wisdom that traditional selling methods worked in all sales. Standard techniques and skills included:

  * **Opening the call** : Establish a personal connection with the buyer, or introduce product benefits.
  * **Investigating the customer’s needs** : Use open-ended and closed (yes or no) questions to uncover needs.
  * **Presenting benefits** : Once you’ve determined the customer’s needs, describe the benefits of buying your product by showing how its features can help.
  * **Handling objections** : Use a range of techniques to overcome customer objections or resistance; for instance, rephrase the objection as a question you can answer.
  * **Closing the sale** : Make a strong closing—use pressure if the customer hesitates—that seals the deal.



Sales training placed particular emphasis on asking appropriate open-ended and closed questions during the investigation stage and on making a forceful closing. But Rackham’s field experience and research showed that some of these traditional techniques were a bad fit for large sales because those sales had different characteristics.

### The Major Sale

Major sales require a more sophisticated interaction between sales rep and customer than is needed in small sales because they’re different from small sales in key ways:

#### Length of the Selling Cycle

**Small sales** : Sales often can be handled with one call in which the customer buys on the spot. The salesperson may push hard to refute objections and close successfully. This works if it’s a one-time interaction where establishing a good relationship isn’t critical. But if the customer delays a decision, resentment created by the pressure tactics can be difficult for the sales rep to overcome in a subsequent interaction. Further, the power of a strong sales pitch wanes in a few days.

**Major sales** : In contrast, a major sale often requires making many sales calls to a customer over months. Since the customer doesn’t make a decision on the first call, pressure tactics that create resentment won’t work and might kill the sale by making it impossible for the sales rep to establish an ongoing relationship. In major or multi-call sales, customer deliberations occur between calls in the rep’s absence.

#### Size of the Customer’s Commitment

**Small sales:** In a small sale, since the customer isn’t spending a lot of money, the rep doesn’t need to strongly emphasize the value of the product to the customer to get him to buy.

**Major sales** : Making a large buy is a bigger decision for the customer. The sales rep must heighten the perceived value in the product or service. In fact, increasing the perceived value is a critical selling skill in larger sales.

#### The Ongoing Relationship

**Small sales:** In a small sale, the sales rep and customer typically interact only once; they don’t develop a longer-term relationship.

**Large sales:** These sales require a long-term relationship with the customer for several reasons. There will be multiple calls to close the sale, and the rep will want to generate future sales with the same customer. In addition, there are usually follow-up needs, such as installation and support. As sales get bigger, the customer’s feelings toward the salesperson become a bigger factor—the person and product become inseparable to the customer. Because the psychology of a large sale is different, the rep must employ a different selling style.

#### The Risk of Mistakes

**Small sales** : When the purchase is small, the customer doesn’t worry much about losing money if it doesn’t work out. The loss isn’t big and others in the company aren’t likely to find out the deal was bad. Similarly, most people are willing to take a chance on buying a small gadget because the loss and embarrassment aren’t great if it turns out to be useless, unlike buying a car that turns out to be a lemon.

**Large sales** : In contrast, customers are extremely cautious about making large buys; caution increases as price increases, as does the fear of making a public mistake (large purchases involve more people and approvals).

### Four Stages of a Sales Call

Despite the different customer psychology and sales skills required, all sales calls have basic similarities regardless of the dollar value. Here are the four typical stages and how they apply to major sales:

**1) Warming up/Opening:** The opening is how you introduce yourself, establish connection, and start the conversation. Sales training often teaches that the customer’s impression in the first few minutes of the call is critical to the sale. The opening may have a bearing in a brief one-call interaction, but in large, protracted sales, your opening is less important than what you do in the next stage: the investigating stage.

**2) Investigating:** In this stage, you ask questions to get information. You’re trying to discover needs or to better understand the customer. Ability to ask investigating or probing questions is arguably the most important sales skill, particularly in major sales. Improving investigating skills can increase large-account sales by as much as 20%.

**3) Demonstrating capability/value** : Once you understand the customer’s needs, the next step is to show how your product or service can help. In larger sales, where you’re often selling a broader solution, you need to show how your solution solves the customer’s specific problems in a way that makes it worth the cost.

**4) Getting commitment:** To be a success, a sales call must end with a customer commitment.

In small sales, the customer usually commits to buying the product, while in large sales, she may agree to another meeting, or to provide access to a decision-maker. Such intermediate steps are called advances because they advance the sale by moving the customer toward a decision.

#### The Investigating Stage

Sales calls typically include all of these stages, but the emphasis may vary—for instance, the warm-up stage may be extended or very brief, depending on the customer’s preferred business style.

Traditional sales training and many sales managers emphasize the commitment stage—closing the sale—as most important. But in a major sale, investigating is the most important stage. It can account for the majority of the time spent on a call. In large sales, reps ask more questions than are asked in small sales.

### Questions Drive Success

Questions are crucial to success in many types of interactions besides sales—for instance, negotiations, management interactions, performance interviews, and group discussions. The more questions you ask, the more likely you are to meet your objectives.

There are different types of questions, some of which are more effective than others. Sales training has emphasized two types—open and closed questions—dating back to at least the 1920s.

Closed questions are directive and usually elicit a “yes” or “no” answer—for example, “Have you purchased new equipment in the last five years?” Closed questions are less engaging, which can make them useful in dealing with long-winded customers, or when you have little time.

Open questions are non-directive and encourage an in-depth answer—for example, “Can you tell me more about your business?” or “What’s your biggest concern?” They’re effective at eliciting information because they get the customer talking. Sometimes, you learn something you didn’t expect.

However, the research on which this book is based found no correlation between using either open or closed questions and sales success. Researchers found no benefit for one type over the other in major sales calls, although sales training has long emphasized the importance of asking mostly open questions instead of closed questions.

### A Better Approach

Researchers found that successful reps handled the investigating stage differently. Rather than focusing on asking open and closed questions in large sales, they asked four different types of questions in a sequence. These successful reps’ investigating questions can be described as the SPIN sequence, which is explained in detail throughout this summary. Here’s an overview:

**1)** **S-Situation questions** : Start by asking fact-finding and background questions, such as

“What do you see as the company’s biggest growth opportunities?” Asking too many of these questions can impose on the customer’s time and patience, so use them judiciously.

**2) P-Problem questions:** Once you understand the customer’s situation, ask questions that explore problems or issues your product or solution can solve—for instance, “Are you concerned about meeting your clients’ quality standards with your aging equipment?” Less experienced reps may not ask enough of these questions.

**3) I-Implication questions:** Asking good situation and problem questions may be enough to win a small sale. However, you need to go further in large sales and ask a more sophisticated question that explores the implications or ramifications of a customer’s problem—for example, “How will this affect your fourth-quarter results?”, or “What will this mean for your biggest customer?” The point is to underscore a problem’s significance, and create a sense of urgency for solving it. These are more difficult questions to frame, even for experienced salespeople.

**4) N-Need-payoff questions:** These questions lead the customer to articulate the benefits of your product or solution. For example, you might ask, “How useful would it be if we could increase your output by 10%?”, or “How would being able to reduce errors help you?” Need-payoff questions contribute strongly to sales success. Top reps ask these questions 10 times more often than average reps.

Asking SPIN questions is the best way to use the investigating phase of a sales call.

Chapter 4 examines in detail how you can use them to improve your success in major sales.
