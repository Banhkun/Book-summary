## Introduction

The first widely used sales model was developed in the 1920s by E.K. Strong, and it was practiced with few changes for the next 60 years. Strongâ€™s sales model established the basic ideas of traditional selling, such as using open and closed questions, presenting product features and benefits, handling objections, and using closing techniques.

However, in the 1990s, the traditional model started becoming less effective as sales grew in price and complexity. _SPIN Selling_ by Neil Rackham created a new model for larger sales, based on research into what top salespeople were doing differently to make major sales.

Rackham, founder of Huthwaite International, a research and consulting firm, analyzed over 35,000 sales calls over 12 years. This study, the largest and most rigorous study ever done to that point, found that winning major sales requires applying different skills and asking customers different types of questions. Further, the techniques and strategies effective in small sales can be a hindrance in large sales.

Rackham developed and extensively tested a new model for major sales, SPIN Selling, which uses a questioning method capsulized by the acronym SPIN: S-Situation, P-Problem, I-Implications, and N-Need-Payoff. _SPIN Selling_ is about how to apply this method to larger sales.

Sales models have continued to evolve in the 32 years since the book was published in 1988; a variety of models are debated, taught, and practiced. But SPIN selling principles are still core sales practices, and the book has become a classic and a template for successful selling.
