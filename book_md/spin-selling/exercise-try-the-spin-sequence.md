## Exercise: Try the SPIN Sequence

In the SPIN sales method, reps ask four types of questions during the investigating stage of a call: Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff questions. Practice the sequence by thinking through a previous sales meeting or one you're planning for soon.

* * *

Picture a customer you've met with or will meet with. What problem questions are most appropriate for this customer?

How would you build these problems into implication questions?

How would you develop the biggest problem into an explicit need?

Now discuss the benefits of your solution, avoiding just features or advantages.
