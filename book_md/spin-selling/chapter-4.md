## Chapter 4: The SPIN Strategy

The four question areas of the SPIN strategy—Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-payoff—are the key to converting a customer’s implied needs into explicit needs in a large sale.

### Situation Questions

**Situation questions are intended to gather facts and background information about the customer’s situation**. They’re the first questions asked during a sales call. They’re aimed at getting to know the customer personally and learning about the business and how it operates.

Examples are:

  * “How long have you been in your position?”
  * “Do you make buying decisions?”
  * “What’s your company’s annual sales volume?”
  * “What equipment do you use? How old is it?”



Situation questions are the easiest and most straightforward questions to ask, so they tend to be overused by inexperienced sales reps.

Situation questions are necessary in most sales, especially early on, because you need to understand the customer’s business. But research indicates their value is limited:

  * Situation questions don’t contribute to success. In successful calls, reps ask fewer of these questions; in unsuccessful calls, they ask more.
  * Inexperienced reps use these questions more than experienced reps do.
  * Customers get annoyed when reps ask too many situation questions.



Situation questions can irritate because they benefit the seller, but do nothing for the customer, who gets tired of answering them and may see them as a waste of time. This is especially true for professional buyers, who are constantly asked the same questions by multiple sales reps—for instance, “Tell me about your company,” or “How does your purchasing process work?”

Some of the questions are necessary, but you can minimize the number by doing research ahead of time, so you don’t ask questions you could have answered yourself.

As they gain experience, sales reps spend more time during a call asking the questions that go beyond fact-finding and influence call success.

### Problem Questions

**Problem questions are intended to reveal implied needs. They ask customers what their problems and frustrations are.**

Examples include:

  * How is your current equipment working for you?
  * What are the shortcomings of your system?
  * Does your aging equipment create problems for you with quality or speed?



Research indicates that:

  * In all sales, problem questions impact success more than situation questions do.
  * In smaller sales, problem questions are a predictor of success. The more problem questions a rep asks, the more likely she’ll make a sale. When reps get training to ask problem questions in small sales, their sales jump.
  * In successful small sales, reps ask twice as many problem questions as reps do in unsuccessful small sales.
  * In larger sales, problem questions _don’t_ have a major effect on sales success (discussed below).



It makes sense that problem questions would contribute more to sales success than fact-finding or situation questions do—because when you uncover problems you can address, you have something relevant to offer the customer.

Further, problem questions engage customers because you’re talking about something they’re interested in, as opposed to taking up their time with routine and possibly repetitive situation questions.

#### Problem Questions in Major Sales

While problem questions contribute strongly to success in small sales, they’re just a starting point for building needs in large sales. Remember, in larger sales, once you uncover implied needs, you need to build them up into explicit needs, because the customer must perceive the need to be greater when the cost of solving it is greater.

In larger sales, problem questions are an important building block, although they don’t create success in and of themselves the way they do in smaller sales.

### Implication Questions

**Implication questions are a tool for building implied needs into explicit needs big enough to require action.** These questions explore the larger implications, ripple effects, or consequences of a seemingly small problem, making it bigger.

Examples are:

  * Could the limitations of your equipment be costing you new business?
  * What effect does that have on quality?
  * Do your equipment problems increase turnover, or make it more difficult to hire operators?
  * Is this leading to increased costs?



Research indicates that:

  * Implication questions contribute strongly to success in larger sales.
  * They increase the customer’s perception of value: when a problem seems big, your solution seems more valuable or worth the price.
  * They’re more difficult for reps to ask than situation or problem questions because they challenge customers.



Most sales reps stop probing after they’ve asked situation and problem questions. In small sales, after they’ve uncovered problems or implied needs, reps typically move on to offering a solution—which may be sufficient to make a sale. However, problem questions aren’t enough in large sales where your solution is expensive.

**You have to ask implication questions to underscore the magnitude of problems _before_ _offering your solution_.**

Imagine the customer saying, “So what?” in response to a problem, and think about how to answer that by making the problem bigger. Then phrase your arguments as questions.

For example, if you’re trying to sell a new machine costing $120,000, you could ask implication questions that emphasize the workaround costs of continuing to use the old system over time. It may be that because the old system is difficult to use, the customer has more turnover in operators. This leads to overtime, outsourcing, recruiting, and training costs, plus a loss of quality. When the customer factors in these costs, the problems of the older equipment appear much bigger—and a $120,000 solution starts to seem reasonable.

#### Dealing With Decision-Makers

Problem questions are often enough to get a commitment when you’re dealing with users of your product or influencers who will advocate for you, but implication questions are more effective when dealing with decision-makers. These questions are a natural fit because a decision-maker’s job depends on trouble-shooting or anticipating the ways things can go wrong. When you explore implications, you’re speaking their language.

#### A Downside

Asking a lot of implication questions can leave the customer feeling negative or gloomy. The next type of question—the need-payoff question—counters that feeling by moving the conversation toward solutions.

### Need-Payoff Questions

While implication questions emphasize the magnitude of the problem, need-payoff questions emphasize the value of your solution.

These are positive questions about the benefits of solving a problem using your solution. For example:

  * How would this help you?
  * What would be the benefits of solving this problem?
  * What makes this solution appealing to you?



Research shows that:

  * In larger sales, need-payoff questions contribute strongly to success.
  * By encouraging the customer to identify the benefits of your solution, these questions make your solution more appealing.
  * Influencers who make your case to the decision-maker respond well to need-payoff questions.
  * Customers rate sales calls with a lot of need-payoff questions as helpful and positive.
  * Need-payoff questions contribute strongly to success in large sales where a good ongoing relationship is important.



Need-payoff questions have two psychological effects:

  * They shift the customer’s attention to problem-solving or taking action.
  * They engage the customer in identifying the benefits, or payoff, of what you’re offering. For example, if you asked, “How do you think a machine that’s twice as fast would help you?”, the customer might respond, “It would cut our overtime costs.”



#### Addressing Complex Problems

In small sales, it’s usually easy for the customer to see how a product will solve her problem. For example, if her concern is protecting important company documents, a secure, fireproof cabinet is an obvious solution.

But in larger sales, the problems—for instance, poor productivity— are more complex. There may be multiple aspects, and your solution may address only one key aspect. You’ll have trouble making a sale if the customer focuses on the aspects your solution doesn’t address, and dismisses it altogether.

Asking need-payoff questions is the best way to avoid this problem. When you ask questions that get the customer to tell you the ways your solution will help, you forestall objections. Also, when you treat the customer as an expert, he’ll respond positively.

#### Selling Your Solution Internally

In large sales, where multiple people are involved in a buying decision, you have to depend on influencers to sell your solution to top management in your absence.

Asking the influencer need-payoff questions will help him remember and advocate for the benefits of your solution. When the influencer identifies the benefits to his company in a conversation with you, he’s rehearsing for presenting them to his bosses. By participating in identifying the benefits, he’ll feel more confident and enthusiastic about your solution.

### Implication Versus Need-Payoff Questions

Implication questions and need-payoff questions are similar in that they’re both used to transform implied needs into explicit needs. It can be difficult to tell the two types apart.

It may help to **think of implication questions as sad and need-payoff questions as happy** :

  * Implication questions are problem-focused; they make problems bigger—they’re sad or negative.
  * Need-payoff questions are solution-oriented; they ask about the benefits of solving the problem—they’re positive or happy.



Here are some examples of each:

Implication questions:

  * Does the slowness of this equipment create backups elsewhere in your production process?
  * What impact are your production problems having on your ability to deliver a quality product on time?



Need-payoff questions:

  * Is this stage of the production process one that you’d like to speed up?
  * How would speeding up this stage of the process help you?



### The SPIN Model in Action

The SPIN sales model is effective because it guides reps to ask questions that are important and relevant to the customer, as opposed to focusing on whether questions are open or closed. It moves the customer through a naturally unfolding process of uncovering and developing implied needs, and then evolving them into explicit needs.

Here’s a summary showing the flow:

  * The seller asks **situation questions** to understand the buyer’s context, leading to 
  * **problem questions** that**** help**** the buyer uncover **implied needs,**
  * which the seller develops through **implication questions** that emphasize the magnitude of the problem, 
  * leading the buyer to state explicit needs, 
  * to which the seller responds with **need-payoff questions,**
  * which allow the buyer to identify **benefits,** which contribute strongly to sales success.



The sequence may vary at times. For instance:

  * A customer may start by stating an explicit need, and you can ask need-payoff questions immediately to get her to identify the benefits of your solution.
  * You might ask a situation question to get more information while discussing problems or implications.



But most of the time, sales calls follow the SPIN sequence.

In a nutshell, research indicates that successful salespeople:

  1. Ask situation questions, but not too many, to understand the customer situation.
  2. Ask problem questions to uncover implied needs.
  3. In smaller sales, reps may offer solutions next. But in larger sales, reps ask implication questions emphasizing the magnitude of the problem and the urgency of solving it.
  4. Reps ask need-payoff questions to get the buyer to identify benefits of the seller’s solution.



### Practicing SPIN Questions

Using SPIN questions effectively requires planning:

  * In planning a call, ask yourself, “What problems can I solve for this customer?”
  * Write down at least three possible customer problems that your solution could address.
  * Write down several problem questions you could ask to reveal each of the above problems.



#### Plan Implication Questions

Implication questions are difficult, if not impossible, to formulate on the fly, so plan them in advance. Remember, these questions contribute strongly to sales success. To plan implication questions:

  1. Write down a problem the customer may have.
  2. Write down potential consequences or effects the problem might have.
  3. For each consequence, write the question it suggests. For example, if the problem is a shortage of qualified people to do something, the implication questions might be whether the shortage will lead to the company incurring overtime costs, or to having difficulty filling vacancies.



#### Tips for Asking Need-Payoff Questions

Need-payoff questions are difficult for reps to get used to asking, despite the fact that, of all the SPIN questions, customers react to them most positively. Here are a few tips:

  * **Don’t ask need-payoff questions before you’ve developed the customer’s problems**. Sometimes reps start a sales call with questions like, “If I could show you a faster way to handle your billing, would you be interested?” Feeling manipulated, the customer will respond defensively. You have to develop and magnify needs before asking need-payoff questions.
  * **Don’t ask need-payoff questions for which you don’t have the solution** —that is, questions about a need your product or service doesn’t address. For instance, don’t ask why the customer needs to produce double-sided copies if your company’s machine only copies one side. You’ll succeed only in making a need you can’t address stronger. 
  * **The time to ask a need-payoff question is when the customer reveals a need you _can_ meet**. However, at that point, many reps jump right into talking about their solution instead of letting customers identify how having a solution would help them.



#### Practicing Need-Payoff questions

You can improve your skills with practice and effort. Here’s a simple practice exercise:

1) Ask a friend or colleague to help you (he doesn’t need to know anything about selling).

2) Think of a need your friend has—for instance, choosing a new car or vacation destination, or changing jobs.

3) Ask need-payoff questions to get the person talking about the benefits of addressing the need. For example, ask, “Why do you think it would be a good idea to get a new car?” “What features do you need that you don’t have now?”

You may be surprised to find that just practicing this exercise with someone can build the other person’s enthusiasm to the point of action. Need-payoff questions are that powerful.

Need-payoff questions are more generic than implication questions, which are focused on a customer’s business, so **it’s useful to have a supply of need-payoff questions ready**. Some examples are:

  * Why is this important or why does it matter?
  * How would that help the situation?
  * Would it be useful if …?
  * How else could this help you?
  * How much would it save if….?
