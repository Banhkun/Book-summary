## Exercise: Weighing Value

When considering purchases, people typically use a value equation: they weigh the magnitude of their need or problem against the cost of the solution. Put another way, they ask themselves, “Is my problem or need big enough to warrant paying this much?”

* * *

Think of a situation where you considered replacing something, but decided the cost was greater than your need or desire to have a new version. What factors did you consider in deciding against the purchase?

Describe the problem that the purchase would have solved.

What implications (effects, consequences) of not making the purchase did you consider? What implications can you see in retrospect?

List the ways the purchase/solution could have benefited you.

Now weigh the purchase versus the cost again. Have you moved any closer to making this purchase or a similar one? Why or why not?
