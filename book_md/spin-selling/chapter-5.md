## Chapter 5: Presenting Benefits

After the investigating stage of a sale where you ask SPIN questions, the next stage is demonstrating value. This stage, also referred to as demonstrating capability, is where you present your solution. In a major sale, some ways are more effective than others.

For the last 60 years, sales training has advocated using features and benefits to demonstrate value, or describe your products and services. The conventional wisdom has been that**features are facts or characteristics about a product** ; they aren’t persuasive. **Benefits are the ways features help the customer** , and they’re a compelling way to present your solution’s value.

But research indicates that:

  * The way reps are trained to use benefits is ineffective in larger sales.
  * The traditional approach is likely to get a negative response.
  * Defining a benefit is more complicated than it seems.



### Features

Conventional wisdom has held that facts/features are neutral, neither helping nor hurting sales success. Examples are: “The cost is $20,000,” “We have two models, basic and enhanced,” or “This computer has X amount of memory.” Facts play out a bit differently in small and large sales—**research has shown facts may help slightly in small sales, but their impact is neutral in larger sales.** Specifically:

  * Reps in unsuccessful calls spend somewhat more time discussing facts/features, but basically, features don’t have an impact on sales.
  * In successful small sales, describing features contributes slightly to success. This isn’t the case for larger sales.
  * In larger sales, describing features is detrimental early in the call and neutral later.
  * Users are more interested in features than decision-makers are.
  * Occasionally, in the middle of a complex sale of a technical product, the customer may start asking for feature details. At this point, people with technical expertise in the product can boost the sale.



Overall though, the longstanding belief that features generally don’t help a sale much, if at all, is correct.

### Benefits

While the definition of features is straightforward, there are numerous definitions of benefits. For example, a benefit:

  * Describes how a feature helps the customer.
  * Saves the customer money
  * Is a unique aspect of your solution that no one else offers
  * Creates a motive to buy



Researchers tested the effectiveness of various benefit assertions in sales calls, and narrowed them to two main types:

  1. A type-A benefit, which shows how a product/service can help generally (this is the most commonly taught benefit definition).
  2. A type-B benefit, which demonstrates how a product/service _meets an explicit need_ of the customer. 



Researchers found that:

  * In smaller sales, using the type-A benefit contributed strongly to success; in large sales, it contributed only a little to success.
  * Using the type B-benefit—focusing on how the solution addresses explicit needs— _contributed strongly to success in both small and large sales_.



The book hereafter refers to type-A benefits (how it can help) as “advantages,” and type-B benefits (how it addresses explicit needs) simply as “benefits.”

**There are three ways a seller can demonstrate value: by describing features, advantages, or benefits**. Here’s how they compare:

**Seller demonstrates value by focusing on:** | **Seller’s statement:** | **Effect on small / large sales**  
---|---|---  
1) Features  | Describes facts  | Somewhat positive/neutral or slightly negative   
2) Advantages  | Shows how features can help the customer  | Positive/somewhat positive   
3) Benefits  | Shows how the solution meets the customer’s explicit needs  | Very positive on both   
  
**Advantages show, in general, how a solution functions or can help the customer**. Examples are: “This feature means our machine costs less to operate,” or “It saves time.” Research indicates that advantages:

  * Contribute positively to small sales
  * Contribute somewhat positively to large sales



**Benefits show** **how a solution meets an explicit need of the customer**. Examples are: “We have this in stock, so we can meet your need for immediate delivery,” “This machine will give you the greater speed you’re looking for,” “This feature saves energy, which gives you the cost savings you need.”

Research indicates that benefits:

  * Contribute strongly to success in both large and small sales
  * Have the greatest effect of any value statements in large sales



#### Effects of Advantages and Benefits

Advantages have a greater positive impact on small sales than large ones because they address implied needs rather than explicit needs, which you have to develop in a large sale to justify the high price. Offering solutions to implied needs isn't enough in larger sales.

In contrast, benefits are much more powerful in large sales because they address explicit needs (but you have to do the work of developing these needs first in the investigating stage, to the point where customers say they want something).

A Motorola Canada productivity study showed that salespeople who used benefits rather than advantages increased their sales success (revenue) by 27 percent

A study of 5,000 technology companies in Europe and North America found that:

  * Calls leading to orders and advances featured significantly more benefit statements.
  * There wasn’t any significant difference between successful and unsuccessful calls where reps focused on advantages.



### Effects on a Longer Selling Cycle

Researchers found that in one company where the selling cycle was long (averaging 7.8 calls), the effects of focusing on features, advantages, and benefits varied at different points in the cycle.

The study found that:

  * Citing features has little effect throughout the cycle.
  * Benefits have a great impact whenever reps cite them.
  * Advantages have a positive effect early in the cycle (contributing to an advance rather than a continuation), but as the cycle progresses, the effect diminishes.
  * Advantages are less effective than benefits throughout the selling cycle.



Researchers theorized that the impact of advantages is greater at first because customers naturally expect to hear more about the seller’s product or solution earlier in the sale. However, at later stages, the customer expects a response to his needs. If the seller keeps talking about advantages at that point, they’ll have less of a positive effect.

Another possibility is that advantages tend to be forgotten between calls, while benefits are remembered because they relate directly to the customer’s unique needs.

An example of how advantages wane is the forceful sales rep who pushes his product on the customer in a first meeting and comes away feeling he’s been successful—but orders don’t materialize later, either because the customer is put off by the approach, or he has forgotten the advantages since they weren’t personalized.

### Selling New Products

When it comes to selling new products, salespeople often do a poor job of demonstrating value, which mystifies and frustrates top management. As a result, new products often fall short of initial sales projections.

The reason is that when a product is new, marketing staff train sellers in the “bells and whistles,” or features and advantages. Excited about selling something new, sales reps focus on features and advantages. They focus on the product rather than the customer, but focusing on general advantages is an ineffective strategy for large sales.

Researchers found that new product sales are far more successful when reps focus on benefits–the problems (explicit needs) the product can solve for specific customers.

Often, when the excitement over a new product launch dies down and sales reps begin losing their initial enthusiasm for it, sales start picking up. The reason is that the reps have shifted their focus back to developing the customer’s explicit needs, and showing how the product can meet them.

### Demonstrating Value Effectively

In summary, there are three main points to remember about demonstrating value effectively in a large sale:

1)**Don’t try to demonstrate the value of your solution before you’ve developed the customer’s explicit needs** by asking implication and need-payoff questions.

2) **Don’t confuse advantages with benefits**. Sales models for smaller sales urge you to focus on general advantages (the word may be used interchangeably with benefits)—but remember, to succeed in large sales, you must develop a customer’s explicit needs and answer them with benefits specific to those needs.

3) **Don’t get caught up in the hype surrounding new products**. When presented with a new product to sell, ask yourself what problems it solves, then formulate SPIN questions to develop explicit needs the product can meet.
