## Exercise: Analyze a Sales Call

One way to improve your selling skills is to review your sales calls after the fact to determine what worked and what you can do better the next time.

* * *

Try this with a recent sales call. Did you accomplish your objectives? How so?

What would you do differently if you could do the call over?

What did you learn that you can use to improve your performance in future calls?
