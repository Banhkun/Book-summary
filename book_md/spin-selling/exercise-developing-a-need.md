## Exercise: Developing a Need

For many purchases, it takes a while to make up your mind to act. You go through a process of need development that starts with a hint of dissatisfaction with the way things are. The steps after that are:

  * You start noticing more flaws
  * You realize you have problems with it
  * You want to change itâ€”now



* * *

Think of a time when you went through this process recently. What did you become dissatisfied with? What first caused you to be dissatisfied?

Once you realized a need/problem, how did it grow bigger in your mind? What were the factors that made it seem bigger than the way it started out?

Were you happy with the result (either acting or not acting)? Why?

What aspects of your personal experience in developing a need could apply to your next sales call?
