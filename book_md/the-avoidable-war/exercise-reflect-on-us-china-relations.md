## Exercise: Reflect on US-China Relations

Now that we’ve covered the history of US-China relations, China’s core priorities under Xi’s leadership, and how the two superpowers can avoid war, reflect on how Rudd’s argument has changed your understanding of this politically complex situation and how it might unfold in the future.

* * *

In the brief history of the key events in the China-US relationship, were there any historical events that you didn’t know about before or were surprised by? Explain why.

Rudd describes the following priorities in modern China: keeping the CCP in power through economic reform and growth, restoring and maintaining Chinese territory by expanding the military, and increasing its global influence through investment and its role in global governing bodies. How do these priorities compare to your own government’s high-level goals?

Based on the guide’s information about contributing factors to tensions between the two countries (like cyberattacks, military encroachment, the trade war, and so on), what kind of events do you think are most likely to spark a full-on conflict between these two nations?

Rudd suggests a three-part diplomacy plan to delay a potential war: establishing firm, verifiable boundaries that each country must comply with, allowing economic and ideological competition to carry on, and collaborating on key global issues like nuclear proliferation and climate change. Which of these do you think will be the most challenging to achieve and why?
