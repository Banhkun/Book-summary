## 1-Page Summary

From moguls like Donald Trump to HGTV house-flippers, countless people have invested in real estate to build their wealth. Some focus on commercial real estate, others restore and sell run-down residences, and still others buy single- and multifamily homes to rent out to tenants.

In _Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat_ , David M. Greene focuses on this last category. He explains how the buy, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat (BRRRR) method differs from traditional real estate investing, and he argues that **the BRRRR approach is the most efficient way to build wealth and gain financial freedom by developing a large portfolio of investment rental properties.**

(Shortform note: Although some experts dispute that BRRRR is the _best_ method for buying investment properties, many agree that rental properties are ideal low-risk investments: You can use other people’s money to buy them, there’s a steady demand for rentals, and properties usually appreciate in the long term—even if markets dip in the short term. To protect yourself against market volatility, keep a cash reserve, regularly review your expenses, trim unnecessary costs, and maintain your properties.)

In this guide, we’ll describe Greene’s tips for executing each step of the BRRRR method and compare his strategies to other methods. We’ll also provide additional information and key context for using Greene’s advice effectively.

Greene began real estate investing in 2009. During the first eight years, he bought two to three properties each year by following the traditional method (which we’ll explain next). He began using the BRRRR method in 2017, and within two years he’d accelerated his investing to buy two properties a _month_. Greene now runs a real estate team within Keller Williams, he’s published three books on real estate investing, and he co-hosts the BiggerPockets Real Estate Podcast.

(Shortform note: Well-known real estate investor Brandon Turner coined the term BRRRR, though he acknowledges that other investors were already using the strategy. Turner and Greene helped popularize the method on the BiggerPockets podcasts, which they co-hosted from 2018 to 2021.)

### The BRRRR Method vs. the Traditional Method

The BRRRR model hinges on two elements:

  1. **Buying a property** as far **below market value** as possible and paying the full price (not just a down payment)
  2. **Refinancing the property** after you’ve renovated and rented it out (Shortform note: The term “refinance” is misleading because you’re not replacing an existing mortgage, since you paid full price for the home’s purchase. However, it likely refers to a _cash-out refinance_ , which allows you to use your equity to borrow cash that you can use for anything—in this case, to “repeat” the process and buy your next investment property.)



Together, these steps represent the biggest difference between BRRRR and the traditional approach to real estate investing: **BRRRR investors finance the property at a later stage than traditional investors.** This chart illustrates the difference in the sequence of steps for each approach.

| **BRRRR** | **Traditional**  
---|---|---  
**Step 1** | **Buy** a property below market value and pay full price (without mortgage payments).  | **Finance** : Borrow money from a lender to cover the property’s purchase.   
**Step 2** | **Rehab** , or renovate the property, paying for it out of pocket.  | **Buy** the property with an out-of-pocket down payment.   
**Step 3** | **Rent** the property.  | **Rehab** the property.   
**Step 4** | **Refinance** the property.  | **Rent** the property.   
**Step 5** | **Repeat** : Use the money from refinancing to buy and rehab a new investment property.  | **Save** or secure money through other means (which we’ll discuss later) for the down payment on a new investment property.   
  
(Shortform note: Although BRRRR is described as a five-step process, there is an implied preliminary step: saving or securing money to buy the property. Including this unstated step more clearly shows that the primary difference between BRRRR and traditional investing is that the “finance”—or “refinance”—stage and the “save” stage are flipped.)

Greene explains that **the advantage of paying full price for a property and refinancing later is that the loan is based on** the after-repair value (ARV), or **the post-renovation appraisal**. Since the renovations add value to the property, and the financing is proportionate to the home’s value, you get a bigger loan than you would if you’d financed the purchase of the property.

The goal is to pay as little as possible for the property and rehab it to increase the value as much as possible. **Ideally, through refinancing, you recover all of your investment (or sometimes more), and you use that money to buy and renovate the next property.** (Greene acknowledges that recouping your entire investment is a “home run”—something to strive for, but not something to expect on every project.) By pulling your money back out of the project, you make the same dollars work for you over and over, thereby increasing the _velocity of your money_.

> **BRRRR Is Best for Long-Term Profits and New Investors**
> 
> The BRRRR process is best for investors who are focused on building a large portfolio of rental properties and growing wealth _over time_. By contrast, if you want to use rental properties to turn a profit quickly, a better strategy is to buy a turnkey property and begin renting it immediately.
> 
> Alternatively, real estate investor Chad Carson recommends using BRRRR only to begin building your portfolio of investment properties—otherwise, if you use BRRRR indefinitely, you’ll accumulate a large number of mortgages, and that creates greater risk if the market drops. Carson suggests that once you’ve acquired several properties, you use the _rental debt snowball_ strategy by funneling all of your rental income into paying off one mortgage at a time until all of your properties are paid off. By eliminating your mortgage payments, you increase your cash flow, and at that point, you can choose whether and how to continue building your portfolio.

For example, imagine you find a fixer-upper for $95,000 and spend an additional $25,000 on renovations, making your total initial investment $120,000. After the improvements, the home is appraised for $160,000. You refinance, and the lender grants you a loan for 75% of this ARV, or $120,000. You’ve recovered your entire investment to use for your next property, and, as long as the tenants’ rent covers your mortgage and expenses, you’ve gained a consistent source of income. Greene asserts that even if the income from each property is just a few hundred dollars a month, **this model allows you to quickly build your volume of properties and multiply that cash flow.**

(Shortform note: A key to maintaining your long-term cash flow across your portfolio is to use the refinance to pull out _only enough to recover your investment_. If you’re approved to refinance for more than this amount, it can be tempting to borrow above your investment—or _overleverage_ —so that you have more to invest in your next property. However, this creates a higher mortgage payment, which reduces your positive cash flow on that property.)

We’ll explore each step of the BRRRR method in detail. But Greene writes that there are a few things you’ll need to do _before_ beginning: Begin looking for the agents and vendors you’ll work with through the BRRRR process and secure a loan pre-approval letter.

### Preliminary Step 1: Begin Recruiting Your Dream Team

When you start investing, Greene says you need to assemble a team of people who you’ll work with on property after property. He calls this your “Core Four”; we’ll call it your Dream Team. Greene explains that **the members of your Dream Team are not employees, but rather vendors and collaborators who specialize in working with real estate investors** , which requires different knowledge and strategies than primary residence homeowners have.

(Shortform note: Greene offers two main pieces of advice for _how_ to find the members of your Dream Team: First, build a reputation as someone people want to work with—by being fair, reliable, and helpful. Second, get recommendations through your network. But how do you build a network? Attend professional networking events, meetups, industry conferences, and open houses; host investment classes, parties, and charity events; and make an effort to constantly meet new people, both in person and online.)

Your Dream Team has four roles, though Greene advises having two people in each role to provide backup if one person becomes unavailable. The four roles are:

  1. **Real estate agents** ,**** who help you find and negotiate good deals on properties
  2. **Lenders** ,**** who help you use loan programs that are best suited to you and the circumstances of each project
  3. **Contractors** ,**** who know how to add maximum value to your property for minimal cost
  4. **Property managers**(PMs), who can handle most tenant issues and requests with little oversight and can advise you on prospective investment properties



> **The Benefits of Investor-Friendly Vendors**
> 
> Greene emphasizes the importance of ensuring your Dream Team members are investor-friendly. This requires that the vendor is not only willing to work with investors, who have different needs and demands than primary residence owners, but also that they have the knowledge and skills to cater to investors’ interests.
> 
>   * Investor-friendly real estate agents are versed in the area’s micro-markets, so they know which neighborhoods offer the best investments, and they have access to off-market properties, which gives investors a leg up on competing buyers.
> 
>   * Investor-friendly lenders understand investors’ objectives and work to get you approved for the high volume of loans needed for a large investment portfolio.
> 
>   * Investor-friendly contractors are likely to have lower prices because they expect you to bring a steady flow of new projects.
> 
> 

> 
> By definition, property managers would not work with primary residence homeowners.

It will take time to find the right people for your Dream Team, but once you do, you’ll build your relationships and develop more efficient systems through working together repeatedly. In some cases, because you consistently bring them business, you can even save money—for example, by asking for a lower agent commission, a discount on contractor work, or reduced management fees.

(Shortform note: Greene specifies that the members of your Dream Team are so important because they have the skills and knowledge to help you beyond performing their primary responsibilities—for example, a good PM not only manages properties but can also connect you with reliable handymen and estimate how much you can reasonably charge for rent. However, as a real estate investor, you’ll likely work with many other vendors, such as a bookkeeper, accountant, lawyer, notary, home stager, and photographer.)

### Preliminary Step 2: Get Pre-Approved for a Loan

Even though you’ll be paying full price for the property, Greene cautions that you must secure a loan pre-approval letter before beginning the BRRRR sequence, since the method hinges on your ability to refinance in Step 4. If you’re denied pre-approval, he suggests working with a business partner who can get pre-approved, or trying another form of real estate investing like house flipping.

(Shortform note: As a caveat, a lender can still deny your mortgage after pre-approval if your credit score, income, or assets drop, if your debt level rises, or if the loan requirements change.)

When you get pre-approved, find out key information that will impact your decisions throughout the rest of the process:

  * **The amount you're pre-approved to borrow** determines how much you can spend on the property purchase and renovation. (Shortform note: The factors impacting the size of your loan include your credit score, the type of loan you’re getting (we’ll discuss loan types in Step 4), and whether the property is single- or multifamily.)
  * **The “seasoning period,”** or the amount of time you must own the property before being eligible for refinancing, determines how long you have to wait before recouping your capital to invest in the next property. (Shortform note: Most banks require a six- to 12-month seasoning period. If you buy and rehab the property using a short-term loan like hard money or private financing—which we’ll discuss in Step 1—you must ensure that its term is at least as long as the seasoning period.)
  * **The loan to value (LTV)** , or the size of the loan based on the value of the property, determines how much you can invest in the purchase and rehab and still recover your capital during the refinance. Greene suggests trying to secure a 75% LTV. (We’ll explain this further in BRRRR Step 1.) (Shortform note: Another way to understand LTV is that it reflects your equity in the property—at 75% LTV, you have 25% equity.)
  * **The _cash-out_ refinance rate **determines how you calculate your expenses and cash flow. A cash-out refinance applies when the size of the loan is greater than the amount you owe on the property (as is the case in BRRRR), and it carries higher interest rates than other refinance loans. (Shortform note: The closing costs for cash-out refinances average 3 to 5% of the loan amount. Some lenders allow you to add those costs to your mortgage to avoid paying them right away, but that option can come with a higher interest rate that could cost you more in the long run.)



Greene recommends you **get pre-approvals from at least two lenders** because their rates and closing costs may vary.

### BRRRR Step 1: Buy

When you’re ready to begin the BRRRR process, Greene claims that your success in Step 1 sets the tone for the success of the entire project: **You need to buy significantly under market value to be able to recover most or all of your investment during the refinance.** The amount of money you can save or make during the other steps is either more limited or is directly impacted by Step 1.

(Shortform note: Some critics of the BRRRR method say that it’s too difficult to find properties priced far enough below market value to make the math work. Others argue that real estate prices this low only exist in certain markets, like the Midwest and Southeast, which would force some investors to buy and manage their properties from out of state. Although Greene advocates for long-distance investing—he even wrote a book about it—other experienced investors discourage it.)

Greene strongly recommends saving money to buy (and renovate) your first property without debt, as he did. Doing this allows you to recoup your own cash during the refinance stage and use it to invest in your next property—without having to use money from your refinance or your property’s cash flow to pay off that initial debt. However, you don’t have to use your own money to do the BRRRR method; we’ll discuss alternatives later in this section.

But before explaining how to _secure_ an investment property, Greene describes how to find a good deal.

#### Finding a Property

Greene writes that the best deals are typically under one of three forms of distress:

  1. **Property distress** , meaning that it needs significant repairs. These fixer-uppers are most common in BRRRR because they’re the easiest to find—but they also require the most work. (Shortform note: Because of rising home prices and fierce competition, many house-hunting Millennials have resorted to fixer-uppers. Despite lower sale prices, the home buyers often face high renovation costs, and 25% report regretting the purchase.)
  2. **Personal distress** , meaning that the property owner needs to sell quickly due to their financial circumstances (such as divorce or a lost job). These properties offer the highest profit margins because they require little or no renovation, but they can be difficult to find. (Shortform note: When a homeowner can no longer afford their mortgage and the house is worth less than what they owe, they may ask their lender to agree to a short sale, meaning they’d sell the property for less than the amount owed. For buyers, this means a discounted price, motivated seller, and reduced competition—but also a more complicated transaction and higher risk, as short sales are sold as-is.)
  3. **Market distress** , meaning that the price is down because the economic or real estate market has dropped. This is a ripe time for good deals, but it’s a limited window of opportunity. (Shortform note: The best time to buy is at the first sign of the market’s recovery, when home values begin to shift from dropping to rising. If you buy at this time, you secure low prices to maximize value appreciation, and the property’s value will start rising immediately.)



To find properties that fall into one of the first two categories, you have to know where to look. Greene suggests finding **foreclosures** and **property tax liens** through live and online auctions**.** You can also drive through neighborhoods looking for distressed and neglected properties, search online for the owner’s name and contact information, and reach out with an offer to buy the property.

Greene also stresses**networking with others to increase your chances of finding a great deal while reducing the leg work required.** He suggests recruiting eyes and ears by networking with:

  * Real estate agents
  * Wholesalers (who find deals and funnel them to investors for a fee)
  * _Bird dogs_ (who search for deals in exchange for money, advice, or mentorship)
  * Professionals who encounter distressed sellers (including divorce attorneys, morticians, and bankruptcy companies) 



Additionally, advertise through direct mail and SEO, and frequently remind your family and friends that you buy homes in any condition.

> **Know Your Goals**
> 
> Real estate investor and coach Phil Pustejovsky says that one pitfall of BRRRR is that it makes investors focus so narrowly on finding a property that is priced low enough to fit the BRRRR strategy that they pass up opportunities that could turn a profit using other investment methods, such as house-flipping or buying a turnkey rental property. According to Pustejovsky and other real estate investors, the key to success is to identify your goals and choose the investment strategies that will help you reach them.

The best strategies for this are to become a hard money lender or a discount note investor (someone who buys another person’s debt at a discounted price and earns the difference between the discount and face value).

##### Identifying a Good Deal

To identify a good deal, Greene says you have to determine the property’s ARV (after-repair value), the renovation costs, and how much you’ll be able to charge for rent.

**First, calculate your ARV and rehab expenses to gauge whether it’s possible to recover your capital when you refinance.** As discussed, Greene recommends aiming for a 75% LTV, a loan worth 75% of the property value. With this rate, if your combined purchase and rehab costs are 75% of your ARV, then you’ll recover your entire investment when you refinance.

(Shortform note: It’s possible to secure up to a 95% LTV mortgage, though there are several trade-offs to consider. First, higher LTVs come with higher interest rates, which eat into your cash flow. Second, fewer lenders are willing to offer high LTVs because they are a bigger risk to the lending institution. Third, mortgages above 80% LTV typically require private mortgage insurance, which adds to your monthly property expenses.)

Estimating your ARV depends on the type of property you’re buying:

  * Single-family home values are based on the recent sales prices of _comps_ , or comparable properties in the area. To analyze comps, Greene suggests consulting local real estate agents, appraisers, and websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. (Shortform note: Comps should be similar in style, size, condition, age, and bedroom and bathroom count.)
  * Multifamily property values are based on their potential profitability through rents. To determine how much you can charge for rent, talk to local professionals (like investors and property managers) and use rent calculators on websites like Rentometer.com and Biggerpockets.com. (Shortform note: To calculate the market value, divide the capitalization rate (cap rate) by the net operating income (NOI). The cap rate is the average of similar properties’ cap rates in the area—and that is the purchase price divided by the NOI. To get the NOI, total future rents and other income and subtract all expenses—including taxes, insurance, maintenance, and property management.)



To estimate a property’s renovation costs, you’ll likely need a contractor to tour the property and provide an estimate. In his own investments, Greene brings a contractor and an inspector to the property at the same time to ensure that the contractor can factor in every major issue the inspector identifies. (Shortform note: Home inspectors can highlight issues a contractor may overlook. Inspectors check a home’s structure, foundation, flooring, roof, insulation, plumbing, electrical system, and HVAC system. For some properties, you may also want to bring in specialists to inspect for mold, water damage, asbestos, termites, radon, and lead paint or piping.)

**Second, estimate how much you can charge for rent to calculate whether your property will cash-flow positively** , meaning your rental income will more than cover your mortgage and expenses. As a general rule, Greene says that if you can rent the property for at least 1% of the purchase price, you’ll probably have a positive cash flow. (Shortform note: Real estate investment experts warn that single-family homes are riskier rental properties because your entire rental income relies on one tenant or family, so you have no cash flow on that property during vacancies. If it doesn’t look like rental income will produce a positive cash flow, you may still be able to profit by rehabbing the property and selling it as a flip.)

#### Securing a Good Deal

Once you’ve found a good deal, you may need to compete against other bidders to secure it—and Greene says that **an all-cash offer makes your bid more competitive.** Cash offers are attractive to sellers because they reduce the _contingencies_ , which allow buyers to pull out of a deal without losing money within a window of time (the _contingency period_). Fewer contingencies mean greater odds that the deal will close smoothly and quickly.

There are **three primary contingencies** in every property sale:

  1. The **loan contingency** allows a buyer to withdraw if their loan doesn’t get approved. A cash offer eliminates the need for a loan approval and, thus, this contingency. 
  2. The **appraisal contingency** provides time to get an appraisal and allows the buyer to withdraw if the property’s value is below a certain amount. Banks often require an appraisal, but if you’re paying cash, you have the option to waive this contingency. 
  3. The **inspection contingency** provides time for a home inspection and allows the buyer to withdraw or renegotiate if the property has significant issues. Regardless of whether you’re paying cash, you can waive this contingency if you already anticipate a major renovation because the house is severely distressed.



(Shortform note: Each contingency is assigned a specific contingency period, during which the home is _under contract_. For example, a loan contingency may last 30 to 60 days, while an inspection contingency may be just 10 days. If the buyer’s financing isn’t approved or they can’t schedule a home inspection within the given time window, they have to decide whether to request an extension—which postpones the closing date—or move forward with the sale anyway.)

Greene adds that cash offers also open you to more investment opportunities because some extremely distressed properties don’t qualify for financing.

**Although Greene stresses the importance of all-cash offers, it doesn’t have to be _your cash_.** Alternative sources of funding include:

  * **Owner financing** —when you give a down payment and the property owner acts as the lender to finance the rest of the sale price.
  * **Private money** —when you borrow from an individual. 
  * **Hard money** —when you borrow from a hard-money lender—generally a private individual who approves borrowers based on their collateral rather than their credit scores (these are often short-term loans with high interest rates and fees).
  * **A business partner**



(Shortform note: Cash offers became more common as the pandemic turned the heat up on housing market competition: They accounted for 20% of home sales in 2019, and by 2021 that number jumped to 33%. Many of these offers came from buyers looking to downsize, who were flush with cash after selling larger homes in the hot market. Facing low housing supply and competing offers for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars above asking price, buyers with cash offers were nearly four times as likely to win bidding wars in late 2020 and early 2021.)

### BRRRR Step 2: Rehab

Once you’ve found and bought a great deal, Greene says that **executing a cost-effective, value-raising renovation is the second most important aspect of making a profit in the BRRRR method.** This involves working with the right contractor and making smart upgrades to the property.

(Shortform note: Many real estate investors consider this to be the riskiest step in BRRRR, especially for rookie investors, since unexpected issues with the property, poor project management, and bad renovation decisions can add tens of thousands of dollars to the budget. As an alternative, buying properties that are already renovated and rented out allows wary investors to bypass two of BRRRR’s biggest potential hazards.)

#### Finding the Right Contractor

As we mentioned, each member of your Dream Team should have experience working with investors. **Greene describes an investor-friendly contractor as one who knows how to find cost-effective solutions to problems** (like _repairing_ instead of _replacing_ worn flooring). (Shortform note: When vetting contractors, ask where they’re licensed, how many years’ experience they have, what types of repairs they can and can’t do, what payment method and schedule they require, and how they can guarantee that they’ll meet the required deadlines.)

If you don’t yet have a contractor on your Dream Team, Greene suggests a few strategies for finding one:

  * Ask your property manager (PM) to find five new contractors to bid on each project, and pay your PM $50 per bid. This allows you to meet and compare several contractors so you can quickly find the right one for you. (Shortform note: To make it easier to compare bids, ask each contractor to distinguish materials from labor costs in their bids. This also allows you to verify the cost of materials.) 
  * Network with other real estate investors and find out which contractors they work with. However, they may be reluctant to share this information for fear that your work will pull contractors away from their projects.



(Shortform note: When working with a contractor, your first project will be the riskiest—that’s when you’ll discover the contractor’s working and management style and find out if they can deliver the work quality and timeline they promised. If the contractor finds an issue that they previously overlooked, like outdated plumbing, the repair could derail your budget. Additionally, if the contractor gets other jobs and prioritizes those projects over yours, you’re likely to go over deadline, which delays your rental income and refinance and also increases the risk of people noticing and breaking into your empty property.)

#### Making Strategic Repairs and Upgrades

As you plan your rehab, Greene writes that you must be strategic about how you approach repairs and upgrades: **Maximize the value of the property** —to maximize both the appraisal when you refinance and the rents you can charge tenants—**but be aware that there is a point of diminishing returns.** If you turn your fixer-upper into a five-bedroom, custom-designed home, there will still be a ceiling to the property’s appraisal and rent values based on the neighborhood and other external factors. Consult your PM to find out about comps’ conditions and amenities to ensure that you prioritize upgrades that make your property competitive.

To strike this balance, Greene offers tips for various aspects of your rehab.

  * **Add only enough square footage to put your property on par with comps**(comparable homes in the area). When you do make additions, try to capitalize on existing structural components—for example, build out onto an outdoor patio’s concrete foundation.
  * **Add bedrooms if the home has fewer than three** , but don’t go over four; at that point, the value gains drop off. If you can, turn existing spaces into bedrooms instead of adding onto the home. 
  * **Add a bathroom if the home has only one.**
  * **Prioritize kitchens and bathrooms** , both of which factor significantly into appraisals and rent prices. Upgrade these spaces with fresh paint and new cabinetry hardware. Splurge on high-end materials in small quantities, like the tile for bathroom floors and kitchen backsplashes. 



> **Don’t Forget Permits**
> 
> Major renovations—including additions and certain plumbing and electrical upgrades—require municipal building permits. When planning your rehab budget and timeline, factor in the time and money needed to obtain the necessary permits. The costs, requirements, and waiting periods vary by municipality, but the process can take up to six weeks, with additional fees for expedited permits. In the permitting process, you must draw up plans for your project, submit those plans for approval along with your permit application, and schedule inspections at various stages of the project to ensure the work matches the approved plan and complies with building and safety codes.
> 
> Despite the hassle and expense, permits are critical to raising your property value: Any home improvements for which building permits are required but not obtained will be excluded from the home appraisal when you refinance or sell the property. That can completely derail your return on a BRRRR investment.

### BRRRR Step 3: Rent

As soon as your property is rehabbed, Greene writes that it’s time to start renting it and creating cash flow. (Shortform note: Finding tenants quickly is also critical because many lenders require you to have renters before refinancing. Delaying this step not only postpones your cash flow but also your ability to recoup your investment.)

Since you don’t have much wiggle room in your rent prices at this stage—they’re largely determined by the property you bought and the success of your rehab—**your priorities in this stage are to minimize vacancy and manage your property effectively.**

#### Minimizing Vacancy

Greene states that you can **minimize vacancy by strategically setting your rent prices and lease periods and by keeping tenants happy.**

As we discussed in Step 1, you should have consulted local investors, PMs, and rent calculators on websites like Rentometer.com and Biggerpockets.com to estimate your rent prices before buying your property. Greene recommends you **set rent prices at the lower end of your estimate initially to attract tenants** and fill vacancies quickly. Then raise rents to the higher end of that range during lease renewals—at that point, most tenants are willing to pay more to avoid moving.

Additionally, **set your lease periods to expire during the spring or summer** , when most renters are looking for homes. If your tenants move out, you’ll have more interest from prospective tenants and reduce the “turn time,” how long the unit sits vacant between renters.

Finally, **don’t give your tenants reason to leave** : Be accessible, responsive, and prompt with maintenance requests. (Shortform note: The implied warranty of habitability requires residential landlords to keep properties in “habitable” conditions throughout the lease period. Although the definition of habitability varies by state and jurisdiction, it broadly includes electricity, heat and hot water, drinkable water, a functional bathroom and toilet, and a smoke detector.)

Greene also suggests rewarding tenants (those who pay on time, maintain landscaping, and keep the property in good condition) by discounting their rent raises during lease renewals. Although you lose some money in the lost rent, these tenants save you money in maintenance costs and city code violations.

> **Screen Your Tenants**
> 
> The tenants who will contribute most to your income are those who cause minimal property damage and stay for many years (and rent increases), saving you lost earnings during vacancies and the time and money required to advertise and fill vacancies. Increase your chances of finding a good tenant by screening interested candidates.
> 
>   * **Require references** from past landlords and employers. Ask landlords if the renter paid on time and kept their property in good condition. Ask employers if the renter is reliable and verify that they’re still employed.
> 
>   * **Run a credit check** to find out if the tenant has filed for bankruptcy or faced prior evictions.
> 
>   * **Ask for current pay stubs** to ensure that the renter makes enough to cover rent.
> 
>   * **Complete a background check** of local, state, and federal records.
> 
> 

> 
> While screening applicants, avoid violating Fair Housing Laws by maintaining consistent screening requirements (ideally posting them with the advertisement for the rental) and steering clear of questions about the renter’s age, sex, race, religion, disability, native language, or familial status.

#### Managing Your Property

**When it comes to managing your property** —from responding to maintenance requests to handling lease renewals and evictions—**you can do it yourself or hire a property manager**(PM). Although Greene recommends having a PM on your Dream Team, you don’t have to use them to manage your property (they can still be a valuable member of your team, for example, by offering advice about the best neighborhoods to buy investment properties).

He lists the pros and cons of each option:

| **Property Manager** | **Self-Management**  
---|---|---  
**Pros** | 

  * Experience and skill set 
  * Familiarity with the area 

| 

  * No cost 
  * Control over every aspect of management 

  
**Cons** | 

  * Higher cost 
  * Time and effort to find a high-quality, compatible PM 

| 

  * Lack of skills and experience 
  * Consistent time and effort (that could be better spent finding, buying, and rehabbing new properties) 

  
  
Greene writes that this choice depends in part on your personality: Some investors may enjoy the work or value the control more than others. However, **as you build your portfolio of investment properties, managing them yourself becomes less feasible,** and you may reach a tipping point where you have no choice but to hire a PM.

> **Weigh the Pros and Cons**
> 
> The pros and cons listed above can be summed up as three key differences:
> 
>   * Time and effort
> 
>   * Cost
> 
>   * Skills and experience (this encompasses knowledge)
> 
> 

> 
> While each investor has a different tolerance for the time and effort required to find a property manager or self-manage a property, let’s examine the other differences.
> 
>   * **Cost:** Property management costs average 8% to 12% of the rental value, which is the total _potential_ rent the property will bring in when fully occupied. Since this price does not reflect additional PM fees, property expenses, or vacancies, it can take a large chunk out of your cash flow.
> 
>   * **Skills and experience:** If you opt for self-management, especially as a new landlord, you’ll need to be aware of your legal responsibilities and liabilities. Get familiar with local landlord and tenant laws to ensure the property meets building codes and that outdoor maintenance (including landscaping and snow removal) complies with the warranty of habitability. Additionally, hire a landlord-tenant attorney to review leases and help you deal with evictions and other tenant issues.

### BRRRR Step 4: Refinance

As discussed in Preliminary Step 2, Greene emphasizes that you should have a loan pre-approval letter before beginning the BRRRR process. That pre-approval gives you a baseline for your refinance, but certain conditions like the loan’s interest rate may change. (Shortform note: Another major risk is the real estate market crashing between budgeting your project—based on your pre-approval and estimate of the property’s after-repair value—and getting it appraised for your refinance. If home values tank, you lose a large chunk of your investment. Although crashes can be unpredictable, monitor market trends and try to anticipate dips.)

Your lender should work with you to determine which type of loan product is best for your project. As a primer, Greene describes several types of loans.

**Conventional loan** : Many lenders offer conventional loans because they’re partially insured by the government, making this a common option for new investors. For investment properties, this loan typically requires a 20-25% minimum down payment.

(Shortform note: As previously mentioned, if your down payment is less than 20%, you’ll typically have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) until you have 20% equity in your home. The annual cost of PMI is based on the size of your loan and your credit score, averaging between 0.58% and 1.86% of your loan. Although this is an added expense, it can make home ownership accessible to buyers who couldn’t otherwise afford a 20% down payment.)

**Jumbo (or high-balance) loan** : This is a loan that exceeds the regional housing market’s designated borrowing limit. As a result, they tend to carry high interest rates and lender fees. However, these loans are uncommon for real estate investors who aim to buy low- and mid-level properties.

(Shortform note: Although Greene equates high-balance and jumbo loans, high-balance loans are conforming loans, while jumbo loans are _nonconforming_. A conforming loan meets the criteria for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to back the mortgage, which gives the lenders a safety net and leads to lower interest rates. Since nonconforming loans don’t meet these criteria, lenders take on more risk and have more flexibility to set the terms and requirements, which typically means higher interest rates and minimum down payments.)

**Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)** : This is a loan against your equity in a property. It acts as a credit line, and it often has lower interest rates than credit cards.

(Shortform note: One benefit of using a HELOC is that you avoid the closing costs required for most refinances. These closing costs average 2 to 5% of the loan amount.)

**Portfolio loan** : This is a loan that the lender or bank (often a credit union or savings and loan association) holds in its portfolio, rather than selling it to a secondary buyer. Although these loans have higher interest rates than non-portfolio loans, they’re critical for high-volume real estate investors because a conventional loan can’t finance more than 10 properties.

(Shortform note: Portfolio loans can also be a good option for buyers who are struggling to get approved for conventional loans, because portfolio loans don’t have to meet conforming loan criteria, and they may not require PMI. However, portfolio loans are harder to secure than conventional loans because fewer lenders offer them.)

Additionally, Greene lists two loans that require you to live in the home (at least initially). If you qualify for these loans, he explains that you can still earn cash flow while living on the property: You can rent out your extra bedrooms in a single-family home or buy a multifamily property and rent the other units. These loans are:

**Federal Housing Act (FHA) loan** : This loan allows for a lower down payment and lower credit score, but it requires you to pay mortgage insurance unless or until you refinance later.

(Shortform note: As of 2022, FHA applicants can qualify for a 3.5% down payment if they have steady income, proof of employment, a credit score of 580 or higher, and a debt-to-income ratio under 43%.)

**Veterans Affairs (VA) loan** : This loan requires no down payment and no mortgage insurance. However, VA loans are only available to active or former military members, and Greene says that listing agents often avoid them because they come with stricter guidelines that make it harder to close a sale.

(Shortform note: Among other advantages, VA loans often have lower interest rates and lower closing costs than conventional loans. On the other hand, VA loans prohibit waiving certain contingencies and require buyers to pay a funding fee, which generally ranges from 1.4 to 3.6% of the loan amount.)

#### Renting and Refinancing vs. Flipping

Greene writes that **refinancing in BRRRR is comparable to selling in a house flip** (when investors buy fixer-uppers, rehab them, and then sell the properties for profit): In either scenario, this is the stage when the investor recoups their investment in the property.

Although house flippers get bigger one-time payouts from home sales, Greene explains why he prefers the steady income from his portfolio of rental properties. First, **home sales are subject to high capital gains taxes, whereas refinances aren’t taxed** and the cash flow from rentals is taxed at a lower rate. Additionally, refinances are simpler and involve only the investor and the lender, whereas home sales also involve real estate agents, brokers, title and escrow companies, and others—all of whom charge fees.

(Shortform note: From a wider lens, the main difference between these two approaches is that building a rental portfolio creates steady _passive_ income, while flipping houses requires more active work to consistently buy, renovate, and sell properties.)

### Step 5: Repeat

Because you recover your investment during the refinance stage, BRRRR is uniquely designed to make it easier to repeat the process than other investment methods. Greene writes that repetition brings two primary benefits.

First, **repetition builds the volume of your portfolio of rental properties, which increases your cash flow.** As we mentioned earlier, you can also reduce your proportionate costs by negotiating discounts from members of your Dream Team in exchange for the volume of business you bring them.

(Shortform note: As with other forms of investment, experts recommend diversifying your real estate portfolio. You can do this by buying properties in different areas, buying different types of properties (such as single- and multifamily homes), and branching out into real estate investment trusts and real estate mutual funds.)

The second benefit is that **repetition allows you to learn from mistakes and develop systems that make your business more effective and efficient.** Systems allow more of your business processes to run on autopilot, which gives you the capacity to take on more investment opportunities that would otherwise overextend you.

(Shortform note: In _Traction_ , Gino Wickman lists three steps to systematizing your business: 1) Identify the key processes for every major activity in your business, 2) list the most important steps for each process, and 3) make it clear that you expect everyone involved to follow these processes.)

#### Systems Require Delegation

Greene emphasizes that **creating systems requires you to delegate or automate the tasks that you dislike and those that don’t play to your strengths.** He cites the Pareto principle, or the 80/20 rule, and recommends focusing your time and energy on the 20% of tasks that you do best and delegating the rest.

The first key to effective delegation is clear communication: Be explicit about what you want and expect to avoid misunderstandings, which waste time and effort. Use checklists, spreadsheets, written instructions, and other means to clarify and standardize processes.

The second key is to consistently delegate to the same people, which allows them to benefit from the repetition by learning from their mistakes and improving their efficiency. If you don’t have the financial means to pay your delegates, Greene suggests finding people who benefit from the experience, the working relationship with you, or your industry knowledge.

(Shortform note: In _Who Not How_ , Dan Sullivan and Benjamin Hardy argue that entrepreneurs must delegate tasks to the “experts” on their teams because failing to do so hurts their business. First, an expert will complete a task more quickly because they have the skills and they enjoy the task. Second, if you do something you don’t enjoy instead of delegating it, you’ll do a poorer job, potentially wasting the time of anyone who’s relying on you to be _their_ expert. Third, making decisions and completing tasks cost energy, so reducing your load improves the quality of each decision and task you handle.)
