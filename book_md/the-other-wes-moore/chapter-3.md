## Chapter 3: 1987

### Wes Moore

Like any inner-city community, drugs were a part of life. In the Bronx, marijuana, heroin, and cocaine had been around for decades. But crack was a different beast.

The introduction of crack changed the drug game. Crack was more available and more addictive than other drugs. It was cheap and easier to produce. And the high demand for the drug created more volatile competition and more violence among the street gangs. It also created a need for more manpower. Many of the boys Moore new from the neighborhood were getting recruited.****

But Joy was going to see to it that her children didn’t become casualties of the streets. Joy would make sure her children were given every opportunity to make something good of their lives. For Moore and Shani, that meant private school.

#### The Importance of Education

**Joy knew that her kids would not be suitably educated in public schools.** She’d attended Bronx public schools as a child, and Moore’s grandmother had taught in one for twenty-six years. During the period of deterioration in the community, the schools had not been spared. There were few resources, and almost half of the student body did not make it to graduation.**** Even if they did, they were still light years behind in knowledge and skills.

Joy had heard of Riverdale Country School as a young girl. The stories made it seem like a fantasy school—a sort of non-magic Hogwarts for wealthy kids. The school sat on a lush acreage along the Hudson River and boasted prestigious alumni, such as John F. Kennedy.

**Riverdale provided a safe and advantageous environment** , and Joy saw it as the place where Moore could get the experiences he needed to change his life. In reality, the school changed Moore’s life in ways none could have predicted.

#### A Comrade in Arms

**Moore stood out as one of a handful of black students at Riverdale.** **Another was a boy named Justin.** Justin lived close to Moore’s neighborhood, and the two hung out together almost daily. They had a crew of other boys from their neighborhood they hung out with, but all of those boys went to public school.

School affiliation was a big deal in the neighborhood. Different schools carried different statuses, or street cred, and by association, a person also was given that status. A white school like Riverdale was not part of the hierarchy and, in fact, had the result of marking a kid from the hood who went there an outsider.

Whenever Moore was questioned about going to the white school, he’d try to change the subject. When that failed, he’d pretend the other students were intimidated by him.

#### Getting Stuck in the Middle

Going to Riverdale was like walking into a different reality for Moore. The dichotomy wore heavily on him. Whenever he was on campus, seeing the beauty and opulence, he felt lost and guilty. He knew his mother struggled to keep his enrollment active, and he felt like an outsider among the privileged students.

**Moore did everything he could to hide how poor he was.** He only had three outfits that were good enough for school, and he created a schedule by which to rotate them to hide the fact. At a certain point, he started borrowing some of Nikki’s more gender-neutral clothing for variety. When the other kids talked about where they would “summer,” Moore tried to make up a vacation home in Brooklyn.

Moore always hung out with Riverdale students on their turf, never his. But one day, he tried to bring the two worlds together.

Joy’s younger brother, Howard, was back in the Bronx after dropping out of medical school. To try to help his nephew, he organized a baseball game to bridge the gap in Moore’s two worlds. Moore was excited about introducing his friends from home to his friends from school.

Things didn’t go according to plan. When one of the wealthy kids from Riverdale taunted a boy from Moore’s crew, a fight broke out. They’d only been on the field for fifteen minutes. Over the next four innings, two more fights would occur. Finally, **Moore realized there was no way to bring his worlds together**.

#### Falling Through the Cracks

**Moore felt like he was becoming too uppity for his neighborhood crew and was too street for his schoolmates.** He suffered emotionally, feeling self-conscious in both scenarios. His grades began to diminish, and his personal standards for success plummeted. He was getting mostly Ds and Cs, with the pleasant surprise of a B every now and then. He was in third grade, but he was reading at a level a grade below him. He was on his way to fulfilling the future that statistics predicted for poor kids reading below their age group: prison.****

In contrast, Justin was a model student. He cautioned Moore that he was going to be put on probation or kicked out if he didn’t turn things around, but Moore only had excuses for his friend. Moore blamed the long ride to school, his father’s death, his mother’s stress, anything he could think of. But in front of Justin, who lived farther out and whose family was worse off, there was no one to blame but himself.

**Not even his mother’s threats of sending him to military school could whip him into shape.** He knew she was bluffing. She wouldn’t send her only son away when she had no husband. Moore believed there was no way military school was a viable option and did nothing to change.

### The Other Wes Moore

For the fourth time in Wes’s life, Mary moved them to a new neighborhood. **Dundee Village was only ten minutes from his old home but miles away from the atmosphere of the streets.** For one thing, Dundee Village was located in Baltimore County, a separate jurisdiction that encloses Baltimore City like a horseshoe.

The neighborhoods were nicer and more spacious, with yards, trees, and flowers, and the quality of life and opportunities were greater. Wes’s neighborhood differed from his old one in demographics, as well. Where Baltimore City was made up of almost all blacks, Dundee Village was home to people of various races and backgrounds.

Part of what motivated Mary to move to Dundee Village was the first of three times Tony was shot in his life. Tony was still heavily ingrained in the drug culture. He’d moved up from foot soldier to crew leader and was considered a veteran at eighteen.

Another part was Wes’s poor performance in school. **Wes had failed the sixth grade.** Mary’s hope that the move would be enough to turn things around for Wes was high, but he couldn’t muster the same enthusiasm. Wes wasn’t fazed by Tony’s troubles. He still idolized his older brother.

What did concern Wes was his image. He wore secondhand clothes and old shoes. He didn’t mind as much when he was in Dundee Village, but when he went back to his old neighborhood, he felt ashamed of his attire. Tony always had new gear and the latest fashion, as did others raking in the spoils of the drug enterprise. Wes was desperate for the same.****

#### Starting His Career

**Wes knew the only way to get the cool threads he wanted was to find a way to make money.** One Saturday afternoon, when he was strolling through a nearby neighborhood, he found a solution.

Wes came upon an older boy standing on a corner wearing headphones. There was a microphone attached that hung in front of the kid’s mouth. The kid was also wearing a flashy diamond ring. Wes was enthralled. He questioned the boy about where he could get a similar headset. The response was music to Wes’s ears: if he wanted a headset, he just had to agree to hang out on the corner for a few hours and call out cop sightings. At the end of his shift, he’d be given a small stipend.

Dollar signs flashed before Wes’s eyes. He couldn’t believe how easy it sounded. Wear a headset, inform on the cops, and get paid? He could afford the fancy shoes and clothes Tony wore, and it wouldn’t require an education or a degree. Making money would free his life up from the constricting responsibilities of a maturing boy.

Wes understood the game. **He would essentially be a lookout for drug dealers, but he rationalized that he wasn’t actually selling drugs or involved in the deal**. He dismissed Tony’s warnings about the difficulty in escaping that life once you were in it. He didn’t think about all of the dangers that came with the game. He just wanted an easier way of life.

#### Knowledge Is Power

**Wes had learned a valuable lesson about the relationship between drugs and money** a few months before meeting the boy on the street. He and Woody planned to skip school one afternoon and throw a barbeque at his house. The boys were meeting up as soon as Mary left for work to buy party supplies.

Mary had a jar full of change in her closet from which Wes frequently pilfered. On that morning, he went searching for party funds and stumbled upon a bag of marijuana Mary had hidden in the closet. **Wes had never seen drugs up close before.** He’d also never tried drugs before. But the marijuana would be an excellent addition to his afternoon plans, so he took it.

Wes and Woody decided to cancel the barbecue and get stoned.**** They met up with friends and took the bag and a bottle of cheap malt liquor to a spot under a bridge.

The group stayed under the bridge for hours, smoking and drinking. When they stood to leave, Wes was so drunk and high, he fell over. Wes got up and hopped on his bike, feeling discombobulated and vulnerable. He was so out of it, he mistook a garbage can for an attractive girl.

Wes went straight to bed when he got home, but not before Mary’s boyfriend got a good look at him. The boyfriend told Mary what was happening when she came home, and she laughed the incident away. She was sure this experience would turn Wes off from drugs and alcohol now that he knew how bad they made him feel. But Wes was pondering a different implication for his experience.

**Never before had Wes understood the intrigue of drugs.** Now, he started to see things more clearly. Even though he had felt uneasy and overwhelmed, being high slowed life down. The act of rolling the joint, inhaling the smoke, and basking in its creamy haze made the rest of the world fall away.

**In an environment like his, escape was a hot commodity. He understood how people could become addicted to that sensation and chase it again and again.** They would spend all their money trying to achieve it, and whoever sold the drugs could make a fortune. There was plenty of money to be earned, even by someone low on the list like a lookout.

For this reason, Wes accepted a pair of headphones that day in Dundee Village. He felt more mature and excited about the future.
