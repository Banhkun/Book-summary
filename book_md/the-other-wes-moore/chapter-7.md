## Chapter 7: 1997

### Wes Moore

Moore had been playing varsity basketball for Valley Forge since his sophomore year. He was tall and good, and colleges had started to take an interest. **By Moore’s senior year, he’d become a hot prospect for college recruiters._The New York Times_** had even published an article about his successes and the expectations for his future. He’d been paraded around campus after campus and felt wanted. He’d always dreamed of playing in the NBA, and these visits strengthened his belief in his future professional success.

However, Moore’s mind soon started to turn in a different direction. He started to think maybe he wasn’t as good as he thought he was. He attended recruiting camps and tournaments and got a firsthand look at who his competition was. In the mid-90s, that competition meant players like Kobe Bryant.

Where Moore had to work hard on the court, the game came naturally to others. They were more agile, graceful, and talented. He had potential, but he was never going to reach the level of skill and swagger these other players had. **His Uncle Howard had always told him to have a backup plan, so Moore turned his focus to becoming known for more than just basketball.**

#### A New Path Forward

**Moore had become more academically minded throughout high school.** He attributes some of this to Joy. She saw how much he loved basketball but hated reading, so she bought him _Fab Five_ , a book that details the historic national championship runs of the Michigan basketball recruiting class from 1991 to 1993.

Moore finished the book in two days. He was riveted by their journey and hip hop swagger. He learned that books were a way to enter different worlds and others’ lives. He started reading everything he could, including classic and contemporary fiction he’d avoided in the past.

One book, in particular, influenced his shift in life goals. **Colin Powell’s memoir,_My American Journey_ , spoke to Moore in a way no other book had.** Powell was a Bronx native, and he spoke of his struggles with discrimination and civil rights as a young man and soldier. Powell believed in the military, in which black Americans had more freedom than at home. He saw how the military helped spawn progress at a national level, and he was grateful for the way the Army helped him learn to love his country.

Powell’s book spoke to Moore’s experiences. Moore wanted to rise above the stereotypes held about young black men, especially those from urban environments. Like Powell, he also sought a path to something greater than himself. Moore wasn’t foolish enough to believe he could overcome the tenets of racism in America. But **Powell had shown him a different perspective of race and opportunity, and Moore began to think about his life differently.**

#### Defying Expectations

When Moore thought about who’d been the most influential people in his life, he realized that, besides his family, all were military men. **These men had taught him the value of public service, the importance of history, and the difficult nature of leadership.** They taught him to respect integrity, strength, and the significance of hard work.

In the Bronx, the impermanence of life**** created apathy or resentment in many people. But the military had given him another way to look at the fleeting nature of life. The impermanence of life highlighted the importance of making each day count. **Moore knew that life was precious, and he wanted his to have meaning.**

Basketball was not his future. He decided to enroll in Valley Forge’s junior college and work his way up to a leadership role in the U.S. Army. After high school, Moore was promoted to regimental commander for the 70th Corps of Cadets. This position made him the highest-ranking cadet and responsible for training more than seven hundred cadets in the program. He was eighteen years old.

### The Other Wes Moore

In 1997, **Wes, now twenty-one, was the father of four children**. His first and second were with Alicia, born a year apart. His third and fourth were with an older woman named Cheryl, who he’d known from Dundee Village. Wes had tried to ignore Cheryl’s growing drug problem since before their children were born.**** But when he found her passed out and drooling from heroin one night, he knew he’d been wrong.

Wes couldn’t help but compare Cheryl to the other junkies who wandered the streets and sold anything and everything to score their drug of choice. It disturbed him to realize that he was responsible for keeping them that way. He left the house, heading anywhere that wasn’t home.

**Wes was fed up with his way of life.** He was sick of getting arrested, sick of contributing to the destruction of other’s lives, and sick of watching his community be destroyed. He wandered the streets, where the manifestations of his frustrations existed all around him. After walking for hours, he turned down the street where his friend Levy lived.

Levy had recently gotten out of the drug game and was trying to go straight. Wes was confused by his decision at first. With so much money coming in, how could you walk away? But that day, he started to understand. Levy was happy to see Wes and invited him in. Wes sat in the living room, tired and exasperated, and told Levy he wanted out. He wanted to change his life.

#### A Second Chance

**Wes’s desire to change his life became more than a pipe dream that day with Levy.** Levy had recently been accepted into the Job Corps program. Job Corps was a federal program that started in 1964 to help underserved youth enter the workforce. Levy had also dropped out of high school, but Job Corps had a GED program, and he was planning on earning his diploma.

Job Corps was nothing new to Wes. One of his aunts had joined but dropped out. But **Wes was skeptical about joining Job Corps because of the time away from his family**. With his kids, their mothers, and his own mother to look out for, leaving didn’t seem viable. Wes looked at the Devil tattoo on his arm. The symbol was meant as an affront to God. What sort of God would allow people to live like those in his community? This was who Wes was, but he wondered who he could become.

#### Taking the Plunge

**Two weeks after that day in Levy’s house, Wes and Levy boarded a bus to the Job Corps campus.** The ride was only thirty minutes long, which meant Wes could return home every weekend to look after his family.

The campus was beautiful. It reminded Wes of what he imagined a real college campus might look like. The room he and Levy shared was huge. Wes was glad he’d trusted Levy.

Wes took a test to determine what level of GED instruction he needed. He scored well, almost at the top of the class, and received his GED a month later. He also found out he could read at a college-sophomore level. **These results gave Wes a different perspective of who he was and what he was capable of.** He placed his diploma in a frame and hung it in his home.

As he had in the drug game, Wes rose to leadership status quickly in Job Corps. Other students sought him out for advice on life, help with their studies, or friendly companionship. Once he was finished with the academic portion, Wes signed on for training as a carpenter.

#### Finding His Niche

Wes was used to using tools. He’d often been tasked with fixing things around the house or repairing part of the structure. He’d enjoyed the steady nature of the work and appreciated the finished product. **Carpentry was tangible joy, and he was excited to learn how to do it properly.**

Wes’s class was tasked with deciding on something each student wanted to build. Wes’s mind immediately turned to his children, in particular, his five-year-old daughter. He’d missed most of her life and wanted to provide for her and keep her safe. He decided he wanted to build her a house.

Over the seven-month course, Wes worked on his daughter’s house. He cut, sanded, and shaped each board. He fastened them together with nails. He made shutters for the windows and a workable door. The final product was a beautiful five-foot-tall structure.

**Working on the house was one of the best experiences Wes had ever had.** He worked hard, felt strong, and found faith in himself. The house was a symbol of everything he was working toward in the program and his life.

On the day Wes graduated from Job Corps, he was excited but scared. He had excelled in the program, but it was a safe, controlled environment. **He’d be on his own now in the real world.** **Whether he could really change or not would be put to the test.**

#### The Straight and Narrow

Wes’s first legitimate job was working for a private home in Baltimore County as a landscaper. The position was only for five months, and when that time was up, he started renovating homes in need of rehab in the city. That work was also temporary. His next job was working food prep at a Baltimore mall.

**Wes had been out of the Job Corps for a year and had yet to find a permanent position or one that paid more than nine dollars an hour.** He worked ten-hour days and still barely had enough to care for his children properly. He was also tired after work and found it hard to have energy to spend time with his family.

But he’d been successful in changing his life. He hadn’t been to his old stomping grounds since he’d started working. But one day, after finishing a shift at the mall, he returned to West Baltimore to pick up a package. When he saw his old neighborhood, he saw how little things had changed during his own transformation. Crews were still on the corners, and addicts were still looking to score. The only difference was a slew of new faces.

During his job training, all the worries and problems of his old life had melted away.**Now that he was back, he realized he had bigger worries and problems to deal with.** Wes went home to his apartment, where he lived alone. His children were living with Alicia and his mother, both of whom needed more money than he could offer. He sat at the kitchen table and felt the world weighing down on him. He banged his fists against his skull and blinked back tears.

After a moment, he opened the package he’d picked up moments before. Like riding a bike, he grabbed a pot and boiled water. He pulled baking soda out of the fridge and poured it into the water. He opened the bag of cocaine and added nine ounces to the pot.
