## Chapter 2: 1984

### Wes Moore

**Moore’s life was turned upside down after his father died.** Joy struggled to keep life going for her family. She was haunted by all of the things she could have done and should have done to save her husband’s life.

Joy took legal actions against the hospital, settling out of court to avoid years of legal proceedings. With the money, she created a foundation to help train paramedics to save others afflicted with the virus that killed Westley. His life could have been saved by a few easy procedures, but the first responders didn’t have the knowledge.

Still, her grief was too immense, and she realized she needed help. **She packed up her home and children and moved them to the Bronx** **to live with her parents.**

#### Different Location, Same Game

Moore was happy to see his grandparents. They were regular fixtures in his life and spoiled their grandchildren. His grandfather was a retired minister and grandmother a retired schoolteacher. They’d always intended to return to Jamaica after retirement, but that plan was abandoned when they saw how much Joy needed them.

Joy had no idea how much the Bronx had changed when she regaled Moore and his sisters with stories about the close-knit and safe community she’d grown up in. But on their drive to the family’s three-bedroom home, Joy grew nervous when she took in the burned-out buildings, a memorial shrine dedicated to a young girl, and a drug deal involving a child on a street corner a few blocks from her parents’ home. **Moore’s grandparents told them about the drugs and violence that had taken over the streets.** The introduction of crack had made everything worse, and people were scared and felt helpless.

Moore was governed more strictly in his grandparent’s home than he had been in Baltimore. He and his sisters had to be home as soon as the streetlights came on. And all chores had to be completed before they were allowed to play.

#### Finding His Niche

It wasn’t long before Moore found a community of friends in his new home. One day, he was granted permission to walk to the basketball courts five blocks away. He dribbled his ball, practicing his crossover dribble and savoring the time outside.

**Moore found salvation that day on the Bronx basketball court.** After waiting on the sidelines, he was called in to play. He played his best, and despite not winning or succeeding against the older, bigger kids, he was opened to a new world.

Pick-up games are common in many urban environments. People, old and young, unemployed or professional, gang-affiliated or straight, came together on the neutral territory of a basketball court. Moore picked up the style and language quickly, growing in both skill and personality among this newfound brotherhood. **Moore had found his tribe.**

### The Other Wes Moore

Despite the six-year age difference between Tony and Wes, the two had a close relationship. **Wes looked up to his older brother, and Tony felt a fierce protective instinct for Wes.** Mary had started working full-time at Bayview Medical Center, and Tony looked after eight-year-old Wes during the day. But Tony’s presence had started to diminish, and Wes was often unsupervised.

Tony’s father lived in the Murphy Homes, also known in the community as the Murder Homes. They were the worst projects in Baltimore—rundown, with poorly lit hallways, grotesque conditions, and a menacing gang presence. Most of the residents lived in fear of the boys and young men who ran the drug trade and carried guns in and around the complex. Tony was one of those boys.

#### A Role Model for Wes

**By age ten, Tony was already involved in drug deals.** By 1984, at fourteen, he was a notorious gangster. He was thin and boyish, but his eyes stopped people in their tracks. Tony had what was known as the “ice grill,” a cold, fierce, and hostile gaze that made the receiver tremble.

Despite his gangster lifestyle, Tony was like any other young boy growing up in poverty. He was sad, angry, insecure, and struggling to understand who he was and what he could be. He didn’t have anyone who believed in him, so he didn’t believe he could do more with his life. But Wes didn’t have to follow his path. Tony wanted to be the person who had faith in Wes. He showed Wes love and support and did everything he could to make sure Wes felt it.

**Tony hammered home the importance of school in Wes’s life** and the need to make something of himself. He knew he was being hypocritical, but he didn’t care. If Tony had another chance at life, he would do things differently. At least he could use his experiences to save Wes from falling into the same trap.

Despite Tony’s efforts to save Wes, his advice would eventually be Wes’s undoing. Part of Tony’s attempts included making sure Wes knew how to protect himself. Tony knew all too well the struggles Wes would have to face growing up in their neighborhood, so **he taught Wes how to fight back and “send a message” to anyone who disrespected him**.****

Part of this training included throwing Wes into make-shift fight clubs at Murphy Homes. Tony taught Wes to strike back with intensity**** so the offender would never step to him the wrong way again. Wes, admiring his brother’s strength, internalized these lessons.

#### Boys Will Be Boys

Mary moved many times during Wes’s childhood to try to put distance between their lives and gang activity. One of these moves was to a nicer neighborhood of black professionals called Northwood.

**After moving to Northwood, Wes met Woody, a boy he would be friends with for the rest of his life.** Woody was from a home with two parents who both worked. His father was a Vietnam veteran and former sergeant in the Army. Wes loved going to Woody’s house not only for the father’s war stories, but also to experience a world that included a father.

Wes and Woody played football for the Northwood Rams, a well-known and nationally respected recreational football team. Wes was athletic and thrived on the field. He loved playing football and cherished his jersey as a symbol of camaraderie and strength.

Wes had thrown himself so completely into football that his schoolwork started to suffer. Despite being bright and feeling smarter than the rest of his class, he barely scored high enough to make it to the next grade. The constant switching of schools and his quiet manner allowed him to float under the radar. **No one noticed that Wes wasn’t learning anything.**

One morning, Woody came over early to toss the ball around in the streets. Other kids came out to join their game, and things seemed fine for a while. Wes was aggressively guarding a boy who was smaller and weaker than he was. He pushed and shoved the boy around so much, the boy finally reached his limit and confronted Wes. The two argued until the smaller boy punched Wes in the face. It was the first time Wes had been punched like that. His lip was broken and bleeding, and blood dripped onto his favorite jersey. Wes formed fists at his side, but instead of attacking the boy, he ran home.

#### Laying the First Stone

Of all the advice Tony had given Wes, the only thing he ever listened to was “send a message.”**** As Wes ran from the fight and entered his house, this advice echoed in his mind.

**Woody followed Wes and found him in the kitchen with one hand holding a towel against his bleeding lip and the other holding a knife.** Woody tried to talk his friend down, even blocking Wes’s way out of the kitchen, but Wes would not be deterred.

What neither knew was that neighbors, witnessing the fight, had called the police. Two cop cars pulled up and cornered the boys still in the street. Woody became distracted by the red and blue flashing lights and didn’t see Wes slip by him.

Once outside, Wes didn’t see the police or their flashing lights. All he saw was rage and the boy who had caused it. Wes was angry, confused, hurt, and scared. He screamed and charged at the boy, ignoring the commands of the officers to drop the weapon.

An officer grabbed Wes and threw him down face first on the hood of the police car. Wes pleaded with the officers that he wasn’t the one who started the fight, but it did no good. The officer placed handcuffs around his wrists.

**Wes was taken to the police station and booked.** He used his phone call to call Tony, and Tony’s father picked him up. Wes was back at the house before Mary was done with work. She wouldn’t find out that her eight-year-old son had been arrested for years.
