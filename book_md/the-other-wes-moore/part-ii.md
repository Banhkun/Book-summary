## Part II: Hindsight

### Scenes from Prison

**Moore had been visiting Wes for a few years by Wes’s thirty-second birthday.** When Moore arrived for a birthday visit, something about the beautiful sunny day and the reality of aging in prison struck him. He became aware of how lucky he was to be a free man.**** Against the odds, he’d taken a path that allowed him to live in the world and feel the warm sun on his skin.

By now, Moore and Wes were close and spoke honestly about their lives. This day was no different. When Moore sat down, **Wes asked him when he’d first felt like a man.** Moore answered that he grew into a man when he realized his accountability to others. However, he wasn’t sure that this was true.

What Moore thought was closer to the truth was an involuntary shift of paradigm. His childhood hadn’t ceased as much as the events of his life had dictated greater responsibility. His wasn’t a gradual move into adulthood, like some boys experience. His was a jarring thrust into adult situations, and for boys like him and Wes, they are either forced to sink or swim.

Wes agreed that accountability to others was hard. Sometimes, you do the wrong thing so you can take care of other people. Often, you only get one chance to make a mistake. Even if there is a second chance, sometimes it’s not possible to make a different choice.

Moore didn’t understand. When he asked for clarity, Wes stated that both of them had made some big mistakes in their childhoods. Both had opportunities to try again and do better. Wes said the difference was contextual. **If the circumstances surrounding the first mistake are exactly the same, sometimes a second chance is just another chance to fail.**
