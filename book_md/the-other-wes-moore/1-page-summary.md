## 1-Page Summary

### Two Men, One Name

**In 2000, the _Baltimore Sun_ ran a number of articles about Wes Moore.** One of the articles celebrated the outstanding achievement of twenty-two-year-old Wes Moore (Moore) from Baltimore City and the Bronx in being named the first black Johns Hopkins student to receive the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. The other articles concerned twenty-four-year-old Wes Moore (Wes), another black man from Baltimore City, for his part in the robbery of a jewelery store and ensuing murder of the store’s security guard. The guard was also an off-duty police officer and father of five small children.

Moore left for Oxford University in England, where he earned a master’s degree in international finance. Wes was convicted on a number of charges stemming from the robbery and murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Despite the soaring trajectory his life was taking, Moore found it hard to distance himself from a question forming in his mind since reading the news of the other Wes Moore. He questioned how two men with the same name and from similar neighborhoods could have taken such different paths. Moore decided he needed more information. **He wrote a letter to Wes in prison, beginning a correspondence and eventual face-to-face relationship with the inmate.**

_The Other Wes Moore_ is a compilation of hours of conversations between Moore and Wes and interviews with family and friends regarding the timeline of events and aspects of the two men’s lives.

#### Choices and Consequences

**Both Moore and Wes grew up without fathers.** Following Moore’s father’s untimely death when Moore was three, his mother, Joy, struggled to overcome her grief. After two years of raising three children alone, she decided to move her family to her childhood home in the Bronx to live with her parents.

Joy did her best to provide Moore with every opportunity to improve his life and get on the path to success. She enrolled him in a predominantly white private school north of the burrough and set strict rules for his social activities. The Bronx had slipped into a severe state of drug- and gang-related violence since her youth, and the streets were no place for a young black boy.

Despite Joy’s efforts, Moore was apathetic about life. He felt caught in the tug-of-war between his black community in the inner-city and the affluent white community at school. He became self-conscious, lethargic, and truant. Eventually, he was suspended from school and almost arrested for vandalism. **These events prompted Joy to enroll Moore in military school at the age of twelve.**

Wes’s childhood was different. His father was absentee. The two had only ever been in the same room three times in Wes’s life. His mother, Mary, raised Wes and his older half-brother Tony on her own, attending college part-time to fulfill her dream of earning a college degree. But federal funding supporting Mary’s tuition was canceled, and she went to work full-time.

With Mary out of the house often and Tony embroiled in the drug trade he’d entered as a young boy, Wes was left to his own devices. He lacked guidance and emotional support and had a quick temper that was not addressed. His decision-making skills were poor, leading to a number of ill-advised behaviors that had lasting effects.

For instance, when a boy punched him at eight years old, his anger and embarrassment made him go after the boy with a kitchen knife and earn his first stint in handcuffs. He was apathetic about school, but no one noticed or intervened. He started working for a drug dealer without considering the implications so he could earn money for flashy clothes. And when Wes was fifteen, he impregnated his girlfriend, then shot at the cousin of a different girl he was seeing after the cousin beat Wes up. **These incidents led Wes further down a difficult path and gave him a lengthy rap sheet.**

#### Role Models and Expectations

Moore’s parents and grandparents tried to instill good values in him, but his continued spiral into reckless and lazy behavior made them fear for his future. They hoped enrolling him in military school would do the trick, and it did.

**Moore gained valuable lessons about discipline and responsibility from his commanders at school.** His Uncle Howard also stepped in as a surrogate father. He steered Moore in positive directions and tried to help Moore make sense of his life. Later, Moore received guidance from counselors and city officials, all with the purpose of opening opportunities to him.

The care and support from these individuals made Moore realize how much people cared about his success, and in turn, he started to care, too. People wanted him to succeed, and he worked to meet those expectations.

However, Wes’s only role model was Tony. Tony did his best to keep Wes from falling into the gang life he was wrapped up in, but Wes never heeded Tony’s advice. He looked up to his brother and envied his independence and growing income. **The more Tony pushed Wes away from a life of crime, the more Wes followed in his brother’s footsteps.**

There was no one else in Wes’s life who set expectations for him. And even if they did, such as his Aunt Nicey, who tried to force Wes to either get an education or a job, there was no follow-up to ensure his success. Wes was free to take the easy and increasingly problematic routes.

#### Divergent Lives

From rocky beginnings, Moore was able to turn his life around. He became a decorated officer in the Army, a successful student, a Rhodes scholar, White House Fellow, and businessman. Although he was originally forced down this better path, **little successes allowed Moore to become more confident and have more faith in his abilities**. He credits his family and the important mentors in his life for helping him see that he could be more than his environment dictated.

By contrast, Wes’s rocky beginnings sent him down a path of darkness. **Wes’s record and lack of education made it difficult for him to find work.** He’d also fathered four children by the time he was twenty.

At some point, Wes wanted out of the life of drugs and crime. He enrolled in a job-training program and earned his GED. However, living the straight life was more difficult than Wes had imagined. He struggled to find permanent work and earned a minimal salary for the jobs he did find. With a large family to support, Wes struggled to make ends meet and sank into despair. He wandered back into his old life, which placed him back on the path of crime. After participating in a robbery and murder, Wes landed behind bars for good.

#### What It All Means

Moore has tried to parse the trajectories of both his life and Wes’s to find the factor that made the difference. He is the first one to admit he hasn’t found it yet. **What Moore does believe is that young people need strong mentors in their lives.** The tendency to focus only on what is right in front of them is strong in young people. What made the difference for him were all the people who steered him to look for more than that. They helped him see that being black and poor, not having a father, and living in underserved and crime-ridden communities didn’t dictate what kind of future he could have. They allowed him to understand what freedom meant.

At the end of the day, Moore knows everyone has choices, and the choices you make are yours alone, even if the circumstances and influences are negative. **Moore makes no allowances or excuses for Wes’s choices. But he also can’t discount the impact of positive influence in his.** The solution, perhaps, is support. Society cannot predict who will make the right choices, but society should ensure that each young person, regardless of economic or demographic considerations, is provided the tools and resources needed to see all the options before they choose.
