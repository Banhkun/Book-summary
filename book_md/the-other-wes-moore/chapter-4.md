## Chapter 4: 1990

### Wes Moore

**Moore had more advantages than most kids in his neighborhood, but he never appreciated them.** He didn’t take life seriously, and his arrogance and aloofness cost him.

Moore’s performance in school continued to deteriorate at such a rate, his teachers were convinced he had a learning disability. Joy was starting to believe them. She couldn’t think of another explanation for her son’s poor grades and seeming inability to retain information.

**One day, Joy learned that Moore’s inability to learn was not the problem.** She heard Moore singing along to a new hip-hop song on the car radio, reciting every word verbatim. Joy had already traversed the first four stages of grief over Moore’s behavior, moving through denial, anger, and bargaining before becoming stuck in depression. But after hearing her son’s flawless rapping, depression swiftly changed to anger.

Moore was more apt to remember the words to hip-hop songs not simply because he loved hip-hop, but because hip-hop was essential to figuring out his life. Hip-hop had moved from a black cultural secret to a national obsession. Moore, like many blacks in inner-city communities, found a voice in the hard anthems of artists like NWA and Public Enemy. The lyrics expressed what life was like in the hood and the emotions of its residents. The songs brought a sense of understanding and unity to blacks and showed the rest of the world how they lived and survived. This latter aspect made Moore more approachable at Riverdale.

Still, a focus on hip-hop instead of school wasn’t at the core of Moore’s poor educational performance. **Moore was skipping school as often as he was attending.**

#### Who’s Gonna Know?

Because of Joy’s multiple job responsibilities, she was often not at home. Moore’s grandparents were always around, but they were old and wore down easily. **Moore and his sisters were tasked to look out for each other** , which they did, but they were also children dealing with their own interests and issues.

With almost no supervision, **Moore was able to devise a strategy for skipping school without punishment.** Attendance was recorded in homeroom each day. Moore had a young and inexperienced homeroom teacher and took advantage of her. He tormented her by goofing off in class until she became so frustrated, she didn’t want him around. A sort of mutual understanding was developed between them. He wouldn’t show up and disrupt her class, and she would turn a blind eye to his absences.

A few days a week, Moore would walk toward school and wait until his grandma drove away. Then, he’d meet up with other truant students and hang out until it was time to be picked up. Although Shani was dropped off with him, she was always loyal and never told.

#### Running Wild

After leaving the basketball courts one day, Moore ran into Shea, a friend from the neighborhood. **Shea was also eleven years old, but he’d become entwined in the predominant neighborhood business: drugs.** He worked as a “runner,” a low-level position within the drug hierarchy that transported packages from place to place for the dealers. Boys like Shea were less likely to raise suspicions by law enforcement.

Moore and Shea had lost touch since Shea had started working, so the two hung out in front of a local billiards lounge taking in the graffiti on the wall. “Tagging,” or spray-painting a personal moniker on city walls, had become popular. Even Moore had a moniker: “KK” for Kid Kupid. He fancied himself a Romeo with the ladies.

Shea took off his backpack and revealed cans of spray paint inside. Shea asked Moore if he wanted to tag, and Moore jumped at the chance. The two scanned the area for cops, then went to work. **Spraying their tags on the wall only took seven seconds, but it was enough time for a police car to drive by.**

The two boys ran in opposite directions, but it didn’t matter. They were rounded up in seconds. Moore was thrown against the hood of the car and searched. Shea was face first on the ground down the block having the same done to him. Both boys were handcuffed and placed in the back of the cruiser.

Whereas an incident like Moore was involved in would once have been deemed a youthful prank, with the surge of crime and drug-activity, **the implications of a black youth breaking the law were more significant**. To compound things, Moore was caught with a drug runner. He was frightened of the consequences he might have to face.

#### A Second Chance

Sitting in the back of the car, **Moore worried about what his arrest would do to his mother and their relationship**. Despite his lackadaisical approach to life, Moore very much wanted Joy to be proud of him and for their relationship to be strong.

Moore was also considering what his fate would be. He and his neighborhood crew had seen their friends and others get tangled up with the law and either abused, killed, or sent to juvenile detention.

Shea advised Moore to play dumb, but Moore thought this plan was idiotic. The cops had Shea’s backpack with the evidence inside. Therefore, when one of the cops asked them what they were doing, Shea stuck to his plan, but Moore started to apologize, desperately trying to mitigate the consequences. His eyes were filled with tears, while Shea stared straight ahead, defiant.

Moore realized how foolish he’d been. **He’d willingly put himself in a situation where the cops could legally take control of his future** , all for a silly tag.

After another long moment, the cops pulled both boys out of the vehicle and uncuffed them. As one cop was releasing Moore, he leaned in and whispered to Moore that he hoped Moore realized how stupid he’d been and how likely it was that he would find himself arrested again if he didn’t change. Moore said he understood and was set free. He knew he’d been lucky and swore to stay out of trouble. **The next week, Moore was up to his old tricks again, and the tag KK was painted on another city wall.**

### The Other Wes Moore

**Wes was too immature to understand the implications of the new life he was leading as part of the drug trade.** But Tony wasn’t. Tony towered over Wes in the front yard, questioning Wes about the mountain of new and expensive Nike sneakers Wes had amassed in his room. Tony knew how much each pair of shoes cost, and the math didn’t add up to anything good that Wes could be up to.

Wes stood in front of his brother, avoiding eye contact. He did his best to sound convincing when he told Tony he’d become a popular DJ and made some extra cash working parties. The story had been good enough to fool Mary, but Tony wasn’t buying it.

Rage pulsed through Tony’s body. He repeated his warnings about getting mixed up in the drug game, the same ones he’d delivered a million times before. He pounced on Wes and punched him over and over, perhaps trying to release his helpless frustration or beat some sense into Wes. When Mary heard the scuffle, she intervened.

**Tony aired his frustrations about Wes’s obvious entry into the world that had trapped Tony, but Mary defended Wes.** She touted the same flimsy DJ story in support. Tony switched his anger to Mary, questioning how she could be so blind. Mary was caught in the middle. One son was a lost cause and one son might still be able to be saved.**** Wes needed her support more than Tony did, so she chose Wes.

#### The Loss of an Idol

**Wes was hurt and confused by Tony’s reaction.** He understood why Tony always warned him against the business, but he also thought Tony was exaggerating. If that life was as bad as Tony said, Tony would have done something to change by now. Tony never talked about solutions or other ways to live except education, and school was a low priority for Wes. He was making money and doing something with his life, the same way Tony had done. How could his brother not see that?

Defeated, tired of being a broken record, and tired of being the only person who seemed to care about Wes’s future, Tony shut down. **He** **told Wes he was finished trying to save him.** He turned and stalked off. It was the last time he would ever talk to Wes about drugs again.

Wes felt rejected by the one person he looked up to. He had lost his guide. But he was fourteen. He wasn’t a child anymore. He could go it alone from now on.

#### The Reckoning

For Mary, the events of that day had a different effect. They triggered a suspicion she was no longer able to ignore.

The day after Tony’s visit, Mary searched Wes’s room while he was at school. She silently prayed she would find evidence to support Wes’s DJing story. **What she found instead were two shoeboxes full of drugs** , including pills, cocaine, marijuana, and crack.

The truth of Wes’s lie hit Mary hard. She sat lost, not knowing what to do. After a moment, she took the boxes into the bathroom and flushed Wes’s supply down the drain.

When Wes came home from school, his heart dropped at the sight of the boxes on top of his bed. His mom knew what he was up to. He was busted. But his fear was quickly replaced with anxiety when he took the lids off and saw the vacancy inside.

All thoughts about how his mother would punish him or how he would explain his way out of trouble vanished. **His focus became on how much he’d lost of other people’s drug stash and** **how much he now owed people who didn’t like to lose money**.

He confronted Mary, asking her if she had any idea what sort of trouble she’d just created for him. He owed $4,000 to drug dealers, he said. The only thing that could have shocked him more than his predicament was Mary’s reaction.

Mary admonished Wes for lying to her. But more than that, **she was livid that he’d brought drugs into the house and put the entire family in jeopardy**. She told Wes he was never to bring drugs into the house or sell drugs again.

Wes walked out of Mary’s room reeling. He had to come up with a plan. Making the money back was relatively easy. As long as there were drugs to sell, there would be people to buy them. He just had to get a new supply and turn it around quickly. He would also need to find another place to hide it.
