## Part 1: The Man of the House

### Scenes from Prison

On one of their first visits together, Moore and Wes discussed growing up without a father. Moore asked Wes whether he ever thought about how different his life could have been if his father had been around. To Moore’s surprise, Wes said he didn’t. When Moore questioned the truthfulness of this sentiment, Wes told him their situations were different.

**Moore’s father had died when Moore was three years old, so he was gone through no fault of his own. Conversely, Wes’s father was gone because he wanted to be gone.** Although the result was the same, the origins were different. Therefore, they were going to mourn their fathers differently.

Wes repeated a version of Moore’s question back to Moore, wondering about the impact losing his father had on Moore’s life. Moore didn’t know what to say. All he knew was that he missed his father every day. In that moment, Moore saw the difference between their stories. He was encouraged to always remember. Wes was encouraged to forget.
