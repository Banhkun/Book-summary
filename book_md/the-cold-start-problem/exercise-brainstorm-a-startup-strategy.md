## Exercise: Brainstorm a Startup Strategy

Chen asserts that you can start a company from scratch and leverage the network effect to scale it into a threatening competitor to any established business. To prepare to do this, plan out the first few steps of your startup strategy.

* * *

The first step in building a network-based startup is to set up a stable, functioning subnetwork. To do this, you need a simple product that serves the needs of a specific niche group. What simple product could you make, and what group could you design it for? (For example, you may decide to create an app that lets runners host, discover, and register for races near them. You decide to recruit the participants of a nearby 5K race to be your first subnetwork.)

Next, you need a repeatable strategy to recruit enough subnetworks to reach the Growth Explosion. What strategy could you use to spread your product, and what groups could you spread it to? (For example, after the participants from your first race have continued to use your app and established a stable subnetwork of runners in your city, you could seek outside investors for enough money to sponsor large-scale races in other cities, encouraging new runners to join your network.)

Finally, identify your difficult-to-attract users, if you have any. How can you adapt the strategy above to appeal specifically to those users? (For example, you may identify “race hosts” as your difficult-to-attract users and decide to offer $100 to any user who wants to host a race as prize money for the winners.)
