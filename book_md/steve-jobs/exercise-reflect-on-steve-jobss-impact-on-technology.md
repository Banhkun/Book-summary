## Exercise: Reflect on Steve Jobs’s Impact on Technology

Many of Jobs’s innovations and design features have now become things we take for granted. Consider the ways that Jobs’s philosophy of design still guides the information tools you use today.

* * *

When Jobs led the team developing the Macintosh, he insisted that its graphical interface be simple and easy to use. Think of an electronic device you own today that _doesn’t_ have a point-and-click interface. Would you say that it was easy or difficult to learn? If difficult, what features would make it more intuitive?

The way many people listen to music changed after the introduction of the iPod. When you enjoy music today, do you listen to an album or a randomized playlist? If you use a playlist, how do you decide what music to include?

Jobs envisioned a future in which data and software were hosted in the Cloud. For the most part, that future is already here. How much of your personal entertainment is streamed instead of played from physical media, such as Blu-rays or CDs? How much of your personal information do you have backed up remotely instead of stored on one computer?
