## Exercise: What Can We Learn About Innovation?

One of Jobs’s key strengths was his ability to imagine the needs of the future instead of simply following the trends of today. Even if you’re not an inventor or designer, there may be ways to apply that philosophy in your daily life.

* * *

What current trend is a topic of interest in your own working life? Alternatively, what is a major present-day problem those in your profession are trying to solve?

Imagine what your job will look like if that trend is taken to its logical conclusion, or if that major problem is solved. What new trends or problems might arise as a consequence?

Now that you have imagined that future, what would be the next logical step in your field? Is there anything you could start doing now to position yourself for success?
