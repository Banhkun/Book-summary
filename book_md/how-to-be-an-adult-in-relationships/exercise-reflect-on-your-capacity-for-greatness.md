## Exercise: Reflect on Your Capacity for GREATness

Think about an _unsuccessful_ relationship you’ve had. You may not have known what the GREAT model was before reading this guide, but you probably still practiced it to some extent. In this exercise, you’ll evaluate your use of the GREAT model in that relationship and come up with a plan for using the GREAT model better in future relationships.

* * *

In your unsuccessful relationship, how did you practice Gratitude, Respect, Engagement, Affirmation, and Tenderness? List some examples for each aspect of the GREAT model.

Do you think you practiced the GREAT model well in that relationship? Why or why not?

Name a specific way that you can practice each aspect of the GREAT model with your partner in your current or next relationship.
