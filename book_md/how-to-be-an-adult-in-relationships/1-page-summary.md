## 1-Page Summary

Do you want a long-lasting, healthy, and fulfilling love? In _How to Be an Adult in Relationships, _therapist and self-help author David Richo argues that **mindfulness is the key to strong, healthy relationships**. Drawing from both Eastern philosophy and Western psychology, he explains how mindful loving can heal your psyche, help you succeed in intimate relationships, and build a better, more loving world.

This guide presents Richo’s ideas in four parts:

  * In **Part 1: What It Means to Love Mindfully,** we’ll explain what mindfulness is, why mindful loving can strengthen your relationships, and how to love mindfully.
  * In **Part 2: Becoming Someone Who Can Love Mindfully,** we’ll examine how your parents’ love shaped your adult capacity for love and how you can heal emotional wounds that hold you back from loving mindfully. 
  * In **Part 3: How Mindful Love Strengthens and Sustains Relationships,** we’ll discuss how mindful loving can stimulate psychological growth, help you navigate relationship changes, and enable you to end relationships gracefully.
  * In **Part 4: Loving Well Means Loving the World,** we’ll dive into what Richo considers the ultimate goal and benefit of learning to love mindfully: increasing your capacity for universal loving-kindness.



Throughout the guide, our commentary will explore other relationship experts’ actionable advice for loving well. We’ll also delve deeper into some of the spiritual and psychological concepts underlying Richo’s arguments.

### Part 1: What It Means to Love Mindfully

Richo’s relationship advice is rooted in the Buddhist concept of _mindfulness,_ the practice of witnessing the present without evaluating, judging, or trying to influence it. When you’re mindful, you simply notice what you’re actually experiencing right now.

He argues that the key to a healthy relationship is a mindful approach. Specifically, he suggests adopting **_mindful loving_ : the practice of seeing your partner, yourself, and your relationship as each really is in the present, without imposing your interpretations. **

(Shortform note: Mindfulness is often associated with meditation, but it encompasses much more than that. You can think of meditation as training: Buddhists believe that it gradually teaches them to live in the present moment. This process gives them the insight they’ll need to understand suffering, let go of their ego, and reach enlightenment. Western psychologists traditionally think of mindfulness as a general stress-management tool. Mindful _loving_ is a stress-management tool for relationships: Part of its benefit is that you’re just more relaxed in your relationship. As a result, you have healthier conflict and less of it.)

Richo says that practicing mindfulness benefits you in three ways: It encourages you to face reality, enables you to be emotionally resilient, and facilitates compassion. When you _love_ mindfully, these benefits can support your relationships, too. Let’s explore each.

#### Benefit #1: Mindfulness Encourages You to Face Reality

Richo argues that **mindfulness enables you to accept reality by keeping you tethered to the present.** Instead of allowing your mind to come up with interpretations of events that may or may not be accurate, mindfulness requires you to focus on the verifiable facts of a situation—what you’re actually experiencing.

(Shortform note: In _Radical Acceptance_ , Buddhist psychologist Tara Brach explains that in the Buddhist tradition, facing reality is known as clear comprehension, and it’s an important step on the path to greater enlightenment. Clear comprehension is liberating because it helps you make necessary changes to your life—you can’t _accept_ and _address_ dysfunction without first seeing the dysfunction clearly.)

##### How Facing Reality Helps Your Relationship

Richo says that a fuller understanding of reality helps you act appropriately in your relationship. You won’t perceive slights or failures where there aren’t any—and you won’t under- or overreact to them when there are. It’ll be easier to take stock of any situation, weigh your options, and make informed decisions about how to move forward in a healthy way.

For example, your partner forgets your birthday _once._ A mindful response is acceptance of the fact that they simply forgot, rather than interpreting a sign that you’re not important to them. Alternatively, if you notice your partner _repeatedly_ forgets your birthday, a mindful response is the conclusion that your birthday is not important to them, rather than an impulse to make excuses for their behavior.

(Shortform note Another way that mindfulness helps you face reality in your relationships is by _improving your emotional self-awareness._ According to psychologists, if you mindfully face your feelings as you experience them, you’ll gradually get better at identifying and coping with them. This makes it easier for you to understand and share your feelings with your partner in a way they can understand, which helps you both maintain emotional intimacy and resolve conflict.)

#### Benefit #2: Mindfulness Enables You to Be Emotionally Resilient

Richo also explains that **mindfulness teaches you that you’re strong enough to handle _all_ of your feelings, perceptions, and experiences, **no matter how uncomfortable they may be.

(Shortform note: Psychologists explain that mindfulness increases your emotional resilience by teaching you how to tolerate discomfort. As you pay attention to reality from moment to moment, you may have some negative feelings—maybe you’re feeling anxious because you had a bad day or you have some lingering pain from an old injury. There may be little you can do to _stop_ those sensations right now, but at least you can wholeheartedly accept them as part of your present reality. When you let yourself fully experience uncomfortable emotions, you stop resisting those emotions, which makes accepting, processing, and moving on from them easier.)

##### How Emotional Resilience Helps Your Relationship

Since you’ll feel confident that you can endure pain and discomfort, you’ll feel comfortable being yourself and letting your partner be herself—even if that means you might sometimes be at odds with each other.

**Emotional resilience prepares you to accept and deal with this interpersonal conflict head-on, rather than denying or avoiding it.** Richo says that proactively addressing conflict helps you resolve it more easily, which strengthens your relationship.

(Shortform note: Relationship experts note that conflict avoidance can actually lead to greater conflict and less intimacy over time. When you suppress negative emotions instead of addressing them with your partner, those feelings will only get bigger and eventually build up to resentment. Eventually, you’re likely to explode, and your response will probably be harsher than necessary—this can negatively impact your connection with your partner, making intimacy harder.)

#### Benefit #3: Mindfulness Facilitates Compassionate Validation

Richo explains that **mindfulness encourages you to assume a compassionate view of reality** —when you see things as they really are, you’ll discover two things:

  1. Every living being is irrevocably divine, fundamentally good, and capable of both loving and being loved.
  2. The universe itself is compassionate, since it generously provides you (and all other forms of life) with everything you need to survive—and often even more than that.



When you adopt the view that all life has _inherent_ lovability, you’ll be able to feel compassion for others—even if you disagree with them, are upset with them, or simply can’t relate to them.

(Shortform note: Many spiritual and secular philosophies generally follow tenets similar to those of inherent lovability and a compassionate universe. For example, according to the Law of Attraction, positive energy flows from the universe into your life when you _think_ positively. In short, these tenets reflect the basic idea that when you believe that the universe is compassionate and has good things in store for you, you mirror that compassion in your life and relationships.)

##### How Compassion Helps Your Relationship

Since mindfulness helps you feel more compassionate, it can lead you to _behave_ more compassionately toward your partner—even when it’s difficult**. Compassionate validation happens when you mindfully accept your loved one’s present reality** , no matter what it is, and make them feel like it’s OK to have that experience. For example, if your partner loses a parent, you might compassionately validate their grief by recognizing that they’re in pain, letting them talk about their feelings, expressing empathy, and showing them kindness.

Richo says that according to psychological research, **compassionate validation is the most important ingredient in a healthy relationship because it makes you feel secure, connected, and loved enough to be emotionally vulnerable.**

> **The Six Levels of Compassionate Validation**
> 
> Psychologists agree that compassionate validation supports healthy relationships, and it seems to be most effective when you tailor it to suit your partner’s specific situation. According to psychologist Marsha Linehan, there are six types of validation you can use to support your partner.
> 
>   * **Level 1 is presence** —when you’re there for someone when they need you. For example, you might be present for a friend by listening while they process a breakup.
> 
>   * **Level 2 is accurate reflection** —when you repeat back what you’ve heard. For example, you might say, “I hear that you’re feeling frustrated with me” during a conflict.
> 
>   * **Level 3 is guessing** —when you notice your loved one’s behavior and guess what they’re feeling. For example, if someone is pacing, you might ask if they’re feeling anxious.
> 
>   * **Level 4 is understanding** —when your loved one’s behavior makes sense to you because you know them well. For example, if your partner has a difficult relationship with their parents, you might understand why they’re hesitant to introduce you to them.
> 
>   * **Level 5 is normalizing** —recognizing that anyone would feel the same way in similar circumstances. For example, you might normalize your child’s grief after their first pet dies by telling them everyone feels sad when they lose someone they love.
> 
>   * **Level 6 is “radical genuineness”** —when you deeply empathize with your loved one as equals because you can authentically relate. For example, this might occur when you relate to someone because you share significant experiences like trauma or grief.

#### To Love Well, Be GREAT to Your Loved Ones

Richo says that **mindful love has five key aspects that can be applied in _all_ kinds of relationships**: attention, acceptance, appreciation, affection, and allowing. We’ll call this the GREAT model—Gratitude, Respect, Engagement, Affirmation, and Tenderness—to help you remember that these practices are key to a _great_ relationship.

Let’s look at each of these practices in further detail:

##### Gratitude

**When you show gratitude for your loved one, you make them feel that they’re valuable, you like them, and you’re glad they exist.** For example, if you appreciate that your child is kind, you might tell them that you feel lucky to know such a kind person. Richo says that gratitude is an important aspect of loving relationships because it helps the recipient feel worthy of being loved.

(Shortform note: Some experts say that it’s best to express gratitude by acknowledging your partner’s traits, not just their actions, and verbalizing how much they’ve helped you _._ For example, if your partner makes dinner for you when you’re sick, you might say, “Thank you for cooking—you’re so caring! It allowed me to rest, which I really need right now.”)

##### Respect

**When you show _respect_ for someone, you support their intrinsic right to live freely rather than trying to exert control over them.** For example, if your partner adheres to a different faith than you do, you respect their religious practice, even if you disagree with the principles of their religion. Richo argues that respect is important because it encourages your loved one to show up in the relationship as their true self.

(Shortform note: According to experts, some concrete ways to show respect for a loved one include being honest with them, taking care not to cross their boundaries, taking responsibility for your actions when you make mistakes in your relationship, and respecting their right to privacy—for example, by not going through their text messages.)

##### Engagement

**When you engage with someone, you show sincere interest in them**. For example, you might engage with your friend by listening to them talk about something they’re excited about. Richo says that engagement is important because it helps your loved one feel like they matter to you.

(Shortform note: According to some researchers, healthy engagement is one of the best predictors of romantic relationship success. Partners make simple, regular “bids” for engagement with one another—for example, you might tell your partner, “Look at that pretty tree!” These bids are requests that your partner pay attention to you and what matters to you at the moment. If you and your partner freely fulfill these requests, you’ll have greater emotional intimacy—and, studies suggest your relationship could last longer.)

##### Affirmation

**When you affirm someone, you let them know that you welcome their true nature: their strengths, weaknesses, flaws, and talents.** For example, you might affirm your partner by telling them they’re a great cook if they make you a delicious dinner. According to Richo, one reason affirmation is important is that it makes your loved one feel that you understand who they _really_ are.

(Shortform note: In _The 5 Love Languages, _Gary Chapman explains that some people feel _most_ loved when they hear words of affirmation—compliments, encouragement, and other kind remarks. Even if affirmation isn’t your partner’s _strongest_ love language, you can still make sure it has the desired effect by following Chapman’s advice to give affirmation that’s sincere and said in a kind tone of voice.)

##### Tenderness

**When you show someone tenderness, you display feelings of devotion and care for them.** For example, you might show your partner tenderness by making a point to tell them you love them every day. Richo explains that tenderness supports healthy relationships by making both physical and emotional intimacy possible.

(Shortform note: In _The 5 Love Languages, _Chapman explains why tenderness increases intimacy: It makes your partner feel physically safe, relaxed, and connected with you. He goes on to suggest that one way romantic partners can express tenderness is through physical touch, for example in the form of hugging, holding hands, kissing, massaging, or having sex.)

### Part 2: Becoming Someone Who Can Love Mindfully

Even if you know _how_ to love mindfully, Richo says, you’ll need to do some inner work to become someone who _can_ love mindfully—an emotionally mature person. In this section, we’ll explain how your parents’ love shaped your ability to love mindfully—and how to emotionally mature by healing any childhood wounds you may have sustained. Finally, we’ll explore how emotional maturity prepares you to approach romantic relationships in a healthy way.

#### Your Parents’ Love Shaped Your Capacity for Mindful Love

According to Richo, **the love you received from your parents as a child set the stage for your adult love life.** If your parents always loved you mindfully, then you’re set to become an emotionally mature adult: someone who knows how to give and receive mindful love. On the other hand, if your parents ever made you feel hurt or underloved, you sustained childhood wounds that can hold you back from becoming emotionally mature.

Richo explains that these childhood wounds can __ interfere with your ability to love mindfully in adulthood in three ways: You accept inadequate love, you expect your partner to fill a parental role, and/or you’re afraid of intimacy.

> **How Secure Attachment Forms—Or Gets Damaged**
> 
> The ability to love mindfully is more commonly recognized as a _secure attachment style: you find it relatively easy to trust, share, and connect with your partner._ According to attachment theorists, secure attachment develops when your parents make you feel like they’re reliably there for you by meeting most of your physical and emotional needs.
> 
> However, secure attachment isn’t _all_ about how your parents loved you—your attachment style can change over time, as you have life experiences that impact the way you relate to people. For example, a toxic relationship can damage your sense of trust in partners, even if you had a secure attachment to your parents. Likewise, a loving partner might help you gain a sense of relationship security that your parents never gave you.

##### Consequence #1: You Accept Inadequate Love

**First, if your parents gave you inadequate love, you’re conditioned to accept inadequate love in adulthood, too.** Richo says that you have physical memories of what love felt like in your body during childhood, and as an adult, you seek out partners who inspire the same feelings.

For example, if your parents often made you feel insecure about their love for you by frequently withdrawing from you emotionally, you’ll seek a partner who makes you feel insecure or forces you to chase or earn their attention. Or, if your parents often made you feel disappointed—for example, by promising to spend time with you but going to the bar instead—you’ll perceive constant disappointment as “normal” in a romantic partnership.

(Shortform note: The tendency to accept inadequate love, or worse, is difficult to overcome, but it doesn’t have to be permanent: While it’s true that people who were abused as children are more likely to be victims of abuse as adults, it’s possible to end this cycle of abuse with the help of a therapist. Therapy can empower you to have healthier relationships going forward by teaching you what healthy relationships look like, improving your self-esteem and self-advocacy skills, and helping you heal from any previous relational trauma.)

##### Consequence #2: You Want Your Partner to Fill a Parental Role

**Second, Richo says that when your childhood cravings for love go unfulfilled, you may grow up to seek out partners who you think will make up for your parents’ shortcomings.** For example, if your parents didn’t engage with you enough, you might find yourself attracted to a person who pays you a lot of attention—maybe even too much.

According to Richo, this can lead to codependency—an over-reliance on your partner to fulfill too many of your needs. Codependency can put undue stress on your relationship: Your partner _can’t_ live up to your expectations or meet all your needs—that is _your_ responsibility in adulthood. When your needs inevitably go unfulfilled, you may feel angry and create conflict with your partner.

(Shortform note: According to psychologists, parent-child dynamics between partners are unhealthy because they lead to _resentment_. If you’re in the parent role, you may feel that your partner is incompetent and take on most of the responsibility in your relationship. As a result, you might come to resent your partner for not doing their fair share. If you’re in the child role, you inevitably give up some of your autonomy—for example, if your partner buys all your clothes, you won’t have as much of a say in what you wear. As a result, you might come to resent your partner for being too controlling.)

##### Consequence #3: You’re Afraid of Intimacy

Third, **a lack of mindful love in your childhood can leave you feeling fearful of intimacy in adulthood.** Since your parents’ love caused you pain, you might be afraid that romantic love will have the same effect. Richo explains that a fear of intimacy usually takes one of two forms: attachment or distance:

  * You might get **too attached** to your partner if your parents were absent in major ways during your childhood—even if it was for a necessary reason, like having to take frequent business trips. According to Richo, overattachment makes you cling to your partner because you’re afraid you can’t handle the potential end of the relationship. 
  * You might be **too distant** from your partner if your parents mistreated or abused you—you might now associate intimacy with being dominated, hurt, or exploited. As a result, you might be afraid that the relationship will limit your freedom and security, and you might pull away from your partner. 



> **Your Attachment Style Determines How You Cope With Intimacy Fears**
> 
> Recall that secure attachment is what enables you to feel reliably safe and connected enough for intimate relationships. If you don’t have a secure attachment style, then you have an _insecure_ attachment style: You’re fearful of intimacy because your previous relationships taught you that you _can’t_ trust your loved ones to reliably be there for you.
> 
> Insecure attachment is fairly common, but it can be difficult to recognize because it comes in different forms. Psychologists generally suggest that there are three insecure attachment styles, which cope with fear of intimacy in different ways.
> 
>   * If you distance yourself from your partner, you likely have an avoidant attachment style. You may feel uncomfortable being emotionally vulnerable, need extra personal space, and prioritize your independence over a committed relationship.
> 
>   * If you get too attached to your partner, you likely have an ambivalent attachment style. You may struggle with feelings of insecurity and jealousy, have a hard time maintaining healthy relationship boundaries, and prioritize your relationship to the point of neglecting other major parts of your life.
> 
>   * If you often find yourself sabotaging or ending your relationships prematurely, you may have a disorganized attachment style.__ As a result of childhood trauma or abuse, people with a disorganized attachment style _crave yet repel intimacy_ because they’re deeply afraid that intimacy inevitably leads to serious harm. They may pursue relationships but behave erratically and withdraw to avoid the possibility of getting hurt.

#### How to Heal Your Childhood Wounds and Grow Emotionally

**Richo says that you can overcome your childhood wounds and reach emotional maturity by learning to mindfully love _yourself._** Loving yourself leads to maturity because it gives you a strong sense of self-worth and a sense of responsibility for meeting your own needs.****(Shortform note: This process—giving yourself the love your parents couldn’t—is commonly known as _reparenting yourself._ Reparenting yourself involves, essentially, treating yourself like a parent _should_ treat their child: keeping them safe, loved, and equipped with the skills and support they need to thrive. As you take care of this “inner child,” you’ll heal her wounds—and will stop repeating unhealthy patterns and behaviors that stemmed from an impulse to soothe your inner child’s pain. Instead, you’ll start to make rational, adult decisions that are _good_ for you.)

Richo suggests three key self-love practices that can help you mature: _recognizing your inherent lovability, setting healthy boundaries with others,_ and _compassionately validating yourself._

##### Self-Love Practice #1: Recognize Your Inherent Lovability

Recall that Richo says that all living things— _including you—_ are inherently lovable. **According to Richo, it’s important to see yourself as inherently lovable because this helps you _treat_ yourself with love. **You’ll be more inclined to take good care of yourself—for example, by speaking to yourself kindly—and less inclined to accept unloving treatment from anyone, yourself included.

(Shortform note: In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach explains that most people find it hard to access their inherent lovability because they feel ashamed and guilty about past mistakes. She recommends moving past these barriers with _self-forgiveness: the practice of welcoming your own feelings, acknowledging the good parts of yourself, and moving forward with greater compassion_. This process teaches you that your mistakes don’t make you a bad person—you’re still capable of goodness and love, so you’re still inherently lovable.)

##### Self-Love Practice #2: Set Healthy Boundaries With Others

While it was your parents’ job to keep you safe as a child, in adulthood that responsibility is yours alone. Richo says that to protect yourself from physical and emotional harm, **you have to learn to set healthy boundaries.** Boundaries are the expectations you have about the kinds of behavior you will and won’t tolerate from others. For example, if you’re monogamous, you might not be comfortable with your partner flirting with other people.

Before you can be ready for a relationship, you should have a general sense of what your boundaries are and feel capable of enforcing them.

(Shortform note: In _Set Boundaries, Find Peace, _Nedra Glover Tawwab says that setting boundaries is a three-step process: First, identify your standards for how people should treat you physically and socially. Then, clearly communicate your boundaries during uncomfortable situations. Finally, reinforce your boundaries by restating them when they’re violated and setting consequences for repeat offenses.)

##### Self-Love Practice #3: Compassionately Validate Yourself

Richo’s third practice for reaching emotional maturity is**facing your childhood wounds with compassionate validation: Acknowledge the ways you were hurt and underloved in childhood, and lovingly address your own pain.** This process shows you that your parents’ inability to love you well was not your fault—that in fact, you deserve and are capable of receiving love from those who __ know how to love well, including yourself. As a result, your sense of self-worth _and_ your self-efficacy—your ability to meet your own needs and advocate for yourself—increase.

Ricoh says there are four essential steps to processing your childhood wounds with compassionate validation:

  1. Remember the painful things that have happened to you. 
  2. Fully feel the complicated emotions, like sorrow and fear, that accompanied those experiences.
  3. Be grateful that your childhood wounds made you resilient.
  4. Forgive those who hurt you and extend compassion to others who are in pain. 



> **Tips From Trauma Experts on Healing Your Childhood Wounds**
> 
> Healing from your childhood wounds can be a long, complicated, and painful process, especially if your wounds are severe and extensive. To help you make the most of Richo’s advice for healing, we’ve compiled advice from trauma experts that you can apply to each step of the process:
> 
> 1) You can avoid getting bogged down by difficult feelings, which can lead to depression, by giving yourself some extra TLC and accepting care from others as you heal. Psychologists recommend talking to your loved ones about your feelings, taking good care of yourself physically, and connecting with those with similar experiences by joining support groups or reading others’ stories of grief and healing.
> 
> 2) You do have to remember your own pain in order to heal—but with severe trauma, it’s also necessary to have others witness and respond compassionately to your pain. If you experienced childhood trauma, you may want to seek out a therapist who can help you process your memories without getting overwhelmed.
> 
> 3) If you had traumatic childhood experiences, you might be afraid of feeling your feelings. If that’s the case, grounding exercises, which help you feel safe and connected to your present reality, may help you overcome that fear.
> 
> 4) Although Richo says you should be grateful that your wounds made you resilient, some psychologists argue that trauma doesn’t actually build resilience—it undermines it. Instead of attributing your resilience to trauma, try taking a more proactive approach to increasing it by working on your mental health and establishing support systems for yourself.
> 
> 5) Richo says you should forgive those who hurt you because forgiveness and love for your adversaries are important ideas in the Buddhist tradition, but some psychologists note that forgiveness requires working through the issue with the person who hurt you, which isn’t always possible. If you can’t forgive, that’s OK—you can still move on by processing your feelings and giving yourself time to heal.

#### The Mature Approach to Choosing the Right Partner

According to Richo,**once you’ve emotionally matured and learned to love yourself, you’ll be ready for a healthy relationship.** You’ll only want what’s good for you—so you’ll take time to consider whether a new relationship would be healthy before you commit to it. As a result, you’ll have stronger relationships from the get-go.

To take an emotionally mature approach to determining whether a potential partner is right for you, Richo recommends you take into account three factors:

**1) Compatibility:** Determine whether you and your love interest have compatible values and life goals.

(Shortform note: In most long-term relationships, compatibility shifts over time for two reasons: First, you’re both putting your best foot forward in the early stages, so you might not notice some incompatibilities right away. Second, people change—and so do their values and goals. According to some experts, relationships thrive when couples stay committed to loving each other despite changes in compatibility—so a compatible level of _commitment_ may be the most important thing to be on the lookout for.)

**2) Availability:** Determine whether you and your love interest have the capacity for trust, intimacy, and commitment, and whether you’re located near enough to each other to sustain a relationship in person.

(Shortform note: In long-distance relationships, it can be hard to maintain trust, communication, and intimacy; but that doesn’t mean long-distance relationships are destined to fail. Usually, it just takes some extra work to ensure both partners feel securely connected to each other.)

**3) Maturity:** Determine whether you and your love interest are emotionally mature or willing to work on maturing together—if either of you are in the throes of addiction, mentally ill, violent, or desperate for a relationship to complete you, Richo says you should prioritize resolving those issues before you start dating.

(Shortform note: You may feel like you need to have _all_ your issues figured out before you can have a healthy relationship, but that’s not the case. According to researchers, most people develop the relationship skills they need during the course of their relationships by practicing with their partners and giving each other room to grow.)

### Part 3: How Mindful Love Strengthens and Sustains Relationships

Once you have the emotional maturity to _be_ a good partner and _find_ a good partner, Richo says, **you’ll create relationships that are not only strong but also continue to help you heal and mature**.

In this section, we’ll discuss how mindfully loving relationships encourage you to grow and become more secure. Then, we’ll explore how mindful loving helps you navigate the changes that occur naturally over the course of a relationship.

#### Mindfully Loving Relationships Encourage You to Grow

Richo says that **mindfully loving relationships encourage psychological growth in three ways:** They provide the opportunity to process your issues, make compassionate validation possible, and improve your self-esteem.

##### Growth Factor #1: Relationships Provide Opportunities for Processing

**Mindfully loving relationships are a space where you can explore and overcome the consequences of your childhood wounds**. Richo explains that during the course of a relationship, you and your partner will inevitably trigger old memories of emotional pain. When this happens between two mindful adults, you can healthily address the conflict _and_ the inner turmoil that has followed you from childhood into adulthood.

For example, if your partner snaps at you because the house is a mess, you might be upset—not just because your partner snapped at you, but also because it reminds you of all the times your parents snapped at you as a kid. If you’re both mindfully loving, you can process and work through it: You tell your partner how it makes you feel when they snap at you, and they validate your feelings. Then, together, you figure out healthier ways to deal with conflict in the future.

(Shortform note: When your partner triggers your childhood wounds, you may experience intense negative emotions and the impulse to lash out. Since lashing out can damage your relationship, learning how to better cope with triggers benefits you _and_ your partner. One thing psychologists recommend when you’re triggered is to ask your partner to give you some space so you can process your feelings and figure out a rational approach to the conflict.)

##### Growth Factor #2: Relationships Provide Compassionate Support

Richo says that in addition to helping you work through your childhood wounds, **your partner can support you through your _adult_ wounds.** For example, if you feel hurt after the end of a friendship, your partner might invite you to express that pain and make an effort to show you some extra affection when you need it. Compassionate validation from your partner ensures that you don’t feel alone and overwhelmed in your pain—instead, you feel connected and supported, which makes pain more tolerable.

(Shortform note: Compassionate support doesn’t just reduce emotional pain—it has a positive physical effect, too. Research demonstrates that emotional support from a romantic partner can help you tolerate pain better, make you feel less stressed, and influence you to make healthier choices for yourself. So, in the long run, receiving compassionate support from your partner can help you live longer.)

##### Growth Factor #3: Relationships Improve Your Self-Esteem

**Intimate relationships also improve your self-esteem** because when someone shows a romantic interest in you, it proves to you that you’re lovable. And, as the relationship deepens, you reveal your flaws and weaknesses, and you continue receiving your partner’s love, you’ll affirm that you’re worthy of love regardless of your imperfections.

(Shortform note: Partners, friends, and other loved ones _boost_ your self-esteem by opening your eyes to your own good qualities with praise, encouragement, or acceptance of who you are. These boosts can help assuage your insecurities, but ultimately, your self-esteem comes down to how _you_ feel about _yourself_. So, while your mindfully loving partner should contribute to your self-esteem to some extent, it’s important that you work on accepting yourself regardless of what others think of you.)

#### Mindful Loving Helps Your Relationship Withstand Change

In addition to supporting your healthy changes, mindful loving helps you _withstand_ changes. Richo argues that all successful relationships happen in three phases—the honeymoon phase, the discordant phase, and the devotion phase. **Mindful loving enables you to navigate and transition between these phases and transition between them in a way that makes your relationship stronger.**

(Shortform note: Richo claims that there are three phases, but other experts say there could be as many as four or five if you count your initial attraction to each other and the peaceful period between the honeymoon and discordant phases. Across these different formulations, however, the general trend of the relationship is the same: You meet, fall in blissful love, gradually get to know each other better as you overcome conflict together, and maintain a steady commitment.)

##### Mindful Loving in the Honeymoon Phase

**In the honeymoon phase, romance is at a high and you express mindful love easily.** You act like the best version of yourself, and so does your partner, so you’re both swept away by the illusion that your partner is perfect or nearly perfect. As a result, it’s easy for you and your partner to practice Gratitude, Respect, Engagement, Attention, and Tenderness (GREAT) with each other and affirm one another’s inherent lovability. This helps you build a mutually loving foundation upon which the rest of the relationship can rest.

(Shortform note: Neuroscientists say that the high you experience during the honeymoon stage is caused by physiological changes in your brain. You’re so enthralled by your partner that just looking at or thinking about them activates the chemicals in your brain responsible for desire, connection, and euphoric feelings. That’s why it’s so easy to practice the GREAT model with each other in this stage—these neurochemicals make you feel good, so you’re motivated to keep being intimate with your partner.)

##### Mindful Loving in the Discordant Phase

Richo says that **you and your partner will inevitably leave the honeymoon stage and enter the discordant phase** when you begin to have conflict with each other.**** In this stage, you’ll see each other as flawed for the first time.

According to Richo, **conflict can be resolved more easily and strengthen your relationship if you approach it in a mindfully loving way** : as an opportunity to get to know and accept each other more fully.

(Shortform note: The mindfully loving approach to conflict doesn’t just strengthen your relationship—it also supports your physical health. Studies show that if conflict happens too often or for too long in your relationship, it may lead to chronic stress. Stress can make you sick—it lowers your immunity to illnesses, causes inactive health issues to flare up, and can result in chronic pains like frequent headaches. In contrast, couples who resolve conflict in a healthy, timely way are healthier in the long run.)

**To resolve conflicts in a mindfully loving way, Rico says you have to put your ego aside and focus on cooperating with your partner instead of on winning the argument.** More specifically, you and your partner should listen to and validate each other’s feelings about the conflict, practicing each of the five components of the GREAT model all the while.

For example, say that your partner is upset with you because they feel like they do more of the household chores than you. To practice the GREAT model in this situation, you could:

  * Engage with them by giving them your full attention while you talk about the issue.
  * Express gratitude, thanking them for everything they do around the house.
  * Express tenderness by giving them a hug while you thank them.
  * Affirm their strengths by acknowledging how much they do around the house and how they’re so good at it.
  * Show that you respect their time, feelings, and effort by suggesting (and sticking to) a plan to more evenly share the workload.



(Shortform note: One popular strategy for mindful conflict resolution is to use “I” statements—statements that focus on your feelings rather than the other person’s actions. “I” statements allow you to express yourself without placing the blame for your feelings on your partner, which can lead to further conflict and resentment. For example, in the above scenario, your partner might say, “I feel overwhelmed by the amount of housework I do” instead of accusing you of not doing enough, which will elicit a more positive response from you.)

##### Mindful Loving in the Devotion Phase

In the devotion phase, you commit to maintaining a healthy relationship and loving each other fully—imperfections and all. According to Richo, **mindful loving is key to the devotion phase because it helps you give each other the grace you’ll need to stay together through life changes.** There will be times in each of your lives when you need to receive more love than you’re capable of giving. For example, if you become seriously ill, you’ll be more reliant on your partner’s support, and you won’t have the energy to return the same amount of support.

If you want your relationship to last, you’ll both need to keep in mind that your partner is still deserving of your love even when they’re not at their best.

(Shortform note: Grace helps you reach the devotional stage of relationships, but psychologists warn that _repeatedly_ having to give your partner grace—with no resulting change in their behavior—is a red flag of abuse, especially when their behavior harms you. Keep in mind that grace doesn’t entitle your partner to violate your boundaries. It’s a _reciprocal_ commitment to support each other through tough times and give one another room to grow.)

#### Mindful Loving Helps You End Relationships Gracefully

According to Richo, **mindful loving helps you recognize when it’s time to end a relationship.** He says that it’s time to break up when the relationship is no longer viable because the seriousness of your issues surpasses your or your partner’s ability to deal with them—continuing the relationship would hurt you or your partner.

(Shortform note: To make letting go easier for both you _and_ your ex, take mindfully loving (GREAT) actions during your breakup. For example, to show respect, break up with your ex _in person as soon as you realize it’s over_. During the breakup, you can also _engage with_ and _affirm_ your ex by having an honest conversation about both of your feelings—that way, both of you can walk away with a better understanding of the relationship and why it ended, which will help you process and grieve.)

### Part 4: Loving Well Means Loving the World

At this point, you know why mindful love is so important to strong relationships and may have started bringing GREAT aspects to your own relationships. This sets you up to strive for **_universal loving-kindness,_ the Buddhist tenet that requires compassion for all living beings**.

According to Richo, this is the ultimate goal of learning how to love mindfully. Romantic relationships teach you to honor your partner’s inherent lovability despite flaws and conflicts—he sees this as a small-scale way to practice extending compassion to _everyone._

#### Why You Should Strive for Universal Loving-Kindness

Richo says that universal loving-kindness should be your ultimate goal because it has two major life-improving benefits: It gives your life meaning and it improves society.

First, Richo says that **universal loving-kindness compels you to help others when they’re suffering, which will make your life feel more meaningful.** For example, if you see that your neighbor is struggling to afford food, you might practice universal loving-kindness by helping them buy groceries. You may not be able to solve world hunger on your own, but you can be part of the solution in small ways.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that helping others increases your sense of meaning because it strengthens your connection to others. Connection is a basic psychological need—humans are an interdependent, social species. When you help someone else, you fill an important role in their life, which reinforces that interdependence and cements your social bond with them. As a result, you have the sense that your life matters—you did something meaningful for someone, and you belong here.)

Second, **universal loving-kindness is necessary for the well-being of global society.** Because loving-kindness emphasizes our common humanity, it enables you to relate to others as equals and overcome conflict collaboratively, rather than destructively.

(Shortform note: This principle is the basis of many religions, not just Buddhism—lots of people believe in the power of love to change the world, and many religious rules and practices function to create supportive, loving communities. There’s also some scientific merit to this idea—our institutions and policies may be more effective if they’re informed by love for all humanity.)

> **Get Started With Loving-Kindness Meditation**
> 
> Even if you haven’t yet mastered the art of mindful loving, you can still improve your capacity for universal loving-kindness through loving-kindness meditation. Although this is traditionally a Buddhist practice, some psychologists recommend it for anybody who wants to feel happier, healthier, and more strongly connected to others. Here’s one way to practice it:
> 
>   * Create an intentional space by sitting quietly, relaxing your body, and focusing on your breath.
> 
>   * Imagine what perfect inner peace would feel like. Once you find that feeling, allow yourself to dwell on it—really feel the warmth, comfort, and love that inner peace entails.
> 
>   * Now, focus your attention on a loved one. Wish that they’ll have the same sense of inner peace you’re experiencing right now.
> 
>   * Continue to generate compassionate well-wishes for other people you know.
> 
>   * Then, focus your attention on people you don’t know, like global populations that are suffering, and compassionately wish the best for them, too.
