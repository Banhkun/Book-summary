## Exercise: Understand Your Prison

In Chapter 9, you learned about the way your psyche is an inner prison that you built for yourself, and you learned why you unconsciously love it. This exercise will help you to recognize your inner prison and begin to break free.

* * *

What are the “walls” of your personal prison built of? (Are they walls of fear? Hope? Despair? Pain? Self-obsession?) Name at least two or three specific walls that you recognize from your regular experience.

How can you tell when your prison’s walls are being threatened? (What kinds of people and situations confront you? What thoughts and emotions come up inside you? How do you find yourself speaking and behaving?)

In what ways do you love your inner prison and cling to it? When threats to its integrity arise, what do you find yourself thinking, saying, and doing to defend and repair it?

How would it feel if you dropped your defense tactics and simply let a threat breach the walls of your prison? Imagine it vividly, and describe your feelings here. (Tip: Afterwards, why not go the full distance and try this tactic in real life?)
