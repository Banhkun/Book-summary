## Chapter 5: Nonresistance and Unconditional Happiness

You can view the principles of opening and closing, and of falling and rising, as specific components and/or alternative expressions of a broader principle that rules your life and represents the path to your salvation. It’s actually a dual principle: nonresistance plus unconditional happiness.

This dual principle evokes one of the most important lessons you’ll ever learn: Life itself—not some exotic adventure or pursuit, but just your daily life—is the highest spiritual path. And your choice to _enjoy_ your daily life is the greatest spiritual teacher. **Life will liberate you if you know how to ask the right question and give the right answer. The question is, “Do I want to be happy?” The answer is an unconditional, “Yes!”** You give this answer by practicing total nonresistance.

### Understand Resistance

To understand nonresistance, first understand what resistance is. The thing in you that has the ability to resist life is actually the Self, your true identity. Put differently, it’s willpower, the force that you use to move your arms, legs, and thoughts. Will is the concentrated power of the Self, directed into the mental, physical, and/or emotional realms. You can misuse will to resist the flow of life.

Realize that you don’t actually resist life itself. That’s impossible. **What you resist is the _experience_ of life, the impressions life makes on you. **You assert your will to resist life’s impressions, and this creates a block in your psyche.

### Reject Resistance, Drop Unhappiness

**To find happiness, you must reject resistance.** When you identify specific areas of resistance in your life, immediately work to clear these out. The benefits will extend to the rest of your experience.

Imagine, for instance, that a childhood experience instilled a fear of dogs in you. You can work with this, learning to relax and have a new and enjoyable relationship with dogs. Then, whenever someone says or does something you don’t like, you can treat this the same way you’ve treated your fear of dogs: no resistance.

In most situations, there’s really nothing to deal with except your own desires and fears, which make everything seem complicated. Without desires and fears, life would just happen naturally, with no problems.

**Anytime you notice any part of yourself growing unhappy, drop the unhappiness like a hot coal.** For help in doing this, use any number of specific spiritual practices that seem helpful, such as affirmations or meditation. Formal meditation techniques might be especially helpful, as they’ll build the muscles of your awareness that enable you to recognize when unhappiness is trying to take root in you. Just remember that all such techniques and practices are means, not ends.

Use what you’ve learned about inner energy. Refuse to close your spiritual heart, no matter what happens. Refuse the siren call to fall into unhappiness and dysfunction. Refuse to build up new Samskaras, those knots of negative energy that you generate by resisting life. Recognize when something activates one of your existing Samskaras and tempts you to identify with a limited and distorted view of things. Remember that nothing _makes_ you close and that there’s literally nothing worth closing over. Remain alert and savvy to your mind’s attempts to convince you otherwise.

Practice what you’ve learned about recognizing your neurotic inner roommate and its voice. Your inner roommate loves melodrama, but unconditional happiness means giving that up to live in peace.

**Great areas for practicing nonresistance and dropping unhappiness include your relationships and your work.** Also remember that your real work is what’s left to do after everything else passes through you. As you practice nonresistance and unconditional happiness, you’ll discover that new talents and abilities emerge for doing this work.

### Take a Vow of Unconditional Happiness

**View your life this way: You’ve taken a _vow_ of happiness. And because of this, life will test you.** You’ll miss your flight. Somebody will put a dent in your new car. Are you going to remain faithful to your vow? It’s as simple as that.

Remember that giving an unconditional “yes” to happiness is itself the highest spiritual technique and the surest way to awakening. Practice any other techniques in service to this one.

By practicing nonresistance and dropping unhappiness, you can choose to be happy. If you place limits or conditions on your happiness—you can’t be happy if your spouse leaves you, or if your car breaks down—then that’s on you. You can’t control those things, but you can refuse to give them power over your happiness. You can remain happy no matter what, even if people starve you and put you in solitary confinement. Reflect on the examples of people throughout history, such as Gandhi, who have remained happy even in the face of persecution and deprivation.

The only rational response to life here on this planet spinning through empty space in a vast universe is to enjoy it. There’s ultimately no legitimate reason to resist life, no reason to close your heart and enable the buildup of tension that leads to unhappiness. **Imagine what you could achieve if you liberated the energy that you’ve been diverting into resisting life.**
