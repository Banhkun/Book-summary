## Chapter 2: Who You Really Are

Now that you’ve gotten to know your inner roommate, you can focus on getting to know someone even more important: your real self.

### The Master Question and Its Implications

**For attaining inner freedom, there’s a technique that’s more important than any book or mantra or holy pilgrimage. The technique is actually a question: “Who am I?”** Properly used, this “master question” will reveal your true identity.

Consider: You aren’t actually your name. Wouldn’t you still be the same person if you had been given a different name? _Who are you apart from your name?_

You aren’t actually your biography. Wouldn’t you still be the same person if you had gone to a different school or married someone else? _Who are you apart from your biography?_

At base, the master question asks you to pay attention to something you might not otherwise consider: The mystery of who sees, hears, and knows when you see, hear, and know. It asks, “Who am I really, at my core?”

### How to Ask the Question

Here are some right ways to ask the master question:

**Ask “Who am I?” about yourself in relation to the outer world.** Consider your changing physical appearance as you age, and contrast this with your sense of inward continuity. Your reflection in a mirror is different than it was when you were 10, but you still feel like the same person. _Who is it that remains constant on the inside as you age on the outside?_

**Ask “Who am I?” about yourself in relation to your inner world.** When you love, _who feels that love_? When you’re afraid, _who feels that fear_?

**Consider your ability to lose yourself in thought, and contrast this with the continuity of your pure awareness.** Descartes (“I think, therefore I am”) was wrong. You can know that you aren’t your thoughts because you can _observe_ your thoughts, and when thinking sometimes stops, you’re still here. Your consciousness still exists. _Who is the thinker separate from your thoughts?_

**Consider your ability to lose yourself as you read these very words.** Your mind can become immersed in the reading, but when you stop reading, you’re still here. _Who is the reader separate from the reading?_

**Consider the status of _you_ in relation to your dreams.** When you dream during sleep, you’re immersed in the experience, but when you wake up, you know the dream was just something that you “had.” _Who is the dreamer who experiences the dream?_

When you ask it truly and deeply, the question becomes, “Who is having all of these mental, emotional, and physical experiences right now?”

### How to Answer the Question

Having asked the question correctly, just let go of all experiences and notice what’s left: the pure experiencer. Notice that this experiencer has a certain quality: consciousness, an intuitive sense of existing. Notice that this pure experiencer can instantaneously apprehend richly complex scenes that would require a lot of time and effort for the thinking mind. Look around the room or out the window. Wordlessly receive what you see. Notice how the experiencer encompasses perceptions effortlessly.

When you understand what the master question is really asking, and when you employ it correctly, the answer eventually offers itself: **You are the one who sees. You are the witness, the one seated at the center of consciousness**. From there, you look outward at your thoughts, then further outward at your emotions, then still further outward, through your physical senses, at the external world.

You are the one “behind” your thoughts, emotions, and sensory impressions, the one who perceives them all and remains constant as they arise and pass away. You aren’t any object of experience. Instead, you’re the one who is “inside,” looking out at the world of experiences. You’re the subject that perceives all objects. This One at the center is the Judeo-Christian Soul, the Hindu Atman, the Buddhist Self.
