## Exercise: Recognize and Create a Whole New Life

The last three chapters advised you to recognize death as the greatest spiritual teacher, to follow the “middle way” of the Tao, and to recognize the divine realities that death and the Tao ultimately reveal. This final exercise invites you to dwell further on these things. And more: It invites you to begin acting on them.

* * *

Chapter 10 stated that death makes life precious, changes your priorities, changes your perspective, makes you more loving, makes you bolder, and makes you really live. When you personally dwell on the reality of death—both yours and that of others—which of these areas do you find it most strongly affects? (Does it change your priorities or perspective? Does it make you feel bolder or more loving?) How exactly does awareness of death affect you in that part of your life, and why?

Chapter 11 taught you that most people don’t live in the Tao. Instead, they “ride the pendulum” by swinging to extremes, resulting in difficult and stressful lives. Where do you see this happening in your own life? (For instance, are you too angry—or do you not allow yourself to feel healthy anger? Do you get too close to people and suffer from unhealthy codependent relationships—or do you keep yourself too distant from other people?) Describe an area of imbalance in your life.

For the area of imbalance described above, where is the Tao located? How can you follow it?

Ask yourself the question that ends Chapter 12: If God loves the world unconditionally, and God sees and knows everyone and everything from a viewpoint of eternal ecstasy, then when He looks at you, what does He see? Really reflect on this question. Articulate its personal implications for yourself and your life.

How would it affect your life overall if you fully embraced death, followed the Tao, and shared God’s perspective of ecstatic, unconditional love for the world? How would your life right now—the way you think, see, feel, talk, act, and live—change?
