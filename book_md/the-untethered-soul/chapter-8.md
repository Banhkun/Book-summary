## Chapter 8: Your Inner Addiction

In Chapter 1, you learned about your “neurotic inner roommate,” which is simply a colorful way of characterizing your psyche. A vivid way to describe your current relationship to this roommate is to say that you’re _addicted to it._ Your psyche makes constant demands, and you’ve devoted your life to meeting them.

### The Metaphor: You’re Addicted to Your Psyche

**You’re “addicted” to your psyche because you mistakenly think your psyche protects you from pain. But in fact, your psyche _is_ pain. **You need to realize that your psyche is very ill, as evidenced by its extreme sensitivity. When your physical body is healthy, you tend not to notice it. You only notice it when there’s a problem. The fact that you frequently notice your psyche because of mental-emotional pain—anger, embarrassment, anxiety—shows you just how unwell it is.

Your psyche’s illness comes from fear and resistance. In learning about nonresistance and unconditional happiness, you learned that your mind is unwell because you’ve given it the impossible job of creating a secure world by resisting life, by trying to make everyone and everything do what you want. You’ve set your psyche the task of conforming the whole world to your sensitivities.

### The Application: You Can Break the Addiction

The good news is that you can break this addiction to your psyche. You do this in the same straightforward way that you’d quit any bad habit: You just stop. Like refusing to put another cigarette in your mouth, you stop telling your mind that its job is to fix everything.

**Breaking the addiction requires you to wake up and realize that the trouble is in you, not the world. You can’t solve your inner problems by getting better at external games.** External changes won’t address the root of your inner problem. If you feel financially insecure and personally lonely, you’ll still feel that way even if your finances improve and you find the “perfect” spouse, because you’ll simply bring your inner problems into that new situation and infect it with negativity. Getting what you think you want doesn’t satisfy you. It just sets the stage for the next round of pain.

Here are some specific practices for giving up your addiction:

  * **Notice when your mind is trying to “make everything okay.” Gently let go of this.** Don’t _fight_ your mind. That only reinforces its neurotic activity.
  * Let your thinking mind quiet down by watching it from your seat of consciousness. Let thoughts just happen, even neurotic ones. When you refuse to identify with thoughts, they start to quiet down. Practice this inner observation with little things to begin with. Calmly observe your annoyance when somebody says something you don’t like. Notice the feeling, and refuse to attribute its source to the other person. Gradually expand this practice to encompass bigger things.
  * **Set up specific awareness practices throughout the day.** For example, use the daily ritual of getting into your car as a moment to stop and center. After you sit behind the wheel, pause a moment to remind yourself that you’re the witness and that you don’t have to buy into your inner roommate’s drama. Hook awareness practices to opening doors, answering your phone, and other regular activities.



#### Free and Clear

Once you’re free from your psyche’s demands, you can wake up and face each day like a vacation. You can enjoy your work and relationships effortlessly. You can fall asleep each night and let everything go. Eventually, your practice of disciplined awareness will lead to a persistently centered consciousness. Like a healthy body, your psyche will just operate naturally, without pain.
