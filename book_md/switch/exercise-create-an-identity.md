## Exercise: Create an Identity

If someone is resistant to a proposed change, find small ways to align their identity with the change.

* * *

What is the change you’re proposing? (For example, you’re trying to get your roommates to eat vegetarian.)

How might someone’s identity _misalign_ with this change? (For example, they’re not interested because they’re “meat-lovers, not bleeding heart vegans.”)

What small change-supporting action can you have them take? (For example, you ask them to do Meatless Mondays with you, and promise you’ll make dinner on those days.)

What’s a second change-supporting action you can suggest soon after, once they’ve started to adopt a vegetarian identity? (For example, you ask them to calculate how much money _three_ meatless days per week would save and suggest putting it in a “beer fund” instead.)
