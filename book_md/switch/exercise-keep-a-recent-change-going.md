## Exercise: Keep a Recent Change Going

Regular celebrations, reflections, and adjustments go a long way toward keeping a change going once you’ve gotten it started.

* * *

Describe a recent change you’ve made.

Have you seen any small change-supporting behaviors recently that can be celebrated?

In what ways is this change more comfortable now than when you started?

Reflect on the pattern of change—rational, emotional, environmental. Do you think you’re supporting each aspect enough? If not, what can you change to make sure all three aspects keep moving in the right direction?
