## Exercise: Set Up Clear Guidelines

If you’re trying to make a change, you need to specify the actions needed to get there, or you risk getting trapped by options and ambiguity.

* * *

Describe a change you’re trying to make or a goal you’re trying to reach. (For example, you want to learn a new language.)

How are having too many options or too much ambiguity holding you back from working toward this goal? (For example, you might get bogged down in thinking about whether an online or in-person course will serve you best, which concepts and vocabulary would be the best starting point, how long it will take to achieve fluency, and how to track progress.)

What are a few concrete, clear ways you could work toward making this change? (For example, join a trial period of each type of course, list the concepts you’re most interested in learning, write down what _progress_ means to you.)

Based on your last response, what are four critical goal-supporting guidelines you can put in place for yourself? (For example, do one online and one in-person class per week, learn 10 new vocabulary words per week, listen to a podcast every Saturday morning and reflect on comprehension.)
