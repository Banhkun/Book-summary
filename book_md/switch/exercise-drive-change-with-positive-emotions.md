## Exercise: Drive Change With Positive Emotions

When information isn’t enough to make people care about change, spark their interest by appealing to their emotions.

* * *

Describe a change you’d like to see—for example, in yourself, your organization, a relationship, or your community.

Who do you need to motivate? What information can you give them about why this change is necessary?

How can this information be rationalized and ignored?

What emotions do you think would spark motivation to make this change?

What experience can you set up that causes this emotional appeal?
