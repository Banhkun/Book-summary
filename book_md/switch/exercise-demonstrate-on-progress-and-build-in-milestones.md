## Exercise: Demonstrate on Progress and Build In Milestones

Make a change more motivating by reflecting on the progress that’s already been made toward the goal and building in regular opportunities for celebration.

* * *

Describe a change you’re trying to make in your organization or personal life. (For example, trying to eliminate sugary drinks from your diet.)

What progress has _already_ been made toward this goal? (A year ago, you were drinking at least three Cokes every day. Now, you’re only drinking two per day.)

How can you break the goal down into small, attainable milestones? (For example, 1) Switch to diet soda, 2) Only drink soda in the afternoon, 3) Cut down to one soda per day, 4) Switch to flavored seltzer water.)

How can you celebrate achieving each of these milestones? (For example, you treat yourself to your favorite takeout after at least one week of maintaining a milestone.)
