## Exercise: Practice Spotting Success Stories

Often, the best solution to a problem is one that’s _already working_ but may have been overlooked.

* * *

What is a problem you’re facing? (For example, “I eat too many snacks between dinner and bedtime.”)

Think of how you have already seen a successful solution to this problem, no matter how small. Describe the solution. (“I don’t snack much when I have dark chocolate in the house because it seems to satisfy my cravings right away, in a way that other snacks don’t.”)

How can you compound on or replicate this solution to solve the problem? (“I’ll stop buying snack foods and will make sure I always have a bar of chocolate on hand.)
