## Exercise: Create a Preloaded Response

Preloaded responses help ensure that you react to situations with _reflexive_ desired behaviors.

* * *

Describe a situation that usually pulls you off track from a change you’re trying to make. (For example, you want to eat fewer unhealthy snacks, but Carol always brings baked goods to the office.)

What is your _specific_ action trigger that should set off your preloaded response? (For example, “When Carol offers me a cookie…” or, “When I see baked goods in the break room…”)

What will your preloaded response to these triggers be? (For example, “I will say no, thank you” or, “I’ll go back to my desk and get a piece of gum.”)
