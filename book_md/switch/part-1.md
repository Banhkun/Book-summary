## Part 1: Rational You | Chapter 2: Find and Replicate Success Stories

Often, when we want to make changes, our rational selves focus immediately on the problems and possible solutions.**Instead, we should be seeking out success stories that can inform decisions or be emulated—essentially, look for what’s _already working_ , and do more of that. **

This exercise performs the essential function of interrupting your rational side’s analysis and reflection. While analysis and reflection _can_ be helpful in some contexts, too often they stop the process of change completely—examining one problem reveals 10 more, and it’s easy to get mired in the details. Finding a success story to emulate is what gives your rational side a clear direction to move in. Suddenly, the way forward seems obvious—“we need to do more of _that._ ”

Examining success stories helps us avoid two major issues that contribute strongly to the inability to change.

1) Our rational tendency to examine problems instead of solutions means that we’re often preoccupied with the _scale_ of the problem—therefore seeking large, complicated solutions to large, complicated problems. **However, success stories usually reveal that _effective solutions can be much smaller than the problem at hand._**

  * For example, health researchers in West Virginia wanted to get people to eat healthier. If they’d focused only on the large, vague problem of unhealthy diets, they’d have to find ways to explain balanced diets and recommended calorie intake, persuade restaurants to show nutrition information, explain the difference between “good fat” and “bad fat,” and so on. Instead, they focused on a simple success story—families who drank 1% milk consumed _far_ less saturated fat than families who drank 2% milk. This “success story” led them to their simple solution: Push advertising for 1% milk. Within months, whole families had largely solved their fat overconsumption.



2) We naturally feel defensive or argumentative toward “outsider” solutions, for two reasons:

  * First, we believe that solutions from _elsewhere_ couldn’t work in the context of _here_. For example, many Americans feel that the universal healthcare systems that many countries have couldn’t work within the context of the United States.
  * Second, we’re easily insulted by the idea that someone else knows how to solve our problems better than we do. “The _Canadians_ think they can show us how to do healthcare better? Give me a break—ours is the best in the world.”



“Insider” success stories send the message, “That _does_ work here,” and give us the satisfaction of having solved our _own_ problem.

**Now we’ll examine how seeking out success stories can be applied in the context of personal change, organizational change, and social change.**

### Personal Change: Solution-Focused Therapy

Solution-focused therapy shows how identifying exceptions to a problem can effectively drive change. This type of therapy doesn’t look into the past to analyze and unravel the sources of your problems. Instead, solution-focused therapists examine the immediate problem and its solutions through a simple series of questions.

**First, they ask “the miracle question”:** If you were to wake up tomorrow and the problem was miraculously solved, what would be the first small indication that something was different in your life?

  * Crucially, this question doesn’t ask for the miracle solution to the problem—rather, it focuses on the small, tangible indication that a solution has happened. In this way, it keeps goals small and attainable. 



**Then, they move on to “the exception question”:** When was the last time you saw a little indication of the miracle solution, for any small amount of time?

  * This question can vary, depending on the context. For a child having behavioral problems at school, it might be, “Which class do you usually behave nicely in?” For an addict, it might be, “When was the last time you were sober for an entire day?”
  * The purpose of this question is to help the patient understand that their solution is _already_ in place—they have a small success story that they can study and emulate. The therapist can help them examine the circumstances surrounding the “exception” and explore ways to recreate it. 



#### Example: The Couples Therapist

A couple approaches a therapist because they’re bickering constantly and can’t seem to get on the same page.

The therapist asks the miracle question: “If you woke up tomorrow magically back in tune with your spouse, what would the first indication be?” The wife answers, “If he brought me a coffee in the morning. I’d know that he listens when I talk about how hard it is for me to wake up.” The husband says, “If she didn’t start chatting as soon as the coffee perked her up. That would show me she’s mindful of how much I dislike talking in the morning.”

The therapist moves to the exception question: “When was the last time you really felt like you were listening to one another?” They agree on their answer. “A few weeks ago. We went to dinner and had an amazing conversation over a bottle of wine.” The therapist pushes, “Why do you think this dinner was special?” The wife replies, “For once I didn’t blow off plans to finish up work. And I felt good because he spent time with me instead of going out with his friends again.”

This conversation stops the couple from searching for the source of their communication issues or overanalyzing past disagreements—instead, successful solutions snap into focus.

  * Be more aware of each others’ subtle needs—her need to feel that she’s understood and his need to feel that she’s mindful of his feelings.
  * Commit to spending more meaningful time with each other, instead of working or going out with friends. 



### Organizational Change: Leverage “Insider” Advice

When pushing organizational change, it’s tempting to focus on underperformers and try to bring them up to speed. **Instead, look for team members who are incorporating the change exceptionally well, and use them as an example for their colleagues.** Not only does this “insider” demonstration prove that the change _is_ achievable and practical, it also saves you the time and energy you’d otherwise spend trying to explain the importance of the change.

For example, you want the managers at your company to raise the communication scores on their direct reports’ feedback forms. You check their scores in one month. One of the managers has exceptional scores, four haven’t boosted their low scores, and one has gone down slightly.

You have the successful manager explain her system:

  * She schedules a short feedback session for each of her employees every week. 
  * She holds open office hours two days a week. 
  * She dedicates the first 20 minutes of every day to walking around the office and checking in with her employees. 



You have each of the underperformers spend a day at the office with the successful manager. With a clear peer example, they see how to fit feedback sessions into their schedules, and have several clear methods to increase communication within their own teams.

Counterintuitively, success stories are often met with suspicion in many organizations. When someone performs exceptionally well, it’s assumed that they _must_ be gaming the system in some way or fudging their results. **Be careful not to fall into this thinking—success stories in your organization are an opportunity to improve, not a trick.**

### Social Change: Fighting Malnutrition in Vietnam

Social change comes with two particular challenges:

  1. As just one person, you’re unlikely to influence a wide audience—especially if you’re an outsider to the society you aim to change. 
  2. Social changes often try to address multifaceted problems that most people don’t have the resources to solve. 



**Seeking out success stories can pinpoint _local_ solutions that _don’t have to be on the same scale as the problem._**

Jerry Sternin was tasked with ending child malnutrition in Vietnam in six months, on a tight budget. He had a lot of information about the problems that _exacerbated_ malnutrition—poor sanitation, high levels of poverty, lack of clean water, and so on. However, this information was useless to him, as he didn’t have the time or the money to solve all these deep-rooted problems.

Instead, he sought out healthy children. Local mothers were tasked with weighing the children in their villages and taking note of any particularly big or strong children. **These exceptionally well-nourished children revealed that a successful solution was already in place and being used by local mothers.**

He studied the practices of the well-fed children’s mothers, considering how they were different from other mothers’. He came away with three key findings:

  1. They fed their children four times a day instead of two, spreading the same amount of food across the day. 
  2. They fed their children differently—they hand-fed smaller children instead of letting them try to do it themselves. Crucially, this ensured that their children ate even when they weren’t feeling well—a child feeling ill from malnutrition is likely to eat _less,_ not _more._
  3. They mixed their children’s rice with sweet potato greens and shrimp and crab from the rice paddies. This was unusual—shrimp and crab were seen as “adult food,” and sweet potato greens were a “low-class food” that was somewhat shameful to use. 



With these findings, he created a program where locals shared food-making duties for their villages’ children, using the recipes of the success-story mothers. **He showed mothers across Vietnam that they _already had_ the means to make their children healthier—they just had to make it standard practice. **The villagers were receptive—the solution was local, not an “outsider” idea, and was practical and sustainable within the context of the villagers’ lives. The new cooking practices stuck. Six months later, 65% of the children were better nourished.
