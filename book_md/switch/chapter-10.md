## Chapter 10: Use the Influence of Others

An interesting aspect of humans’ social nature is the way that we figure out how to behave—when you’re not sure how to react to a situation, you’ll naturally look for cues in the behavior of those around you. **This means that behavior is _contagious_ between people**. If all your friends are smokers, you’re more likely to become a smoker than if your circle consisted of mostly non-smokers.

**When pushing for change, it’s crucial that your environment sends change-supporting social signals that will prompt contagious change-supporting behaviors.**

**When you’re making personal changes,** you can increase your environment's change-supporting signals simply by surrounding yourself with people who behave the way you want to and distancing yourself from situations and people who encourage “bad” behaviors.

  * For example, if you’re trying to cut down on drinking, it makes sense to spend less time at the bar or with your drinking buddies. Instead, reach out to friends who always seem to have fun plans that don’t involve alcohol. 



**Trying to create change in others, on the other hand, can get complicated.** Most people don’t like being told what to do or who they should spend time with. Instead of dictating how people should act, focus on highlighting and multiplying change-supporting behaviors until they become prominent social signals that others will look to for guidance. There are three methods to accomplish this.

### Method 1: Publicize Good (and Bad) Behavior

Get people on board with changes by broadcasting _just how many_ people are performing change-supporting behaviors. People take this information as a social signal that indicates what they _should_ be doing—and they feel ashamed when their actions fall short of this standard.

  * For example, one hotel wanted to convince their guests to reuse their towels more than once to save water and energy. They tried putting signs in the bathrooms asking guests to reuse towels to be more eco-friendly—these signs proved useless. However, when they changed the signs to say, “The majority of guests reuse their towels at least once during their stay,” guests were _26%_ more likely to reuse their towels.



Likewise, you can broadcast _bad_ behaviors. This sparks change in people by creating discomfort—first, because they’re reminded that they’re behaving contrary to what's expected of them, and second because _everyone_ now knows they’re not doing what they should.

  * For example, an editor who wants a faster turnaround on articles can create a spreadsheet that’s shared with all writers, so everyone can see others’ progress. A lagging writer will see that everyone else is getting their work in on time and that their late work is the odd one out—they’ll quickly speed up. 



### Method 2: Give Shape to Ideas People Already Agree With

At times, your proposed change will be an idea that everyone already agrees with—you just have to attach social signals to it in order to make it a widespread practice. In these cases, it’s necessary to give the idea a concrete shape that can be publicized and incorporated into common knowledge and opinion.

#### Example: Designated Drivers

In the 1980s, the concept of choosing a _designated driver_ to safely get everyone home after drinking was popular in Scandinavian countries, but virtually unknown in the U.S. Jay Winsten, a public health professor at Harvard, wanted to see this practice adopted across the country. He knew that there wouldn’t be any pushback against the idea—the need for a safe ride home already in the back of many people’s minds, and the solution would be easy to adopt.

He gave shape to the designated driver idea by repeatedly exposing people to it. He got more than 160 TV programs’ producers and writers to write designated drivers into their scripts—by giving characters a line where they’d mention choosing a driver, adding a designated driver poster in the background of a bar scene, and so on.

  * Just three years after he launched the campaign, _90%_ of Americans knew about designated drivers, and many of them had either been one or used one themselves. Additionally, alcohol-related car crashes decreased by _6,000_ between 1988 and 1992. 



### Method 3: Get Change-Supporters Together

Cultural changes—such as in society or organizations—can be particularly difficult because they disrupt the “way things are,” which is often closely intertwined with people’s _identities._ For example:

  * People in privileged positions push back against societal calls for equality—such as feminism or the Civil Rights Movement—which they feel attack them and their values or diminish their power.
  * Ambitious, career-driven employees might measure their self-worth in terms of their productivity and late nights spent at the office. 



As one person against a deep-rooted culture, you’re not in a position of change-making power. Instead, put your efforts toward helping change-supporters find one another and cultivate a _new_ identity and culture. In doing so, they’ll feel more emboldened to speak up for change—thus sending out social signals to a larger audience, who in turn will send social signals to an _even larger_ audience.

Here’s how this could work in an office setting: Tasked with improving the work-life balance in your corporate office, you propose a four-day work week. This calls for your employees to become more collaborative and efficient. **You can help change the culture by creating opportunities or spaces where pro-change team members can validate one another.**

#### Managing Conflicting Identities

When team members feel validated in their decision to adopt a pro-change identity, they’re more confident in speaking to their colleagues about their support, and sending out influential pro-change social signals. Naturally, this may create opportunities for conflict between pro-change and anti-change team members.

It’s tempting to shut down any friction that stems from your suggestion for change—you’re trying to get everyone feeling _positively_ toward your ideas, after all. However, these conflicts can be valuable opportunities for pushing pro-change team members together.

Imagine you had a pro-change employee in conflict with an anti-change employee because the anti-change employee is constantly making snide comments about her work ethic.

  * **Scenario A:** You say, “Everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. Can you each please respect the other’s choice and leave it at that?” They keep their opinions to themselves, but eventually your pro-change employees—in the minority—feel pressured to keep up with their colleagues. Your work environment doesn’t see much of a change. 
  * **Scenario B:** You say, “Maria, perhaps you’d prefer to work with Sean (pro-change) on this project. I think you two will be better aligned in your values.” Maria and Sean regularly discuss the perks of the shorter week. The support makes them feel confident praising the new system to their colleagues, even those who are anti-change. Eventually, the pro-change identity spreads throughout the office and everyone gets on board with your four-day week.
