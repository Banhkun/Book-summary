## Exercise: Interpret an Uncertain Interaction

According to Navarro, learning to read nonverbal cues can give us a better understanding of what other people are feeling or thinking. Let’s practice applying his strategies to your own interactions.

* * *

Consider a recent interaction with someone that left you uncertain about how they felt about you or the situation. Describe the context of this interaction. Where were you? What were you talking about?

As Navarro advises, the first step of reading body cues is to establish a baseline. If you’re familiar with this person, what kind of behaviors are common for them? If they’re a stranger, how did they behave at the start of your interaction?

Think back to how they behaved throughout your interaction—Navarro suggests you focus first on the lower body. Reflect on the direction they oriented themselves, how much they moved, and whether they performed any self-comforting behaviors. Did you notice any cues indicating security or insecurity?

As your interaction went on, did you notice any gradual or rapid changes in their behavior? For example, they might have stopped gesturing with their hands or started turning their feet away.

Based on the nonverbal cues you noticed, are there two or three that all point to the same conclusion?
