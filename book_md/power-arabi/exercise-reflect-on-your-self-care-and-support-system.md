## Exercise: Reflect on Your Self-Care and Support System

Arabi’s advice for healing after narcissistic abuse—in addition to ending the relationship and seeking professional support—is to practice self-care and ensure that you have a strong support system to lean on. These recommendations may also benefit you even if you’re not currently recovering from a toxic relationship.

One form of self-care is doing safe activities that release feel-good brain chemicals like oxytocin, serotonin, adrenaline, and dopamine. Write down a few things that you know you like to do—like going for jogs, doing yoga, or snuggling with a pet. Then write down a few things that you haven’t tried before, which are more likely to give you an adrenaline and dopamine rush. These could include things like solo travel or more low-stakes activities like playing a new board game.

Another strategy for self-care is to improve your self-esteem and confidence by reciting positive affirmations, or simple statements to change your mindset. Write down an area that you’d like to work on having more confidence or self-compassion about, and then write an affirmation that you can say when you’re feeling down. For example, if you want to work on being kinder to yourself when you make a mistake, your affirmation could be, “Everybody makes mistakes. I forgive myself and learn from them.”

Think about who in your life you trust to support you through a potentially abusive situation. Write down the people you’re closest to and what types of support they’re likely to offer. For example, do you have a friend who lives nearby and could provide a safe place to stay temporarily? Do you know someone trustworthy and nonjudgmental whom you could confide in?

Now write down one way you could strengthen your support system by reaching out to someone _else_ and offering care that you feel you have the capacity to give. For example, you could call and check in with a friend or family member you haven’t heard from in a while. Or, if you know someone who’s been feeling down, you could offer to do a fun activity with them to cheer them up.
