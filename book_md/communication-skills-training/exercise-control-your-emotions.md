## Exercise: Control Your Emotions

Williams explains that a crucial part of communicating effectively is being able to control strong emotions. In this exercise, consider a past experience involving strong emotions and identify techniques you can use to handle your feelings more effectively in the future.

* * *

Think of a recent conversation where you experienced strong emotions that impacted your ability to communicate effectively. What emotion(s) did you feel, and what triggered you to feel that way? (For example, maybe you recently got annoyed at someone because you felt they were overexplaining. This led to you interrupting them, which offended them.)

When encountering the trigger you identified above in the future, what steps can you take that will make you feel calmer? (For example, you can envision yourself floating in the ocean or cuddling with your cat.)

Identify any negative assumptions that sparked your strong emotions. For each negative assumption, brainstorm a positive belief you can replace it with. (For example, if you assume the other personâ€™s over-explaining because they think you're stupid, consider that maybe they were just trying to be helpful and make sure you understood them completely.)
