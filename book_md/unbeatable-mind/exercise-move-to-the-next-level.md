## Exercise: Move to the Next Level

Right now in your life, you are primarily operating at one of Divine’s five levels of development (surviving, protecting, achieving, equalizing, or integrating). In this exercise, you’ll assess where you are now and see what it would take to push you into the next level.

* * *

First, ask yourself which level you’re at right now. What are you focused on in life? Who is included in that focus? What are you striving for the most? Which level do your focus and aim correspond to?

Next, think about what disciplines and values you may be lacking. Which ones could you incorporate further into your life, and what goal are they oriented toward?

Now, think of what steps you could take to move to that next level. Pick one discipline or value and ask how you can implement it in your daily life. What’s one change you can make that will push you toward the next level?
