## Chapter 3: The Problem With Focusing on Income

Now that we’ve covered why Sen defines development as freedom, and we’ve explained what constitutes freedom, we’ll move on to some of the practical problems of the income-focused approach Sen wants to replace.

Sen contends that **focusing on income to assess development doesn't fully reflect people's welfare or well-being** and that consideration of freedom provides a more well-rounded picture.

### Pitfalls of Income-Centered Development

Sen views income-centered development as inadequate because it overlooks aspects of welfare that people value. Here are three oversights of the income approach:

  1. Varying effects of GDP on health
  2. Social costs that persist even with income transfers to the poor
  3. The possibility that overall welfare may improve without strong GDP growth 



We will consider each of these in turn, providing examples Sen uses to support each claim.

#### 1\. When Increased Wealth Doesn’t Improve Health

Often, income alone doesn’t tell the full story of well-being. For example, Sen notes that African Americans have per capita incomes much higher than the average person living in developing countries like Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, or Jamaica. However, African Americans have lower life expectancies (a measure of well-being) than people in each of these three nations.

Therefore, the mere fact that they’re wealthier doesn’t necessarily translate to better standards of living. By focusing more on the five freedoms outlined previously, (democratic rights, commercial liberties, public provisions, ethical guardrails, safety nets), we can better understand the causes of the disparities between income and welfare.

Specifically, Sen argues that improving income alone doesn't raise life expectancy. For example, Sri Lanka and Namibia each have a GDP per capita of around $4,000. However, Sri Lankans have a life expectancy of 77 years compared to 63 years in Namibia, likely because of their health care system.

Another key contributor to life expectancy is public expenditure, specifically on health.**** Sen explains that increases in per capita GDP _are_ correlated with increased life expectancy—but only __ when that new wealth is used to eradicate poverty and improve health care.

> **Comparing GDP and Welfare**
> 
> Sen emphasizes that income statistics can be misleading because of the way income is distributed. This can lead to poor health and lower standards of living than average income might indicate. For example, as of 2020, African Americans had life expectancies of 77 years with per capita incomes of around $22,000. This is the same life expectancy of Costa Ricans—despite the fact that their per capita income is just over $12,000. In Sri Lanka, where income is below $4,000 per person, life expectancy is 80 years.

#### 2\. Income Transfers

Increasing people's income through government programs doesn't necessarily improve their well-being because it often doesn't address social problems. For example, Sen explains that many European nations, which typically have unemployment rates above 10%, generously supplement the incomes of unemployed people. But research indicates there are numerous social costs associated with being unemployed, including negative effects on physical and psychological health, as well as social ostracism.

Sen argues that European unemployment subsidies don’t increase overall well-being because they fail to account for these residual costs. **Helping the disadvantaged requires more than just subsidizing their incomes, it requires expanding their opportunities.**

(Shortform note: Research suggests that unemployment has a substantial negative effect on individual health. Sen argues many of these negative effects aren’t considered in economic metrics like GDP, nor can they be fixed through income transfers alone. Unemployed people often suffer a host of psychological impacts, like an increased risk of depression and lower levels of marital satisfaction.)

#### 3\. Social Services and Welfare

The sizable impact of the forces just discussed raises an important question for policy makers: Should countries focus first on increasing GDP as a means to eradicate poverty and prioritize health care? Or should they focus first on devoting their modest resources to these public provisions?

Sen says**poor nations shouldn’t wait for economic growth to provide social services.** The reason has to do with the _relative costs_ of poor nations making such investments. Because social services like education and health care are labor intensive (they rely much more on people rather than technology), the costs of providing them sooner are lower, too.

If a nation waited to get wealthier before making these investments, that wealth would increase the costs of these investments. According to Sen, this happens because jobs in social services demand higher wages when overall incomes rise.

##### Example: China vs. India

To illustrate this point, Sen compares China and India in the latter part of the 20th century, when both nations transitioned from centrally planned economies to market-oriented ones. Both nations were similarly poor. However, China has been far more successful at raising incomes and eradicating poverty.

This is because prior to its transition (and unlike India) China already had a relatively robust infrastructure for education and health care. These investments, made when China was still extremely poor, allowed them to take better advantage of economic growth when it did come, because its people were better educated and healthier.

> **Effect of Public Health on Economic Growth**
> 
> Some researchers argue that money spent on health care is an investment in the productivity of workers. Economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research discovered that good health has a sizable positive impact on productivity. According to their research, increasing a population’s life expectancy by one year was associated with a 4% increase in GDP.
> 
> This finding is consistent with Sen’s view that poor nations can benefit substantially by investing in social services like health care.
