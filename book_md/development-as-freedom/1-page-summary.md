## 1-Page Summary

_Development as Freedom_ by Nobel Prizewinning economist Amartya Sen draws on the works of moral philosophers and economists, from Aristotle to Adam Smith, to argue that economic development goes beyond increasing wealth—it’s about expanding freedom.

### Redefining Poverty and Economic Development

In redefining development as freedom, Sen takes a holistic view of poverty and characterizes it as impeding people’s ability to lead the lives they want.

Sen contends that income and wealth are only important as a _means_ to something else, not for their own sake**.** As such, poverty is about more than low income; it’s about a lack of opportunity. Conversely, **development is about more than simply increasing wealth; it’s about _increasing_ opportunity.**

Sen contends that poverty is harmful and unjust because it deprives people of the ability to lead the lives they want, and development is valuable because it allows people to improve their lives as _they_ see fit.

> **Sen and the Human Development Index**
> 
> Sen’s work on redefining poverty, which earned him the Nobel in 1998 and led to the publication of _Development as Freedom_ in 1999, has affected policy-making. With Sen’s help, the United Nations established the Human Development Index, which provides a more comprehensive metric of welfare than just income. The index is composed of three parts:
> 
>   * Life expectancy at birth
> 
>   * Years of schooling per adult and expected schooling of children
> 
>   * Gross National Income (GNI) per capita
> 
> 

> 
> Each part is indexed on a scale from 0 to 1; the three scores are then averaged to get a single score from 0 to 1. The UN believes this “capabilities approach” to development offers a more useful metric than GDP or GNI because, in addition to income, health and education affect development as well.

#### Poverty as “Capability Deprivation”

Sen defines poverty as “capability deprivation”—hindering someone’s chances to improve their station in life. Sen sees two benefits to this definition:

  1. It considers the _intrinsic_ importance of freedom, which Sen says all people value.
  2. Other factors besides low income contribute to lack of capability, which makes the income approach inadequate.



Sen explains that forms of capability deprivation (which he also refers to as “unfreedoms”) include the processes and opportunities that affect a person’s welfare. For example, violations of human rights are one form, because they disrupt the _process_ of free decision-making; famines are another because they diminish _opportunities_.

(Shortform note: Sen takes issue with all definitions of poverty that use income as the sole metric, of which there are many. For example, the World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on $1.90 or less per day. For developed nations, the OECD defines poverty as half the median household income. And, the US Census Bureau’s poverty line varies by size of family unit. Sen argues all of these ignore factors that affect a person’s capabilities, such as access to education and health care.)

#### Development as Freedom

Sen defines development as the process of expanding the freedoms that people can exercise. Sen gives two reasons why defining development as freedom is better than other definitions of economic development: freedom’s value and its efficacy.

##### Value of Freedom

According to Sen, wealth is merely an instrument for achieving the higher objective of attaining what we want: human flourishing and happiness. Freedom, on the other hand, is essential to achieving our objectives. In fact,**enabling freedom is the _purpose_ and _value_ of economic development**.

##### Efficacy of Freedom

Achieving progress individually and as a nation depends on people having the ability to make their own choices. Sen says that **having free agency is the most effective way for people to attain the things they value,** like happiness.

> **Milton Friedman on Economic Freedom**
> 
> Before Sen, economist Milton Friedman also made freedom central to his vision of economics. In his 1964 book _Capitalism and Freedom_ , Friedman argues that only in a nation with economic freedom can citizens have political freedom as well. This is because political freedom and economic freedom are inextricable. In nations lacking economic freedom, governments control the exchange of goods and services, as well as the exchange of political views via the printing press, internet, and other means of expression.
> 
> While Sen values other forms of freedom beyond economic, Friedman argues that all other freedoms come from the ability to engage in voluntary transactions. Therefore, capitalism is the only economic system that enables the other forms Sen desires (described in the next section).

### Explaining Freedom

Now that we’ve established Sen’s basis for redefining poverty, we’ll examine what specifically he means when he refers to development as “freedom.” Sen’s is a more expansive view of freedom than traditional definitions, including both **negative rights** (such as freedom from coercion) and **positive rights** (such as the rights to education and health care).

Sen argues that**these freedoms are both the primary _purpose_ of development, as well as the most effective _means_ of development.**

#### Five Types of Freedom

Sen cites five types of freedoms that advance a person’s potential, each of which reinforces the others:****

  1. Democratic rights
  2. Commercial liberties 
  3. Public provisions 
  4. Ethical guardrails
  5. Safety nets 



##### Democratic Rights

Sen explains that these political freedoms are mostly synonymous with the civil rights of a liberal democracy. They include the ability to choose who governs and on what principles and the right to freedom of expression and of the press. They also entail the right to form and choose among political parties, as well as the right to criticize authority figures.

(Shortform note:**** Not all economists believe in prioritizing democracy as much as Sen does. In _The Bottom Billion_ , Paul Collier argues that democracy is a _hindrance_ to economic development in poor nations flush with natural resource revenue. This is because politicians, unlike dictators, fixate on pandering to win elections rather than pursuing long-term policies like investments in education. Unlike Collier, Sen puts greater emphasis on the intrinsic importance of citizens having a say in who governs.)

##### Commercial Liberties

By commercial liberties, Sen means the freedom of individuals to produce, exchange, and consume their choice of goods and services. Here, Sen focuses on the ability to engage in economic activity free from arbitrary constraints—such as government price controls and forced labor. The right to access financial institutions and credit is also part of economic freedom. This access is crucial because it gives low-income people a chance to earn interest through savings or to receive loans for new business ventures.

> **Is Economic Freedom Essential?**
> 
> Sen’s assertion that economic freedom is essential to other freedoms is part of a long intellectual tradition. In his _Second Treatise of Government_ , John Locke made the philosophical case that property rights—the ability to enjoy the fruits of your own labor—are natural rights that should be protected by the government.
> 
> Communists, however, have differing views on economic freedom. The central tenet of Marxism (at least when Marx and Engels wrote _The Communist Manifesto_) was the abolition of private property. The socialist magazine _Jacobin_ argues that “Capitalist Freedom is a Farce.” In this view, unregulated economic freedom leads to monopoly, which allows capitalists to exploit their employees and force workers to tolerate low wages, poor conditions, and controlling bosses; all of which, they argue, are antithetical to freedom.

##### Public Provisions

“Public provisions” means having access to services that enable people to live better, such as education and health care.**** Sen explains that access to an education provides literacy, which is crucial to exercising political freedoms because it allows citizens to make more informed decisions; good health is important to commercial freedom because it allows people to be more productive workers.

> **Gary Becker and Human Capital**
> 
> Throughout _Development as Freedom_ , Sen stresses the importance of the public provision of education, putting an economic emphasis on _people_ rather than things. Fellow Nobel laureate Gary Becker also oriented economic theory around people with his human capital theory.
> 
> Becker argued that understanding economic development requires differentiation among people based on their knowledge and abilities, rather than lumping all workers together under the banner of “labor.” The term “human capital” refers to these differing levels of abilities that each worker possesses.
> 
> Following Becker’s lead, many economists also make the case that in addition to individual gains in productivity from better human capital, there are social gains as well. In their view, these gains justify the government providing education, because the benefits exceed the costs.

##### Ethical Guardrails

According to Sen, ethical guardrails include the “right to disclosure,” or public “right to know,” as well as other components of business and contract law. Ethical guardrails create openness and trust in social interactions (especially commerce) and are necessary to prevent government corruption, crooked business practices, and other unethical behavior.

(Shortform note: “Right to disclosure” refers to rules like the SEC’s requirement for publicly traded corporations to release pertinent information about their businesses—such as balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flows.)

> **The Role of Law in Economic Development**
> 
> While praising the role of markets in economic development, Sen emphasizes that properly functioning government institutions are necessary for effective markets. These ethical guardrails help fortify the public’s trust in commercial exchange.
> 
> Similarly, in _The Law-Growth Nexus_ , law professor Kenneth Dam explains how legal institutions affect economic development. Dam argues there are three components to “the rule of law”: enforcement, contracts, and property rights. He argues that failure to establish the rule of law in developing countries is a significant obstacle to growth.

##### Safety Nets

Social safety nets guard against severe suffering.**** They include _fixed institutional arrangements_ , such as supplemental income and unemployment benefits, and _ad hoc arrangements_ like disaster relief or emergency public employment. Sen believes both types are important components of development.

> **Two Views on Safety Nets**
> 
> Safety nets remain a contentious subject among economists and policymakers. Sen argues safety nets are necessary to combat poverty and misfortune, while others argue they provide disincentives to work and fail to improve social mobility for the poor.
> 
> During the Great Depression, the federal government established America’s first safety net programs, which have since been expanded. Sen considers these programs “fixed institutional arrangements,” and argues they are fundamental to freedom because they enhance people’s capabilities. Currently, some of the United States’ largest safety nets include: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, unemployment insurance, food and monetary aid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.

### Sen’s Idea of Justice

Having redefined poverty and development, Sen turns to the idea of justice. Sen’s view of justice**** is part of his broader case for freedom-centered development, because “just” (or equitable) opportunity is essential to increasing the five types of freedom discussed earlier.

Harvard philosopher John Rawls, whose ideas Sen echoes, argues that justice requires more than personal freedom. Similarly, Sen argues freedom requires more than just negative rights. Sen’s freedom also requires a set of positive rights in order to ensure that the disadvantaged have opportunities to develop their potential. His belief in positive rights compels him to include public provisions and safety nets among his five types of freedom.

(Shortform note: By “negative rights,” we mean the rights of a person to be free _from_ external violations of liberty, such as coercion. By “positive rights,” we mean people’s claim _to_ entitlements in order to secure a baseline level of welfare.)

#### Building on Rawlsian Justice

In Sen’s interpretation, the idea of Rawlsian justice (laid out in _A Theory of Justice_ published in 1971) is to allow individuals a better chance to pursue their objectives. To attain their objectives, they need “primary goods.” These **primary goods include rights, freedoms, opportunities, and income**. Together, they provide people a fair chance to succeed or fail on their own merits.

Rawls also values freedom for its own sake (what he calls the priority of liberty). However, Sen goes further in arguing that for very poor nations, the “priority of liberty” can overemphasize freedom and overlook the basic economic needs of the poor. Therefore, Sen also champions positive rights like safety nets and public health programs that he deems vital to freedom.

> **Economics and “Distributive Justice”**
> 
> For Rawls, justice is based on what he calls the “difference principle,” which has these components:
> 
>   * Each person has equal claim to a set of rights and liberties.
> 
>   * In order for social and economic inequality to be just, it must satisfy two conditions.
> 
> 

> 
> First, unequal outcomes are acceptable when everyone has an opportunity to attain them. For example, if someone becomes rich by becoming a famous musician, this is considered just because everyone has an opportunity to do so.
> 
> Second, inequality can be tolerated if it benefits the least advantaged members of society. For example, if an entrepreneur builds a fortune by inventing a new technology, his greater income can be tolerated if that technology improves conditions for the disadvantaged.
> 
> If inequality fails to satisfy these two conditions, then Rawls believes in redistributing resources to improve conditions for disadvantaged people, as long as it doesn’t infringe upon anyone’s basic liberties.

### The Role of the Market in Development

Sen identifies two reasons why free markets are integral to development:

  * They are a means to economic growth and progress.
  * They are a fundamental freedom that people have reason to value. 



Sen acknowledges that free markets can increase economic growth and overall economic progress. However, Sen says free markets are much more important than just as a means to improve prosperity. Independent of its impact on economic growth, **the freedom to exchange goods and services is a basic part of social interaction, and thus it’s valuable as its own kind of freedom.**

> **Adam Smith on the Role of the Market**
> 
> Sen relies heavily on the work of Adam Smith to support his philosophical and practical case for freedom. Some scholars call this Smith’s “presumption of liberty.”
> 
> Smith generally thought that an undisturbed market was the best engine for progress and liberty. However, he did acknowledge that there are circumstances when the market fails to provide socially preferable results. In such cases, he believed it was just to prioritize the public good. He specifically mentioned the government’s role in national defense, enforcing the rule of law, and in providing public works like roads and bridges.
> 
> In _Development as Freedom_ , Sen follows a similar line of reasoning. He views freedom as important and useful to the public good but identifies some areas where the government can improve general welfare.

#### Capitalist Values

Sen argues that**in order to flourish, capitalism requires a set of values and norms.** A combination of legal institutions and social mores is crucial to economic functioning.**** These capitalist values are part of the ethical guardrails Sen refers to throughout the book, and they help combat greed and corruption. The three values that he focuses on are **trust, sympathy,** and **commitment.**

The first value, **trust** , is crucial to economic exchange. Only in a system where mutual trust is routine can trade occur.

**Sympathy** , too, is a capitalist value. Sen agrees with Adam Smith’s view that there are many situations where self-interest compels a person to help others. If we suffer when someone else suffers, this is sympathy. This natural human drive persists even in a capitalist system dominated by self-interest.

Sen contrasts sympathy with another capitalist value: **commitment**. Sen defines commitment as a person’s desire to help others—not to alleviate their own “sympathetic suffering,” but because of a larger commitment to justice.

Sen believes these values help explain the sustained success of Western economies, and that cultivating these values in developing nations is crucial to development.

> **Imposing Capitalist Values**
> 
> In _The White Man’s Burden_ , economist William Easterly agrees with Sen that there is a set of capitalist values that makes free enterprise work. Easterly specifically highlights the importance of trust in enabling capitalism to flourish.
> 
> However, Easterly also argues that these capitalist ethics must develop organically, and can’t be imposed on a nation or culture that’s unfamiliar with them. This is why attempts to bring capitalism to countries with long histories of other economic systems usually fail.
> 
> For example, the effort to rapidly turn former Soviet satellites into capitalist systems following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was largely a failure. This “shock therapy” was meant to deliver the economic success of the West, but it had the opposite effect. Easterly argues this was because these nations had yet to develop capitalist values on their own.

### Development as Freedom in Practice

Now that we’ve explained Sen’s philosophical case for freedom-centered development, we’ll analyze some of the most urgent issues plaguing underdeveloped nations and discuss how a development as freedom model would mitigate them. First, we’ll look at gender bias and how empowering women can spur growth. Then we’ll discuss food scarcity and how to ensure that there’s enough to eat in a world of 7 billion people.

### Women and Development

Sen identifies **bias against women** as a major obstacle to growth in developing countries. This bias deprives women of basic rights in areas such as political participation and family planning. It also ignores the economic impact of women in the workforce. **By empowering women** , Sen argues, not only are women better off, but their **communities become safer and more prosperous**.

#### Women’s Agency

Sen argues that **the most effective way to empower women is to increase literacy.** Research shows that increases in female literacy are strongly associated with a reduction in child mortality. The knowledge women gain through education allows them to better care for their children.

According to Sen, female literacy and labor force participation have a positive effect on fertility rates.**** In this case, “positive” refers to having _fewer_ babies. Around the globe, a greater recognition of women’s rights usually leads to a reduction in fertility rates (the average number of children born per woman).

In many developing societies, women have little choice in family planning. But education gives women greater knowledge about family planning, and work outside the home often gives them more options, too.

> **Advances in Female Literacy and Reductions in Fertility Rates**
> 
> Since _Development as Freedom_ was published in 2000, women’s literacy rates have continued to improve. In 2000, female literacy in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs, as classified by the United Nations) was 44%. As of 2020, it has risen to 59%. School enrollment is up for girls, and literacy rates among young women in poor countries are nearly on par with those of young men.
> 
> A similarly positive trend has happened to women’s average number of births. In 2000, the fertility rate in LDCs was 5.2. In 2020, it was down to 3.9. Sen would likely attribute this reduction to educational empowerment, greater recognition of women’s rights in family planning, and increased access to contraception. Also, improved health care has helped reduce infant mortality, which allows women to bear fewer children to achieve their desired family size.

### Preventing Famines

In addition to the problems resulting from disempowering women, famine can also be a problem in developing countries. Sen identifies**** three ways that freedom-centered development can prevent famines: private markets, free trade, and government support.

  1. **Private markets** provide incentives for people to produce and distribute food.
  2. **Free trade** allows people to convert their labor power into food.
  3. **Government support** enables famines to be avoided by offering supplemental assistance when there is a recession, natural disaster, or price shocks.



Sen also believes**it’s not difficult or expensive for governments to prevent famines** , and he says societies can guard against them through economic growth and famine relief (such as income transfers to buy food).

Sen contends that**no famine has occurred in a functioning democracy** because democracy provides an incentive for government officials to take the steps necessary to alleviate food shortages.

(Shortform note: While Sen puts the responsibility for famine relief on the affected country, the charitable organization Oxfam has a five-step plan to prevent famine that includes outside help. It includes providing clean water, encouraging proper sanitation, emergency food and cash assistance, supplying seeds for farming, and government accountability. This kind of private intervention can help prevent famine when government dysfunction is the cause.)
