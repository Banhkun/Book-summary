## Shortform Introduction

_Development as Freedom_ by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen argues that economic development goes beyond increasing wealth—it’s about expanding freedom.

Sen, an Indian economist and professor, believes the definitions of poverty and development should be broader.

This guide explores the roots of Sen’s reasoning, from what it means to be poor, to his idea of justice and the role that markets play in the process of development. Additionally, we examine different perspectives on the substance and practicality of Sen’s “development as freedom” approach.

### About the Author

Amartya Sen is a professor of economics and philosophy at Harvard University. He was born in Santiniketan, India in 1933, and was a child when the Bengal Famine ravaged much of his homeland. Sen went on to earn his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1959, and he has taught in the United Kingdom at the London School of Economics and Oxford University, in addition to his native India. In 1998, Sen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his “contributions to welfare economics” including his work on poverty, famines, and social choice.

Sen has written or edited more than 20 books and 200 scholarly articles, primarily in philosophy and economics. Sen has also served as president of the Indian Economic Association, the American Economic Association, and the Econometric Society.

In addition to his Nobel Prize, Sen also received the National Humanities Medal, the Edinburgh Medal, and the George Marshall Award, among other accolades.

### The Book’s Publication and Context

_Development as Freedom_ was published in 1999 by Alfred A. Knopf and Oxford University Press.

#### Intellectual Context

_Development as Freedom_ is based on a series of five lectures Sen delivered to the World Bank in 1996.

Sen has devoted his career to the study of poverty. _Development as Freedom_ reflects Sen’s interest in both economic philosophy and empirical research, and combines moral and economic arguments.

Portions of _Development as Freedom_ are a response to two of the 20th century’s most influential books on political philosophy, Robert Nozick’s _Anarchy, State, and Utopia _(1974), and John Rawls’ _A Theory of Justice _(1971).

Sen draws on portions of these and other works to articulate his “development as freedom” approach.He also relies on his and his colleagues’ decades of empirical analysis of global poverty, famines, and women’s issues. He uses this evidence to show the practical importance of freedom to social progress.

To make his case that we should define development as expanding freedom, Sen draws heavily on Adam Smith’s _The Wealth of Nations _(1776), in addition to Smith’s earlier writings on moral philosophy. Sen invokes a wide range of scholars—from Karl Marx to F.A. Hayek—in his efforts to bridge typical ideological divides and establish his holistic approach to development as freedom.

#### The Book’s Impact

For a work of scholarship, _Development as Freedom_ has been unusually influential. _The Guardian called Sen_ a rare scholar to have “a major effect on politics” because he changed the way many policymakers look at poverty. For example, Sen helped the United Nations design the Human Development Index (HDI), a more comprehensive measure of welfare than standard per-capita income.

Sen has also ushered in an era of 21st-century economists who have focused on measures of social progress rather than simple economic growth.

In his native India, Sen is well-known and celebrated as “the Mother Teresa of economics.”

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Development as Freedom_ was generally well-received, both by critics and the general public, and it’s often regarded as a more humane approach to economics. Kofi A. Annan, then the Secretary-General of the United Nations, said Sen had “revolutionized” the way economists approach development, calling him an insightful champion for the world’s poor.

Fellow Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow, whose work on social choice Sen criticizes in his book, was nonetheless positive, calling it “ a forceful and rigorous analysis” of the symbiotic relationship between freedom and development.

The World Bank even integrated much of Sen’s view of poverty as “capability deprivation” into its own definition.

However, there also have been criticisms from across the ideological spectrum. Some progressives think Sen emphasized individualism too strongly, at the expense of collective interests. They also think Sen overlooked the destabilizing effects of globalization and free trade on developing economies, and he neglected proper attention to the role colonialism has played in the problems of poor nations.

From a free-market perspective, some have criticized Sen’s support of a “positive rights” view of liberty, one that considers government entitlements as integral to human freedom.

_The Economist,_ while praising the “great attractions” of the book, criticized Sen for ignoring the motivations of government action and the problem of rent-seeking—public officials pursuing their own interests above the public interest.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

While Sen says in his introduction that _Development as Freedom_ is geared toward a general audience, many parts of the book are esoteric. Readers lacking a basic background in economics and political philosophy will likely have trouble following some of the more abstract concepts Sen covers, such as utilitarianism and social choice theory.

_Development as Freedom_ is part philosophy and part research. Sen relates many of his ideas back to various philosophers, Enlightenment thinkers, and early economists. Aristotle, Confucius, Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Karl Marx all make appearances, among many others.

Sen supplements these philosophical discussions with the presentation of empirical research. In the chapters on famine and women’s agency, Sen cites much of his own research. Sen takes care to cite his sources, and there are approximately 50 pages of notes and references at the back of the book.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_Development as Freedom_ consists of an introduction and 12 chapters. Because of the range of topics covered, and because the book is not divided into parts, it often lacks a coherent organization.

Sen devotes the first few chapters to laying out the philosophical case for why economic development focused on income alone is insufficient, and why development as freedom offers a more useful alternative. In the latter half of the book, each chapter covers a more specific topic of development (chapters focus on democracy, famines, and women’s rights, for example).

Because of this structure, many sections overlap, with Sen reiterating the role of freedom as both the principal means and purpose of development in each chapter.

Helpfully, each chapter has a brief conclusion, covering the main points, and connecting them back to Sen’s thesis.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Our guide reorganizes _Development as Freedom_ into three parts.

  * Part 1 consists of the philosophy of _Development as Freedom_. It explains how and why Sen chooses to redefine key terms like poverty, economic development, and freedom.
  * Part 2 focuses on “development as freedom” in practice. It examines specific issues pertaining to poverty and development, such as famines, authoritarianism and democracy, and oppression against women.
  * Part 3 examines obstacles to and criticisms of Sen’s approach. This part includes a look at criticisms of Western bias in Sen’s model of development, as well as practical difficulties of implementing development as freedom in poor nations.



This guide also presents supporting and alternative approaches to Sen’s themes. Additionally, we update the data where appropriate to reflect significant changes since the book’s publication in 1999.
