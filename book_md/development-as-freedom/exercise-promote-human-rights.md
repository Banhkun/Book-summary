## Exercise: Promote Human Rights

Sen argues that all nations can benefit by adopting freedom and human rights.

* * *

What do you think is the best way to promote freedom and human rights in developing countries?

Do you agree that economic rights such as unemployment insurance and paid holidays are human rights as well? Why or why not?

Do you think itâ€™s more important to help a poor nation that respects human rights achieve economic growth, or ensure a prosperous nation that violates human rights is held accountable? Why?
