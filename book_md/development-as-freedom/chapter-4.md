## Chapter 4: Competing Notions of Justice

Having laid out new definitions of poverty and development, Sen turns to analyzing the **competing theories of justice** prevalent in economics: **utilitarianism, libertarianism, and Rawlsian** justice**.** Sen incorporates their positive aspects, such as the importance of valuing both freedom and its consequences, into his own view of justice.**** Justice is integral to his broader case for freedom-centered development, because “just” or **equitable opportunity is essential to increasing the five types of freedom discussed earlier for all people.**

### Utilitarianism

Articulated by British philosopher Jeremy Bentham in the 19th century, **utilitarianism is an ethical theory that prioritizes doing the greatest good for the most people**. It became the predominant theory of ethics throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, and was adopted, in different variations, by prominent economists such as John Stuart Mill and William Stanley Jevons.

(Shortform note: In this context, “utility” refers to a measure of happiness or satisfaction. The theory is based on the idea that rational people seek to increase their utility or happiness, and that public policy should seek to do the same for society.)

#### Pros of Utilitarianism

Sen sees two main virtues of this approach. First, utilitarianism is focused on outcomes, meaning the results of policies are more important than processes. Sen believes results must be part of the calculus. Second, the welfare of people is the primary consideration.

#### Cons of Utilitarianism

Sen identifies four problems with utilitarianism.

  1. Utilitarianism focuses on total utility and doesn’t consider how utility is distributed among the population—leading to a potential disregard of the lower classes. 
  2. It does not regard freedom as inherently valuable. Freedom is considered important only because of its indirect effect on happiness.
  3. It overlooks that people can become inured to their situations. For example, some poor people in undeveloped societies may consider themselves happy despite their low standard of living, which severely limits their opportunities. 
  4. Because people have different notions of happiness, comparisons _between_ people don’t work well.



> **In Defense of Utilitarianism**
> 
> Some researchers take issue with Sen and other scholars’ interpretations of utilitarianism, arguing they mischaracterize its main tenets. Writing “In Defense of Utilitarianism,” Professor Peter Bowden argues that modern utilitarians _do_ value freedom, and that the kind of model expressed by John Stuart Mill in _Utilitarianism_ provides a practical approach to decision-making.
> 
> Regarding freedom, if an individual values freedom inherently (as Sen says all people do), then violating their freedom reduces their utility. This fact prevents utilitarians from overlooking freedom, as Sen claims they do. And since in addition to his work on utilitarianism, Mill literally wrote the book _On Liberty_ , Bowden argues that it’s misguided to act as if he didn’t value freedom for its own sake.
> 
> As for practicality, although it’s difficult to make utility comparisons between people, Sen’s preferred method of using democratic means to decide the proper size and scope of positive rights (like social safety net programs) is similarly hard.

### Libertarianism

**Libertarian theory** , as expressed by Robert Nozick in _Anarchy, State, and Utopia_ ,**focuses on maximum individual liberty with minimal government intervention in personal affairs.** In libertarian theory, the parties involved in a transaction determine what constitutes a just or fair exchange rather than the government.

(Shortform note: Opposition to minimum wage laws is an example of applying the libertarian “justice as consent” model. If an employer wants to pay a worker $5 an hour, and the worker is willing to accept this, libertarian theory considers this transaction consensual and therefore just. Libertarians aren't concerned with whether any outside party considers this exploitative—what's important is the mutual consent of the parties involved. In fact, libertarian theory considers minimum wage laws _themselves_ unjust, because they essentially give the government power to veto an otherwise mutually agreed-upon transaction.)

#### Pros of Libertarianism

Sen notes only one key benefit of libertarianism: Unlike utilitarianism, libertarian theory _does_ value freedom inherently.

#### Cons of Libertarianism

Sen warns that libertarianism prioritizes freedom from government intervention above results, meaning it’s willing, in theory, to accept poor outcomes for some people as long as respect for everyone’s rights is maintained. If freedom results in unemployment, for example, the government has no obligation to help the unemployed.

(Shortform note: Proponents of libertarianism would likely claim that in practice, indispensable freedom _leads_ to improved conditions for all people. Sen, however, argues that libertarianism insufficiently protects the most vulnerable people. Widespread human suffering (such as famines) has occurred in places where people’s rights were fully protected in ways consistent with libertarian theory.)

### Rawlsian Justice

In _A Theory of Justice_ , published in 1971, Harvard philosopher John Rawls presents a moral model, “justice as fairness,” which tries to reconcile notions of liberty and equity.

In Sen’s interpretation,**the purpose of Rawlsian justice is to allow individuals a better chance to pursue their objectives.** To attain their objectives, they need “primary goods.” These primary goods include rights, freedoms, opportunities, and income. Together, these primary goods provide people a just or fair chance to succeed or fail on their own merits.

#### Pros of Rawlsian Justice

Rawls values freedom for its own sake (what he calls the priority of liberty). Rawls also **values other primary goods** , meaning that he considers more than freedom in his evaluations. Sen agrees with Rawls that primary goods—aside from liberty—are vital as well.

#### Cons of Rawlsian Justice

Sen argues that for very poor nations, the “priority of liberty” can overemphasize freedom and risk overlooking the basic economic needs of the poor.

While Sen values negative rights, he also champions positive rights like safety nets and public health programs he deems vital to his idea of freedom. For example, Sen would likely favor progressive tax rates to redistribute some of the highest earners’ income to poorer people.

(Shortform note: By “negative rights,” we mean the rights of a person to be free _from_ external violations of liberty, such as coercion. By “positive rights,” we mean peoples’ claim _to_ entitlements in order to secure a baseline level of welfare.)

> **Economics and “Distributive Justice”**
> 
> Each theory of justice Sen addresses seeks to address a fundamental question of economics: How should resources be distributed within a society? The arguments about which arrangements are morally preferable fall under the category of “distributive justice.”
> 
> For Rawls, justice is based on what he calls the “difference principle,” which has these components:
> 
>   1. Each person has equal claim to a set of rights and liberties.
> 
>   2. In order for social and economic inequality to be just, it must satisfy two conditions:
> 
> 

>   * Unequal outcomes are acceptable when everyone has an opportunity to attain them. For example, if someone becomes rich by becoming a famous musician, this is considered just because everyone has an opportunity to do so.
> 
>   * Inequality can be tolerated if it benefits the least advantaged members of society. If an entrepreneur builds a fortune by inventing a new technology, his greater income can be tolerated if that technology improves conditions for the disadvantaged.
> 
> 

> 
> If inequality fails to satisfy these two conditions, then Rawls believes in redistributing resources to improve conditions for disadvantaged people, as long as it doesn’t infringe upon anyone’s basic liberties.
