## Part 1: Philosophy | Chapter 1: Redefining Poverty and Economic Development

In _Development as Freedom_ , Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen draws on the works of moral philosophers and economists, from Aristotle to Adam Smith, to argue that economic development is about more than increasing wealth—it must be about expanding freedom.

In redefining development as freedom, Sen takes a holistic view of poverty and characterizes it as impeding people’s ability to lead the lives they want.

Most definitions of poverty are based only on level of income. However, Sen’s approach to understanding poverty is more nuanced. He believes income alone does not tell the story of well-being.

Sen contends that income and wealth are only important as a _means_ to something else, not for their own sake**.** As such, poverty is about more than low income; it’s about a lack of opportunity. Conversely, development is about more than simply increasing wealth; it’s about _increasing_ opportunity.

Sen contends that **poverty is harmful and unjust because it deprives people of the ability to lead the lives they want** , and development is valuable because it allows people to improve their lives as _they_ see fit.

> **Sen and the Human Development Index**
> 
> Sen’s work on redefining poverty has had practical implications for policy-making. With Sen’s help, the United Nations established the Human Development Index, which provides a more comprehensive metric of welfare than just income. The index is composed of three parts:
> 
>   * Life expectancy at birth
> 
>   * Years of schooling per adult and expected schooling of children
> 
>   * Gross National Income per capita
> 
> 

> 
> Each part is indexed on a scale from 0 to 1, and the three scores are then averaged to get a single score from 0 to 1. The UN believes this “capabilities approach” to development offers a more useful metric than GDP or GNI because health and education affect development as well.
> 
> By utilizing the Human Development Index, Sen hopes to provide a clearer picture of advances in developing nations, as well as to identify the areas that still require improvement.

### Poverty as “Capability Deprivation”

Sen defines poverty as “capability deprivation,”****(he also refers to it as “unfreedom”)**—** which means**** hindering people’s chances to improve their station in life.**** There are two main benefits to viewing poverty in this way:

  1. It considers the _intrinsic_ importance of freedom, which Sen says all people value.
  2. Other factors besides low income contribute to lack of capability, which makes the income approach inadequate.



Sen explains that forms of capability deprivation and unfreedom include the processes and opportunities that affect a person’s welfare. For example, violations of human rights and civil liberties are one form of unfreedom, because they disrupt the _process_ of free decision-making. Famines, poor sanitation, and the threat of disease (such as malaria in sub-tropical climates) are another form, because they diminish _opportunities_.

(Shortform note: Sen takes issue with all definitions of poverty that use income as the sole metric. There are multiple income-centered definitions:

  * The World Bank defines extreme poverty as $1.90 or below per day.
  * For developed nations, the OECD defines poverty as half the median household income.
  * The US Census Bureau’s poverty line varies by size of family unit.



Sen argues all of these ignore factors that affect a person’s capabilities, such as access to education and health care.)

### Development as Freedom

Sen defines development as _the process of expanding the freedoms that people can exercise_.

In contrast, most of modern economic literature takes the “income-centered approach” to poverty and economic development. Most analyses by economists and policymakers view per-capita income and GDP growth as the keys to prosperity. However, Sen argues this approach is actually a deviation from the emphasis early economists put on a more holistic approach to development.

Aristotle stated that **wealth is only valuable insofar as it could be used to achieve other objectives** , such as “capacity” and “flourishing.” Adam Smith, considered the founder of economics, often prioritized living conditions rather than mere income. The pioneering work of economists and mathematicians like Sir William Petty and Joseph-Louis Lagrange paid similar attention to what could be achieved with income.

In line with this classical view**,** Sen makes both a philosophical and empirical case for why poverty and development ought to be considered through a freedom-focused approach.

> **Where Does GDP Come From?**
> 
> In _Development as Freedom_ , Sen is critical of the narrow criterion of GDP as _the_ metric of economics. While Sen and other economists recognize the value of accounting for the size of aggregate and per capita income, Sen also points out the flaws with the GDP approach.
> 
> For more than a century, economists and policymakers have debated the best way to measure prosperity. Gross Domestic Product—the total market value of all goods and services produced within a specified period—has been the predominant metric.
> 
> Economist and author Diane Coyle explains how the British scientist and political economist Sir William Petty “invented” GDP in 1665: The British government enlisted his services to calculate the fundamentals of the British economy during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In this sense, GDP was popularized not because it was the ideal metric of human welfare, but because it provided governments with information to decide the best way to finance their military excursions.

#### Why Define Development as Freedom?

Sen gives two reasons why defining development as freedom is better than other definitions of economic development: freedom’s value and its efficacy.

##### Value of Freedom

Other definitions of development (such as GDP) only focus on the _means_ of development, thereby missing the crucial point that the _reason_ we value means such as GDP growth, industrialization, technological progress, or other aspects of modernity is that these things allow people the freedom to better achieve their desires.

In other words, according to Sen, they are merely instruments for achieving the higher objective of attaining what we want: human flourishing and happiness. But freedom is an essential ingredient in achieving our objectives—in fact, **enabling freedom is the _purpose_ and _value_ of economic development**.

> **Milton Friedman on Economic Freedom**
> 
> Before Sen, economist Milton Friedman also made freedom central to his vision of economics. In his 1964 book _Capitalism and Freedom_ , Friedman argues that only in a nation with economic freedom can citizens have political freedom as well. This is because political freedom and economic freedom are inextricable. In nations lacking economic freedom, the government controls the exchange of goods and services, as well as the exchange of political views via the printing press, internet, and other means of expression.
> 
> While Sen values other forms of freedom beyond economic, Friedman argues that all other freedoms come from the ability to engage in voluntary transactions. Therefore, capitalism is the only economic system that enables the other forms Sen desires (described in the next section.

##### Efficacy of Freedom

Achieving progress individually and as a nation depends upon people having the ability to make their own decisions. Sen says having free agency is the most effective way for people to attain the things they value (like happiness)—even more than simply attaining wealth.

(Shortform note: Sen is not presenting an either/or choice between freedom and increased affluence. Rather, he argues that freedom is the best way for people to achieve their potential. In later chapters, Sen presents empirical evidence that freedom enhances people’s ability to lead long and happy lives in ways that higher income alone does not.)

> **Foreign Aid and Economic Development**
> 
> Sen argues that the single best way for poor nations to develop is through the expansion of freedom. In this sense, reforms _within_ a country are sufficient to lift a nation out of poverty. However, some development scholars argue that _outside_ assistance is needed, especially in a global economy.
> 
> Prominent development economist Jeffrey Sachs argues that poor nations are usually stuck in a poverty trap, and require a “big push” in the form of foreign aid to get out of this rut. Once out, they can develop further on their own. If they aren’t provided this aid, Sachs says they will continue to suffer from material poverty, irrespective of how much freedom may be expanded.
> 
> While the US and western European nations didn’t rely on aid to overcome their initial poverty, scholars like Sachs believe the disadvantages poor nations face in a more competitive global economy hinder their ability to compete.
