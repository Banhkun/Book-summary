## Chapter 2: Explaining Freedom

Now that we’ve established the basis for redefining poverty as deprivation of opportunities and development as freedom, we’ll examine what specifically Sen means when he refers to freedom. Sen’s is a more expansive view of freedom than traditional definitions, including both _negative rights_ (such as freedom from coercion) and _positive rights_ (such as the right to education and health care).

Sen argues that these freedoms are both the primary _purpose_ of development, as well as the most effective _means_ of development.

### Five Types of Freedom

Sen cites**five types of freedoms that advance a person’s potential** :

  1. Democratic rights 
  2. Commercial liberties
  3. Public provisions
  4. Ethical guardrails
  5. Safety nets



We’ll examine these five freedoms individually and examine how each reinforces the others.

(Shortform note: Sen’s list of five freedoms is similar to the four freedoms that Franklin D. Roosevelt laid out in a famous speech in 1941. Roosevelt argued the four fundamental freedoms were: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Like Sen, Roosevelt believed it was the government’s obligation to provide material support and national security to people, in addition to securing their individual liberties.)

#### Democratic Rights

Sun explains that democratic rights (or political freedoms) are mostly synonymous with the typical civil rights of a liberal democracy. They include:

  * The ability to choose who governs and on what principles
  * The right to freedom of expression and of the press
  * The right to form and choose among political parties
  * The right to criticize authority figures



> **A Critique of Democratic Rights**
> 
> Not all economists believe in prioritizing democracy as much as Sen. In _The Bottom Billion_ , Paul Collier argues that democracy is a _hindrance_ to economic development in poor nations flush with natural resource revenue. Collier says this is because politicians, unlike dictators, fixate on pandering to win elections rather than pursuing long-term policies like investments in education.
> 
> Also, many poor democracies are rife with corruption. Politicians often buy votes and intimidate their opponents. If checks and balances are weak, this malfeasance is often ignored. Collier argues poor nations would benefit more from strengthening an independent judiciary and fighting corruption than focusing on voting.

#### Commercial Liberties

By commercial liberties, Sen means the freedom of individuals to produce, exchange, and consume their choice of goods and services. Here, Sen focuses on the ability to engage in economic activity free from arbitrary constraints, such as government price controls and forced labor. The right to access financial institutions and credit is also part of economic freedom. This access is crucial because it gives low-income people a chance to earn interest through savings, or to receive loans for new business ventures.

> **Is Economic Freedom Essential?**
> 
> Sen’s assertion that economic freedom is essential to other freedoms is part of a long intellectual tradition. In his _Second Treatise of Government_ , John Locke made the philosophical case that property rights—the ability to enjoy the fruits of your own labor—are natural rights that should be protected by the government. Locke also argued against slavery—on the grounds that it is a violation of basic liberty, including the right of a person to freely choose how to use their labor.
> 
> Communists, however, have differing views on economic freedom. The central tenet of Marxism (at least when Marx and Engels wrote _The Communist Manifesto_) was the abolition of private property.
> 
> The socialist magazine _Jacobin_ argues that “Capitalist Freedom Is a Farce.” In this view, unregulated economic freedom leads to monopoly, which allows capitalists to exploit their employees and force workers to tolerate low wages, poor conditions, and controlling bosses; all of which, they argue, are antithetical to freedom.
> 
> On this issue, Sen aligns more with Adam Smith. Both regard freedom of production and exchange as valuable for its own sake. Additionally, both think that competing for employees encourages businesses to improve wages and conditions as best they can while still making a profit.
> 
> To them, reducing the influence of individual firms like Amazon would likely require _more_ economic freedom, by way of lowering barriers to entry or repealing excessive licensure requirements. Sen laments the “license Raj,” which used to rule India, where governments required multiple permits for nearly every economic activity. This stifled would-be entrepreneurs and prevented economic growth.

#### Public Provisions

Public provisions refers to having access to services that enable people to live better—such as education and health care.**** These provisions allow people to better enjoy other freedoms. For example, access to an education provides literacy, which is crucial to exercising political freedoms because it allows citizens to make more informed decisions; good health is important to commercial freedom because it allows people to be more productive workers.

> **Gary Becker and Human Capital**
> 
> Throughout _Development as Freedom_ , Sen stresses the importance of the public provision of education, putting an economic emphasis on _people_ rather than things. Fellow Nobel laureate Gary Becker also oriented economic theory around people with his human capital theory. Becker argued that understanding economic development requires differentiation among people based on their knowledge and abilities, rather than lumping all workers together under the banner of “labor.”
> 
> The term “human capital” refers to these differing levels of abilities that each worker possesses. Following Becker’s lead, many economists also make the case that in addition to individual gains in productivity from better human capital, there are social gains as well. In their view, these gains justify the government providing education, because the benefits exceed the costs.
> 
> Sen and Becker both point to Korea and Taiwan as examples of nations that benefited from government investments in their citizens’ education.

#### Ethical Guardrails

Ethical guardrails create openness and trust in social interactions, especially commerce.**** According to Sen, ethical guardrails include the “right to disclosure,” or public “right to know,” and other components of business and contract law necessary to prevent government corruption, crooked business practices, and other unethical behavior.

(Shortform note: “Right to disclosure” refers to rules like the SEC’s requirement for publicly traded corporations to release pertinent information about their businesses—such as balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flows.)

> **The Role of Law in Economic Development**
> 
> While praising the role of markets in economic development, Sen emphasizes that properly functioning government institutions are necessary for effective markets. These ethical guardrails help fortify the public’s trust in commercial exchange.
> 
> Similarly, in _The Law-Growth Nexus_ , law professor Kenneth Dam explains how legal institutions affect economic development. Dam argues there are three components to “the rule of law”: enforcement, contracts, and property rights. He argues that failure to establish the rule of law in developing countries is a significant obstacle to growth.

#### Safety Nets

Social safety nets guard against severe suffering.**** Sen distinguishes between _fixed_ _institutional arrangements_ and _ad hoc arrangements_. _Fixed institutional arrangements_ are programs such as supplemental income and unemployment benefits. _Ad hoc arrangements_ include disaster relief or emergency public employment. Sen believes both types are important components of development.

> **Major Safety Net Programs in the US**
> 
> Safety nets remain a contentious subject among economists and policymakers. Sen argues safety nets are necessary to combat poverty and misfortune, while others argue they provide disincentives to work and fail to improve social mobility for the poor.
> 
> During the Great Depression, the federal government established America’s first safety net programs. Since then, programs have been designed or expanded to broaden their reach. Sen considers these programs “fixed institutional arrangements,” and argues they are fundamental to freedom because they fortify people’s capabilities.
> 
> **The Social Security Act:** Passed in 1935, the Social Security Act provides unemployment compensation and is a major source of income for the retired, unemployed, and people with disabilities. It’s currently the largest safety net program in the US, serving about 62 million Americans.
> 
> **Head Start:** Established in 1964, Head Start is a pre-kindergarten education program designed to reduce disparities in educational attainment between rich and poor children. It currently serves around 900,000 primarily low-income kids.
> 
> **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program:** Also established in 1964, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly referred to as “food stamps,” provides food vouchers as a means of fighting hunger and food insecurity.
> 
> **Medicare/Medicaid:** In 1965, the US government established Medicare, which provides health insurance to people 65 and over, and Medicaid, which provides coverage to low-income Americans. Combined, more than 100 million people are enrolled in these programs.
> 
> **Federal Pell Grant Program:** In 1972, the Federal Pell Grant Program became law. It provides tuition and other assistance to low-income college students.
> 
> **Earned Income Tax Credit:** The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), established in 1975, is a tax credit available to working people of modest income. In 2015, nearly 50 million taxpayers received benefits through the EITC.
> 
> **The Affordable Care Act:** Passed in 2010, the Affordable Care Act subsidizes the private health insurance of low-income people. It also expands Medicaid by offering matching federal funds to states.
> 
> In addition to these programs, others provide unemployment insurance, monetary aid to poor families, and children’s health insurance.
