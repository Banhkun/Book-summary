## Chapter 8: Population, Food, and Famine

Another problem that developing countries face is hunger and famine. Sen explains these problems, what's wrong with current approaches, and how his approach to development addresses a rapidly growing population and food supply issues.

### The Malthus Model

Sen argues the answer to the pressures of a rapidly growing population lies in expanding freedom, not restricting it. Many poor nations with rapidly growing populations have adopted freedom-restricting policies on the basis of a now-debunked population growth model**** developed by Thomas Malthus in the 19th century**.**

**According to Malthus, because population grows exponentially while food supply grows linearly, famines are unavoidable.** When the population grows too large for the food supply to sustain, he argued, people will starve. In order to prevent this, Malthus thought the only remedy was for the government to adopt policies of population control.

**The Malthusian model has been roundly refuted by modern economists for ignoring technological innovations, which have enabled sizable increases in food production.** Despite this, there are still concerns about the impact of a rapidly growing population on food supply, because the logistics of getting food where it’s most needed remains a challenge.

(Shortform note: When _Development of Freedom_ was published in 1999, the world population was slightly more than 6 billion people. As of 2022, there are more than 7 billion people on Earth, with most of this population growth happening in developing nations. East Asia and the Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa are the two regions where population growth has increased most rapidly since 2000.)

### Is There a Global Food Shortage?

Given the pace of global population growth and the prevalence of hunger in the world, many people have speculated that there simply isn’t enough food to go around. But in Sen’s view, **hunger is not a consequence of limited food supply.**

Sen shows that food production per capita has increased substantially since the 1970s in every region of the globe except Africa. What’s more, the largest increases came in China and India—the two regions that have experienced the most rapid population growth over the period.

So **despite their growing populations, China and India have managed to _increase_ the food available to their people.**

As for Africa, which saw a reduction in food production per capita, Sen argues this problem is part of a much larger issue of political and economic mismanagement and not about food production itself.

#### The Global Price of Food

In addition to there being more food to go around, Sen notes that food is more affordable as well.**** Compared to 1950-1952, the prices of four staple crops (wheat, rice, sorghum, and maize) have all decreased by at least 60%.

**Despite occasional fluctuations, the general trend has been for food prices to drop, meaning even the poor have more access to food than they did previously.**

(Shortform note: Since 2000, global cereal production has increased by around 44%, and the percentage of underweight children in Sub-Saharan Africa has fallen from 25% to 17%. The world has enough food to go around, and it can be imported in places where changes in climate or economic arrangement have made growing food more challenging.)

### Population Control

Despite an increasing food supply, some nations have resorted to population control as a response to rising population growth rates.

In judging the effect of coercive population control, Sen asks three questions:

  1. Is this sort of coercion just?
  2. What are the unintended consequences of population control?
  3. What happens to population levels without coercive measures?



Sen’s preferred idea of justice considers both the intrinsic value and the instrumental value of freedom. Therefore, he weighs the freedom of families to choose how many children to have as well as the impact of that decision on society.

#### Intrinsic Importance of Family Planning

Sen believes the right of couples to choose the size of their family is a freedom people value for its own sake. Government responses to violations of coerced family planning policies also violate other freedoms.

In one example from China, Sen says the family planning police pulled a family from their home then blew up the home with explosives. Next to the rubble, the officials painted a warning to others to obey the government policy.

India, too, has pressured citizens to comply with population targets. For example, in order to receive some public benefits, recipients had to agree to be sterilized. In some areas, citizens with more than two children were barred from running for local office.

> **Coerced Sterilization in Modern India**
> 
> Although many of India’s more draconian family planning policies have been abandoned, some are still in effect. Sterilization camps, where women are “herded like cattle” and surgically sterilized, are still common. Although these procedures are nominally voluntary, there’s often intense public pressure for women to undergo them.
> 
> Health activists argue that pressuring women in this way reflects regressive attitudes toward women’s role in family planning. They blame poor education and lack of access to contraceptives on the current predicament, and they encourage the Indian government to prioritize family planning education.

#### Unintended Consequences of Population Control

Sen says that China has become worse off due to its one-child policy. Since China’s implementation of its “one-child policy” in 1979, its fertility rates have dropped considerably. By 1999, the rate was 1.9, slightly below the replacement level of two children per couple.**** By contrast, India’s was 3.1, while the average among other low-income countries was 5.0.

However, Sen argues the one-child policy had unforeseen negative consequences as well. **China’s infant mortality rate is much higher than that of the Indian state of Kerala** , despite both places having similar rates when China enacted its policy in 1979. Sen believes this is**because the “one-child policy” in China, which has an anti-female bias, caused neglect of female babies.** Additionally (as mentioned in Chapter 7), sex-selective abortion increased substantially under the one-child policy.

> **China’s One-Child Policy**
> 
> Designed to combat a rapidly growing population, China’s one-child policy has had far-reaching ramifications. While the policy was in effect between 1980 and 2016, China contends it prevented 400 million births.
> 
> Although population growth slowed, the policy also caused a host of demographic consequences. Because of the social preference for males, the one-child policy led to sex-selective abortion and abandonment and neglect of baby girls. As a result, the male-to-female ratio has become skewed, with about 34 million more men than women in the country.
> 
> As Sen notes, the Chinese government often used force to ensure compliance with the policy. To circumvent this, many children born in violation of the policy were kept undocumented.

#### A Better Way to Reduce Fertility Rates

Sen argues that social development, like education and increased women’s agency, is more effective in slowing population growth than coercive population control policies.

Similar economic and social development occurred in Bangladesh, where the fertility rate dropped from 6.1 to 3.4 in only 16 years, without an official population control policy. In Kerala, India, fertility rates dropped more quickly than in China—despite having some of the least restrictive family planning policies in India.

**As nations develop economically and socially, it’s typical for fertility rates to fall on their own,** for two reasons:

  1. **Social changes shift what is expected of women** , putting a greater emphasis on their contributions outside of the home.
  2. **Female education and job opportunities give women more options** than to simply bear children.



Because of this, and their violation of freedom, Sen believes coercive population control measures are futile.

> **The Demographic Transition Model**
> 
> The demographic transition model provides an explanation for how fertility rates naturally decline as people become richer, rendering population control measures unnecessary. There are five stages, which track changes in birth rate and mortality rates of a population.
> 
> **Stage 1:** Birth rates and mortality rates are both high, leading to a relatively stable population. This stage applies to hunter-gatherer societies.
> 
> **Stage 2:** Modern medicine reduces mortality rates, especially among infants and children, while birth rates remain high. This leads to rapid population growth. Most of the least developed nations fit this category.
> 
> **Stage 3:** Birth rates gradually decline as a result of access to contraception, enhanced women’s rights, and economic growth. Many developing countries are currently in stage 3.
> 
> **Stage 4:** Birth and mortality rates are both low, and population size stabilizes. Most developed nations fall into this category.
> 
> **Stage 5:** Birth rates fall substantially below replacement level, and the elderly population increases relative to the working population. Nations like China, Japan, and the US are at or nearing this level, although migration (which is not included in the model), also has an impact on population.

### The Cause of Famines

Sen believes**all famines are avoidable.** Rather than an imbalance between population and food supply, sudden food insecurity is a result of government failure to respond to fluctuations in the supply or price of food.

#### How Famines Happen

In order to reduce the effects of famines, Sen says it’s vital to understand three truths about how and why they occur:

  1. **Famines can occur even without a drop in the overall food supply.** In 1974, Bangladesh suffered a famine despite having _higher_ food availability per person than in the previous three years.
  2. **Famines rarely affect an entire population.** Sen says most famines affect less than 5-10% of the population.
  3. **Starvation is usually not responsible for most casualties in a famine.** Diseases made worse by undernourishment, poor sanitation, and migration are most responsible for the suffering.



> **A New Cause of Famine?**
> 
> Sen argues that all famines are preventable. However, when _Development as Freedom_ was published in 2000, the only cause of current famines was violent conflict. Since then, the famine in Madagascar has changed traditional thinking about what leads to famine.
> 
> Madagascar is the only country whose famine is not caused by conflict. Instead, it’s generally understood that climate change has contributed to the current four-decade drought currently experienced by the island nation. The UN calls it a “climate-change” famine, and food prices have soared as a result. Although Sen didn’t mention the impact of changing climate on famine, he would likely argue that the government must intervene to ensure Madagascar is able to avoid further suffering.

#### Preventing Famines

Sen identifies**three keys to preventing famines: private markets, free trade, and government support.**

  1. **Private markets** provide incentives for people to produce and distribute food.
  2. **Free trade** allows people to convert their labor power into food.
  3. **Government support** enables famines to be avoided by offering supplemental assistance when there is a recession, natural disaster, or price shocks.



Sen also says**it’s not difficult or expensive for governments to prevent famines, and he identifies three ways societies can guard against them.**

First, if a famine affects 10% of the population (which would be very high), it would take only around 3% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the government to supplement the _full_ incomes of the people affected. Even in the Indian famine of 1344-1345, the emperor was able to successfully implement a famine relief program by replacing incomes.

Second, overall economic growth is a much better way to prevent famines than increased food production.**** Japan, South Korea, and Singapore all experienced substantial drops in per-person food production as their economies grew and switched to manufacturing, yet their populations remained well-fed, as they could afford to import food. Also, if food supply dwindles too much, rich nations with strong industrial bases can import food to compensate for the relative reduction in their agricultural sector.

**Third,** no famine has occurred in a functioning democracy. Democracy provides an incentive for government officials to take the steps necessary to alleviate food shortages.

Sen blames government mismanagement for the Chinese famine that occurred during the Great Leap Forward of 1958-1961, in which around 30 million suffered from starvation and related illnesses.**** Sen argues that the widespread mismanagement that caused the suffering simply wouldn’t have been tolerated in a democracy. Democracy makes people aware of the extent of the damage (through a free press) and gives the people a means for addressing it (through elections).

(Shortform note: While Sen puts the responsibility for famine relief on the affected country, the charitable organization Oxfam has a five-step plan to prevent famine, including outside help. It includes providing clean water, encouraging proper sanitation, emergency food and cash assistance, supplying seeds for farming, and government accountability. This kind of private intervention can help prevent famine when government dysfunction is the cause.)

### Famine and Alienation

Sen argues that when the government is alienated from the people it serves, this can lead to (or exacerbate) famine, because the government isn’t as likely to intervene on their behalf.**** The Irish Potato Famine serves as an illustration.

#### Case Study: The Irish Potato Famine

Sen says **the Irish Potato Famine could have been prevented through British intervention** , but a British sense of superiority led them to neglect the Irish people.

The famine decimated Ireland in the 1840s, when food production fell dramatically because of a potato blight. **Despite widespread hunger, Ireland continued to _export_ food. **Market forces directed much of the available food in Ireland to where it could be purchased at the highest price: in this case, England, which was relatively richer.

##### Why Didn’t England Intervene?

When the famine occurred, Ireland was still part of the British Empire.**** While mainland Britain had social safety nets in place that provided assistance to the unemployed (known as the Poor Laws), Ireland’s version of these programs was watered-down and did little to help.

Sen says this**unequal treatment stemmed from British disdain for Ireland.** Many in Britain attributed poverty in Ireland to laziness and incompetence. British officials also blamed the Irish for their overdependence on potatoes as a staple crop. **This kind of “blaming the victim” is common when famines occur in colonized areas, such as India under British rule.** Such a posture prevents governments from taking decisive action to relieve the suffering of their subjects.

> **Legacy of the Great Famine**
> 
> The potato famine that struck Ireland from 1846 to 1851 has had lasting implications on its demographics and culture.
> 
> Prior to the famine, Ireland had a population of around 8 million. Because of the widespread suffering and emigration the famine caused, by 1911 its population dropped to 4.4 million. Even today, Ireland’s population has yet to reach its pre-famine levels. Most of those who left Ireland came to the US, which now has around 32 million people who identify as having Irish heritage.
> 
> This emigration caused a cultural consequence as well: At the time of the famine, about half of the Irish population spoke Gaelic. By 1891, there were fewer than 700,000 Gaelic speakers in Ireland, as English became the predominant language.
