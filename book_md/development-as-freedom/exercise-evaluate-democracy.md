Sen says all people deserve the right to elect their leaders democratically, and he argues that democracy facilitates economic development.

Do you think prioritizing democracy in poor nations is the best way for them to develop? Why or why not?

Would you be willing to tolerate an authoritarian government like Singaporeâ€™s, if it managed to achieve sustained economic growth? Why or why not?

Do you think foreign nations or international organizations are right to try to impose democracy on poor countries that are currently authoritarian? Why or why not?
