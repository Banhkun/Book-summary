## 1-Page Summary

In _The Power Elite_ , American sociologist C. Wright Mills claims that **the United States is controlled by a small group of powerful economic, military, and political elites.** By consolidating wealth and power over time, these “power elites” have exploited American institutions for their own benefit. Now, they’re unaccountable to the people and free to act as immorally as they please. Writing in 1956, Mills suggests that the decisions, failures, and successes of the power elite are what truly determine the course of the United States.

Our guide to _The Power Elite_ will explore how this group solidified its rule over the United States as well as how the American people have lost the ability to impact political change. Through our commentary, we’ll further explore American history that informs (or challenges) Mills’s theory—both before and after the book’s publication in 1956. We’ll also offer alternative theories that try to explain the relationship between power, American institutions, and the public.

(Shortform note: To understand Mills’s goal in writing _The Power Elite_ , it helps to understand how he views sociology as a field. In his later work _The Sociological Imagination_ , Mills outlines a theory of sociology as a tool to bridge the gap between history and biography. This means connecting individual circumstances to broader social and political forces—for example, by showing an _individual’s_ high debt was caused in part by systemic economic issues. By making these connections, sociology gives people tools to understand the world around them and ideas for improving it. Through this lens, _The Power Elite_ is Mills’s attempt to connect the development of elite rule to the average American’s feelings of political and economic powerlessness.)

> **Critics of Mills’s “Doomsaying”**
> 
> Many critics of _The Power Elite_ and of Mills in general argue he has a tendency to overstate or exaggerate in his work, offering dire warnings and predictions. Some dismiss Mills’s work entirely, viewing it as alarmist leftist propaganda lacking academic substance. This is in part because Mills’s conception of a “power elite” is his version of _elite theory_ , a common feature of Marxism and other leftist scholarship. According to elite theory, a few coordinated individuals control a majority of power regardless of democratic elections.
> 
> Other critics say that while Mills has good ideas, he tends to present them in a too-theatrical or even conspiratorial way. Particularly, critics decry his bold claims about coordination among the power elite, their nefarious goals, and the powerlessness of the American people (which we’ll discuss in Part 2). In the decades since _The Power Elite_ came out, it has become an important part of the American sociological canon. However, some still argue that his work tends toward style over substance, saying Mills angrily criticizes parts of society without offering alternatives.

### Part 1: Defining the Power Elite

To start off, we’ll explore how Mills defines the power elite—who they are and how they operate. According to Mills, **the power elite are leaders in business, the military, and politics who have outsized influence on the country.** These elites aren’t stuck in one particular sphere, but instead often transition from private companies to government positions and back again throughout their careers. What truly defines the power elite then is less what they do and more how much influence they have over the economy, politics, and the lives of average Americans.

To elaborate on his definition, Mills emphasizes three aspects of the power elite: **social coordination, varying levels of competence, and a focus on money over morality.**

#### Social Coordination

According to Mills, **the power elite is a coordinated class rather than a bunch of disorganized and competing individuals.** Besides working together in their professional lives, the power elite have a much deeper level of _social_ integration. Most of the power elite go to the same exclusive preparatory schools and universities and join the same social clubs. These social institutions aren’t just symbols of prestige—they also allow the young, up-and-coming elite to network, get to know each other, and develop a common way of viewing the world.

(Shortform note: To understand Mills’s theory of elite coordination, let’s look at an opposing view: the theory of _checks and balances_. According to this theory, competition among political elites prevents them from gaining too much power. Famously, the United States Constitution contains a number of rules allowing different branches of government to limit or “check” each other’s power, something many conservative and liberal analysts alike argue is crucial for democracy. Mills’s critique suggests checks and balances are flawed because they fail to recognize that political competition isn’t between branches of government but rather between overall interests—so when elites control all three branches, they will _choose_ not to limit the power of their class.)

#### Varying Competence

Mills strongly disagrees with the idea that elites are uniquely competent or intelligent. He notes that many modern elites are born to already-wealthy families and merely inherit a great deal of their influence. Others who join the power elite do so not by displaying incredible competence, but by getting existing elites to know and trust them (often by joining the various social institutions discussed above). **Elites don’t need to be competent to exercise their power** either, says Mills—they can and do hire committees, advisors, and consultants to help them make decisions.

(Shortform note: For an example of the kinds of advisors helping powerful people make decisions, we can look to when _The Power Elite_ was written. Mills wrote during the rise of the _think tank_ —groups of academics who do research, write articles, or even draft legislation on behalf of governments, businesses, and other political organizations. After World War II, think tanks evolved from temporary study groups into full-time staffed institutions, particularly in the United States. Think tanks typically work toward a particular goal or take a particular political stance, providing ideas and research that similar-minded politicians, bureaucrats, and corporate executives can use to achieve their own ends.)

#### Money and Power Over Morality

According to Mills, being elite requires a person to emphasize money and power over everything else—**moral concerns and values only get in the way.** The bureaucratic and corporate structures of the elite allow them to distance themselves from the harm their actions might cause—instead of directly witnessing the consequences, they just hear about the political or monetary benefits of those actions in a boardroom meeting. Meanwhile, everyone below the elites in the hierarchy can avoid feeling guilty about their actions because they’re just following orders from above.

(Shortform note: The corporate and bureaucratic structures Mills discusses can lead to interesting moral dilemmas: When an immoral act is committed in a corporate context, should emphasis be placed on punishing the corporation as a whole, the guilty individuals within it, or both? For example, in the 1980s, the US company National Semiconductor deliberately failed to properly test computer chips it sold to the US Department of Defense (DoD). While National Semiconductor paid a fine as punishment, it refused to give the DoD a list of individuals responsible for the fraud—while the DoD wanted to punish each individual who participated in the fraud, National Semiconductor argued only the corporation as a whole was responsible.)

### Part 2: The Creation of the Power Elite

After explaining who the power elite are, Mills then discusses **how they came to control a majority of wealth and power in America.** Mills says this process began after the American Civil War, as political and technological developments allowed businessmen, military generals, and politicians to exercise their influence more broadly. Those who took advantage of these developments gained enough power to shape their respective institutions, outcompete their rivals, and form a new national class of elites. In Part 2 of our guide, we’ll explore the three main institutions where Mills believes the power elite developed:

  1. **Corporations**
  2. **The military**
  3. **Civilian government**



#### Institution #1: Corporations

1\. Mills starts by discussing how **an increasingly small number of corporations influence every aspect of life in America.** This is the result of a long process of corporate centralization of wealth and power starting after the Civil War. Mills explores this process in three steps: competing to industrialize; shifting leadership to executives; and, finally, defining American life.

##### 1) Competing to Industrialize

In the decades following the Civil War, Mills says **there was intense competition among American corporations**. New technological developments like railroads and telegrams opened up crucial new markets by connecting formerly isolated towns and communities across the country—and corporations fought viciously for control over these markets. However, these competitions eventually had clear winners, as lax government regulation and corruption allowed larger corporations to buy up or force out smaller competitors. Corporate leaders during this period were the men who founded, expanded, and owned these companies. Examples include 19th-century industrialists like Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and J.P. Morgan, who created massive corporations that controlled the steel, oil, and banking industries respectively. As a consequence of these historical developments, writes Mills, **the vast majority of any given industry in America is now controlled by five or fewer corporations.**

> **Bigger Is Better: Economies of Scale**
> 
> Why do industries tend to be dominated by a few large companies? Why do periods of relatively lax government regulation make this process easier? The answers to these questions have to do in part with _economies of scale_ , or cost savings a company benefits from as it grows in size. The larger a company is, the more it produces—and the more it produces, the lower its costs are per unit produced. This allows large companies to keep prices lower than those of their smaller competitors, which often means smaller companies lose their customers and go out of business.
> 
> For example, imagine two cookie companies: Big Cookie and Small Cookie. Both companies pay $1 million on fixed costs like cookie factories, research for new recipes, and salaries of managers and executives. Big Cookie produces 100,000 cookies per day, while Small Cookie produces 50,000 cookies per day. Therefore, Big Cookie only spends $10 on fixed costs per cookie, while Small Cookie spends $20 on fixed costs per cookie. In addition, Big Cookie can buy ingredients in bulk at a better deal than Small Cookie, meaning they spend less on ingredients per cookie. Because of their lower costs, Big Cookie can sell cookies cheaper than Small Cookie—eventually forcing Small Cookie to close.
> 
> Government intervention can prevent this from happening by keeping businesses from growing too large or protecting smaller businesses. But, as previously stated, the decades after the American Civil War were notorious for lax regulations on business, meaning large businesses could dominate.

##### 2) Shifting Leadership to Executives

Once industries were dominated by a few major corporations, the intense competition between them slowed down or even stopped altogether, explains Mills. He argues this was because of a shift in corporate leadership from founders to executives and stockholders. Unlike the founders of the past, **this new “executive class” was less concerned with the success of their _specific_ corporation and more concerned with the success of their industry and of corporate power in general. **Mills suggests two reasons why this is the case:

1)**** Most executives don’t create or own a majority of their corporations—instead, they’re just hired to _run_ them. This means they don’t have personal incentives to compete—they get paid whether their corporation grows, shrinks, or stays the same. They also own stock in many different companies, meaning their financial well-being isn’t tied to their specific corporation’s success.

2) In addition, executives work for multiple corporations over the course of their careers. This also disincentivizes competition—executives have no reason to compete with and potentially harm their future employers.

(Shortform note: In his earlier work _White Collar_ , Mills claims this change in corporate structure and the subsequent growth of the “white collar” worker—salespeople, middle-managers, and so on—has contributed to a major cultural shift in middle-class America. Mills explains that new corporate structures and ideologies demand people view each other as tools toward a specific end: Managers see their subordinates as tools for accomplishing tasks given by executives, while salespeople see the people around them as potential customers and therefore “instruments” of their own success. By viewing the people around them as means to an end, says Mills, people alienate themselves from genuine human connection and become isolated.)

##### 3) Defining American Life

Mills explains that by working together toward their overall interests, the executive class and stockholders have consolidated their power and now dominate major portions of American life. While unforeseen circumstances (financial collapses, major world events, and so on) might cause _individual_ companies or executives to lose power, the _collective_ power and wealth of corporations remain very stable. They use this power to influence things like what people eat, where they live, the media they watch, and their political lives. An average individual, on the other hand, doesn’t have the wealth or influence to challenge corporate power in a significant way.

> **Spanning the Globe**
> 
> Though Mills stresses the extent of corporate influence over _American_ life, he doesn’t fully predict how large corporations would spread _internationally_. To understand why, let’s examine the world economy when _The Power Elite_ was written—and how it’s changed since.
> 
> In 1956, the global economy was for the most part divided into the communist and capitalist worlds. These countries didn’t trade with one another, creating two separate global economies at once. In addition, the process of decolonization was destabilizing the already fragile economies of many Western colonial empires—and also creating new nations, some of which became communist themselves. Therefore, while American corporations held influence or established a presence in other countries, they couldn’t exist all over the world the way they do now.
> 
> But from the 1970s onward, many of the communist countries either reformed their economies to allow for global trade or collapsed altogether. With the fall of the Soviet Union, economic globalization skyrocketed and corporations—many of them American—were free to spread across the world. An iconic symbol of this process was the first McDonald’s restaurant opening in Russia in 1990 to a line of around 38,000 people.

#### Institution #2: The Military

After discussing the power of corporate institutions, Mills then discusses the second institution in which American power has centralized: the military. He suggests that while the United States has been in violent conflict for almost all of its history, the nature of _who_ fights and why they fight has changed drastically in the 20th century. He explains this process in three steps: using temporary militias, creating the professional officer corps, and going to war indefinitely.

##### 1) Using Temporary Militias

Mills explains that **from America’s founding until the 20th century, the military was relatively decentralized and separate from civilian political power.** Local militias made up of citizens rather than professional soldiers did a majority of America’s fighting, usually on a small scale. A larger, permanent military bureaucracy wasn’t really necessary—when conflict came, citizens would organize into local militias, fight toward a specific political or economic end (often taking land from American Indians), and then disband.

Even during bigger conflicts like the American Civil War, soldiers _and_ officers were mostly citizens organized into small, decentralized militias. Mills explains that the average general of the late 19th century wasn’t educated, saw plenty of combat firsthand, and rose through the ranks based on performance in battle or seniority as a soldier. While some of these generals transitioned into political life later on, it was always separate from their military careers—they advocated for their specific parties and civilian government interests rather than for the military as an institution.

(Shortform note: The term “militia” in American history is relatively broad, referring to two very different kinds of military organizations. First are “organized militias,” or the militaries of individual states—the Florida National Guard, for example. While organized militias are made up of civilian volunteers or conscripts instead of professional soldiers, they do tend to have formal military training and command structures. These organized militias fought the majority of small-scale conflicts in 18th and 19th-century American history. Disorganized militias, on the other hand, can refer to federal, state, or local militias made up of _any_ able-bodied citizens. They have little to no training or structure and usually only function as impromptu defense forces.)

##### 2) Creating the Professional Officer Corps

The next step of American military centralization began at the turn of the 20th century, explains Mills. At this time, the US military started replacing decentralized militias with a professional officer corps. This system created very different kinds of officers: men who were highly educated in military beliefs and values, who often saw little to no combat and who were deliberately kept separate from civilian life. These officers were promoted not for winning battles or fighting well, but instead for following strict hierarchies and chains of command over the course of their careers.

During World War I, the United States vastly expanded the military as an emergency wartime measure—one that included close coordination among the civilian government, the military, and private industry. This was only temporary, however, and the government dismantled much of its military after the end of the conflict. This showed that **while the military was increasingly centralized and hierarchical, it was still a tool of civilian government.**

(Shortform note: Though Mills says Congress creating the professional officer corps at the turn of the 20th century was a turning point in military centralization, some scholars argue it was actually just the culmination of a century-long internal process. Following America’s poor performance in the War of 1812, many officers and bureaucrats coordinated to “professionalize” the military despite having little support from Congress. Professionalization meant standardizing and regulating military training and practices—which meant a central authority determined more of what the military did. From this perspective, Congress establishing a professional officer corps was less a sudden centralizing shift and more the formalization of an existing process.)

##### 3) Going to War Indefinitely

The largest growth in military power and influence started a few decades later with World War II. Much like in World War I, the military, civilian government, and private industry worked together during World War II. However, US involvement in the war was much larger, meaning there was more money involved in the war economy and more integration necessary to coordinate the war effort. Most significantly, Mills argues that **this collaboration didn’t end after World War II.** Instead of dismantling the expanded military and returning to a peacetime economy, the United States entered the Cold War—a conflict with no clear end that allowed the country to maintain its expanded war economy and wartime integration indefinitely.

(Shortform note: Collaboration during World War II extended beyond just the elites—it also included leaders and members of labor unions. Formally, unions throughout the country agreed not to strike for the duration of the war; even the most militant left-wing unions refrained from striking out of solidarity with the Soviet Union’s war effort against the Nazis. “Wildcat” strikes—strikes against the wishes of union leadership—still occurred during the war, though never for long. When the war ended, so too did the no-strike pledge, leading to an enormous wave of strikes in 1945 and 1946. However, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and purges of labor leaders greatly weakened American labor power, allowing elites to continue collaborating with far less organized opposition.)

Permanent wartime integration allows top generals to gain influence over corporations and politicians alike. Politicians can use the strict hierarchy and obedience of the military to efficiently accomplish their political goals and bypass the democratic political process, meaning they invest more money and power into the hands of the military. Then, generals use the inflated military budget to pour massive amounts of money into private corporations that do business with the military—becoming the largest customer of these companies and gaining a great deal of influence over them.

(Shortform note: While large-scale collaboration among corporations, politicians, and the military exists to this day, Mills’s claims about the influence of specific generals are far more specific to his time. In the 1950s, generals like Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower were beloved and popular figures for their roles in World War II. They leveraged this public support to try and gain power—MacArthur consistently challenged the authority of US president Harry S. Truman until Truman eventually fired him, a massively unpopular move. Eisenhower, on the other hand, won the 1952 presidential election in a landslide, and military spending spiked during his time in office.)

#### Institution #3: Civilian Government

After discussing the centralization of the American military, Mills then turns to “civilian government”: elected officials and appointed bureaucrats. He argues that federal bureaucratic agencies have slowly gained more and more power than elected officials—officials who are far more accountable to the American people—at every level. This process had three main steps: using party machinery, growing the bureaucracy, and appointing elites.

##### 1) Using Party Machinery

Mills explains that before the 20th century, **American politicians mainly worked within the political party “patronage” system:** Over the course of their careers, they started in local party politics, met party mentors and allies, and received pay-offs and positions of power based on loyalty. This was also true for America’s **“civil service,” or government bureaucrats hired for specific technical positions** —everything from school superintendents to chiefs of police. These positions were “rewards” given out to loyal party members. This system was built on corruption and graft, with people often exercising political power for their own personal benefit and giving positions to people they trusted.

(Shortform note: While the era of large patronage networks and political ‘machines’ is generally believed to have ended in the early 20th century, versions of it continued to operate up to and even after _The Power Elite_ was written—especially in the Democratic Party and in the South. Political machines controlled or influenced politics on a local and state level well into the 20th century, like through Augusta Georgia’s “Cracker Party” or Huey Long’s control of Louisiana politics. Political machines even impacted federal politics—Richard J. Daley’s Cook County Democratic Party allegedly miscounted votes in the 1960 presidential election to favor Democrat John F. Kennedy, though this is still debated today.)

##### 2) Growing the Bureaucracy

In the early 20th century, presidents like Theodore Roosevelt and especially Franklin Delano Roosevelt expanded the civil service and dismantled much of the patronage system of the past, explains Mills. This contributed to the centralization of power in two distinct ways:

**1)** **The expansion of the civil service invested more power in federal non-elected positions.** New federal agencies within the executive branch had power over major aspects of American life. Since these positions were appointed, those filling them were only accountable to those in power and not the public at large. For example, monetary policy (how much money to print) was a _major_ subject of debate in early American politics among voters and elected officials. However, in 1913, the government established the Federal Reserve—a civil service agency staffed by appointed officials that controlled the country’s monetary policy directly.

(Shortform note: To contextualize Mills’s concerns with the growing power of bureaucrats, we can look to one of his major influences: German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920). Weber believed overgrown bureaucracy to be the main threat to democratic and free society. According to Weber, a more complex state requires more technically skilled people to manage it—meaning the more complicated a state becomes, the more power skilled bureaucrats gain. This is because they not only have more to manage, but also because they are the only ones who know how to manage the state. From this perspective, we can see why Mills fears the growth of the bureaucratic state might make the country less democratic.)

**2)** **Reforming the patronage system took wealth and power away from low-level party members.** The patronage system made elites provide lower-level officials with jobs in exchange for their loyalty. While this was blatant corruption and graft, it also allowed for some degree of upward mobility and elite accountability—if elites ever stopped providing benefits and opportunities to those beneath them, then they would lose the support of their base.

Reforms of this era cracked down on bribery and graft, but they crucially still allowed elites to control government positions. This meant that while lower-level politicians still kept or lost their jobs based on loyalty to elites, they weren’t able to hold elites accountable in return by demanding upward mobility and wealth. Mills therefore claims that despite these reforms, **America still doesn’t have a merit-based and apolitical civil service** since politicians can create or destroy civil service jobs at will.

(Shortform note: In the years since Mills wrote _The Power Elite_ , further changes to bureaucracy—specifically the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which remains largely unchanged to this day—have given federal employees additional job protections. Some critics even argue that under current standards, it’s too difficult to fire underperforming federal employees. They use the analogy of government as a business to explain their argument: Low-level civil servants and bureaucrats need to be accountable to higher-ups just like low-level employees need to be accountable to their bosses. This helps ensure efficiency and productivity.)

##### 3) Appointing Elites

Mills argues that the larger, stronger bureaucratic agencies in the executive branch allow elites to consolidate their power further. He believes **these agencies allow elites inside and outside the government to control major American political decisions** —things like war and peace, the shape of the economy, and how power is distributed. What the average American sees as politics (elections, Congress, and so on) is actually just a mid-level, intermediary process for determining _how_ to carry out the will of these elite few.

For example, Mills notes that **modern American liberals and conservatives have the same overall goal in economic policy: private ownership of large corporations that determine major aspects of American life**. The difference is in their approach: Liberals believe safety nets and increased public spending (though less profitable in the short term) maintain the long-term stability of the corporate economic system. Conservatives, however, believe in maximizing short-term corporate profit by cutting taxes and government spending.

Top bureaucratic positions (secretary of defense, secretary of state, head of the CIA, and so on) are often given to corporate and military elites, rather than career politicians or bureaucrats—allowing for further integration and centralization of the American power elite. For example, President Eisenhower’s initial cabinet was jokingly referred to as “nine millionaires and a plumber” because it consisted of nine corporate executives and the president of a pipefitter union.

> **Bureaucratic Behemoths**
> 
> To contextualize Mills’s grave concerns about elite bureaucracy, we can look to one of _The Power Elite_ ’s major influences: Franz Leopold Neumann’s _Behemoth_ , a 1942 book outlining the internal structure and workings of Nazi Germany. Neumann defined the Nazi state as a chaotic blend of private monopolies and government institutions operating with little to no oversight.
> 
> According to Neumann, this mess of private and public institutions had two main things in common: First, they were ultimately all accountable only to those at the top—Hitler and his closest allies. Second, they collectively controlled every aspect of life in Nazi Germany. Neumann’s analysis of the Nazi state helps inform why Mills is so alarmed at what he views as an unaccountable blend of the military, large corporations and government bureaucracy in the United States.

### Part 3: The American People and Power

After discussing how the elite has consolidated power in America, Mills then explores **how the American people have lost power.** He argues that due to changes in media and political organization, many Americans feel powerless to influence their political circumstances—a situation that has contributed to a broad national sense of unease and loss of control. **Mills suggests that this sense of unease can eventually lead to large-scale political violence**.

In Part 3 of our guide, we’ll explore how the American people have traditionally exercised political power and how they’ve lost this power over time. In particular, we’ll look at the three main institutions that define the relationship between the American people and their political circumstances:

  1. **The media**
  2. **Political organizations**
  3. **Intellectuals**



#### Institution #1: The Media

Mills argues that **the growing centralization of the media has taken power and influence away from the American people**. This centralization first occurred when new technologies like radio and television made it easier for a few people to reach many, while lax regulation allowed a few major corporations to dominate the media industry.

Mills believes that media centralization has taken power away from the American people for two main reasons:

##### 1) Fewer Opinions

**Centralization of media has reduced the number of opinions and viewpoints available to the public**. Mills suggests there used to be many different opinions, viewpoints, and political narratives offered by various smaller media outlets. However, media centralization has slowly destroyed these smaller sources, meaning fewer and fewer corporations control more and more aspects of public opinion. Mills doesn’t believe that all major news sources agree on everything, but he does believe that none of them question or challenge the power of the elite.

##### 2) Less Discussion

**Average people are unable to respond to or challenge mass media in meaningful ways**. Previously, if an individual wanted to challenge a media opinion, they could either contact the media source directly, present their opposing opinion in a different media outlet, or discuss their opinion with members of their community. However, the centralization of media makes this all unlikely or even impossible—individuals don’t have platforms to express these opinions in a way that others will notice, and they can’t act on their opinions in any significant way (as we discuss in the next section).

> **The Internet and Centralization**
> 
> Has the development of the internet over the past 30 years counteracted the media centralization Mills discusses, or has it just been another example of it? Let’s look at arguments on both sides, addressing Mills’s concerns about the impact of media centralization:
> 
> **The internet is decentralized:** Political commentators often contrast the internet with television to show its decentralized nature and democratizing effect. While television is a one-way medium controlled in large part by a few major networks, the internet allows everyone to communicate with each other and establish their own websites and communities. This addresses both of Mills’s major concerns, allowing everyone to express their opinions, discuss political issues with one another, or even plan activist movements and protests.
> 
> **The internet is centralized:** Skeptics or outright critics of internet decentralization view it as a medium that has rapidly become just as centralized as others. They note that voices on the internet don’t carry even remotely equal weight, with a few select websites or users receiving far more attention than others. This means that while everyone can have a voice or discuss an issue, they may not be heard or have any impact. And critics point out that much like television networks before, a major portion of internet use is attributable to a few major companies, such as Netflix and Facebook.

#### Institution #2: Political Organizations

In addition to the media, Mills argues that **American political organizations have also centralized over time, taking power and influence away from the people**. Traditionally, an average American could influence local community politics, which then could organize with other communities to influence state and federal politics. For example, John joins a union, then can influence it through regular meetings and elections. Then, his union works with other unions to form a broad political base, with money and votes to influence government policy and elections.

Mills explains that as the government centralized, these political organizations centralized as well. This is for two main reasons:

  1. Smaller political organizations are less effective at influencing large, centralized government bureaucracy—since they have less power and money, they’re sidelined in favor of those who do.
  2. As electoral politics became less accountable to the people (as previously discussed), those wanting to be heard flocked to political organizations, causing them to grow in size.



He suggests that this led to a shift in the structure of organizations: Instead of many autonomous communities coming together to create an organization,**a select group of executives and bureaucrats now control massive national volunteer organizations.** Members of these groups are as disconnected from real power as they are in politics—they’re single members out of millions.

(Shortform note: To better understand Mills’s points, let’s take a look at the structure of nonprofit political organizations. Much like corporations, nonprofit political organizations are led by a board of directors that votes on leadership positions like president or CEO. Unlike corporations, however, nonprofits don’t choose their board of directors from shareholders. Instead, whoever starts the nonprofit can decide how to choose directors on their own. This means in a large nonprofit, decisions about leadership are generally made only by those at the highest level.)

#### Institution #3: The Intellectual Class

Mills argues that traditionally, intellectuals in America served to challenge or explain political dynamics to the American people. This helped Americans understand what was going on in their society, how it affected their lives, and what they could do about it. However, Mills claims that this is no longer the case. He suggests that**the majority of American intellectuals fail to acknowledge, question, or challenge the rule of the power elite**. This has also taken power away from the American people by depriving them of their ability to understand what’s going on in government, why it’s going on, and how it affects them.

(Shortform note: Mills critiques the intellectual class more directly in his later work, _The Sociological Imagination_. In it, he claims a new generation of economists, sociologists, and so on have taken to gathering technical information—opinion poll data, market research, and other quantifiable metrics—without developing a broader historical and social understanding of what they study. Without taking a wider view of social and political trends, Mills says, social scientists can’t help average Americans understand their life circumstances. They might even work on behalf of elites, remaining ignorant or willfully ignorant of what their research is used for.)

Mills explains that some intellectuals simply deny the existence of the power elite or say elites are disorganized and accountable to the American people. Other intellectuals don’t _deny_ the existence of the power elite but instead ignore or downplay their role, avoiding critiques of broader power structures. According to Mills, both post-war conservatives and post-war liberals fail to acknowledge the power elite.

##### 1) Conservatives

Mills explains that in post-war America, the rule of the power elite has left many middle-class Americans perceiving a loss in status or influence. Instead of recognizing the power elite as the true cause of this, though, **conservative politicians and intellectuals focus these middle-class frustrations into attacks on specific individuals, institutions, and symbols of status** within government. To this end, they ignore government norms and conventions, publicly and privately persecute their enemies, and seek power for themselves and their allies by any means necessary.

The most obvious example of this sort of behavior at the time is a campaign of unfounded personal attacks and accusations led by Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s. McCarthy made a number of very public accusations, often claiming other members of government were communists or homosexuals with little to no evidence. This behavior fits Mills’s definition above: It channeled broader social frustrations onto specific individuals, defied congressional conventions, and was done in part for fame and power.

> **The _Petite Bourgeoisie_ and Right-Wing Movements**
> 
> Mills actually defines the conservative voter base more precisely than simply middle-class. He identifies them as the _petite bourgeoisie_ , a Marxist term referring to the social class between large-scale capitalists and wage workers. This class includes people like small business owners, self-employed tradespeople, and others of middling wealth who can operate semi-independent of large capital. According to Marxism, the _petite bourgeoisie_ are in a precarious position—capitalism allows them to maintain the wealth they have, but also leads to the concentration of wealth that will eventually force them into the lower class.
> 
> A lot of Marxist and socialist scholarship (some of which Mills cites) claims that when the position of the _petite bourgeoisie_ is particularly threatened, they often adopt far-right ideologies. This allows them to channel the frustrations of their precarious position at _specific_ elites, minority groups, or segments of society without having to admit that the capitalist system as a whole—the system they associate with their wealth—is the real reason why their social position is threatened.

##### 2) Liberals

Mills suggests that instead of acknowledging or challenging the rule of the power elite, **post-war American liberals are attempting to mount a disorganized defense of the status quo.** This is because liberals held power for decades before World War II, leading to two main consequences:

  1. Liberal grassroots organization has greatly diminished because in the years before the war, it wasn’t necessary for liberals to stay in power.
  2. The New Deal made a significant portion of liberal political projects into federal law, meaning many post-war liberals just want to keep things the way they are.



Finally, Mills claims that **as an ideology, liberalism in post-war America has essentially become meaningless.** Liberal ideals—a government of the people, limits on government power, freedom of political expression, and so on—are frequently used in the rhetoric of both liberals _and_ conservatives to justify vastly different policies. In the meantime, neither group actually tries to _fight_ for these ideals. The power elite has worked to take power away from average Americans, bypass limits on government power, and monopolize political discussion—and liberals and conservatives alike haven’t tried to stop them.

> **A New Liberalism?**
> 
> In the decades since _The Power Elite_ was written, liberalism and liberals have seen a significant ideological shift. Starting in the 1970s, many liberals trended _away_ from large-scale government social programs like the New Deal and the Great Society, instead trending toward _neoliberalism_. Neoliberals embrace a lot of classic liberalism’s emphasis on free market economics and the limited role of the government in economic affairs.
> 
> As such, neoliberal politicians like Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton focused on corporate deregulation and encouraging free trade. These politicians and their supporters view neoliberalism as a way of escaping the stagnant New Deal “status quo,” like what Mills discusses. Critics of neoliberalism, on the other hand, view it as a further “hollowing out” of liberalism by the elite.
