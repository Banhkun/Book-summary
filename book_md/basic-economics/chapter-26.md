## Chapter 26: A Brief History of Economics

The book ends with a brief history of how economic thinking developed over the centuries.

  * 1600s-1700s: mercantilists argued that a nation should export more than it imports, causing a net inflow of gold. They equated gold with wealth. They were preoccupied with transfers of wealth and increasing the power of their own nations relative to that of other nations, not creating wealth for people at large. This supported policies like repressing wages to lower export costs.
  * 1776: Adam Smith published _The Wealth of Nations_ , conceiving of economic activity as creating wealth and non-zero-sum. He saw wealth as the goods and services that determine the standard of living, not as the amount of gold. He rejected government intervention to help merchants, believing individuals could sort out interactions with each other just fine. This built the foundation of classical economics.
  * 1817: David Ricardo published _Principles of Political Economy_ , adding rigor to terminology and analysis of economics. He also introduced the theory of comparative advantage.
  * 19th Century: Say’s Law argued that production of output and the generation of income for those producing the output were one and the same. This addressed popular fears that growing output would exceed the ability of people to buy it, leading to unsold goods and unemployment.
  * 19th Century: The “marginalist revolution” allowed price theory to incorporate the demands of consumers, rather than just the costs of producers, giving rise to neo-classical economics. 
    * Previously, the fact that diamonds cost more than water contradicted pricing based on consumer demand, given that water was critical to life and diamonds weren’t. But this analysis compared the total utility of water vs the total utility of diamonds - arguing humans were better off with no diamonds than with no water.
    * But innovations in marginal utility resolved this issue - utility is subjective and depends on how much of that good the consumer already has. 
    * This was expressed precisely through differential calculus.
  * 20th Century: Equilibrium theory arose to illustrate the complex interdependencies of economic activities.
    * Even though the real world is seldom in equilibrium, the theory usefully illustrates what happens when things are not in equilibrium. 
  * 1936: John Maynard Keynes published _The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money_ , giving rise to Keynesian economics, which explained changes in aggregate output and employment, and argued for government intervention to restore an economy in depression. It allowed tradeoffs between rates of unemployment and rates of inflation in the Phillips Curve.
  * 1970s: Milton Friedman and the Chicago school of economics found the market more rational and responsive than Keynesians assumed.
    * Inflation and unemployment simultaneously rising in 1970s undermined the Phillips Curve tradeoff concept.
