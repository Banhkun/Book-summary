## Chapter 11: Distortions in Labor Markets

We’ve learned that human labor is a resource like any other, and that markets price resources efficiently without the need for central control.

However, there are artificial changes to labor prices in the form of artificial floors. **Minimum wage laws, mandatory benefits, job security, working conditions, collective bargaining and occupational licensing all have the same effect - they artificially increase the price of labor above what they would be in free competition.** This causes a surplus of supply and less demand for labor.

#### Minimum Wage Laws

Even though minimum wage laws are meant to benefit workers, they can lead to increased unemployment. **The real minimum wage is always zero.** With artificially higher wages, employers tend to use more capital as a resource. Rather than hiring extra people, employers get more mileage through existing workers through overtime or by investing in technology to make workers more efficient.

Countries with no minimum wage laws like Switzerland and Singapore tend to have lower unemployment rates of 2-3%. Furthermore, countries with no minimum wage laws and fewer mandatory benefits tend to have shorter periods of unemployment and faster turnover.

**Because of the surplus in supply, buyers (employers) can be more selective about who they hire. This typically disadvantages younger, less skilled, and minority workers** , who become delayed in acquiring job skills and experience and thus stifle their lifetime income. Indeed, minimum wage laws were once explicitly advocated to reduce competition with minorities, who were willing to work for less (such as African-Americans in the United States in the 1930s).

**Labor unions benefit from minimum wage laws** , since experienced unionized workers tend to displace younger, less skilled workers as the minimum wage goes up. (Shortform note: imagine that a young worker would cost $8/hr in a market, but a skilled worker would cost $15/hr. An employer could make the decision accordingly. But if the minimum wage became $14/hr, the cost difference between the two workers shrinks to $1, and it becomes much more compelling to hire the skilled worker.)

Politically, minimum wage laws seem superficially beneficial to voters, since the wage is an obvious first-order improvement, but unemployment is a more subtle second-order problem that isn’t tied to minimum wage laws. (Shortform note: furthermore, there are likely vicious cycle effects wherein the employed are more likely to vote, and the employed are more likely to support minimum wage laws, thus further increasing unemployment and entrenching the voting power of the employed.)

If there were no minimum wage laws in the United States, more people would be employed, with the median person earning lower wages than with minimum wage laws. This **“spreads employment more evenly.”** And the workers still retain free choice - if they were clearly better off not working for the employer at a lower wage, they would choose not to work. Instead, **minimum wages tend to make low-wage workers worse off by closing off one of their already limited options**.

#### Working Conditions and Benefits

The above reasoning applies to mandatory working conditions, benefits, and job security laws. **These costs are factored into the total cost of hiring workers and tend to increase cost per worker above free market levels.**

For instance, for job security laws like limiting situations where termination is allowed, firing may be so costly that it’s easier not to hire in the first place. These laws save the job of existing workers, but at the cost of reducing flexibility of the economy as a whole. Even in technological disruptions that obviate jobs, the workers flow into more productive roles for the economy, such as agricultural workers turning to manufacturing.

Politically, these policies are popular because they gain more votes from workers than it loses among employers, and they cost the government nothing.

All these are reasons that **unemployment may not decrease as an economy rises out of a recession - an employer may simply find that working existing workers overtime is cheaper than the overhead of hiring new workers**(in training and benefits).

#### Labor Unions

Similarly, **labor unions tend to set wages higher than what would exist in open competition.**

Say that manufacturers would pay $15/hr for workers at market rates. The union bargains to increase pay to $20/hr. Now the employer will employ only people who meet the minimum bar of productivity at $20/hr; this may mean driving some less qualified workers to their second-best option for $12/hr. This is a loss to the economy as a whole, since scarce resources are not being allocated to where productivity is highest, and capital is required to increase worker productivity to $20/hr.

As an example, auto unions in the United States raised auto worker conditions, but they also raised the price of cars and made American cars less competitive with Japanese cars. Eventually Japanese manufacturers built plants in the US, which became mostly non-union. **This is part of a growing skepticism about unions’ economic effects** , since highly unionized workforces became correlated with economic declines and unemployment in industries. Employers have remained non-union by paying their workers at least as much as unionized workers receive.

**The unions remaining in the United States are often in the public sector, as with teachers. Public managers and politicians spend taxpayer money, not their own money, and so have little incentive to resist union demands.** Furthermore, often being monopolies, government agencies lack competition that would force efficiency.

#### Occupational Licensing

Certain professions like doctors, beauticians, and taxi drivers require licenses to practice. This reduces competition by raising the bar for new entrants to the industry.

Surprisingly, the demand for requiring licenses for practitioners has usually come not from the public but rather from existing practitioners. This protects the incumbents in the industry from competition from new entrants. One signal of this is that **new legislation often exempts existing practitioners** \- if the law were actually meant to protect the public, then bad actors who are existing practitioners should certainly be weeded out.

#### Child Labor Laws

Once designed to protect children from vulnerable physical working conditions, child labor laws now keep youth out of office jobs that are physically innocuous. Thomas Sowell argues that educators and labor unions also have incentives to keep children in school for longer and out of the workforce, respectively, thus securing their own jobs at the expense of allowing youth to gain work experience.

#### Open Competition

Thomas Sowell argues that **in open competition, better safety and working conditions would naturally arise through employers competing with each other for workers**.

(Shortform note: this probably requires employer reputation to be spread among workers - which has gotten easier with the internet - and job mobility and transportation to make labor markets fluid. Otherwise, if workers have little choice to leave an employer, they may need to endure unsafe conditions.

Another factor might be that many people may rather trust in a guaranteed level of working conditions, despite its distortion of the market, rather than trust the vague open market to take care of it and suffer the occasional bad actor.)

### Wages in Developing Countries by Multinationals

Much is said about low wages in developing countries for wealthy multinational companies, such as with Apple and its manufacturer Foxconn, and Nike and its shoe manufacturers. The common perception is that the employer should pay a wage comparable to that in the United States - that the gap between $10/hr and $2/hr is too vast.

However, this ignores the **difference in productivity** between workers in developed countries vs developing countries, due to worker skills, technology, and management practices. A $2/hr worker may generate losses if paid at $10/hr.

**This argument also takes a paternalistic air, that the international workers are “forced into” sweatshops, as though they had no free choice.** In reality, these jobs can be highly in demand, reflecting the (unfortunate) reality that there are no better local alternatives than the multinational job. Multinationals pay about double the local wages in poor countries. A $2/hr job at a factory may be far better than the $1/hr job in worse conditions. **Removing these jobs would remove a valuable option and force workers into less productive jobs.**

When employers are forced to adopt higher minimum wages in a country due to legislation or popular pressure, they can develop labor capacity in other countries, or use capital instead of labor (e.g. by displacing workers with machinery). This costs the country the bigger picture, since fewer employed people means less stimulus for the economy and fewer workers who gain the skills to benefit the local economy in the long run.

Instead, open competition among employers in a country can increase wages and working conditions naturally in a virtuous cycle. One employer developing skills in a population can invite more employers to seek talent, driving up wages and human capital.

Finally, in reality, rich countries tend to invest more in other rich countries, not in poor countries (as explained in the International Trade section below). If exploitation were such a great opportunity, why aren’t multinationals doubling down and pouring all their investment there, instead of other high wage countries? It must be because high wages in other countries produce relatively more output per dollar than lower wage workers do - therefore, the lower wage in other countries is justified.
