## Part V: The National Economy | Chapter 16: National Output

The basic economic principles that apply to specific markets for goods also apply to national economies as a whole. The supply and demand for a nation’s output can fluctuate, just like supply and demand for a single good fluctuate.

### National Output

The national output is what is produced during the current year. It is distinct from a country’s total wealth, which is accumulated across time and can be used to allow a country to live beyond its current production.

The most common measure of national output is Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the sum of everything produced within a nation’s borders.

Much is made of comparisons of GDP - how it’s changing over time, how one nation compares to another. But **comparing GDP across any dimension has complications:**

**GDP comparisons across time have issues of changing composition of the output.**

  * Cars in 1950 are far less advanced than cars in the 2000, so merely comparing number of cars is misleading.
  * Work compensation increasingly comes in benefits, rather than direct wages, so just comparing wages is misleading.
  * Work that had previously gone unpaid (like farming, making homemade clothes, cooking food, raising children) may now be outsourced to the marketplace, and is now counted in national output, even though the volume of activity has not actually changed.
  * Developing countries that improve healthcare allow the poor and elderly to better survive, but their survival now lowers the average income.
  * Trying to adjust by cost of living is difficult, since rare luxuries like flat-screen TVs can reduce in price dramatically and become commonplace, while common goods may increase in price due to quality.
  * Economists estimate consumer price indices have an inflationary bias of 1%, so real inflation is 1% less than the CPI.



**GDP comparisons between nations can be inaccurate.**

  * The quality of output may differ, even if the quantity is identical.
  * Different age distributions will show younger nations to have less output, because younger people do not require healthcare costs that are counted in output.
  * Different currencies require conversions, where official exchange rates may not reflect actual purchasing power of currencies.
  * Free or subsidized goods provided by governments are valued at cost of production (usually higher than the price), while private goods are counted at the price of sale. This inflates the output of socialist economies.



**Comparing bulk GDP vs GDP per capita.**

  * GDP per capita is a better metric of standard of living.
    * China has the 2nd largest GDP, but likely not a higher standard of living than #3 Japan.
  * However, GDP per capita can be misleading - Bermuda has a high GDP per capita, primarily from the wealth of a small minority of investors that may not distribute into the population at large.



National output and real income are one and the same - real income is the goods and services that can be purchased by the nation; the nation’s output is the goods and serviced produced by the nation. Thus, **a nation can never “output so much that the economy cannot absorb it”** \- this is a common myth.

What can happen instead is that consumers and investors can become hesitant to part with their money (either by buying or lending), causing aggregate demand to fall below aggregate output, causing producers to cut back to stem losses.
