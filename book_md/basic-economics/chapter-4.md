## Chapter 4: Myths about Prices

We’ll cover a number of myths about prices and their role in the economy.

### Myth: High Prices are a Sign of Greed

**Many people see prices as obstacles to getting what they want.** Beach-front homes in Malibu are priced at millions of dollars, out of reach of most of the country. This can be labeled in the popular press as “greed is driving up the price of housing,” as though people are charging more than the product is worth.

However, this ignores the fact that **the price becomes a reality only if others are willing to pay them and if a transaction happens**. One could price her phone at $5,000,000, but no one would be willing to buy at that price. Therefore, greed has little impact on what others are actually willing to pay.

Thus, high prices are not a sign of “greed” on the part of homeowners - **prices merely reflect the scarcity of beach-front homes, that there are not enough beach-front homes to satisfy all of us**. Different economies ration these houses differently - in a feudal economy, the lord would ration the houses by fiat, giving houses to certain people. They could also be rationed by lottery. No matter the method, **the rationing would still have to happen**.

Related: people tend to over-attribute economic situations to individual actors and intentions, like greed or politicians’ stupidity. In reality, **most people do not have the force to shape markets** , and are merely responding to their individual incentives like everyone else. In the Soviet Union, it made a lot of sense for each individual officer to make suboptimal planning decisions (the punishment for deviation was death), even if systemically it caused massive inefficiencies.

Inversely, some people tend to depersonalize the market too much, treating it as a mysterious entity. In reality, **markets are simply made up of people** , and understanding individual wants and drives can lead to better understanding of markets.

Here are other situations that are commonly seen as unsavory and greedy, but occur for good market reasons:

  * In areas of famine or emergency, the prices for scarce goods can rise (e.g. the price of bottled water rises after a hurricane). Merchants who supply goods at prices higher than other areas seem greedy.
    * In reality, **the high prices and profits are necessary to incentivize vendors to supply their goods** ; without this incentive, people might starve. It is apparently not uncommon for food supplied by nonprofits to sit spoiling on the docks while people starve inland, because the prices are too low to support distributors.
    * Furthermore, higher prices cause healthy self-rationing - a family may buy only enough water as necessary until the next shipment, rather than hoarding and depleting supply for other families.
  * In low-income neighborhoods, prices for loans and goods tend to be higher.
    * However, **profit rates per store are no higher in low-income neighborhoods than elsewhere** , and stores may actually be _leaving_ these neighborhoods because they couldn’t make the financials work. (If profits were so easy, you’d expect an abundance of stores arriving to capitalize on the high profits.)
    * The **higher prices in low-income neighborhoods reflect higher costs** , in the form of higher crime and vandalism, higher insurance costs, and fixed cost with smaller transactions.
      * Why are smaller transactions more costly? Lending $100 to 50 individuals costs more than lending $5000 to one customer.



In general, people tend to dislike when goods have dynamic pricing (like ride-hailing app Uber’s surge pricing). But the pricing is needed to provide an incentive for suppliers to service the customers. If the price rises too high (e.g. because of greed from early suppliers), new suppliers will arrive and naturally compete to drive the price down.

### Myth: There is One “Real” Value

People tend to think there is one “real” value for a good, and that price fluctuations are deviations from its “real” value.

In reality, multiple factors govern the price of a good, and **the value is subjective**. Transactions only happen when each party wants the other thing more than what they currently have - it only makes sense to transact in this case.

If there were actually one objective real value, it would be zero-sum and make little sense to transact, since neither side is gaining from the transaction.

### Myth: How Can You Put a Price On X? (Education, health, art, etc.)

Costs of providing a product or service are real - not just the production costs, but also the opportunity costs that those resources could have been spent on something else. Treating something as sacred means something else must invariably suffer.

Price controls are basically a refusal to pay the full costs of the good. Like restrictions on healthcare spending, it often involves **forced reductions in prices, not a reduction in _real underlying cost_**. Just because a supplier is forced to accept a lower price when selling a good doesn’t change the cost of what it takes to supply the good. Naturally, price changes will distort the market.

(Shortform note: also, consider the extremes of what “you can’t put a price no X” means. Would it make sense to devote the entire GDP of the United States to save a single life? If not, then the price of a life is between that and zero.)

### Myth: Unmet Needs

A common talking point is pointing to some burning “unmet need.” This rhetoric tends to categorically place some desires higher than others and seek to meet them at all costs.

However, **while there are scarce resources (as there have been for all of human history), there will _always_ be unmet needs**. We cannot all satisfy our want for large beachfront homes or, less facetiously, around-the-clock top-tier medical care and the best educators.

Gullibly allocating resources to the “unmet need” of the day is likely to cause suboptimal allocation and inefficiency. Instead, we should consider the tradeoffs in any reallocation of resources.

(Shortform note: there may be a fundamental schism between people who desire equality and empathize with others’ suffering, and those who do not. Where the former may see a need for people to receive a baseline level of food and care, the latter may prefer the free market take care of itself, which may mean a portion of the population that cannot afford it will suffer while the whole system ends up more efficient. These two sides often find the other incomprehensible, leading to unhelpfully vociferous arguments.)

### Myth: Economic Explanations are Too Simplistic

Some dismiss economic explanations of a situation as too simple, often in favor of their own pet theory.

Simple phenomena can lead to complex emergent effects. The tilting of the earth on its axis leads to annual temperature variation by latitude, leading to complex reactions like animal hibernations and migrations, large seasonal weather patterns like hurricanes, etc.

Likewise, simple economic concepts like supply and demand, and pricing used to ration resources, can lead to extremely complex systems across millions of actors in an economy.

### Economics is Not About Morals or Philosophy

Economics is merely an analysis of cause-and-effect relationships and to find ways to allocate scarce resources with alternative uses. One shouldn’t expect economics to make moral judgments about what is “right or wrong” - only what produces the greatest overall system output. “No one expects mathematics to explain love.”

### Miscellaneous Points about Prices

**Prices tend to reduce competition and friction.**

Scarcity ensures that people are competing with each other when making purchases, by bidding up the price of products they want. However, money encourages a focus on personal decisions about prices and incentives you face.

  * In a market economy, a Protestant church may decide how big of a church it needs to build, and scale back to something it can afford. It doesn’t consider the Catholics a rival, even though they are competing for the same construction materials.
  * If instead the resources were centrally rationed, the two churches would see each other as rivals for fixed resources, maximizing their plans to eke out as much as it can get.
  * (Shortform example: similarly, when buying milk, you simply think about whether $3 per gallon is worth it for you. You don’t think about bodybuilders who drink a gallon of milk a day who are bidding up the price.)



**Agency problems** \- people who aren’t spending their own money don’t have the same incentives as people who give them money.

  * Example: politicians who spend taxpayer money - explored more later in Part V: The National Economy.
