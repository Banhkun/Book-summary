## Chapters 6-8: Filling in the Gaps

The 2002 draft is a key moment for the Oakland A’s, giving them the opportunity to**replenish a 2001 roster than had been depleted through trades and free agent poachings from other teams.** During the offseason, the team loses stars like Jason Isringhausen, Johnny Damon, and Jason Giambi. But we should explore _why_ they left the team in the first place. For the answer to this also lies in Billy and Paul’s data-driven, sabermetric approach to running the team.

As a cash-strapped club, the Oakland A’s simply can’t afford to go out on the free agent market and throw money at the available stars. Payroll cannot exceed $40 million. On a 25-man roster, this means **an average salary of around $1.5 million per player—far below the league average of $2.3 million.** Thus, the A’s must acquire inexpensive players through the draft and then trade them once their entry level contracts expire and they become too expensive to retain.

This is what happened with the players from the previous season, all of whom the A’s had no longer been able to afford on their meager budget. And this is what makes the 2002 draft so critical: they are counting on the newcomers to fill in these gaps.

**Despite the total mismatch of financial resources between the A’s and the rest of the league, the team is remarkably successful under Billy’s leadership**. The 2001 A’s finish 102-60. The 2002 iteration of the team, meanwhile, goes 103-59, good for first place in the American League West Division. On paper, the 2002 team is far worse than its 2001 incarnation. Yet they manage to post a nearly identical win-loss record with what looks like an inferior roster.

### Expected Run Value

They achieve this through **shrewd, value-driven management of their most important asset: the players**. Billy and Paul, with their sabermetric approach, realize that no player is irreplaceable. All players make measurable, on-field contributions to team success. Taking a page from Bill James, Paul crunches the numbers and determines exactly how many runs each player contributes to total team runs. He understands that every action taken by a player has an expected run value, by either helping the team score runs or preventing opponents from doing so.

Paul is able to calculate exactly how many runs any player is worth. In a dysfunctional and irrational market for baseball players, **expected run value becomes the gold standard for the A’s, a tool that enables them to more accurately price the assets in any given trade**. This knowledge gives the A’s an edge in player trades with other teams, enabling them to receive far more value than what they give up, while saving money. The rest of the league is making these vital franchise decisions on instinct and subjective reasoning; the A’s are using a formula that enables them to far more accurately gauge the value of their players.

### The Selig Commission

If the market for baseball players had been rational in any way, the A’s shouldn’t have been able to enjoy the success they do. If player salaries accurately reflect player value, the continually outspent A’s should be bottom-dwellers instead of perennial contenders. But Billy and Paul know the market _isn’t_ rational. Some players are wildly overvalued, while others are undervalued for the most spurious of reasons, having nothing to do their actual level of performance.

This flies in the face of what has crystallized into conventional baseball wisdom by the late 1990s and early 2000s. At the time, there is growing concern within baseball circles that small-market, low-budget teams can never hope to compete with the likes of the Yankees. The rich teams will simply scoop up all the best talent, leaving the rest of the league with lower quality players. This concern is premised, of course, on the assumption that salaries reflect true value—that is, the teams with the most money and highest payrolls should have the best on-field record. But there is one glaring exception to this theory: Billy Beane’s Oakland A’s.

**In 1999, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig convenes a blue ribbon commission to examine the wealth inequality in major league baseball** , exploring possible solutions to this “problem,” including revenue-sharing and player salary caps. Under such schemes, the rich teams would effectively be subsidizing the poor teams. Selig, as owner of the cash-strapped Milwaukee Brewers, has his own self-interested reasons for spreading the money in baseball around more equitably. And the idea of the poor teams being hamstrung by financial constraints rather than poor management is certainly a comforting nostrum to many GMs around the league because it excuses their weak performances.

Billy Beane himself gives testimony before Selig’s commission, and in his report (authored by Pual DePodesta), he echoes the views of the commissioners, arguing that his team’s success is a mere fluke. Beane’s presentation argues that his team’s recent success does not disprove the larger point that low-budget teams like his can’t afford to compete with the rich teams in the long run.

But Billy does not believe his own presentation. Sure, he’s happy to tell the commission what it wishes to hear, especially if it might result in the containment of player salaries or even revenue-sharing with the major teams—having more financial resources certainly wouldn’t hurt the A’s. But he also knows that he doesn’t need it. He has seen firsthand, as a player and now as a general manager, just how irrational the market for baseball players really is. He is fine with letting the rich teams mindlessly throw money at aging and overpriced stars, while leaving the undervalued and overlooked players for him. He knows **most bad baseball teams aren’t bad because they lack cash—they are bad because they are poorly managed**. And he is confident that effective management will beat money every time.

### Extracting Value

**Before the start of the season, Paul DePodesta calculates that it will take about 95 wins to reach the playoffs in 2002**. With this as the end goal, it’s then a matter of working backwards: to achieve 95 wins, they will need to have a runs scored vs. runs allowed differential of +135 (Bill James had discovered that there is a stable ratio between run differential and wins).

And this is where the team’s data-driven approach really pays dividends. The loss of Isringhausen, Damon, and Giambi definitely costs the team, but it costs them in a way that can be measured and quantified. If these players’ contributions to the positive run differential is now gone, they must find the players who, based on past performance, will be able to fill in those gaps. Such players don’t need to be highly paid stars, they just need to contribute to the team’s net run total. And such players can be had for very little, thanks to the irrationalities of the labor market for baseball players.

#### Jason Isringhausen: Selling the Closer

As a closer, Isringhausen only pitches at the end of the game, in relief of the starting pitcher. But closers, Billy realizes, are highly overvalued and overrated because GMs put too much stock in the usefulness of “saves.” A closer earns a save by doing nothing more than not losing a game that is already nearly finished by the time they take the plate.

**The likelihood of a team winning or losing any game is largely determined before the closer makes their appearance**. A save is earned mostly on the backs of the team effort that precedes them—if a closer comes into a game in the ninth inning, with his team already leading and no one on base, he is likely to earn the save regardless of what he does. The save, the key metric by which closers are valued, is, like the RBI or the error, heavily weighted by luck.

But Billy knows that the rest of the league still believes in the value of closers. When Beane had acquired Isringhausen back in 1999, he was a minor league pitcher in the Mets organization. So the A’s groom him into a role as a closer, giving him the opportunity to inflate his save totals. When Isringhausen later becomes too expensive (because his ability is overvalued by the rest of the league), Billy ships him off to the St. Louis Cardinals, in exchange for two first round picks in the 2002 draft—one of which will later be used to acquire Jeremy Brown. **The practice becomes known inside the Oakland organization as “selling the closer.”**

#### Johnny Damon: Overvalued Slugger

Johnny Damon is a center fielder and a slugger with a talent for extra base hits. He boasts a great slugging percentage (a similar statistic to batting average, except weighted to account for extra base hits like doubles, triples, and home runs), is thrilling to watch at the plate, and is a fan favorite. Yet Beane and DePodesta also see that Damon strikes out a great deal—indeed, he makes outs at a rate that greatly reduces the return on investment of retaining him.

After revising Bill James’s old “Runs Created” formula, DePodesta concludes that **an extra point of on-base percentage contributes three times as much to runs as slugging percentage**. A player who rarely hit triples or home runs, but consistently gets on base through walks and singles, is more valuable than a flashy slugger like Damon who tends to strike out—yet such a player is likely to command a much smaller salary than a player like Damon.

**Evaluated this way, Damon performs poorly, with a .324 on-base percentage—ten points below the league average**. Thus, his offensive skills are replaceable. The team needs to find a combination of players that can compensate for the loss of Damon’s expected run value. And with the rest of the league having such a poor understanding of these concepts, Beane and DePodesta know they can get such players for a fraction of what they are really worth. This is why they allow Damon to walk after the 2001 season.

### Replacing the Pieces of Giambi

The loss of Giambi to the Yankees will be harder to replace. Although defensively weak as a first baseman, **Giambi is a highly efficient scorer at the plate, a run-creating machine with a stellar on-base percentage of .477**. He is the rare player, like Nick Swisher, on whom the sabermetricians and the old baseball guard can agree. But even still, Beane and DePodesta know that Giambi isn’t irreplaceable.

For the team is simply the sum of its parts. And while certain star players obviously contribute more runs than others, their output can be replicated. The production of a Giambi might not be easily replaced by another _single_ player, but it can be replaced by a _combination_ of other players, each of whom can do their part to fill in the gap left by his departure.

**They don’t need to find the total package in a new player—they just need to find a fraction of that package** , which will form part of the whole when joined with other players. They aren’t looking for the next Giambi, nor, frankly, can they afford to. They need to find the _parts_ of Giambi, which can be obtained for far less.

The players Oakland loses after the 2001 season (including Giambi) have an average on-base percentage of .364. The task before Billy Beane is thus to find new players who can man the former players’ field positions competently, while collectively contributing an on-base percentage 30 points higher than the league average, thus filling Giambi’s gap. Surprisingly, Billy is able to find such players for next to nothing—a testament to how **most major league clubs discount the importance of on-base percentage.**

The players brought in to replace the lost offense are catcher Scott Hatteberg, outfielder David Justice, and first baseman Jeremy Giambi (Jason’s younger brother). These are players whom most of the rest of the league has written off as inadequate or defective, which, of course, is why the A’s are able to acquire them so easily.

### Giambi Returns to Oakland

On Wednesday, April 24, 2002, the A’s are hosting the Yankees. The game makes for a compelling story, as it is Jason Giambi’s return home to the team he spurned. While the fans jeer him and brandish signs labelling him a “Sellout” and “Traitor,” the A’s front office sees the game as an interesting experiment, a test of their sabermetric principles.

DePodesta, ever calm and calculating, makes the point that**focusing on the results of any _one_ game in a 162-game season is shortsighted**. He argues that the _process_ of how teams play games and accumulate runs matters far more than the _results_ of individual games. Everyone else does the opposite: making decisions based on outcomes rather than processes. If a team maintains their discipline and consistently gets on base, they are likely to win more games over the course of a long season. But it’s impossible to _completely_ remove the element of luck from baseball, and random, unexpected events in a _single game_ can always overwhelm probability.

Sure enough, the Yankees roar out to an early 5-0 lead. Billy Beane, for all his focus on long-term results, is still highly emotional when it comes to baseball. His frustration and anxiety become too much to bear and he departs the stadium. **This is why he seldom watches the games in real-time: he does not want his player decisions to be influenced by the outcomes of single games and single plays.**

Although he does criticize individual player decisions in the heat of the moment (derisively labeling shortstop Miguel Tejada as “Mr. Swing at Everything” when he steps up to the plate during this game), he does not want to fall prey to the scout’s fallacy of judging players based on statistically insignificant sample sizes.

The game is a test of Oakland’s new acquisitions of Justice, Hatteberg, and the younger Giambi. The 36-year-old Justice, for instance, is written off by other teams as too old. Despite this, he boasts a high on-base percentage and excels at drawing walks. This unglamorous style of play seldom makes the highlight reels on ESPN, but it contributes significantly to helping teams win games, which is why Oakland acquires him. Sure enough, Justice’s patience at the plate yields results during the game, earning him a walk which leads to a run that cuts the Yankee lead to 5-4.

The next batter up is Jeremy Giambi, believed by many around the league to be too slow to succeed in the majors. But he does have an above-average on-base percentage, derived largely from his patience and ability to wear pitchers out, which ultimately draws walks. And Giambi, to his credit and the crowd’s delight, draws a walk during this at bat, bringing home the tying run for the A’s. The team’s methodical approach appears to be yielding fruit.

Although a run of bad luck in the final innings (and some questionable calls from the umpire) cause the A’s to lose this game to the Yankees by a score of 8-5, the team is clearly competitive. And although it’s only one game, **the parts assembled by Billy Beane clearly appear to be working as intended.**

### Scott Hatteberg: Diamond in the Rough

The final player acquired to replace Giambi’s offense, Scott Hatteberg, goes to the locker room after the loss to the Yankees to review the tape of the game. This is one of the qualities the team most admires about Hatteberg: **he is a smart, analytical player, a student of the game who wishes to learn from his mistakes.**

Once a catcher in the Boston Red Sox organization, with some hitting ability, injuries have robbed Hatteberg of his ability to throw the ball. As a result, his market value rapidly declines, and he struggles to find a major league team willing to take a chance on him after his contract expires in 2001. But, as we’ve seen with other players, Billy Beane’s Oakland A’s see upside in Hatteberg where other organizations see only downside.

For Hatteberg is also a remarkably disciplined hitter, with an uncanny ability to draw walks and get on-base. His mediocre .270 batting average conceals his true value. Because of his injury history and his unrecognized offensive contributions, Beane is able to sign Hatteberg for a mere $1 million.

No longer able to throw, Hatteberg is re-molded into a first baseman by Oakland. Although he struggles in his new role during 2002 spring training, by mid-season, he blossoms into an above-average first baseman. But that is just a bonus for the organization. **Billy Beane has not brought Scott Hatteberg to Oakland for his fielding ability—Scott Hatteberg is in Oakland to _hit_.**

Hatteberg is the opposite of what Billy Beane had been as a player. Where Billy was petrified of striking out (which caused him to madly swing at every pitch), Hatteberg is unafraid of the third strike. **He has the patience and discipline to wear out opposing pitchers** , forcing them to throw inferior pitches which he can then hit. He knows how to wait for the game to come to him, rather than trying to force the game to bend to his desires. In short, he has the mental durability that Billy Beane had never developed as a player.

Oakland is the ideal environment for a player like Hatteberg to thrive. The Red Sox had scorned his thoughtful approach to hitting as weak and passive. They wanted hitters with flash and power, even if these hitters also struck out on the regular. The team would yell at him for drawing a walk with a man on base, foolishly labelling such behavior as “selfish.” They had wanted him to swing at everything. The Boston hitting coach, Jim Rice, even derided Hatteberg for working the count and grinding pitchers down, pointing out that Hatteberg had a .500 batting average when he swung at the first pitch. Of course, **Hatteberg would only swing at the first pitch when it was too good to _not_ swing at**, which was rarely the case. Still, the Red Sox organization would not hear of it and tried to force Hatteberg to become a slugger.

But everything is different in Oakland. Hatteberg’s style blends perfectly with Beane’s philosophy and he thrives. By the end of the 2002 season, Hatteberg is one of the stingiest swingers in the league, choosing not to swing at 64.5 percent of pitches thrown to him—the third-highest rate in the American League. DePodesta calculates that if Scott Hatteberg had taken every at bat for the A’s in 2002, the team would have scored between 940 and 950 runs, more than the entire roster of the powerhouse Yankees. Put another way, nine Scott Hattebergs are worth more than the entire Yankee team.
