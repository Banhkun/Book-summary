## Chapter 5: Draft Day

By 1997, Billy Beane is the general manager of the Oakland A’s. Inspired to read James by former Oakland GM Sandy Alderson, Billy is determined to use James’s insights to build a winning A’s team. Moreover, **sabermetrics will allow him to build a successful team on the cheap, as they offer a guide on how to identify undervalued players**. The rest of the league can keep their marquee home run hitters and base stealers; Billy wants the guys who know how to get on base.

Billy has good reasons for defying baseball’s conventional wisdom. He had been the victim of wrongheaded ideas about what makes a successful baseball player. Scouts saw him make flashy plays during his high school playing days and then rushed him into a professional playing career that he never really wanted. **He had failed partly due to his own insecurities and mental hang-ups, but also because he had been wrongly labelled a star.**

Now, as GM, Billy is determined never to make the same mistakes that had been made with him. He will draft and sign players whose performances—measured by data over the long term, not the starry-eyed reports of scouts based on a handful of games—indicate that they are built for success in the major leagues. He will look for value in the types of players that are typically overlooked by other GMs.

By the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, Billy has assembled a sabermetric-focused team in the front office, including assistant GM Paul DePodesta, who had graduated from Harvard with a degree in economics and never played professional baseball himself. As he grows into the GM role, Billy begins to run the team more in line with his principles, regardless of conventional wisdom. **He is a micromanaging and almost autocratic GM, deferring very little to his scouting staff and even to the manager**. Those who are new to the A’s organization quickly realize that Billy runs everything—trades, drafting decisions, scouting, and even tactical baseball decisions on the field.

In keeping with his principle of total control, Billy knows exactly which players he wants to select in the 2002 draft. But they still must overcome the conventional wisdom and conservatism of the A’s scouting staff, many of whom are holdovers who have been with the team for years before Billy became GM.

But to understand why that draft is a pivotal moment for Billy, we first need to understand why the amateur draft is so critical to a team like the Oakland A’s.

### The Amateur Draft

As we’ve seen,**player salaries had exploded since the 1970s**. And by the time Billy Beane is at the helm of the Oakland A’s, the team’s ownership has stressed profitability above all else. The team is to be run on a shoestring budget, with cost containment the guiding principle. Thus, Billy must acquire effective players on the cheap. His acceptance of James’s sabermetric principles greatly helps him in this, empowering him and his staff to identify undervalued players that are overlooked by the other teams.

**The emphasis on cost containment is why Billy Beane and his staff place such a strong emphasis on the entry draft**. Unlike free agency bidding wars, the draft is where young talent is obtained for very little money. Under league rules, when a team drafts a player, they acquire the exclusive right to sign that player: if the player refuses to sign, they have no right to sign with another team unless they choose to reenter the draft. Once they sign, the team has the exclusive rights to their first seven years in the minor leagues and six in the majors.

Moreover, because these are young players directly out of high school or college, eager to play in the major leagues, and with no legal right to sign with a competing team, the team that drafts them has enormous leverage during the contract negotiation process. As a result, extraordinarily talented players coming directly from the draft can be signed for a fraction of what they would cost on the open market. For teams with deep pockets, the draft doesn’t matter so much—they can always afford to grab players through free agency, even though they often overpay and run their payrolls inefficiently. But for a stingy team like the Oakland A’s, the draft is their best shot at putting together a winning roster.

**In 2002, the A’s hold seven picks in the first round**. After having their 2001 roster picked clean through free agency by the free-spending, big-market teams like the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, the 2002 draft represents a remarkable opportunity for the Oakland A’s to replenish their roster. Billy Beane wants to maximize this opportunity. He has a wish list of 20 players he wants and is determined to make sure that they become Oakland A’s by the end of draft day. To do that, he must overcome the irrational biases of his own scouting staff, while outmaneuvering 29 other GMs.

### High School Vs. College Players

Billy has keenly observed that **players who are drafted directly out of high school have a demonstrably worse track record in the majors than college players**. College athletes have played against superior opponents and played more games overall than their high school counterparts. Therefore, their statistics are both qualitatively and quantitatively better than those of high school players.

Billy had been burned by his scouting staff’s insistence on drafting high school players in the 2001 draft. The hype around these players had been based on little more than a handful of personal observations of high school games. The traditionalist scouts had, meanwhile, **dismissed college players with solid stats for the most superficial reasons—their weight, their height, or their “attitude.”**. Billy sees how much of professional baseball scouting is determined by these arbitrary and subjective evaluations. Based on his own experiences as a high school draftee, Paul DePodesta’s statistical analysis, and his insights from reading Bill James, Billy establishes a new rule for his club going into the 2002 draft: no high school players.

### Jeremy Brown and Nick Swisher

Getting the players on the wishlist will be difficult. Whether or not they are still available depends on what the other teams do. Although Billy and Paul DePodesta have largely prioritized players whom they believe will be overlooked by the other clubs, there is always going to be some overlap with what other teams want.

**The picks any team ends up with at the draft depends on a combination of prioritization, strategy, and pure luck** —after all, a general manager has very limited ability to prevent one of the teams ahead of them from picking a coveted player. The Oakland shortlist is made up of overlooked and undervalued, but nevertheless, extremely talented college players. Given the team’s financial squeeze, Billy and Paul must draft top-quality players and sign them for a fraction of what they would be able to command on the open market. They target diamond- in- the- rough players, young men who can be turned into effective professional players once they are trained in the Oakland system, which emphasizes on-base percentage over slugging.

**At the top of Billy’s shortlist are two amateur players—fielder Nick Swisher and catcher Jeremy Brown**. Swisher is one of the relatively few players upon whom the traditional scouts and the sabermetric-focused newcomers are in agreement: the young player is a surefire MLB star.

Brown, on the other hand, is an unconventional pick, especially so high in the first round. Most of the scouting on Brown has assigned him a very low place in the draft, if, indeed, he will be drafted at all. **Although the fielder has what appear to be great stats coming out of college, most of the scouting world has dismissed him as being overweight by major league standards.** He simply doesn’t _look_ the part of a baseball star. And to traditional scouts who base their evaluations of players almost entirely on firsthand observations, this seems like the kiss of death to any team that would be so foolish as to draft him—if Swisher looks like a guaranteed star, Brown looks like the epitome of a bust.

But Billy knows better and sees Brown’s upside, particularly his on-base percentage. Before the draft, the A’s scouting staff contacts Brown, telling him that they are interested in selecting him in the first round. Brown himself is incredulous, thinking that the call must be one of his friends pranking him. Why would a professional baseball team squander one of its precious first round picks on _him_? He has been so influenced by conventional baseball wisdom that he discounts his own potential.

### The Draft Shuffle

To ensure that he is able to draft the players he wants, **Billy and his staff need to be keenly attuned to what the _other_ teams are planning to do**. One unexpected move by another team has the potential to throw the A’s entire draft strategy into turmoil. Whenever a player is drafted by one team, it has consequences for the next teams in line. If their top player is taken, they must have a backup player ready to go.

**Sudden changes have a domino effect across the entire league**. As the draft is about to start, an agent convinces a highly touted high school pitcher named Denard Span that he can negotiate an entry-level contract of $2.6 million for him. Word quickly gets out that Span won’t sign for anything less than this, which means that Span will go undrafted—even the most free-spending teams aren’t willing to throw _that_ kind of money at an untested high school player. And although this figure is far above what the A’s would be able to afford and Span isn’t even someone Billy is interested in drafting, this development impacts his drafting strategy.

Now, the Colorado Rockies, who occupy a first round draft position a few picks ahead of the A’s, will choose a different pitcher than Span, who they had been set to select. This, in turn, will influence the Mets’ drafting strategy. _They_ will be able to select Swisher before the A’s can get him. This, naturally, causes the emotionally combustible Beane to explode at this unexpected turn of fortune. For all of his faith in sabermetrics, data, and rational strategy, **Billy is still the same volatile man who would break his bat when he failed to hit a home run as a player**.

But, just as suddenly, the tides turn again. Billy sees that the Mets have no idea what Swisher is worth. After a conversation with Mets GM Steve Phillips, Billy learns that New York is interested in drafting a high school pitcher named Scott Kazmir. As a high school player, Kazmir is nowhere on Billy’s shortlist, and he is happy to let the Mets have him.

The Mets taking a pass on Swisher, in turn, increases the chances that the Detroit Tigers (who also occupy a position in the draft ahead of the A’s) will choose Prince Fielder, the son of a former Tiger and a sentimental favorite of the Detroit scouting staff. Although the A’s believe it is extremely foolish for Detroit to use a first round pick this way, it opens the way for the A’s to take Swisher, which they do with the 16th pick. They also select Jeremy Brown with the 35th pick.

Draft day 2002 is a perfect encapsulation of **the ideological split in professional baseball: traditional, subjective scouting vs. rational, data-driven sabermetrics**. In favoring the latter approach, Billy Beane and the Oakland A’s are outliers with respect to the rest of the league. The first five picks in that year’s draft are high school players, violating Billy’s new cardinal rule.

To Billy and Paul, this is a wild and reckless gamble on the part of these other teams, squandering priceless draft picks on high school players, who have been shown by the data to have poor chances of actually panning out in the major leagues. Nevertheless, the rest of the league’s hidebound adherence to baseball conventional wisdom is Oakland’s gain.

(Shortform note: None of the top-five picks from the 2002 draft ever appeared in an MLB All-Star Game, something which could be seen as vindicating Oakland’s no “no high school players” philosophy. Both Scott Kazmir and Prince Fielder, however, _did_ go on to All-Star major league careers, suggesting on the other hand that Billy and the A’s were overly pessimistic about other teams’ drafting strategies.)

### Drafting as Value Investing

Billy and his staff can’t believe their good fortune. **As the rest of the league makes poor draft choices, more and more of the A’s shortlist becomes available**. What had looked at the outset like a potential disaster turns into a bonanza for Oakland. At the end of the day, they snag 13 of the 20 players on their shortlist. Before the draft begins, Billy and his staff believe that getting three or four would be a success. This isn’t just a good draft, it is an absolute rout. From the A’s perspective, they have fleeced the rest of the league, drafting talented players and signing them for a fraction of what the other teams are paying.

In drafting these largely overlooked or outside the box players (with the obvious exception of players like Swisher),**the A’s are applying the principles of value investing to professional baseball**. Value investors specialize in identifying companies**** that the market tends to undervalue. Billy and Paul profit from the irrationality of their competitors, who tend to overvalue certain players for subjective or sentimental reasons, rather than a rational analysis of their likelihood to succeed in the major leagues. In adopting a value investor approach to the draft, **the A’s manage to get more bang for their buck than anyone else**.
