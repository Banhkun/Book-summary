## Chapters 3-4: New Approaches to Baseball

**Billy Beane enters the front office at a true inflection point for the Oakland A’s and for baseball as a whole**. Much of what was thought to be sacrosanct about the game is being questioned. The traditional ideas about what makes a winning team are being challenged and proven wrong.

In 1995, as Billy is working his way up the ranks of the front office, the Oakland A’s are sold to real estate developers Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann. This signals a shift in how the entire organization will come to think about acquiring and managing players. The previous owner had been willing to spend as much as needed to field a competitive team, seeing ownership of a major league team as more of an act of civic duty than a profit-yielding investment. In fact, the 1991 A’s had the highest team payroll in all of baseball.

But the new owners adopt a very different approach. For them, owning the A’s is an investment—one that they expect to pay off. **Their new mantra is to reduce costs as much as possible, and that means cutting team payroll to the bone**. Gone are the days of free spending. The team must now economize, making sure that every dollar spent on players demonstrably contributes to on-field success.

### The New Economics of Baseball

Oakland’s new austere, no-frills approach to running the team occurs during an era where the economics of professional baseball are undergoing profound change. The change is driven by a few key factors, all of which make smart drafting of amateur players essential for teams looking to rein in costs.

  1. The first is the rise of free agency in baseball. After a court ruling in the 1970s, players are able, for the first time, to sell their services on the open market following the expiration of their entry-level contracts. 
  2. The second is skyrocketing player salaries, a trend which begins following the introduction of free agency. In just the four years following that court ruling, the average league salary goes from $52,000 per year to $150,000. By 2002, the average player salary is $2 million+, and growing. With baseball players now earning such hefty compensation for their services,**it becomes incumbent upon the front office to make sure that owners’ money is spent wisely.**



For big-market teams like the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, these trends do little to change their approach to running a big-league club. Their deep-pocketed owners are willing and able to spend whatever they need to in order to acquire the biggest stars on the free agent market. But for relatively poor teams like the A’s, they change everything, **placing a premium on finding value in the type of players in whom no one had seen value before.**

### Sandy Alderson: A New Philosophy

Sandy Alderson, general manager of the A’s when Billy Beane makes his transition to the front office, is considered a baseball outsider by many within the organization, mainly because he has never played baseball himself. But because he has never played, **he is unbiased and unattached to baseball’s customary way of doing things** and open to new approaches to the game.

He observes that most of the things baseball insiders love about the game and value most in players—particularly big, flashy plays like home runs and stolen bases—do little over the course of a season to help the team score runs and win games. Simply put, most of the things major league baseball teams do don’t actually _work_.

Because after all,**the purpose of a baseball team isn’t to compile home runs or a high batting average: it’s to score runs and win games.** Therefore, every player and every play ought to be judged solely on the basis of how it contributes to the win column. Alderson, now in charge of spending the team’s suddenly scarce funds, needs to ensure that every penny is spent wisely.

Alderson pioneers a scientific, data-driven, and top-down approach to managing a baseball team. **He thinks little of the opinions and collective wisdom of the old baseball men and is dismissive of the yardsticks by which they measure performance.**

**He is particularly critical of batting average statistics, and the way in which coaches and scouts treat them as the gold standard for success**. Batting average is simply the ratio of hits to total at bats. If a player has five plate opportunities in a game and scores two hits, he has a batting average of .400 (2 hits/5 at bats). Yet in running the numbers, Alderson sees that total team batting average, for all the emphasis the old guard places upon it, bears little relation with total runs scored. Alderson concludes that a high batting average does little to actually win games.

#### Drawing Walks

To drill a bit further, there is a _reason_ that batting average has such a weak correlation with runs—**hits are not the only way that a batter can get on base**. Batting average overlooks **the importance of _walks_** to a team’s total offensive output.

The batting average statistics sharply undervalue a player’s ability to get on base by drawing walks. Players who are good at this aren’t flashy home run hitters, but they contribute heavily to runs scored and, most importantly for Alderson, are deeply undervalued (and underpriced) by most teams. **Drawing walks is a subtle skill** —it relies on the hitter knowing when _not_ to swing, being patient, and studying a pitcher’s throwing tendencies.

This is at odds with the traditional view of walks, namely, that they are entirely produced by pitcher error, and that the batter has no agency in creating them. But Alderson rejects this passive view, arguing that a hitter plays a significant role in drawing walks. Traditional baseball’s free-swinging ethos, meanwhile, conditions players to look for an opportunity to belt one out of the park, rather than contributing to team offense through walks.

#### On-Base Percentage

Alderson sees that**another statistic provides a much better prediction of offensive output: on-base percentage**. This measure tells you how often a batter got on base, including by walks. Essentially, on-base percentage is the probability of a batter making an out. And this is the measure that Alderson seeks to spread like gospel through the Oakland organization.

There is a simple, strong logic to Alderson’s new philosophy. During a team’s hitting portion of an inning, anything is possible before they’ve made three outs; thus, the primary goal of the offense should be to avoid making outs. **Any play which _increases_ a team’s chances of making an out is bad; any play which _decreases_ the chances of making an out is good**. Therefore, increasing on-base percentage should be the primary focus.

#### Attempting to Change the Organizational Culture

All of this is a radical departure in thinking on Alderson’s part, one that sets him apart from the old baseball minds within his organization, including then-manager Tony La Russa. The latter believes that scoring is a product of a series of flashy plays by individual players; Alderson believes that scoring is a team-wide process. **Every ball, every walk, every hit, every avoided out contributes incrementally to runs.**

Alderson is evangelical in his emphasis on on-base percentage. While he sees some success in implementing his ideas in Oakland’s minor league affiliates, his philosophy hits a brick wall with the big club in Oakland, where traditional attitudes still prevail. Alderson’s revolution remains incomplete.

#### The Conversion of Billy Beane

Indeed, the very presence of Billy Beane on the roster, a player who liked to swing at every pitch, shows how little currency Alderson’s ideas have at this time. But Alderson is an important figure for Billy, one who shows him that **it is possible to apply intellectual rigor and analysis to baseball**. By the mid-1990s, Billy has risen through the ranks of the organization to become a talent scout. He is a supporter of Alderson’s approach and wants to apply these principles to his new position. He asks Alderson where he has gotten his ideas from, and Alderson directs him to the works of a writer named Bill James.

Reading James is a turning point for Billy. He goes from being merely a supporter of this new approach to baseball, to a true believer. For, by this point, James’s ideas are beginning to reshape how intelligent general managers and scouts look at the game.

### Bill James: Prophet of Sabermetrics

Bill James had begun his writing career under quite humble circumstances. When he starts self-publishing in the late 1970s (it takes a few years for his work to be taken up by a professional publisher), he is already in his 30s, with no written works to his name. Working the night shift in a pork and beans factory in a tiny town in Kansas, he is an unlikely figure to ultimately revolutionize America’s national pastime.

Nevertheless, he has keen insights about baseball (the only topic about which he ever cared to write) and is driven to put them on paper. **He begins analyzing baseball statistics: specifically, the _deficiencies_ of existing baseball statistics**, and how these deficiencies lead major league teams to make poor and shortsighted personnel decisions. In 1977, he self-publishes his first work, barely longer than a pamphlet. He doesn’t know it at the time, but James is launching a new field of intellectually rigorous and data-driven baseball analysis, which will come to be known as sabermetrics (so named after SABR, the acronym of the Society for American Baseball Research).

**James decries the arbitrary and subjective nature of fielding statistics in baseball, particularly the concept of the error**. An error occurs when a fielder blunders on some sort of defensive play, resulting in a base or a run for the opposing team. But, James argues, the concept of the error is entirely subjective, almost moralistic—indeed, he cites it as the only statistic in sports that is based on an observer’s opinion of what _should_ have happened.

Simply tallying up errors and praising (and paying) the players who commit the fewest makes little sense, in no small part because there is no objective definition of what an error _is_. The “error” in question may be the fault of the pitcher, not the fielder. In fact, a player must do something _right_ to be assigned one in the first place—they must be in the correct field position to even attempt the play on which they erred. In fact, a player could keep his error numbers low by consistently being in the wrong field position.

#### The Deficiencies of the Naked Eye

**One of James’s main insights is that the naked eye is a poor tool for measuring baseball performance**. Statistically significant data, accumulated over long periods of time, offers a much better guide.

Travelling around the country looking for baseball talent, a professional scout might only see small snippets of any given player’s overall performance.__ In isolation, these tiny sample sizes can lead to wild inaccuracies in judgement about a player’s worth. _On any given night_ , after all, a player with a .275 on-base percentage can play better than his teammate with a .350 on-base percentage.

Yet, James notes, **these chance observations of players are informing baseball decisions at the highest levels.** Teams are making ludicrous personnel decisions and deciding who does and doesn’t get to be a professional baseball player based on the very flimsiest information. This outrages James, especially in an era of skyrocketing baseball salaries. **If players are going to be paid exorbitant sums, it makes sense to figure out exactly what they’re worth**. A grotesque market failure, a gross misallocation of precious resources, is at the heart of professional baseball.

Moreover, James is exasperated by the fact that good data actually _is_ available. Rapid advances in computer technology during the 1970s and 1980s have lowered the cost of acquiring and analyzing baseball statistics, certainly for wealthy MLB teams. But the teams choose to squander this opportunity, **relying on bad conventional wisdom and outmoded heuristics to decide who should and shouldn’t become a professional baseball player.**

#### Removing Luck from Baseball Analysis

James begins publishing annual treatises, in which he highlights the uselessness of commonly-cited baseball statistics like errors, runs batted in (RBIs). Another of James’s key insights is that **much of the data that managers, scouts, and GMs use to evaluate players’ skill is based on luck and subjective opinion.** In publishing his annual baseball abstracts, James attempts to strip as much luck out of baseball analysis as possible.

James also points out the absurdity of that statistic revered by baseball’s old guard: the RBI. A batter earns an RBI when they score a hit that results in another player scoring a run. By definition, it is a product of luck: a batter has to have the good fortune to be at bat when other players are _already_ on base. The batter will, of course, have had nothing to do with their teammates getting on base before them. **It is a matter of luck to even have the _opportunity_ to score an RBI.** A batter who hits a single with a runner in scoring position and a batter who hits a single with no one on base have performed the same athletic feat—but one will be credited with an RBI, while the other won’t.

#### The Runs Created Formula

James wants to see exactly which plays most contribute to a team’s offensive production. He sets out to construct a model to predict how many runs a team might expect to score, based on their accumulated walks, singles, doubles, stolen bases, and other offense-generating plays. He pores over statistics from previous baseball seasons to see which components of offense are most correlated with runs. This allows him to assign a statistical “weight” to each, in effect determining how many runs (or portions of a run) a walk, hit, or stolen base is worth.

He distills it down to a “Runs Created” formula:

**Runs Created = (Hits + Walks) x Total Bases/(At Bats + Walks)**

After statistical analysis, James finds that this formula is remarkably effective in predicting a team’s run production. **It shows that walks are a valuable (yet overlooked) part of offense, while batting average matters hardly at all.**

#### Rejection by Baseball Insiders

Although James starts out with a small audience in 1977, his annual treatises on baseball, _The Bill James Baseball Abstracts_ , reach a growing and influential audience throughout the 1980s. People are compelled by his sharp and pointed critiques of the ludicrous measures by which baseball teams measure success, and begin urging major league clubs to take James’s ideas more seriously. People with backgrounds in economics, mathematics, and statistical analysis are especially drawn to his rationalistic approach to analyzing something that everyone _thinks_ they already understand.

Despite this, **there is a marked hostility on the part of baseball insiders toward those they perceive as baseball outsiders** , particularly this new army of data-focused, statistics-obsessed observers who dare to tell the big clubs that they are doing their jobs all wrong.

The small cadre of people who actually _run_ professional baseball teams is determined to exclude outside voices and opinions, even if that means losing games. They prefer to do things _their_ way than take advice from a bunch of pencil-pushers droning on about on-base percentage and runs created formulas. **They are profoundly uninterested in using baseball statistics in an analytical way**. In fact, in the early 1980s, the earliest participants in what later becomes the phenomenon of fantasy sports are more interested in getting their hands on good baseball data than the teams themselves—even though these fans stand to gain far less from such knowledge.

On the rare occasion when major league teams of this era _do_ try to implement sabermetric principles in the front office, these attempts are met with hostility by baseball’s old guard, including sports journalists and ordinary fans. When the Boston Red Sox hire a James-inspired number-cruncher to advise the general manager on personnel decisions, the sports media in Boston treats the hiring as a scandal. They point to this person’s unathletic appearance, his non-baseball background, and his residence in New York City (home of the hated Yankees) as disqualifying factors. They excoriate the Boston GM for being under the sway of a computer geek who (to them) doesn’t know the first thing about baseball and claims to avoid even watching the games. After public outcry in Boston, the team is forced to fire this sabermetrician.

**Exasperated James acolytes find their ideas rejected across the league**. The ideological conservatism of baseball’s ruling elite seems to have a stranglehold on the game. Despite his growing popularity with the general public, James finds that he has made no headway with the most influential part of what he _thinks_ would be his natural audience—the people who actually run professional baseball teams.

**But he does have one devoted reader, who will eventually put his ideas into practice at baseball’s highest level—Billy Beane.**
