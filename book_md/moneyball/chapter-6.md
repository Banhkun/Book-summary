## Chapters 11-12, Epilogue: Rise of the Sabermetricians

**The A’s are reborn after Billy’s wheeling and dealing at the trade deadline**. A mediocre third-place team at the end of July, by September, they are in first place in the AL West, going on a 19-game winning streak. On September 4, 2002, they have the opportunity to earn their 20th straight win, an American League record at the time.

That night, the largest crowd ever for an Oakland regular season game gathers at Network Associates Coliseum to watch the A’s try to make history against the hapless Kansas City Royals. The team’s success is a testament to Beane and DePodesta’s strategy of finding player value where other teams see none, and putting their resources into on-base percentage rather than flashy home run hitters. They are a Bill James-inspired team: and the results are showing on the field.

### The Two Sides of Billy Beane

**Billy has no intention of watching the game that night, as is his standard practice.** Like with the Jason Giambi homecoming game, there is no point in getting emotionally invested in the outcome of a single match. A baseball GM assembles a team for the long haul of a 162-game season. Worrying about one game, no matter its symbolic importance, is akin to a casino manager worrying about the outcomes of individual pulls of the slot machine or draws at the blackjack table.

Billy has created a team composed of players whom he regards highly because of their strong statistical performances in meaningful categories over long periods of time. **In the long run of the regular season, he believes that they will meet their statistical destiny**. But, of course, anything can happen in a single game.

Despite his intentions,But Billy is unable to resist the temptation to watch the A’s go for their 20th straight win. During the game, he finds it difficult to keep his emotions in check. When the A’s roar out to an 11-0 lead in the game, the crowd is ecstatic and Billy is elated. The team’s 20th straight victory seems assured. But bit by bit, the commanding lead evaporates. And as it does, **Billy the cold, calculating GM gives way to Billy the emotional volcano, liable to explode at any time.**

Clearly, he is highly emotionally invested in this one game, even if he knows he shouldn’t be. After all, the model he and DePodesta had put together shows that the team needs to win 95 games to earn a postseason berth. Ninety-five wins means 67 losses, and tonight might just be one of those 67. But it is impossible for Billy to detach himself from the symbolic importance of this game. **He begins criticizing the performances of individual players and calling into question the decisions of manager Art Howe** , with whom he frequently clashes (Howe also resents Billy’s micromanaging of the A’s and feels he lacks the on-field deference customarily granted to managers).

Miguel Tejada is a shortstop who Billy has hounded for making flashy, acrobatic plays instead of less glamorous, but tactically sound ones. On this night, Tejada tries and fails to get a runner out at home plate instead of going after the runner on third base. The risky play fails to produce any outs and cuts the Oakland lead to 11-6. **Billy is frustrated, claiming that players like Tejada “try to do more than they should.”** Later, Billy calls Howe’s impulsive decision to take first Bradford and then Rincon out of the game as “a fucking embarrassment.” As the Royals rally to tie the game at 11-11, Billy begins hurling objects around the clubhouse in frustration.

At the bottom of the ninth inning, with the score tied, Scott Hatteberg, Billy Beane’s reclamation project, steps up to the plate. With the score tied, Hatteberg has the opportunity to win the game in a walk-off. True to his patient hitting style, **Hatteberg vows to himself that he will not swing at anything in the strike zone unless he has two strikes against him** , after which he has little choice but to swing. He will grind the pitcher down as much as he can, looking for either a weak pitch or an opportunity to earn a walk.

Happily for Hatteberg and the A’s, he doesn’t need to wait that long. On the second pitch, Hatteberg takes a swing at a fastball and belts it out of the park for a game-winning, history-making home run, as the A’s clinch their 20th consecutive victory. Billy Beane will try to pass off the game as no different than any other, but of course, it isn’t. Billy may operate as a calculating, asset-trading GM, but he is still, at heart, driven by passion and emotion.

(Shortform note: The 2017 Cleveland Indians posted 22 consecutive wins, breaking the record set by the 2002 Oakland A’s.)

### The Playoff Crapshoot

**The Oakland A’s shock the baseball world by winning the AL West Division, with a record of 103-59.** They have one of the best regular season records in all of baseball, second only to the Yankees (the team that poached Jason Giambi). Going into the season, the media and old guard of baseball had believed the A’s barely stood a chance of making the playoffs at all, let alone of winning their division. Their success is a testament to Beane and DePodesta’s value investment strategy in building the team and a stunning rebuke to decades of conventional wisdom about what makes a winning ballclub.

One of Billy’s favorite proof points is the fact that the Minnesota Twins have scored 32 fewer runs than the A’s, despite having a team batting average that is 11 points higher. Billy explains to his team and to the media that this disparity is due to the fact that the Twins’ on-base percentage is lower, and on-base percentage matters far more for run production than batting average. The Twins also squander outs by making foolish plays like attempting to steal bases and hitting sacrifice bunts at a rate far higher than the A’s.

**This is a major point of contention between the A’s and the baseball traditionalists** , particularly television and radio commentators like former player Joe Morgan. Morgan argues that teams must “manufacture runs” to achieve success in the playoffs, i.e., trade outs for runs through stealing bases and hitting sacrifice flies and bunts. Billy thinks this argument betrays a deep ignorance of the game. **Why would a team treat outs as anything other than a precious resource to be preserved at all costs?** And why should the process for winning a baseball game be any different in the playoffs than it was during the regular season?

Billy knows that much of the baseball commentariat is actively rooting against his team in the playoffs. They seem to not so much _disagree_ with his club’s ideas about how to win baseball games as to be outright _offended_ by them. Winning games without flashy home run sluggers or lighting-speed pitchers, to these keepers of baseball’s conventional wisdom, is a violation of the natural order of things, a perversion of the noble tradition and spirit of America’s national pastime.

Unfortunately for Billy and the A’s, **the Joe Morgans of the world get their wish when the A’s fall in the first round of the playoffs,** losing three games to two in a best-of-five divisional series to the Minnesota Twins. The naysayers believe that this proves Billy Beane wrong: the Twins, with their high slugging percentage and team batting average, have beaten the sabermetric, on-base percentage-obsessed A’s. The old school of subjective baseball commentary is right; the new school of data analysis and number crunching is wrong.

But is this really true? Can such sweeping inferences be drawn from a five-game playoff series, which the A’s barely lost? To Billy Beane and Paul DePodesta, the answer is a resounding “no.” The A’s poor playoff performance relative to their stellar regular season record is entirely explained by the small sample sizes of the playoffs, in which random on-field events have an outsized impact on the outcome of a series. **As Billy points out, “My job is to get us to the playoffs. What happens after that is fucking luck.”**

DePodesta notes that during the regular season, the A’s had allowed an average of only four runs per game, but that they allowed 5.4 during the series against the Twins. If a key player has a few bad games in a row during the regular season, it matters little, because the consequences are negligible in the context of 162 games. But in a five-game playoff series, poor player performance can doom a team. This is precisely what happens to the A’s in the 2002 playoffs: Tim Hudson, who had been a rock-solid pitcher all season, pitches two awful games against the Twins. This is entirely anomalous for him and couldn’t have been predicted. The A’s have been hit with bad luck.

### The Insiders Club

While the _outcome_ is obviously frustrating, **the playoff flameout does little to undermine the soundness of the team’s overall approach.** That Joe Morgan is out in public claiming that Oakland’s loss is due to their inability to “manufacture runs” says more about the absurdity of his critique and his ignorance of how baseball actually works than it does about the A’s.

**Morgan is part of an insiders club of pundits, writers, scouts, and ex-players, one almost entirely immune to accountability**. No matter how inaccurate their predictions, no matter how wrongheaded their analysis of the game, they are never drummed out of professional baseball circles. The members of this clique always seem to find ways to make a living in the world of baseball, despite their often poor performances and recycled cliches. This situation contrasts with that of active players, managers, and GMs, who are unceremoniously traded, demoted, or fired for the most capricious reasons.

This state of affairs would never exist in a functioning market. In a rational labor market, people who were bad at their jobs, whether commenting on baseball or scouting future players, would be fired. But as we’ve seen, baseball is one big market failure, one in which salaries rarely correspond with actual value. **It is less of a business than a social club, one that values loyalty over competence.**

### An Opportunity Declined

Billy Beane is surprisingly calm in the wake of his team’s playoff disappointment. **He knows that what he has accomplished with the A’s on a shoestring budget is extraordinary**. He is frustrated by the media commentary, which seems inordinately focused on how a team fares in the playoff crapshoot rather than the real test of its mettle during the regular season, but he knows he cannot change this.

What he _can_ change is the makeup of his team, to prepare it for success in 2003. One of his first moves is to get rid of manager Art Howe. He persuades the Mets to hire Howe, taking his hefty $2 million salary off the books, and he promotes one of the assistant coaches to the manager position. And in the A’s organization, the manager is more of a symbolic role: Billy will be calling all the shots.

By this time, the smart team owners around the league see the merit of the Oakland philosophy. **Value-driven methods can put a winning team on the field, leading to higher revenue from ticket sales and television viewing figures—all at minimal expense**. The year before, in fact, the owner of the Toronto Blue Jays had hired the A’s director of player development, J.P. Ricciardi, as the Blue Jays’ GM, hiring him right on the spot. Ricciardi, who had learned at the feet of Beane and Paul DePodesta, begins remaking the Blue Jays along similar lines, bringing in a team of outside analysts and number-crunchers and shedding team payroll in a drive for sabermetric efficiency.

(Shortform note: Ricciardi’s tenure as Blue Jays GM was largely viewed as a disappointment in Toronto. In eight seasons from 2002-2009, Ricciardi never assembled a team that reached the playoffs.)

The Boston Red Sox are also coming to believe in the sabermetric revolution. New owner John Henry hires Bill James (Henry is shocked that no other baseball team has ever tried to hire James), as well as DIPS inventor Voros McCracken. But there is one more missing piece of the puzzle in John Henry’s quest to remake the Red Sox: Billy Beane.

Henry offers Billy a five-year, $12.5 million contract to take the GM job in Boston. It is a tempting offer, but Billy ultimately declines. He realizes that the only reason he is interested in the job is for the money. As a fresh-faced high school graduate, he had made the decision to sign an entry-level contract with the Mets and become a professional baseball player. **It was the only decision he had ever made for money—and it had been the worst decision of his life**. He vows to never make that mistake again.

Billy has finally fulfilled his destiny as a winner, but in the front office rather than on the field. In his 20+ year journey through the world of professional baseball, Billy has finally proved his value. And there is no putting a price on that.

(Shortform note: In 2015, Billy Beane was promoted to executive vice president of baseball operations for the Oakland A’s, after serving nearly 20 years as GM. In 2009, Sports Illustrated named him one of the “Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade.” His methods of player evaluation have now been widely adopted across Major League Baseball.

Paul DePodesta is currently the chief strategy officer of the NFL’s Cleveland Browns, and has enjoyed a long and successful career as a professional sports executive.)
