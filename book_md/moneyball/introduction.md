## Introduction

Anyone involved in playing professional baseball or managing a professional team cannot escape the weight of the sport’s history. As America’s national pastime, it’s been played in the United States since before the Civil War. And this long and storied tradition has created a century and a half’s worth of conventional wisdom about best practices and how the game _ought_ to be played.

Baseball’s old guard—a consortium of coaches, scouts, general managers, owners, former players, and sports journalists—have rigid conceptions of what makes a good player and how teams win games. **But the central insight of _Moneyball_ is that much of this conventional wisdom, propagated by baseball’s traditional gatekeepers, is hopelessly wrong. **

The 2002 Oakland Athletics, pegged by baseball insiders as a mediocre club at the outset of the season, exposed much of the sport’s conventional wisdom to be bunk when they posted a 102-60 regular season. They did this with a roster composed of players that had largely been overlooked by the insider’s club—pitchers with unusual pitching technique, fielders who were overweight or couldn’t run quickly, and hitters who barely knew how to belt a home run. In short, the 2002 Oakland A’s were a team of players who didn’t _look_ like players at all.

_Moneyball_ is the story of how this team and its general manager, Billy Beane, turn the baseball world on its head and call into question everything that everyone _thinks_ they know about the game. But to understand how Billy Beane proves the naysayers wrong, we need to take a closer look at the man himself and understand why his _own_ baseball background and experiences influence the way he assesses baseball players.

### Shortform Note

_(_ Shortform note _: Moneyball_ has been a controversial book within the baseball world since its original publication in 2003. Some critics claim that it underestimates the achievements of traditional, non-sabermetric scouting: Barry Zito, Tim Hudson, and Mark Mulder for example, were great players for Oakland during the 2002 season, but are barely mentioned in the book. None of them were regarded as unconventional draft picks or diamonds in the rough—they were, instead, quite conventional baseball stars. This criticism accuses author Michael Lewis of picking and choosing his examples to make the sabermetric approach look prescient and the traditional, more subjective approach look ignorant and short-sighted.

Perhaps more significantly, the issue of performance-enhancing substances is entirely unmentioned. While baseball’s steroid scandal had not yet become a major story in 2003, it is now known that Jason Giambi and Miguel Tejada, two critical A’s players during the _Moneyball_ era, were using PEDs. Given that Billy Beane was an acknowledged micromanager, overseeing all aspects of team operation and policy, this does raise important questions about what he did and didn’t know at the time.)
