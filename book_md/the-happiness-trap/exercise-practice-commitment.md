## Exercise: Practice Commitment

Harris writes that commitment in the face of failure requires three steps: Recognize and fully accept your situation, determine what action you can take now that’s in sync with your values, and take the action.

* * *

Apply Harris’s three commitment steps to a current problem or goal you failed to meet. Accept the situation using one of the mindfulness techniques: defusion, expansion, or connection. How has this affected your view of the situation?

Identify an action you can take that aligns with your values. Specifically, which values does the action address and how?

Determine when you’ll take the action, and identify any necessary steps.
