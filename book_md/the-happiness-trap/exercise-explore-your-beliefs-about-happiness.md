## Exercise: Explore Your Beliefs About Happiness

Harris contends that our erroneous beliefs about happiness (that humans are naturally happy; if you’re unhappy, there’s something wrong with you; and you can and must eliminate negative thoughts and feelings) lead to misery.

* * *

Which of Harris’s happiness myths has had the greatest impact on your life; how has it affected you?

Describe a time when you acted on a negative event or emotion based on this myth—what did you do, and how did you end up feeling afterward?

How would rejecting this myth change your response to a negative emotion or event next time?
