## Shortform Introduction

Instincts hardwired into us from humans’ earliest days lead us to relentlessly pursue happiness. But these instincts make us miserable today—**our continual efforts to be happy lead instead to stress, anxiety, and greater unhappiness.** We’re caught in a happiness trap.

As an antidote, therapist and life coach Russ Harris advocates ACT, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which will help you accept pain as part of life and deal with it productively.

While Harris didn’t develop ACT—it originated in the mid-1980s—his 2007 book helped popularize ACT, which uses a combination of behavioral and mindfulness principles strategies.

He touts it as a “revolutionary” development in human psychology based on behavioral science. ACT is related to but moves away from CBT, or cognitive behavioral therapy, in that CBT focuses on changing your thoughts to lessen suffering, while ACT teaches awareness and acceptance of negative thoughts and feelings. The “commitment” part of ACT refers to committing yourself to taking action. Proponents say ACT can help you free yourself from stress, anxiety, and depression.

**By developing “psychological flexibility” toward negative feelings instead of trying to eliminate them, and then acting in accordance with your values, Harris argues that you’ll live a more satisfying life.**

### About the Author

Harris is a medical practitioner, psychotherapist, life coach, and consultant to the World Health Organization. (He wrote a stress management protocol for use in refugee camps.) He’s presented hundreds of workshops and trained more than 50,000 health professionals in ACT in the US, UK, Europe, and Australia.

Harris claims that discovering and practicing ACT as a physician in Australia in his late 20s helped him overcome depression and stress. He noticed that many of his patients suffered from the same problems, so he switched his field to therapy to help more people.

He’s since written multiple ACT-based textbooks and self-help books besides _The Happiness Trap_ , including:

  * _ACT With Love_ (2009)
  * _The Confidence Gap_ (2011)
  * _The Reality Slap_ (2012)
  * _Getting Unstuck in ACT_ (2013)
  * _The Illustrated Happiness Trap_ (2014)
  * _ACT Questions and Answers_ (2018, for clinicians)
  * _ACT Made Simple_ (2009 revised 2019, a textbook for professionals)
  * _Trauma-Focused ACT_ (2021, for clinicians)
  * _When Life Hits Hard_ (2021)



Harris also offers ACT courses online for laypeople and clinicians, as well as corporate programs. In addition, he is co-director of PsyFlex, which works with businesses and organizations to improve their work environments by applying a non-therapy version of ACT.

### The Book’s Publication

  * Publisher: Trumpeter Books, an imprint of Shambhala Publications Inc.



_The Happiness Trap_ was published in Australia in March 2007. According to Amazon, it’s an international bestseller, having sold more than one million copies, with editions published in more than 30 languages.

It ranks fourth among Amazon bestsellers on depression and 22nd among cognitive psychology books.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

Positive-thinking approaches to living a happier, more successful life, have dominated self-help books and media since the genre’s blooming in the 1920s. In 2007, the year _The Happiness Trap_ was published, competing titles about harnessing your thoughts for change included:

  * _Change Your Thoughts—Change Your Life_ , Wayne W. Dyer
  * _Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain_ , Sharon Begley
  * _The Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the World_ , Lynne McTaggart (on positive thinking)
  * _Reposition Yourself,_ T.D. Jakes
  * _The Astonishing Power of Emotions_ , Esther Hicks and Jerry Hicks (on positive thinking and the law of attraction)



In contrast to these books’ focus on changing your thoughts and yourself, Harris advocated self-acceptance, especially accepting negative thoughts and feelings as inevitable and, at times, useful. Further, he presented ACT as empirically supported, unlike the ideas of some self-help gurus.

#### Intellectual Context

ACT (pronounced like the word “act”) was developed by psychologist Steven C. Hayes and other researchers in the mid-1980s. It aims to help people handle painful thoughts and feelings while living a meaningful, satisfying life by applying six techniques or skills to develop “psychological flexibility.” (Hayes discussed the latter concept in a TED talk.)

In _The Happiness Trap_ , Harris cites studies indicating this behavioral/mindfulness method helps people with a range of concerns, including anxiety, stress, chronic pain, drug addiction, smoking, and depression.

ACT is the opposite of positive psychology, started in the 1990s by psychologist and bestselling author Martin Seligman to study what happiness is, and to help patients live happier lives (rather than studying what makes people mentally ill). In contrast, **ACT proponents like Harris argue that happiness isn’t human’s natural state, therefore positive psychology raises unrealistic expectations.**

Further, Harris notes that we sometimes need to pay attention to and deal with negative feelings. Also, many of our most meaningful experiences encompass both happiness and unhappiness. While ACT and positive psychology take opposite approaches, both are recognized as valid by the American Psychological Association (APA).

Still, in 2011, APA published a critical analysis noting that while ACT presented itself as a new, “third wave” of behavioral treatment, proponents of traditional CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) believed that ACT didn’t deserve the hype because it represented only minor variations of CBT.

In addition, critics caution that ACT’s techniques of contemplating negative thoughts and feelings may not always be appropriate for trauma recovery. (While there’s little research on the adverse effects of mindfulness practices like those ACT promotes, one study found that mindfulness-based programs caused adverse effects in 37-58% of participants.)

Harris disagrees that ACT is an inappropriate tool for trauma recovery, although he advises that trauma patients practice the techniques with a therapist rather than on their own. Harris’s 2021 book, _Trauma-Focused ACT_ , advocates resolving traumatic memories through “flexible exposure.”

#### The Book’s Impact

Many psychologists and therapists recommend the book to clients because of its accessible presentation of ACT principles, as well as its practical exercises. It also appears on multiple lists of therapists’ most-recommended books.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

**Many readers praise the book for offering specific, practical techniques for easing stress and anxiety** , while not making sweeping claims; some call it life-changing. Others call the book a great introduction to ACT, lauding its simple explanations of ACT concepts and the fact that ACT overall is evidence-based.

Steven C. Hayes, the founder of ACT, praised the book for its exploration of how we fall into the happiness trap and for presenting the practical techniques in a creative, accessible way.

However, **some readers feel the book is too elementary for those who already have basic self-awareness** and who have worked on examining their thoughts and behaviors. A few think it should carry a warning for trauma survivors.

Additionally, some readers deem Harris disrespectful for failing to mention or credit Eastern religion and philosophy, especially Buddhism, for the mindfulness concepts and practices at the foundation of ACT. Another questioned the extent to which ACT theories may or may not apply to non-white people and cultures, claiming that the studies on ACT’s effectiveness focused on white sample populations.

### Our Approach in This Guide

The guide is organized in two parts:

  * **Part 1 explains the origin** , dynamics, and impact of the happiness trap. 
  * **Part 2 explains ACT** and its core principles and techniques, as well as providing exercises for practicing and applying them in everyday life. It also focuses on finding fulfillment by acting in accordance with your values, rather than spending your energy on avoiding painful thoughts and feelings in the hope of being happier.



We’ve reordered the six ACT techniques to start with the observing self because understanding this concept provides helpful context for understanding the other principles, which incorporate the observing self. We’ve also merged chapters for coherency–here’s a mapping of the sections of the guide to the chapters of the book:

  * Part 1 → Book Chapters 1-3
  * Part 2
    * Principle #1 → Book Chapters 7, 23
    * Principle #2 → Book Chapters 4-6, 8-9
    * Principle #3 → Book Chapters 10-16
    * Principle #4 → Book Chapters 17-22
    * Principle #5 → Book Chapters 24-26, 28
    * Principle #6 → Book Chapters 27, 29-33



In this guide, we’ll provide background on the development and uses of ACT, and we’ll compare ACT principles to other therapies and practices. We’ll also provide additional exercises and techniques beyond Harris’s for practicing mindfulness in everyday life.
