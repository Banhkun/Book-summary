## Exercise: Does Your Thinking Self Help or Hinder?

Harris explains that we have two minds or “selves” that affect our response to events: The thinking self provides a running (judgmental) commentary on events, while the observing self neutrally observes this running commentary.

* * *

Describe a time when you acted in a situation based on the interpretation or judgment of your thinking self (for example, taking something your partner said as criticism and responding angrily).

How did the situation turn out? How did your reaction influence the outcome?

How would sidelining your thinking self and activating your observing self have affected your response to this situation?
