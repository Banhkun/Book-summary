## Introduction

In _The Happiness Trap_ ,__ Russ Harris explores Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, or ACT, a psychological discipline developed by Steven C. Hayes in 1982. Hayes developed ACT in the context of evolutionary psychology, which holds that our early survival instincts influence our modern brains—and that failing to recognize this connection undermines our happiness.

_The Happiness Trap_ contends that **humans are not wired to be naturally happy**. To the contrary, the psychological mechanisms that helped our ancestors survive and reproduce make us uncomfortable (and unhappy) in the modern world.

Harris argues that**fighting the natural inclinations of our brains in an effort to be happy all the time is a futile endeavor and only makes us _more_ unhappy** in the long term. Harris calls this paradox “the happiness trap.” He offers ACT as an empirically supported remedy to this universal problem of human experience.

> **Happiness—and Unhappiness—Are Essential to Motivation**
> 
> Although many scientists agree that the human brain is not wired to be consistently happy, happiness does play an important role in human motivation. A 1950s study, researchers implanted electrodes in rats’ brains that allowed the animals to push a lever and get a pulse of stimulation to their brains’ pleasure centers. The rats became so obsessed with the pleasure stimulation that they didn’t pause to eat, drink, or sleep. The dopamine hits that fueled the rats’ obsession also feed drug addiction.
> 
> The brain is wired to get these dopamine bursts from external rewards—like money and material goods—more than intrinsic rewards, like contentment. The catch: The dopamine surge from external rewards is more short-lived, creating the _unhappiness_ that motivates us to pursue more happiness. Evolutionary psychologists argue that this unhappiness was key to our ancient ancestors’ survival because it helped them remain vigilant to threats and motivated to continually progress.

The long-term goal of ACT is to help people develop “psychological flexibility,” a mindset that allows them to productively deal with their suffering and take meaningful action. ACT seeks to promote psychological flexibility through six foundational principles. We’ll explore each of these in greater detail in later chapters.

  1. **Connecting with the “observing self”** : Your mind, or “self,” has two parts—your _thinking self_ thinks, judges, and acts, while your _observing self_ observes those actions. Activating your observing self can alter the way you deal with negative thoughts and feelings and how you connect to the world around you.
  2. **Defusion** : A mindfulness technique for acknowledging unwanted thoughts and images by relating to them through the observing self. (In general, mindfulness means focusing on the moment.)
  3. **Expansion** : A mindfulness technique for accepting uncomfortable feelings and urges by relying on the observing self to make space for them in your body.
  4. **Connection** : A mindfulness technique for becoming fully mentally present in your environment by prioritizing the nonjudgmental perceptions of the observing self. 
  5. **Clarifying values** : A human being can’t live a meaningful life without values. ACT encourages you to discover the values that you hold dearest when you aren’t preoccupied by the constant quest to escape pain.
  6. **Committed action** : ACT defines two types of action essential to well-being. The first type is “effective action,” or action that corresponds with your values. The second type, which follows from the first, is “committed action,” which is effective action taken repeatedly without fear of consequence or failure. 



> **Psychology of the Normal**
> 
> Steven C. Hayes, who developed ACT, has described the approach as “psychology of the normal.” Whereas other frameworks focus on detecting and correcting abnormal processes through diagnosing psychological disorders, ACT teaches people how to use normal brain functions in a productive way. For example, the abilities to analyze and evaluate are essential to our survival and ability to thrive—but, when these functions become overactive, they can send us into anxious spirals that actually inhibit our productivity and happiness.
> 
> Hayes explains that since brain processes like analysis, evaluation, and problem-solving are necessary for everyday life, therapists can’t encourage people to stop them altogether, as they do with _abnormal_ processes like obsessive compulsions. Instead, they must teach patients how to use these functions responsibly and productively. In this way, Hayes says that his purpose is not to “cure” or “fix” patients' problems, but rather to give them the tools to overcome obstacles that naturally come up in life.

Harris began his career as a medical doctor in 1989 but transitioned out of medicine and into therapy after noticing how many of his patients struggled with stress and unhappiness. He has written numerous books on ACT for both specialized and general audiences, and he leads ACT training for therapists across the world.

This guide will begin by taking a deeper look at our cultural beliefs about happiness, why those beliefs don’t align with evolutionary psychology, and how the conflict between our beliefs about happiness and the actual function of our brains creates the happiness trap. Then, we will examine each of the six principles of ACT in turn, giving the context necessary to understand each concept or technique, as well as a practical summation of how to apply these principles to your own life.
