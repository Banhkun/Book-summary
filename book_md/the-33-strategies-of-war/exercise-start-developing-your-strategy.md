## Exercise: Start Developing Your Strategy

Take a minute to think about how you could apply some of Greene’s advice to winning the battles in your own life.

* * *

Greene says one of the keys to developing an effective strategy is knowing exactly what you want to accomplish. Think of a project or something you’d like to accomplish in the near future and briefly describe your desired end-state. (For example, paying off debt, getting a promotion, or positioning your product as the market leader in a certain sector.)

Greene emphasizes the importance of understanding your enemies (remember, your “enemy” is anything or anyone standing between you and your goal). What could prevent you from achieving the desired end-state you described in your previous answer? In other words, who are your enemies? Consider both literal enemies (for example, political opponents) and figurative enemies (for example, if you habitually scroll through social media to the point where it takes time away from achieving your goals, maybe your social media habit is an enemy that you’ll need to vanquish.)

Greene advises striking at the source of your enemy’s power. Analyze one of the enemies that you identified. What is it that makes that enemy powerful or enables them to stand in your way? What do they depend on to maintain their strength?

How could you neutralize the source of your enemy’s power that you identified above? List at least one way you could strike at the root of the problem.
