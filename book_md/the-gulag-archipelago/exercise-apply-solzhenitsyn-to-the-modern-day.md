## Exercise: Apply Solzhenitsyn to the Modern Day

 _The Gulag Archipelago_ , as a history and a critique, was highly specific to the Soviet Union and its citizens. Even so, the book is widely read today, and has been used as an educational tool for discussing issues such as censorship, political repression, and human rights abuses in prison. Proponents of the book argue that it doesn’t just illuminate the past, but can act as a warning about the future.

What parallels, if any, do you see between Solzhenitsyn’s depiction of the Soviet Union and your own country? If these two governments are more unalike than alike, what do you think are the key differences?

Do Solzhenitsyn’s descriptions of the gulag system resemble the prison system in your own country? Why or why not?

What do you think the goals of your country’s prison system are, compared to Solzhenitsyn’s claim that the gulag was a tool of control and exploitation?
