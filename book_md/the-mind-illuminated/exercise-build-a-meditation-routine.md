## Exercise: Build a Meditation Routine

According to the authors of _The Mind Illuminated_ , the first step of successful meditation is building a consistent meditation routine. Take some time to plan out your daily meditation routine.

* * *

What would be an ideal time of day for you to meditate? Recall the authors’ advice to choose the same time every day and opt for a time when your mind is naturally alert and calm. (For instance, if you’re a morning person, it may be best to meditate every morning at 7:30 a.m. before your workday obligations crowd your mind.)

What can you do to protect that time for meditation? What obligations will you need to reschedule so that no other tasks interfere with your chosen meditation time? (For example, you may need to wake up earlier, change when you have breakfast, or change when you begin or end your workday.)

Finally, consider how you can boost your motivation to meditate. How could you change your meditation routine to increase pleasure (such as designing a calm, beautiful nook to practice in)? What could you do to seek out inspiration (such as subscribing to a monthly meditation magazine)?
