## Shortform Introduction

In _Profit First_ , Mike Michalowicz presents his own system of business accounting and financial management, which allocates a percentage of income as profit before calculating money for expenses. Michalowicz claims that this method allows an entrepreneur to create and maintain financial habits which will make their business more efficient, stable, and profitable.

### About the Author

Mike Michalowicz is an author, entrepreneur, business makeover specialist on MSNBC, and lecturer. In the 1990s, he found initial success starting and selling two multi-million-dollar tech companies. By 2008, though, he had lost all of his money on ill-fated startups and ended up in debt. By studying his mistakes, he developed new methods and techniques to get himself out of debt and regain financial stability. Over the next decade, Michalowicz paid off his debt and now runs two multi-million dollar companies and authors books on how to run a successful business.

### The Book’s Publication

**Publisher** : Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Random House

Mike Michalowicz self-published _Profit First_ in 2014, and Portfolio later published a revised and expanded version in 2017. (This guide covers the 2017 version of the book.)

While all of his books are about entrepreneurship, _Profit First_ is his best known work and is devoted specifically to money management and accounting. _Profit First_ was Michalowicz’s third book, following his guide to startup success, _The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur_ ,__ in 2008 and his guide to business growth, _The Pumpkin Plan_ ,__ in 2012. Michalowicz has continued writing since the release of _Profit First_ , his most recent books being a children’s money management guide (_My Money Bunnies_)__ and a marketing guide (_Get Different_).

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

The Profit First system of money management was originally a theory described in a brief section of Mike Michalowicz’s first book, _The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur_. After hearing from entrepreneurs who had tried his theoretical system and found success, he decided to expand and develop on that original theory by writing _Profit First_.

It fits into the category of books for simplifying accounting and financial management for entrepreneurs, particularly those running small to medium sized businesses. This includes books like Gregory Burges Crabtree’s _Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!_ (2011) and Dawn Fotopulos’s _Accounting for the Numerophobic _(2014). Michalowicz attempts to distinguish his book from others in the genre by pitching an alternative accounting system instead of trying to simplify existing systems.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Profit First_ is on the Kindle best-sellers list for business accounting and the Apple Books best-sellers list for business and personal finance.

Michalowicz has also built a larger _Profit First_ brand based on the methods explained in the book. The brand includes speaking engagements, a podcast, online courses, conventions, a blog, merchandise, and more. In addition, he’s created a network of accountants, bookkeepers, and coaches who use the Profit First system and help businesses adopt it.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

The majority of reviews of _Profit First_ are positive, and many come from accountants and entrepreneurs who successfully adopted the Profit First system for their own businesses. There are also many positive reviews from other authors in the genres of business accounting and entrepreneurship. These reviews appreciate the simplicity of the book’s approach and the money and stability the Profit First system can offer a business owner. These reviews also emphasize Profit First as a _way of life_ that reduces stress and makes _all_ finances easy to understand.

Negative online reviews tend to criticize the book for being repetitive or for having a lack of significant ideas. Others say that the methods and techniques the book recommends are unnecessary, adding extra complexity to standard business accounting which works fine as is.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_Profit First_ approaches its main arguments in two steps: First, Michalowicz presents anecdotes, testimonials, and examples of entrepreneurs and authors he knows who have experienced the problem being discussed or who have successfully used methods from the book. He uses these and behavioral psychology to create a narrative of a typical entrepreneur: An owner of a small or medium business who struggles with spending discipline and maintaining growth and profitability. Michalowicz then outlines why his method or guideline works for the typical entrepreneur and gives step-by-step instructions on how to implement it.

While this approach makes the book easy to read and understand, it also means that a reader who doesn’t fit the author’s description of a typical entrepreneur might be more likely to question how necessary his guidelines are, or why they are better than traditional business accounting methods. A reader that doesn’t have serious struggles with debt, spending discipline, or tracking their finances might find the book less relevant to their financial circumstances.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_Profit First_ is divided into three clear parts. Part one (chapters one and two) explains what the Profit First business accounting method is and how it’s better than traditional business accounting. **Most of the book’s main ideas are explained in the first two chapters of the book**. The second part of the book (chapters three through six) explains how a business can set up the Profit First method. Finally, the third part of the book (chapters seven to 11) consists of how to use the Profit First method to address various problems your business might encounter, as well as additional optional tips and tricks that can be used to maintain spending discipline and financial health.

By establishing the book’s main arguments in the first two chapters, Michalowicz creates a solid foundation that allows a reader to connect all future points back to those original main ideas—although his consistent callbacks to those main ideas can make the book repetitive. Unlike parts one and two, the third part of the book has a vaguer focus**,** and as a result the later chapters overlap more often.

### Our Approach in This Guide

**This guide is split into three parts.** The first part defines the Profit First method by contrasting it with traditional accounting methods, as well as by outlining Michalowicz’s main Profit First tenets. While the book goes back and forth comparing the two, we’ve separated traditional and Profit First accounting into two separate chapters for clarity and straightforwardness.

Michalowicz’s instructions for how to set the Profit First method up for your business are in part two of this guide, while in part three we’ve organized many of Michalowicz’s recommendations for managing specific aspects of your business into an overall guide for how to use the Profit First long-term. This structure allows us to clearly define what Michalowicz recommends you do early on and separates this advice from his suggestions on how to improve your business and financial stability over a longer period of time.

Our commentary provides psychological and business research to support or contrast with Michalowicz’s claims of how entrepreneurs think and act. It also provides practical steps for improving your business when Michalowicz offers more general, overarching recommendations. These practical steps come primarily from other books and articles by entrepreneurs and business consultants.
