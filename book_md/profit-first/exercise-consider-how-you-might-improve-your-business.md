## Exercise: Consider How You Might Improve Your Business

Using Michalowicz’s standards for cost cutting and improving efficiency, determine where and how you might be able to improve your business.

* * *

Add up the cost of all of your unnecessary expenses labeled “remove.” How much money will you save by cutting these?

Divide your adjusted revenue by your number of employees. How much revenue do you make per employee? Do you have employees who earn your business more or less revenue than that?

What is the unique problem your business solves for your clients? If there are several, list them all here.

List any products or services your business provides that do not help you solve this unique problem for your clients. Can you scale back or cut these? Explain your answer.
