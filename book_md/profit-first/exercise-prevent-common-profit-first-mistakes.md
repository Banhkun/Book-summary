## Exercise: Prevent Common Profit First Mistakes

Plan ahead to avoid making the common Profit First mistakes Michalowicz lists.

* * *

Return to your “keep, improve, remove” marked list of expenses, or just reflect on your current expenses if you haven’t yet made a list. Which expenses would lead to a reduction in the quality of your product or service if you were to spend less on them or cut them altogether? Label these expenses as “need.”

When was the last time you had your tax estimate calculated? How can you or your accountant ensure that finding this estimate becomes a consistent habit?

Find your lowest and highest income month from the last year. What’s the difference between the two? How would you manage your business differently during your lowest income month versus your highest income month?
