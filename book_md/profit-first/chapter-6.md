## Chapter 6: Your First Year Using the Profit First Method

Once you’ve found your ideal percentages, Michalowicz says you shouldn’t try to match them too quickly—if you allocate too much money away from expenses right away, you’ll often end up without enough money to keep your business running.

This chapter will explain his methods for setting up a pattern of sustainably moving towards your ideal percentages by **gradually changing how you spend your money.** Michalowicz provides several techniques and financial habits which will help you accomplish this.

### Changing Three Percent at a Time

First, Michalowicz suggests that when you change your current percentages to meet your ideal percentages, you **start by only changing three percent.** Subtract three percent from a percentage currently higher than its ideal, and add it to a percentage currently below its ideal.

  * For example: An entrepreneur’s current expense percentage is 50 percent, but their ideal expense percentage is 40 percent. Their current profit percentage is one percent, but their ideal profit percentage is 10 percent. When starting the Profit First method, this entrepreneur reallocates three percent from expenses to profit, so that their expense percentage is 47 percent and their profit percentage is four percent.



Make this three percent shift in your allocations right as you’re setting up the Profit First method. After that, set out to make another shift towards your ideal allocation percentages _every quarter.****_ Reallocate more if you think you can, and less if you’re in particularly dire financial straits. What’s most important is that you continue to get closer to your ideal percentages over time.

(Shortform note: While you might want to reallocate a large percentage of your income right away, you shouldn’t immediately do so—Michalowicz claims that by only changing three percent at a time, you’ll be more likely to stick with your new percentages. Clear agrees and further explains why this is the case in _Atomic Habits_. He asserts that people have an easier time sticking with easier behaviors, and so smaller changes are better when forming new habits.)

### Creating Income Allocation Habits

Now that you have a sense of what percentage of your income you’ll be allocating to each of your new bank accounts, Michalowicz outlines several routines and habits for allocating your income easily and consistently. Following these habits means you’ll never be caught off guard by how much money you do or do not have, and can clearly see where your money is going when. Michalowicz recommends you follow three habits when conducting your business’s accounting throughout the year.

(Shortform note: The following habits allow you to _automate_ your accounting, which David Bach says is crucial for financial stability in _The Automatic Millionaire._ Bach explains that if you automatically divide your income when you receive it, then you won’t even consider the money you put into your savings spendable and won’t have to make the (often agonizing) decision of whether you should spend or save it.)

#### Habit #1: Allocate Income and Pay Bills Bimonthly

Create this habit by allocating your income to your other accounts and paying your bills twice a month on two specific days—one in the middle of the month, and one at the end. Paying bills twice a month helps you keep track of when in the month you’re spending more or less of your money. It also means your expense account balance will more consistently reflect your available money.

If you can’t pay your bills regularly in this way, it’s an indicator of serious financial trouble**** and you’ll need to cut your expenses (more on this later).****

(Shortform note: If you have less money than you thought you would when paying your bills consistently, that could be a sign that your business is experiencing cash flow issues. Often, businesses have cash “trapped” in inventory or in accounts receivable. They _earn_ the revenue required for their business to work, but they have trouble actually _receiving_ this revenue as cash on hand. By maintaining the habit of allocating income and paying bills bimonthly, however, you’ll avoid being surprised by this issue again.)

#### Habit #2: Take Profits Quarterly

The second habit MIchalowicz recommends is taking half of the money in your profit savings account for yourself at the start of each quarter.**** Leave the other half in the account. If your business has multiple owners, then divide half the money in the profit account as appropriate amongst them. **Keep the money you take out of your profit account for yourself—don’t reinvest it into your business.**(Shortform note: If you don’t want or don’t need all this profit for yourself, don’t automatically plan on reinvesting it into your business. Instead, consider giving some of the profit distributions to your employees by setting up a profit-sharing plan as part of their retirement fund. An estimated 19 to 23 percent of U.S. businesses do so.)

This habit helps keep you financially stable in two ways: First, by only taking profit once every quarter, you won’t be accessing the profit account frequently and therefore will be less tempted to misuse the money in it. Second, since you’re only taking half of the money in your profit account,**** you’ll have cash on hand at all times to run your business in case of an emergency. Even if your income sharply drops, this money ensures that your business can still survive for a time, so you won’t panic.

(Shortform note: You might be concerned that by making a habit of withdrawing money from your profit account, you’ll be more tempted to take money from it when you shouldn’t. However, Gretchen Rubin (_The Happiness Project_) claims that planned exceptions to your personal “rules” won’t weaken your good habits. Rubin explains that an exception planned ahead of time, like the habit of withdrawing profit quarterly, has a clear starting and stopping point which helps you clearly define when the behavior is allowed and when it isn’t.)

Here’s around how much time a given profit allocation percentage will buy you annually, should your income suddenly drop to nothing:

  * 5 percent pays for three weeks’ expenses. 
  * 12 percent pays for two months’ expenses. 
  * 24 percent pays for five months’ expenses. 



Note that by doubling your profit percentage, you’ll buy more than double the amount of time. Michalowicz explains that this is because the reallocation not only builds a bigger emergency fund, but also lowers your expenses. (Shortform note: You might be confused by Michalowicz’s advice to put half of your profits into an emergency fund, since many financial experts would call such an emergency fund a reinvestment of your profits—something Michalowicz strongly advises against throughout the book. You can avoid this confusion by interpreting Michalowicz’s definition of “reinvestment” as “putting profits into growth or expenses.”)

#### Habit #3: Paying Your Taxes Yearly

When you use the above habits, the only additional accounting step to manage at year’s end is taxes. Pay your taxes using money you’ve allocated into the tax savings account. If there isn’t enough money in the account to cover your taxes, chances are you either weren’t diligent enough in estimating your tax liability throughout the year, or your tax percentage wasn’t high enough. If you don’t have enough to pay your taxes, Michalowicz says you can take money from your profit account to cover the difference. He emphasizes that you shouldn’t make a habit of this, though, and should prevent the same mistake from happening again by adjusting your tax percentage.

(Shortform note: If you’re still unable to pay your taxes even with the money in your profit account, don’t panic—the IRS is willing to work with people unable to pay their taxes, through both long-term and short-term payment plans. Remember, though, that maintaining proper financial discipline is crucial when working with the IRS so you can avoid legal consequences.)
