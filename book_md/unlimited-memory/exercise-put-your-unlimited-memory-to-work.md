## Exercise: Put Your Unlimited Memory to Work

Use Horsley’s tips and memory techniques to commit some new information to memory.

* * *

First, pick something you want to memorize, whether it be a list, a concept, a string of numbers, or anything else. Identify anything that may interfere with your _attention_ in memorizing this. Are you prone to self-deprecating and discouraging talk? Or do you struggle with single-tasking? Consider how these may impact your learning and write down some solutions to avoid distraction and discouragement.

Next, choose one or more of Horsley’s associative techniques to memorize the information. Remember the importance of the SEE technique, and consider 1) how you can relate the information to your senses, 2) how you can make memorable exaggerations of the information, and 3) how you can add energy and motion to the information. Write these down to make them easier to refer back to.

Finally, make a plan to make your memorization practices a habit. Write down the intervals at which you want to review your information. Consider putting digital reminders in your phone and computer to be sure you don’t forget.
