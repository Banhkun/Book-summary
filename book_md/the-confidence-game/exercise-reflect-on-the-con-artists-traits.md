## Exercise: Reflect on the Con Artist’s Traits

According to Konnikova, there are three personality traits (the dark triad of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism) that make people more likely to become a con artist. In addition, there are two environmental factors that encourage con artist behavior: opportunity (such as being in a place where this is normal) and rationale or justification, such as external pressure from an authority figure. In this exercise, we’ll explore your experience with these factors.

Even if the dark triad traits don’t manifest in your personality in an extreme way, what are some aspects of these traits that you observe in yourself or that you’re most likely to exhibit when you’re at your worst? For example, you might tend toward being overly confident, struggle to empathize with others, or seek self-advancement at other people’s expense.

Given Konnikova’s argument that everyone is capable of deception, in what context are you most likely to fulfill the environmental criteria of having the opportunity and rationale to play a con game? What factors are most likely to prevent you from doing so? For example, if you’re most likely to justify a con when you’re under a lot of pressure at work, having a personal relationship with customers or other potential victims might prevent you from deceiving them.

Based on Konnikova’s description of con artists and her assertion that _everyone_ is susceptible to cons, how has your view of con artists and their victims changed?
