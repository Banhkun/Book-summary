## Exercise: Invest in Your Strengths

Conchie and Rath emphasize the importance of investing in your strengths rather than attempting to become well-rounded. Apply this philosophy to maximize your strengths.

* * *

What strengths and weaknesses do you have in your professional life? Do you recognize yourself in any of the four strengths Conchie and Rath discuss (executing, influencing, relationship-building, strategic thinking)? Which ones?

After youâ€™ve determined which strength seems to fit you, consider how you can act to optimize this strength. For example, if you think your strength is executing, how can you incorporate more responsibility into your role at work?

Now think of someone you work with who seems unsatisfied with their role. Do they seem to align with one of the four strengths highlighted in this guide? If so, how can you help them take advantage of this strength at work?
