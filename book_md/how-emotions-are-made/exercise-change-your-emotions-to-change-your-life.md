## Exercise: Change Your Emotions to Change Your Life

Changing your experiences can help your brain construct new emotions, which, in turn, affects how you feel on the inside and how you behave in the world. By changing your emotions, you can change your life.

* * *

Which challenging emotion(s) do you often struggle with in your life? Describe a recent instance in which youâ€™ve experienced this emotion.

Which of the techniques outlined by Barrett for managing your emotions can you implement to address how you deal with this emotion in the future? (Keeping your body budget balanced, increasing your emotional granularity, recategorizing mental suffering as uncomfortable sensations?)

Specifically, are there any practices you think would work particularly well for you (for example, getting more sleep, spending more time in nature, traveling, studying new emotion words, mindfulness meditation)? Explain why you think these practices would be effective.
