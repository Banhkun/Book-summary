## 1-Page Summary

In _The God Delusion_ , University of Oxford biologist and anti-religion activist Richard Dawkins argues that**religion has exerted a harmful influence on human society since its inception and that we ought to abandon it in favor of science.** He illustrates this argument by demonstrating that:

  * God almost certainly does not exist and the arguments for his existence are weak.
  * Religion doesn’t exist because God granted us some divine wisdom—instead, it came about and persists through the mechanisms of evolutionary psychology and cultural transmission.
  * We don’t need religion to behave morally.
  * Religion actually promotes values that are distinctly _immoral._
  * Religion does not provide the emotional comfort and fulfillment its adherents claim.



### The God Hypothesis

The claim that God exists is a hypothesis, just like any other (we’ll call it the “God Hypothesis” in this summary). Since it is logically impossible to prove a negative, one can never be certain that God _isn’t_ real. But that does not mean that we can’t reasonably assess the _likelihood_ of the God Hypothesis.

Because, of course, we do not treat all hypotheses as being equally likely or plausible. The Tooth Fairy is also a hypothesis about how money appears under children’s pillows in the morning after they place a baby tooth under them at night. But because we have more rational and likely explanations for the appearance of the money under the pillow, we can confidently assign a very low probability to the Tooth Fairy Hypothesis.

**The God Hypothesis is a perfectly legitimate one for science to study, evaluate, and, ultimately, reject, if the evidence in support of it is found to be lacking.**

### Arguments That Challenge the God Hypothesis

#### Argument #1: Who Created the Creator?

Most arguments for God’s existence postulate a supreme designer. Proponents of this belief are called creationists. **Creationists believe that the universe we observe is the handiwork of an intelligent designer who consciously and knowingly created everything** , from the movement of galaxies throughout the universe to the orbit of electrons within an atom.

For creationists, an intelligent God is the ultimate and simple explanation for everything. But this is where the “simple” theistic position begins to fall apart. **If all things can be said to have their root cause in an intelligent God, then one must raise the obvious question—what is the root cause of God? Who designed the designer?** You can postulate an infinite regression of the physical universe that terminates with God. But if you cannot explain the existence of God in the first place, the argument collapses.

#### Argument #2: The Unreliability of the Bible

The Bible was written and compiled by several different authors, writing centuries after the events they purported to describe. As such, **it is** **riddled with inconsistencies and is not considered a reliable historical account by scholars.** For example, the Bible is unclear about whether Jesus was born in Bethlehem or Nazareth. That the Bible is unable to even get the facts straight on where the supposed son of God was born argues strongly against relying upon it as a historical source, and as “proof” of God’s existence.

#### Argument #3: Natural Selection and the Improbability of God

**Natural selection offers a far more logical, testable, and likely explanation for why the world is the way it is.** Before Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, intelligent design seemed to offer a much stronger explanation for the complexity we observe in the natural world. It was impossible to imagine that the variety and intricacy of the universe could have come about by any means other than through the conscious will of a supremely intelligent deity.

But Darwin and natural selection solved this great mystery. Natural selection states that certain small genetic mutations in individual living organisms give them a slightly greater chance of survival than their peers. Because those organisms best suited for survival are more likely _to_ survive, they therefore have a greater likelihood of passing on their own genes to their offspring. **Over time, traits that are advantageous for survival get passed on; those that aren’t die out.**

Environmental change over the course of billions of years complements the evolutionary process, as plants and animals evolve through natural selection to become better suited to their environment. From simple, single-celled organisms arise primates like human beings capable of abstract and concrete thought.

### The Origins of Religion

Even though we’ve seen that the factual claims made by theism are highly unlikely to be true, we cannot ignore the fact that religion itself has existed and continues to exist, across all societies and all periods of time.

If we don’t accept the truth of religious claims, we have to account for religion’s existence by means of natural selection, evolutionary psychology, and cultural transmission, instead of divine received wisdom.

**Belief in religion seems to be an extraordinarily _dis_ advantageous trait that ought to have died out very early on in the evolution of humans. **It compels individuals and societies to expend enormous resources on elaborate buildings, ritual sacrifices, and the maintenance of a priestly caste that does little to ensure the practical, day-to-day survival of either the individual or the group. How, then, did religion arise and evolve despite these drawbacks?

#### Religion as a By-Product

The origins of religion begin to make sense if we consider **religion as a by-product of _other_ instincts and cognitive traits that _do_ confer a significant advantage in natural selection.**

Religion might represent a massive misfiring of an instinct that’s usually useful: namely, the **behavior pattern of child obedience to adult authority figures.** With regard to natural selection, children obeying community elders makes perfect sense. In early human societies, children who adhered to adult commands such as, “Don’t go swimming in that river with the fast-moving rapids,” or “Stay out of that section of the woods where bears are known to prowl” would naturally have had a far greater chance of survival than those that didn’t.

But this unquestioning obedience would also make children vulnerable to the authoritative claims of religion. If you are hardwired to blindly adhere to all adult rules and regulations, there is every reason to accept the claims of religious leaders who tell you which gods to pray to and which rituals to perform.

#### Memes and Cultural Transmission

**Culture, like genetic material, can also pass down over time. The basic unit of culture is the meme.** A meme is some element of culture (like architecture, cuisine, or religion) that can be transmitted from generation to generation.

We can treat memes as somewhat analogous to genes. Those memes that are “good” at survival get passed on; those that aren’t don’t survive. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the memes are advantageous to human survival; it simply means that the _memes themselves_ are successful at being copied and passed down with comparatively few “transcription” errors along the way.

Some common religious memes that have survived and successfully replicated include belief in an afterlife, the eternal rewards that await martyrs, and the idea that non-believers must be punished or killed.

### Religion and Morality

Aside from its likely falsehood, religion is also flawed because it’s _not_ the source of human morality. To be sure, religious people certainly _claim_ that Darwinism cannot account for the existence of altruism, kindness, or empathy. But, in fact, **kindness and altruism have perfectly rational Darwinian roots**.

#### Kinship Altruism

The individual human trait of selfishness is _not_ advantageous in natural selection. In fact, **the drive for gene survival provides a powerful incentive for individuals to behave _altruistically_ toward those in their kin group, with whom they share a genetic link. **After all,**** taking care of your children and ensuring that they grow up strong and healthy enough to have children of their own is the best way to ensure the survival of your own genes. It is easy to see why natural selection would favor kin altruism as a replicating behavior through generations.

#### Reciprocity and Mutual Obligation

The reciprocity reflex is also a powerful evolutionary mechanism. **We are hardwired to repay favors, even from strangers. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense because it increases _everyone’s_ chances of survival.** The reciprocity reflex causes the other members of the group to help you if you have helped them, creating networks of mutual obligation and support.

#### Immoral Religion

Because morality can be explained by natural selection, we don’t need religion to account for it.**** In fact, **religion promotes abhorrent values that are totally at odds with modern morality**.

Take the Old Testament, the holy book of Judaism and Christianity (and, to a lesser extent, Islam), in which we are taught to celebrate:

  * A cruel, jealous, and vindictive God who drowns all the men, women, children, and animals in the world (save for Noah) when he feels that they are not sufficiently pious and obedient
  * Lot inviting a group of men, who wish to sodomize the two angels he is harboring in his home, to _instead_ gang-rape his daughters (with whom Lot later commits incest) 
  * Abraham’s unflinching willingness to slaughter his son Isaac in cold blood simply because God commanded him to do so (God eventually saves Isaac after being convinced of Abraham’s loyalty)
  * Joshua’s destruction of the city of Jericho and the genocidal slaughter and enslavement of its citizens



#### Biblical vs. Modern Morality

Almost no one today, even the most pious believer in the Bible, thinks that collective punishment, gang-rape, incest, child murder, slavery, or genocide are practices worth emulating. Most religious people concede that we shouldn’t take everything in religious texts literally.

**But if even the self-proclaimed faithful are going to pick and choose which parts of the Bible they like and which parts they don’t like, they are implicitly acknowledging that the Bible _isn’t_ a universal standard for morality; obviously, they’re using some other, non-biblical standard.**

They, like non-religious people, are using the common standards of modern morality that are in place in most advanced 21st-century societies. Whether we consciously acknowledge these values or not, the overwhelming majority of people in modern societies accept notions such as representative democracy, freedom of speech, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, religious toleration, and equal rights for women and minorities. But these values exist in spite of religion, not because of it.

#### The Fostering of Religious Hatred

**Religion is one of the great sources of in-group loyalty, but also hatred and fear of the other.** Because religion teaches people that they have access to a divine truth, it inevitably breeds intolerance toward those who don’t share the same beliefs. After all, those who don’t share your faith—the “other”—are enemies of God and his holy word.

The Israeli psychologist George Tamarin found that 66 percent of Israeli schoolchildren, most of whom were raised with the stories of the Old Testament, expressed support for Joshua’s aforementioned war crimes against the citizens of Jericho—war crimes that included wholesale slaughter and the selling of children into sexual slavery. They did so on the grounds that the people of Jericho were of a different religion than Joshua’s Israelites and that the slaughter was necessary to prevent God’s chosen people from assimilating with non-believers.

Because it teaches people to suspend their faculties of critical thinking and see themselves as having a direct connection to the will of the almighty, **faith can encourage normal people to commit heinous and otherwise indefensible acts against _others_ , all in the name of God— **for example, an anti-abortion fanatic murdering a doctor in the name of rescuing innocent “babies” or the 9/11 hijackers killing nearly 3,000 people because they believed that they would be divinely rewarded in the afterlife.**** Religion teaches the perpetrators of such acts that their crimes are justified, even _moral_.

Because religion by definition is incapable of providing evidence for its claims, **society must end the practice of granting automatic respect or deference to religion.** Justifying some hateful action or belief on the grounds of “I believe it” or “It’s my faith” should be accorded no more respect than someone’s political opinions or their support for a particular sports team.

### The Role of Religion

What function is religion supposed to perform? Which needs does it purportedly fulfill? Proponents of religion claim that, at its best, religion provides human beings with:

  * An explanation of the natural universe, its origins, and our role within it
  * An exhortation to moral action
  * Consolation in our moments of deepest loss and grief



As we’ve already discussed, the first two claims are patently false. Now, we're going to explore why the final one is likewise invalid.

#### False Comfort

**The claim that religion provides consolation or makes people happier or more secure is dubious at best.** Social science research offers no conclusive evidence that atheists are any less happy or fulfilled than people of faith.

We know this anecdotally too. Religious Christians, for example, claim to believe in an afterlife, in which they will be rewarded with joy and bliss for eternity as they are reunited with their deceased loved ones. If they truly believed this, then they wouldn’t fear their own deaths or mourn the passing of friends and family. Instead, they would be _excited_ about death and their coming ascension into paradise. But of course, this is _not_ how religious people behave or think in practice. They despair of their own deaths and grieve the loss of others just as much as anyone. This would seem to indicate that even the devout don’t truly believe in life after death: that they know intuitively that once they die, they are truly gone forever.

Atheists, for their part, can have a more healthy and affirming attitude toward both life and death because they don’t have to reconcile the rational part of their minds with a belief in God or an afterlife. Atheists are free to accept the idea that there was a period of time stretching from the beginning of the universe to the moment of their birth when they did not exist—and that death merely represents the _resumption_ of that state of non-existence.

Not believing in an immortal soul or an afterlife opens your eyes to the truth that **your existence is the very briefest flicker of a candle in the vast history of the universe**. Your _non_ -existence is the natural and normal state of affairs. You just happen to be living through a fleeting exception. Knowing that, **life can be as joyous or as sad as you choose to make it.**

### The Case for Science

Our brains and sensory organs evolved in such a way as to limit what we can grasp intuitively. But there’s so much more out there in the universe. To take one example, our visual world only represents a tiny sliver of the light spectrum. Beyond the tiny band of visible light, the universe is awash in electromagnetic waves, from X-rays to radio waves to gamma rays. We would never know they were there if we relied solely on our senses.

**But there is an extraordinary tool that enables us to truly grapple with the mysteries and complexities of the universe—science.** Science enables us to understand the phenomena around us in all their wonder and beauty, from the mind-bending behavior of subatomic particles in quantum theory to the infinite density of black holes to the nature of matter and existence itself. Far from being drab and uninspiring, science uplifts us and expands our intellectual horizons in ways that religion never could.

Ultimately, **religion limits the possibilities of human thought and action.** You’ll always be constrained by a God who knows more than you and can control every aspect of your life and beyond into eternity. Nothing exists that he doesn’t allow; nothing can be conceived of that he hasn’t already designed. Meanwhile, science removes these limitations from the human mind, and opens us up to a universe without constraints. Quantum mechanics, evolutionary biology, and particle physics provide insights that are far more enriching to the human spirit than simple stories about a creator deity and his rather unsavory band of prophets.

**It’s time to free ourselves from the primitive shackles of religion and embrace our true potential as humans.**
