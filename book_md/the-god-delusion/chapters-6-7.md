## Chapters 6-7: God and Morality

So far, we’ve talked mostly about why the claims put forward by religion are unlikely to be true, and why religion’s existence and persistence can be explained through rational processes of evolutionary psychology and cultural transmission. But even if the claims made by religion are unsubstantiated and its origins have nothing to do with the revelation of divine truth, doesn’t it still serve a valuable purpose as the foundation for morality? Would we be capable of kindness and empathy without God?

In this chapter, we’ll make the case that **morality and religion are wholly separate** , exploring:

  * How altruism and kindness are fully compatible with Darwinian natural selection
  * How there is no documented difference in moral intuition between atheists and people of faith
  * How adherence to moral standards solely out of fear of divine punishment is a poor basis for morality
  * How religious texts like the Bible promote abhorrent values that are totally at odds with modern morality



### Darwinian Morality

Religious people claim that Darwinism cannot account for the existence of altruism, kindness, or empathy. They argue that the theory of natural selection threatens to undermine the very foundations of human morality. Darwinism, they claim, is purely about the survival of the fittest, and an organism concerned solely with its own survival cannot care about the health and wellbeing of others.__ They see the fact that humans _do_ feel empathy and compassion as a glaring contradiction that Darwinism can’t explain.

But this view is based on a misunderstanding and gross caricature of Darwinist principles. Darwinism does not postulate a selfish “kill or be killed, eat or be eaten” view of human history. In fact, **kindness and altruism have perfectly rational Darwinian roots**.

#### The Origins of Altruism

Genes seek to maximize their chances of survival across generations. In that sense, genes are “selfish.” But this does not mean that the human trait of _selfishness_ is itself advantageous in natural selection. In fact, the drive for gene survival provides a powerful incentive for individuals to behave _altruistically_ toward those in their kin group, with whom they share a genetic link.

After all,**taking care of your children and ensuring that they grow up strong and healthy enough to have children of their own is one of the best ways to ensure the survival of your own genes**. It is easy to see then why natural selection would favor kin altruism as a replicating behavior through generations. And sure enough, kin altruism—caring for those with whom one shares a genetic link—is widely seen not just in humans, but throughout the animal kingdom.

#### Reciprocity and Mutual Obligation

But even if natural selection can adequately explain kin altruism, creationists ask, what accounts for the kindness and empathy we display toward people we’re _not_ related to? Surely _this_ must be the product of some divine spark within ourselves?

Natural selection, once again, can account for our natural feelings of empathy. Here, the primary evolutionary mechanism is the reciprocity reflex. This tells us to repay others when they do something for us.**** We do this all the time without even realizing it. When a friend treats you to lunch, you make sure you pick up the check the next time you go out; when your neighbors invite you to a party, you invite them the next time you’re hosting an event.

**We are hardwired to repay favors, even from strangers. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense because it increases _everyone’s_ chances of survival.** The reciprocity reflex causes the other members of the group to help you if you have helped them, creating networks of mutual obligation.

We are so programmed for altruism that we extend it even to people who are unlikely to ever “repay” us for our kind actions. It’s why we are moved by images of war orphans, stateless refugees, or even homeless people we encounter on the street. Their survival has nothing to do with us, can secure us no advantage, and yet the sight of their suffering triggers intense feelings within us.

**Reciprocity is key to the social glue that holds societies together. Especially in early human societies, which would have been small, tight-knit bands of mostly kin, it would be advantageous to cultivate a reputation as being trustworthy and reciprocal.** Likewise, it would have been disadvantageous to cultivate a reputation as a selfish free rider—because no one would be willing to help you in your time of need.

(Shortform note: Want to learn more about the reciprocity reflex? Read our summary of Robert Cialdini’s Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.)

This dynamic would have been enhanced by a key distinguishing feature of human societies—language.**** In particular, gossip, the sharing of social information about others, would have allowed someone’s reputation as either a generous member of the community or an unscrupulous free rider to spread quickly.

This sharing of social information was likely an important element in contributing to group survival for early humans, enabling scarce resources to be shared more efficiently and potential threats to be identified more easily.

Further, it reinforced positive social norms by making our ancestors aware of the misdeeds of people _outside_ the immediate kin group whom they may not have personally known—bolstering both altruism and the reciprocity reflex by ensuring that selfish people didn’t receive cooperation, while altruistic people did.

(Shortform note: To learn more about the role of gossip in fostering early human language, read our summary of Jonathan Haidt’s The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom.)

#### Darwinism and Modern Morality

As we mentioned, **early kin-based human communities would have strongly favored genetic tendencies toward altruism on the basis of both kin survival and reciprocity.** We are thus bred to be altruistic and moral.

It’s important to note that this does not make the love and compassion we feel toward our fellow human beings any less real or genuine. It simply provides a coherent explanation for why we think and behave as we do. **Understanding Darwinism intellectually does not make anyone love their family and friends less, despite what creationists might claim.**

Indeed, our modern displays of love and affection might simply be misfirings of our normal evolutionary impulses, just as we saw with religion itself in the previous chapter. For example, the desire for sex comes from a clear Darwinian impulse—to create offspring to pass along your genes. But we still experience lust and desire when there is no chance of procreation—as in same-sex relationships or when a heterosexual couple is using birth control. Sexual desire still exists independently of the original evolutionary impulses that explain it.

### Morality Without Religion

Clearly then, **we don’t need God to explain our morality.** In fact, the American philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris has noted that many of the behaviors we would traditionally associate with immorality, such as violent crime, are _more_ prevalent in religious communities than secular ones.

For example, of the 25 most dangerous cities in America (by violent crime), 76 percent are in “red” states, with large numbers of conservative Christian residents. Similarly, we see far higher rates of abortion and teen pregnancy in the “Bible Belt” region of the Southern United States than we do in the rest of the country.

Furthermore, evolutionary biologist Marc Hauser’s research shows that when atheists and religious people are presented with a series of hypothetical moral dilemmas, there is zero measurable difference between the moral intuition of the two groups.

Moreover, there is something problematic about the claim, often advanced by religious people, that they behave in moral and upstanding ways only because God compels them to. This is not morality; it’s just fear of punishment and ingratiation to a powerful higher being. **By claiming religion as the sole basis for their moral behavior, people of faith are in effect saying that they _would_ kill, rape, and steal if they didn’t live in fear of God’s punishment.**

#### The Categorical Imperative

One final moral claim advanced by the religious community is that religion provides absolute moral standards. Religion, they argue, is the only force capable of telling human beings what is good and what is evil in all cases.

Without the absolute and universal moral clarity of religion, they claim, each individual would be free to decide for themselves what is and is not moral. _Anything_ could be justified under such a flimsy moral framework. But is this really true? But does religion truly have a monopoly on absolute moral standards?

The 18th-century German moral philosopher Immanuel Kant would have likely disagreed. He put forward a theory of morality that could operate without God. **Kant’s categorical imperative argues that _individual_ moral principles should be judged on the basis of whether or not they would make sense as _universal_ principles. **

For example, if you cheat on a test because it’s inconvenient and burdensome for you to get good results by studying, would you then be in favor of a universal law that justifies cheating in _all_ situations where working hard is inconvenient? Is a world in which people did this as a matter of routine a world in which you’d like to live? If your answer is no, then you must judge your own conduct as immoral under the categorical imperative.

Kant’s categorical imperative provides a moral standard that exists entirely outside of religion—it does not require the existence of God, nor the acceptance of a holy text. It demonstrates that morality can exist wholly without reference to religion.

### The Immorality of the Bible

Far from providing the basis for our morality, religion actually does the very opposite. In reality, **religious texts promote abhorrent values that are totally at odds with modern morality.**

Take the Old Testament—considered a holy text in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—that celebrates:

  * A cruel, jealous, and vindictive God who drowns all the men, women, children, and animals in the world (save for Noah) when he feels that they are not sufficiently pious and obedient
  * Lot inviting a group of men, who wish to sodomize the two angels he is harboring in his home, to _instead_ gang-rape his daughters (with whom Lot later commits incest) 
  * Abraham’s unflinching willingness to slaughter his son Isaac in cold blood simply because God commanded him to do so (God eventually saves Isaac after being convinced of Abraham’s loyalty)
  * The warrior Jephthah sacrificing his daughter in an act of ritual murder in order to give thanks to God after the latter grants him a military victory
  * Joshua’s destruction of the city of Jericho and the genocidal slaughter and enslavement of its citizens



Although the figure of Jesus Christ in the New Testament is far more gentle and benevolent than the domineering bully God of the Old Testament, the later text still has its share of barbarism. The gruesome story of Jesus’s crucifixion and martyrdom on behalf of our collective sins is incredibly psychologically damaging to the billions of people around the world who have been forced to learn it. It instills in the believer a lifetime of guilt and self-hatred, knowing that the only Son of God died on the cross because of _your_ wickedness and sinfulness (even if the crucifixion happened nearly two millennia before you were born).

#### Changing Times, Changing Values

Almost no one today, even the most pious believer in the Bible, thinks that collective punishment, gang-rape, incest, child murder, slavery, or genocide are practices worth emulating. Most religious people concede that we shouldn’t take everything in it literally.

**But if even the self-proclaimed faithful are going to pick and choose which parts of the Bible they like and which parts they don’t like, they are implicitly acknowledging that the Bible _isn’t_ a universal standard for morality; obviously, they’re using some other, non-biblical standard.**

What standard are they using? They, like non-religious people, are using the common standards of modern morality that are in place in most advanced 21st-century societies. Whether we consciously acknowledge these values or not, the overwhelming majority of people in modern societies accept ideas like representative democracy, freedom of speech, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, religious toleration, and equal rights for women and minorities. But these values exist in spite of religion, not because of it.

So how do moral values change over time? It often begins with forward-thinking leaders like Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. or Mahatma Gandhi, who use the power of their moral vision and clarity to open people’s minds to new ideas and new ways of thinking. Their ideas spread through word of mouth, amplified by modern communications technology like the telegraph, telephone, and, today, the internet. Beyond the advocacy of moral leaders, advances in science, technology, and broader access to education help us achieve a more inclusive definition of humanity.

It’s why we no longer believe that people of different faiths should be stoned to death or why people of different races are biologically inferior and must be sterilized. **The process of learning and discovery teaches us that what unites us as humans is much stronger than what divides us.**
