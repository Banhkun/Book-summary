## Chapters 8-9: The Dangers of Faith

In the last chapter, we talked about how most of modern society has moved away from the moral values extolled in holy texts like the Bible and the Quran. Whether they acknowledge it or not, most people have accepted modern, secular liberal values.

But **there are still many people all around the world who explicitly _do_ ground their morals in religion**—and often a narrow, literalist interpretation of their religion at that—with brutal consequences. In this chapter, we’ll explore how faith poisons rational minds and endangers society, looking at:

  * How faith (belief without evidence) forecloses the possibility of critical thinking and can be used to justify even the most horrific acts
  * The atrocities perpetrated in the name of faith
  * Why raising children to accept faith and assigning them a religious label constitutes a form of abuse
  * Why society should stop granting automatic respect or deference to religion



### Evidence vs. Belief

**The essence of faith is belief without evidence**. Even if incontrovertible evidence that the Bible was a fraud or that God did not exist was presented to them, a person of faith would be unmoved. This blind faith is tragic, as it forestalls any possibility of truly engaging with the world and exercising your powers of critical thinking.

And even though the overwhelming majority of people of faith are nonviolent and would never think of forcefully imposing their beliefs on others, their faith _itself_ is a source of great malevolence. Once you’ve accepted the idea that you don’t need proof to back up your beliefs and that faith can act as your guide, you can justify nearly _anything_ in the name of that faith. By encouraging faith, _all_ forms of religion provide fertile breeding grounds for dangerous extremism.

### The Fostering of Religious Hatred and Violence

**Because religion teaches people that they have access to a divine truth that can never be questioned, it inevitably breeds intolerance toward those who don’t share the same beliefs**. After all, those who don’t share your faith are enemies of God and his holy word.

Religion is one of the great sources of in-group loyalty, but also hatred and fear of the other. The Israeli psychologist George Tamarin found that 66 percent of Israeli schoolchildren, most of whom were raised with the stories of the Old Testament, expressed support for Joshua’s slaughter and enslavement of the people of Jericho.

The children who defended these actions did so overwhelmingly on religious grounds, claiming that it was justified because the victims were heathens and unbelievers. Interestingly, when Tamarin presented the facts of the case but changed the context so that it was a _Chinese_ general committing war atrocities, the numbers reversed; only 7 percent approved of the action.

The intolerance bred by religion can escalate into violence, which, according to some theists, is justified—even _moral_. Whether it’s an anti-abortion fanatic murdering a doctor in the name of rescuing innocent “babies” or the 9/11 hijackers killing nearly 3,000 people because they believed that they would be divinely rewarded in the afterlife, **religion has a unique power to justify that which would otherwise be indefensible.**

It’s important to note that those who commit acts of religiously inspired violence are not “evil” or “psychopaths” (however malevolent their deeds might be). To write them off this way is to absolve religion of any responsibility for the poisoning effect it has on the human mind.

A quick exploration of just a few of the injustices perpetrated by religious extremists shows how dangerous faith can be.

#### Example # 1: The Murder of Dr. John Britton

In 1994, the anti-abortion extremist Reverend Paul Hill shot abortion doctor John Britton and his bodyguard to death in Florida, outside Britton’s clinic.

Hill bragged about his crime to authorities, claiming that his act of cold-blooded murder was divinely justified because it was done to protect the lives of the innocent unborn. Leaving aside the question of whether an embryo, which is incapable of feeling pain and has nothing remotely like consciousness, is “human” or not, it is beyond doubt that the two murdered men _were_ human beings. Hill’s supposed scruples regarding the sanctity of life evidently did not apply to his victims.

Even as he was led to the execution chamber after being sentenced to death, Hill remained gleefully unrepentant for his crime and delighted in the possibility of becoming a martyr for the “pro-life” cause.

#### Example # 2: Homophobia and the “American Taliban”

Religious extremists, whether they are the fundamentalist Christians of the West (particularly in the United States) or the jihadists of the Muslim world, are well-known for their hatred of behavior that they deem aberrant or contrary to their interpretation of the holy word. American Dominionists and Reconstructionists actually favor establishing a theocracy in the United States, in which the barbaric practices and beliefs of the Old Testament would be enforced by the state.

These extremists reserve particular hatred and intolerance for homosexuality. Of course, homosexuality is no crime at all (although it was still technically considered to be one even in a supposedly enlightened country like Great Britain until 1967). The private sexual behavior of consenting adults ought to be of no concern to anyone but the individuals themselves.

In the United States, the so-called “American Taliban” (so named because of their theocratic similarities with the actual Taliban in Afghanistan) foments vicious hatred against the LGBT community. Prominent figures in the American fundamentalist Christian community like former presidential candidate Pat Robertson and the Reverend Jerry Falwell claim that homosexuality is an abomination against God and that HIV/AIDS was sent as divine punishment to rid the world of LGBT people. Robertson even went so far as to attribute 2005’s Hurricane Katrina and its destruction of New Orleans to LGBT comedian (and New Orleans native) Ellen DeGeneres hosting the Emmys.

#### Example #3: **The Danish Cartoon Controversy**

In 2006, a Danish newspaper published some cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed—an act that is prohibited in Islam. Two Muslim clerics in Egypt publicized the cartoons, claiming that they were indicative of a deep hatred for Islam, both in Denmark and the West as a whole. Their actions set off widespread rioting and mayhem across much of the Muslim world, from Pakistan to Libya. In the course of the rioting, Christians were murdered with machetes in Nigeria, and nine people were killed when the Italian embassy was stormed in Libya.

The senseless violence was bad enough, but what may have been even worse was the reaction by the supposedly liberal press in the Western world. Many in the elite media refused to reprint the “offending” cartoons, out of fear of provoking the mob. **Journalists sacrificed the principle of freedom of the press on the altar of appeasing violent religious mania**.

Further, many editorials appeared in British and American papers arguing that the original Danish cartoons were deeply insensitive to Muslim people around the world—and that while the violence was regrettable, the outrage was certainly understandable. This reaction among elite commentators in the secular West is a textbook example of how **respect for religion is placed above all other concerns, even free speech and public safety.**

#### What About Violence Perpetrated by Atheists?

Religious people might counter with the argument that Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin were atheists and they committed the greatest humanitarian crimes in history. While Stalin most likely was an atheist, Hitler almost certainly wasn’t. Hitler openly declared himself to be a Catholic in multiple speeches, invoked the supposed killing of Christ by the Jews as a rationale for his murderous antisemitism. He also expressed a belief in divine Providence throughout his life. Indeed, Hitler’s more modern, racialized antisemitism drew upon a long history in Christian Europe of reviling the Jews for being “Christ-killers.”

But even if both men could be proven decisively to have been atheists, it wouldn’t matter. Their crimes were not motivated by _atheism_. Stalin’s murderous career was driven by his interpretation of Marxist-Leninist ideology; Hitler’s by racist eugenics, combined with extreme nationalism and militarism. If anything, both dictators built quasi-religious cults of personality that elevated each of them to the status of near-gods in their respective countries.

The lesson is clear—**while individual atheists may indeed commit horrific crimes, it is not their atheism itself that compels them. What _is_ needed for otherwise normal people to commit evil is religion.**

### Children and Religion

Another of religion’s dangers is the negative effect it has on children.**Raising children in a tradition of faith constitutes an act of abuse in and of itself.** Some of the most tragic victims of faith are the young children who are taught from the moment of birth by their parents, clergy, and community to unquestioningly accept a belief in God**.** This forced suspension of critical thinking stunts a child’s intellectual capacity and usually sets her up for a lifetime of guilt, shame, and fear.

To take the example of Catholicism, young children are taught that if they eat meat on Friday, masturbate, or curse their parents, God will sentence them to an eternity of damnation in Hell.

Two thousand years of Christian tradition have portrayed Hell as an unimaginably horrifying place, where you are continually burned alive, forced to eat molten sulfur, and personally tortured by the Devil himself.

American evangelical pastors like Ted Haggard and Keenan Roberts even take children on tours of so-called “Hell Houses,” in which they are shown live, simulated scenes of torture designed to mimic the horrors that await them in Hell if they engage in sins such as homosexuality or blasphemy.

That Hell (like everything else religion claims) is almost certainly fictitious can be of little comfort to the psychologically vulnerable and suggestible children who are taught to believe that they might one day be forced to spend eternity there. Being forced to believe in something so ghastly at such a young age leaves permanent, crippling psychological scars—even for those adults who’ve left behind the faith of their childhood.

#### Female Genital Mutilation

**When the religious community isn’t inflicting psychological trauma on children, they’re inflicting _physical_ harm.**

Female genital mutilation, practiced within certain Muslim communities (although it is by no means exclusive to Islam), entails the forcible removal of the clitoral glans and/or clitoral hood from adolescent girls. It is extremely painful and can lead to lifelong health complications for the victims—when the procedure doesn’t kill them outright.

Female genital mutilation is designed to keep women “pure” and prevent them from being able to experience any pleasure during sexual intercourse. The practice is a direct product of religious ideas regarding the role and position of women in society.

#### Children Can’t Have a Religion

**We must stop indoctrinating children in the idea that faith is a virtue.** Teaching children to unquestioningly obey authority and accept received wisdom without evidence hobbles their ability to think critically and robs them of the joys of intellectual discovery.

Children can’t choose their religion any more than they can choose their political affiliation, because they do not have a full grasp of the facts. It makes as much sense to say “She’s a Catholic child” or “She’s a Jewish child” as it does to say, “She’s a communist child” or “She’s a fascist child.”

Instead, we ought to say, “She’s a child of Christian parents,” making it clear that **the choice of religion is something that only a competent adult, fully aware of the facts, can make.** Filling children’s minds with superstition and fear of divine punishment, all while giving them no say in the matter, is a form of child abuse, little different than punching or kicking them.

### Stop Respecting Religion

**A final reason why religion is dangerous is that** **society grants it a level of respect and deference that it doesn’t grant to any other system of belief.** To criticize any aspect of a religion’s liturgy, dogma, or practices is looked upon as prejudicial, bigoted, and mean-spirited.

Even those who profess to be atheists will unflinchingly chastise others for critiquing religion, claiming that doing so is hurtful and needlessly antagonistic toward people of faith. This unquestioned respect that one must pay towards religion is never applied to other fields, like politics.

**There is no reason why we shouldn't be able to mock or critique religion just as we would a political ideology like communism or a discredited scientific theory like geocentrism** (the belief that the sun and stars revolve around the Earth).

**Society must end the practice of granting automatic respect or deference to religion.** We would never defend something as barbarous and dehumanizing as female genital mutilation if it was being done in the name of some _secular_ ideology like communism or democratic socialism. However, **when cruelty wraps itself in the cloak of religion, secular society chooses to turn a blind eye.**

#### The Unfair Advantages of Belief

**Religion’s privileged status provides real-world, material benefits for people of faith that are routinely denied to others.** For example, it was nearly impossible to avoid military service if one was drafted into the Vietnam War. Even if you were a conscientious objector, with a deeply held moral objection to the war, you would likely face criminal punishment if you failed to report after you’d been drafted.

But this was not so for religious objectors. If you could claim, for example, that your Quaker faith prohibited you from participation in armed conflict, the draft board was almost certain to allow you to avoid service. There is no moral difference between the two objectors, except that one is couched in religion and the other isn’t.
