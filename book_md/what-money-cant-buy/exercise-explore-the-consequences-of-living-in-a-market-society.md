## Exercise: Explore the Consequences of Living in a Market Society

Sandel argues that our market society exacerbates the divide between rich and poor people. Reflect on what that divide looks like and what, if anything, we can do about it.

* * *

Do you agree that we live in a stratified, polarized society with a large gap between the rich and poor, as Sandel describes? Explain why or why not.

Do you think that we should encourage rich and poor people to intermingle more? If so, what two measures could we take within the next decade to make that happen? If not, what do you see as the benefits of keeping people with differing levels of income separate?
