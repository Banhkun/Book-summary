## Exercise: Prepare for an Upcoming Presentation

Now that you’ve learned the process of brainstorming, writing, and delivering a speech, think about how you can apply the techniques we discussed in the guide to a future presentation.

* * *

Think of a speech or presentation you have to give. If you have the freedom to choose the topic, what are some topics you’re passionate about? If you have to follow a given topic, what are some aspects of that topic that you find interesting or exciting?

Consider the various techniques for making your speech engaging (telling stories, using visuals, engaging multiple senses, and using humor). Write down one or two that resonate the most with you and your topic. How might you use these techniques in your speech?

Describe how nervous you feel about public speaking. What is one strategy you can focus on to manage your stress and anxiety for your next presentation?

How might you keep your audience engaged? Describe one or two strategies—for instance, how you plan to interact with them or create a shocking moment.
