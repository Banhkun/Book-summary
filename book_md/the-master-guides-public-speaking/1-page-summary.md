## 1-Page Summary

Does the thought of speaking in front of an audience make you anxious? You’re not alone: Many people say they fear public speaking even more than death. But public speaking is also one of the most important and widely applicable skills in life, and the good news is, _anyone_ can master it. By learning proven skills and techniques, you can become an effective communicator and confidently deliver your message to an audience.

In Shortform’s Master Guide to public speaking, we’ve compiled leading experts’ insights on how to prepare and deliver your speech. Whether you want to persuade, inform, entertain, or motivate your audience, this guide will walk you through the process of crafting and delivering a powerful speech that captures your audience’s interest.

We’ll begin by exploring the preparation phase—how to plan, write, and rehearse your speech. Then, we’ll describe tips for delivering your speech to an audience and keeping them engaged.

### How to Prepare Your Speech

First, let’s dive into the preparation work for your speech. In _Public Speaking for Success_ , author and lecturer Dale Carnegie contends that the best speeches are extensively prepared ahead of time. In this section, we’ll look at various experts’ tips on how to:

  * Choose a topic
  * Structure and write an engaging speech
  * Practice to boost your confidence and performance



#### Choose a Topic

Carnegie recommends that when choosing a speech topic, look for one that you’re both passionate and knowledgeable about, as **a powerful speech is one thatblends emotion and reason**. Your emotions will fuel and animate your speech-giving, while your rock-solid information will persuade even the most intelligent and discerning audiences.

##### Be Passionate About Your Topic

In _Talk Like TED_ , communication coach Carmine Gallo explains additional benefits of speaking on a topic you’re passionate about:

  * You’ll be so excited about sharing your passion with the world that you won’t feel nervous about your talk.
  * When you’re passionate about something, you’re likely to speak about the subject energetically. You’ll be much more interesting to watch than a lackluster speaker, meaning people will be much more likely to actually pay attention to you.
  * Studies have shown that feelings are contagious. Therefore, if you exhibit deep passion when speaking about your chosen subject, your audience will emulate that passion and listen intently to what you’re saying.



If you don’t get to choose your presentation topic, however, Gallo recommends you **frame the topic in a way that _does_ excite you and appeal to your passions. **For example, if your passion is bringing added efficiency to your workplace, and you’re asked to give a presentation on dull accounting software that you don’t really care about, focus your presentation on how efficient the software is.

##### Be Knowledgeable About Your Topic

Your audience will only listen to your message if they trust that you’re an expert in the topic. In _The 16 Undeniable Laws of Communication_ , leadership expert and speaker John C. Maxwell advises that you choose a topic you’re already knowledgeable about and then go further to **develop more expertise about the subject.** When you dedicate time and effort to becoming competent in your field, people will perceive you as more credible when you present your ideas.

Maxwell suggests additional tips for choosing a topic that gives you credibility:

**Tip 1: Ensure your message matches your true beliefs.** To be credible in the eyes of others, you must genuinely believe in the message you’re delivering. When you’re confident in your message, you naturally use more powerful language and convey more emotion. Your audience will be more open to listening to you when they believe your words are sincere.

While it’s important for your message to match your true beliefs, persuasion and rhetoric expert Jay Heinrichs says in _Thank You for Arguing_ that it’s more important to match the values of your audience. When your audience believes that you share the same values as they do, they see you as someone _virtuous_ , or trustworthy and aligned with their cause.

**Tip 2: Support your words with your actions**. Maxwell advises you to follow your own advice before giving it to others. For example, if you argue that organization is key to productivity, but you display an obvious lack of organization, your audience won’t be receptive to your message.

Heinrichs adds that audiences almost always trust someone who shows evidence of real-life experience over someone who has book smarts. To make yourself seem more authoritative, you can also demonstrate your know-how by approaching a problem in an off-script way that a rookie would never think of.

#### Write Your Speech

Once you’ve chosen your topic, it’s time to turn it into a speech. We’ve organized experts’ advice on speech-writing into six subtopics, ranging from choosing your message to writing a powerful closing.

##### Create Your Message

In _TED Talks_ , TED curator Chris Anderson suggests you begin writing your speech by **determining your throughline—the lesson you want your audience to take away**. Think of this as the point of your speech. For example, if your topic is your trip to Alaska during which you saw how the Inuits live, your throughline could be, “People who live in small, self-sufficient communities live more creatively than people in big cities.”

Carnegie adds that speeches tend to have one of four common goals:

  * To elucidate and educate
  * To persuade people of a position
  * To inspire people to take action
  * To captivate and entertain



##### Outline Your Ideas

Once you’ve crafted your message, outline your ideas and plan how your speech will unfold. Gallo recommends that when choosing your talking points, you use the Rule of Three: **Include a maximum of three ideas in any one speech.** Research suggests that the brain can’t process more than three ideas at once, so if you add any more than this to your talk, your audience simply won’t remember them.

Gallo also suggests creating a message map—a one-page summary of everything you want to include in your talk—to help you plan so you know going into your speech what you’ll cover. Create one using three steps:

  * **Step 1:** At the top of a sheet of paper, draw an oval. In the oval, write a short “headline” that summarizes the main message of your talk.
  * **Step 2:** Draw three arrows pointing down from your headline. At the end of each arrow, write a sub-point that will support your overall argument.
  * **Step 3:** Below each sub-point, write all of the supporting material you’re going to include when discussing it. Maxwell suggests you support your talking points with data, stories, quotes, illustrations, and so on.



Carnegie offers another practical speech-planning technique: Dictate your speech to explore different ways of arranging the ideas. Speak aloud into a voice recorder as if you’re giving the speech, and you’ll begin to notice better ways of fitting the ideas together. Transcribe your dictations for editing in a word processor, and repeat this process until you’re sure of your structure.

Gallo’s and Carnegie’s techniques are mostly for _you_ to conceptualize what you’ll be speaking about, but Maxwell advises that you also present your outline to your _audience_ so they can see**the skeleton of your speech and thus better follow your talking points.** Experiment with ways to organize your points so that the audience can easily absorb them and see how they’re connected—for example:

  * Number them (such as: “Five Things I Learned”).
  * Arrange them in an acrostic (a word that uses each of its letters to spell out a new word or sentence—like: “How to **PLAN** : **P** ick a goal, **L** ay out your strategy, **A** djust your priorities, and **N** otify your employees”).
  * Use a common word in each of your major points (for example: “Find Your Purpose, Know Your Purpose, Use Your Purpose”).



##### Create a Strong Opening

Once you have an outline, write an opening for your speech that will hook your audience. Anderson explains that **you only have about60 seconds to keep your audience’s attention once you begin your speech**. He suggests you say something dramatic within the first minute, show a fascinating image (this can be beautiful, confusing, or funny), or pique their curiosity with a question or counterintuitive statement.

Likewise, Carnegie recommends you keep your opening succinct by refining it to a sharp, powerful sentence or two. He adds that there are several weak ways of opening a speech that you should avoid:

  * **Don’t open with an apology.** Often used to seem humble, this technique makes speakers look incompetent or unprepared and can annoy audiences.
  * **Don’t open with humor.** Most speakers can't pull off jokes, so you'll most likely make the audience cringe and pull away emotionally.
  * **Don’t open too formally.** Scripted, overly rehearsed, and/or dry openings easily lose the audience's attention.



##### Express Your Ideas Simply

Many experts suggest you **express your ideas simply when writing your speech,** which, as Maxwell explains, allows your audience to better understand and remember them.

In one of his other books, _The Bezos Blueprint_ , Gallo offers tips you can use to keep your speech simple and clear:

**Tip 1: Use simple language.** Express your ideas simply enough that the average high school student could understand them. Maxwell expresses a similar sentiment but suggests using language that an eighth grader can understand.

**Tip 2: Vary sentence length and structure, but use short sentences and simple words most of the time**. The more complex, important, or stressful the subject matter, the more important it is to write plainly. Choose words of Anglo-Saxon origin rather than those of Latin or Greek origin—for example, a Latinate word might _facilitate_ your efforts to sound smart, but an Anglo-Saxon word will _help_ your audience understand you.

**Tip 3: Use active language.** Begin sentences with clear subjects and vivid verbs. This keeps the “action” moving and keeps your audience engaged.

**Tip 4: Trim unnecessary words and ideas.** Keep sentences short and direct by avoiding qualifiers and hedge words—they add fluff and feel indecisive. Likewise, Maxwell says you should trim excess information that might distract from your main points.

##### Incorporate Engaging Content

To make your ideas more understandable and to captivate your audience, experts recommend that you **incorporate a variety of engaging content** into your speech. Let’s look at several ways you can do this:

**Strategy 1: Tell stories.** In _How Highly Effective People Speak_ , competitive public speaker Peter D. Andrei explains that people understand the world through stories—it’s how we learn and how our ancestors passed down information over thousands of years. When an argument is presented as a story, we relate to the people in the story and imagine what it would be like if the same things happened to us. Andrei specifically recommends telling a story about a _single_ person because this makes it easier for the listener to imagine themselves in the story.

Heinrichs adds that you should describe sensations in detail. For example, describe the scent of your childhood home or the feeling of your stomach dropping. This helps your audience “experience” the event alongside you, and they’ll react to it the same way you did.

Gallo offers additional recommendations for making your story more memorable. He suggests incorporating the following elements into your story:

  * **Unexpectedness:** Make the story take a turn that the audience didn’t anticipate. You’ll shock people into paying attention to what you’re saying.
  * **Mystery:** Keep your story’s outcome unknown for as long as possible. People crave the closure of knowing how a story will end and will keep listening until they get it.
  * **Heroes and villains:** Give your audience some characters to root for and others to dislike. They’ll become engrossed in your story as they wait for the satisfaction of the hero triumphing and the villain getting their comeuppance.
  * **Adversity:** Make sure that the main character of your story overcomes adversity at some point in the narrative. Your audience will be inspired by this battle against misfortune, and they’ll keep listening to find out whether the main character prevails.



**Strategy 2: Use visuals.** Maxwell suggests you use body language, visual metaphors, or actual visual aids like physical props and images to help illustrate your ideas. Andrei explains that memories based on visual perception stick out more clearly in our minds, so they’ll provoke a stronger emotional reaction and be easier to recall later.

Gallo provides an example of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos using a vivid metaphor to condense a complex idea: To illustrate his philosophy on team size, Bezos explained, “We try to create teams that are no larger than can be fed by two pizzas.”

**Strategy 3: Engage multiple senses.** Gallo recommends presenting content that triggers a combination of the senses of hearing, sight, and touch. It’ll help your audience to remember what you’ve said: Research has shown that multisensory experiences are much more memorable than single-sense experiences. For example, if you’re pitching a product, you could pass a prototype around your audience.

**Strategy 4: Incorporate humor:** Maxwell writes that getting your audience to laugh increases feelings of intimacy and makes them more receptive to your words. However, he suggests you only use humor if it comes naturally to you. Gallo adds that humor increases your likeability and suggests four ways to incorporate humor into your speeches and presentations:

  * **Share an anecdote:** Relate a short, amusing story about an experience you—or possibly someone else—had.
  * **Make an analogy** : Humorously draw attention to the ways in which two different things are similar (for example, “Attempting to run Congress without encouraging social relationships between its members is like trying to drive a car that doesn’t have any motor oil!”).
  * **Quote someone else’s funny comment:** This might be anyone from a friend to a famous person.
  * **Show the audience a funny video or picture:** Use one you’ve produced yourself or one produced by someone else.



##### Create a Powerful Closing

Anderson writes that **an audience will remember a talkbased on how it ends.** He provides several options for powerful closings:

**Closing 1: Apply what you’ve discussed to a broader situation.** For example, “If this management style can transform Fortune 500 companies, imagine what it could do in the White House.”

**Closing 2: Declare a personal mission.** End your speech by making a proclamation about how _you_ are going to use this knowledge to improve the world.

**Closing 3: Leave your audience with a dream.** Paint a picture of a better world. Inspire your audience with your dream for the future—but be sure to avoid clichés.

**Closing 4: Call them to action.** Ask your audience to take the information you just gave them and do something with it. For example, “If we all contact our congressmen, they’ll have to listen.” Maxwell offers another tip for encouraging action: Help your audience imagine what the positive change looks like and show them how to take the first step.

**Closing 5: End with beautiful language.** A poetic statement, song lyric, or eloquent phrase can add a somber and memorable touch. Carnegie recommends using a famous quote if it more powerfully sums up your argument than you could.

#### Practice Your Speech

Once you’ve written your speech, rehearse it so you can deliver your ideas clearly and confidently. Carnegie recommends you memorize your speech. This doesn’t necessarily mean learning each exact word and phrase by heart, but instead**thoroughly learning your _argument_ so you can speak extemporaneously**. This will not only save you time but will also enhance your delivery—when you know your speech well enough, you can deliver it with conviction, feeling, and authenticity.

Gallo suggests you focus on three things when practicing your speech:

  * **The speed at which you talk.** Keep rehearsing until you’ve perfected talking at a speed of 190 words per minute. This is a conversational rate of speech that seems natural.
  * **Confident body language.** Examples of confident body language include standing up straight, holding your head high, and making frequent eye contact with your audience. If you fail to appear confident in what you’re saying, your audience will trust you and your opinions less.
  * **Hand gestures.** Use gestures to add emphasis to what you’re saying. For example, if you’re talking about how much a problem has grown in size, create a small circle with your hands and expand it. Studies have shown that making hand gestures will increase the audience’s confidence in you and what you’re saying.



### How to Deliver Your Speech

Now that we’ve outlined how to prepare, write, and practice your speech, we’ll explore experts’ tips and tricks to help you deliver it with confidence and clarity on the day of your presentation. That way, you’ll leave a powerful impression on your audience. We’ll cover how to manage your stress and anxiety, engage your audience, and hold their attention.

#### Manage Stress and Anxiety

**It’s normal to feel nervous and release adrenaline before your speech** , even if you’re a seasoned speaker. Anderson explains that adrenaline can be good: It gives you energy and animates your voice. However, in large doses, it can also make you shaky, give you dry mouth, and cause anxiety. He gives some tips for managing your nerves before you step out on stage:

**Tip 1: Get active.** If your adrenaline is high enough to make you shaky, do something physical**** to get rid of the excess. Carnegie suggests you jump around and shake your fists in the air—feel your convictions and allow them to animate you and fire you up.

**Tip 2: Drink five to six ounces of water** five minutes before you speak. This is enough to keep dry mouth at bay but not enough to fill your bladder.

**Tip 3: Focus on your breathing** in the minutes before speaking. Make sure the oxygen is going all the way down into your stomach and hold it for a moment or two before exhaling. In _Amplify Your Influence_ , keynote speaker René Rodriguez suggests another breathing variation for calming your nerves: box breathing. Breathe in for four counts and pause for four counts. Then, breathe out for four counts and pause again for four counts. Repeat this cycle of breath for as long as you need to feel more centered and calm.

If all else fails (if, for example, you begin stuttering or your mind goes blank), Anderson says to simply **tell the audience you’re nervous.** They want to root for you, and admitting that you’re experiencing nerves only makes you more relatable. However, Maxwell disagrees, arguing that if you show that you’re nervous in any way, your audience will be more concerned about you than your message. He recommends that you combat your nerves by adopting a mantra—a short affirming statement to remind yourself that you’re able to communicate well and make a difference with your words.

#### Engage Your Audience

To engage your audience during your presentation, Maxwell says you must focus on **connecting with them. **Connection breaks down barriers that prevent people from listening to you, which makes them more receptive to you and your ideas. Maxwell suggests a few ways to engage and connect with your audience:

  * **Put yourself in the audience’s shoes.** Consider what they feel, think, and desire, and make them feel valued in ways that are important to them. You can do this by interacting with them, expressing your gratitude, or celebrating their accomplishments. Carnegie also suggests using familiar in-group words and ideas, like a Richard Feynman joke for a group of physicists.
  * **Remove mental and physical barriers.** For instance, be friendly and create a comfortable atmosphere so that your audience feels at ease. Or, instead of standing behind a large podium, try sitting by the edge of the stage.



Carnegie provides some other ways to engage and connect with your audience when presenting:

  * **Speak from your heart:** Facts don’t convince—emotion does. Deliver your speech with passion and enthusiasm. If you’re not emotional about your subject, your audience won’t be either.
  * **Act confident:** Take the stage with poise and presence. Remind yourself that you’re well-prepared, invested in your ideas, and here to educate an audience that came to listen to _you_.
  * **Speak conversationally,** as if you're chatting with a close friend. This will bring out a natural, sincere quality in your voice and help the audience feel connected to you. 
  * **Show your individuality.** Real stage presence comes from an authentic individual owning their personality. Speak, move, and express yourself naturally. Gallo explains that allowing yourself to be emotionally vulnerable is important because it shows your audience that you’re a human being who has feelings, just like them.



#### Keep Your Audience’s Attention

You may have successfully engaged your audience, but you must then prevent them from drifting off or losing focus as your speech progresses. Maxwell offers two techniques that can help you liven up a lukewarm audience:

  * **Interact with audience members.** Ask questions that require them to shout out answers or raise their hands. You can also encourage them to say or share something with a neighbor.
  * **Use pauses strategically.** When you stop talking, people naturally return their focus to you as they wonder what caused the sudden silence.



**Another way to keep your audience captivated is to shock them**. Gallo writes that shocking moments stick in people’s minds—according to neuroscientists, they heighten our emotions and cause our brains to perceive and remember information more vividly. The more your audience thinks about the shocking moment, the more they contemplate the idea you were trying to get across—and the more likely they are to act on that idea.

Gallo recommends several techniques to create a shocking moment:

**Technique 1: Bring an unusual prop to your talk.** For example, neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor brought a real human brain to her TED talk about neuroscience. The brain disgusted her audience, but it also grabbed their attention.

**Technique 2: Give a demonstration.** This method is particularly useful if you’re presenting a product. Showcase the item’s unique selling points. Your audience will hopefully be shocked by how impressive it is.

**Technique 3: Include startling statistics.** For example, when giving a TED talk on psychopathy, author and journalist Jon Ronson revealed that one in every hundred people is a psychopath—a high statistic that grabbed his audience’s attention.

**Technique 4:. Display a jarring photo or video.** For instance, if you’re discussing the horrors of war, you could include images of war-torn communities to shock your audience into recognizing the pain that conflict causes.

**Technique 5: Create a sound bite and use it in your presentation.** A sound bite distills your main argument into a short, snappy, and memorable sentence. You can transform your sound bite into a shocking moment by making it particularly emotionally charged.
