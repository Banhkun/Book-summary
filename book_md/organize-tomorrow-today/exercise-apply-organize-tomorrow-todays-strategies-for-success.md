## Exercise: Apply Organize Tomorrow Today’s Strategies for Success

Selk, Bartow, and Rudy provide many strategies you can use to increase your level of success at work. Consider how you can implement one of these strategies to solve a problem you’re facing right now.

* * *

Describe a challenge you’re currently facing that hinders your success at work. (For example, you never have enough time to answer all your emails.)

Which of the authors’ strategies would best help you overcome this challenge? Explain how this strategy would help. (For example, their strategy for limiting the windows of time you spend on unproductive tasks could increase the time you have to answer emails.)

Name one action you can take to begin implementing your chosen strategy. (For example, you could set the maximum time you’re allowed to spend on unproductive tasks to 10 minutes. If your breaks are longer than 10 minutes, dedicate them to answering emails.)
