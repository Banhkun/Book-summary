## Chapters 1-2: Life at Home

_Fun Home_ is __ a graphic memoir by cartoonist Alison Bechdel. It follows Alison through the early years of her life as she navigates her relationship with her closeted father, discovers her own sexuality, and grapples with her father’s supposed suicide.**** Told in a non-linear fashion,**the book touches on the themes of gender identity, sexual orientation, dysfunctional households, suicide, and literature as a way of connecting to life.**

(Shortform note: The author includes many references to literature. For the sake of clarity, this summary includes brief descriptions of the stories and authors referenced. Also, because this is a graphic novel, the summary pulls from both the book’s text and its illustrations.)

Alison Bechdel grew up in an old, Victorian home in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania with her two brothers, mother, and father. **Her father, a notably distant man, put more energy into working on their home than he did focusing on his family.** When they first bought the house, it was falling apart, but he was determined to restore it to its former glory. He had an affinity for restoration and, often, forced his family to help him with his projects.

### Her Father’s Inner Turmoil

**Alison’s father was likely a closeted homosexual or bisexual man.** Though he never directly expressed his sexuality to his family, Alison recognized a few behaviors that showed her father’s more feminine side throughout her childhood (such as his use of a bronzing stick). **She implies that her father’s repression was a source of self-loathing and misplaced anger.** She compares her father’s desire to create the image of a perfect home despite its disrepair to his desire to create the image of the perfect man despite his inner struggle.

**Her father was sensitive to failure and disorder.** He punished his children at any sign of imperfection, even if they hadn’t done anything wrong. For example, he once asked the family why a vase had gotten so close to the edge of the table. No one responded, so he proceeded to grab and spank Alison as she cried that she hadn’t done anything.

He was not only sensitive to the perceived failures of his children, but he was also sensitive to his own.**** For example, one of Alison’s brothers once commented on the peace signs on their father’s tie. It was not a critique, just an observation. Despite the fact that he was running late, Alison’s father immediately ran up to his room and changed ties. After this incident, their mother told them that they were no longer allowed to make comments on their father’s appearance, even if their comments weren’t critical.

Though he had his moments of kindness, these actually made the tension in the house worse.**** The children never knew what version of their father they were going to get, so they had to navigate every interaction with their father with finesse.

### Opposites

**Alison and her father were polar opposites of one another.** Throughout her childhood, this led to constant tension and disagreement:

  * **Where her father loved extravagance, Alison loved functionality.** Her father wanted opulent, period-specific decor. Alison wanted to live in an all-metal, submarine inspired room. When attending a wedding, Alison’s father wore a luxurious velvet suit. Conversely, Alison wanted to wear sneakers.
  * **Where her father was more feminine, Alison was more masculine.** Her father loved dressing Alison up in girly clothing and wearing makeup. Alison didn’t care about clothing and wore her hair short. She calls herself the “Butch” to her father’s “Sissy.”
  * **Where her father craved isolation, Alison craved interaction.** Alison adored her and her father’s occasional game of airplane. It gave her the physical contact that she craved, but very rarely received from him.



> **Icarus, Daedalus, and the Minotaur**
> 
> Alison compares her father to three Greek mythological figures: Icarus, Daedalus, and the Minotaur.
> 
> Daedalus, a master craftsman and inventor, creates a disguise for Pasiphaë (the wife of King Minos) that allows her to mate with a bull that has been given to King Minos to sacrifice. This results in her giving birth to the Minotaur, a fearsome creature that demands human sacrifice. To contain the Minotaur, King Minos demands that Daedalus construct a Labyrinth to contain the creature. To keep the Minotaur pacified, King Minos sacrifices 7 young men and 7 young women to the beast every year.
> 
> When a hero kills the Minotaur, King Minos imprisons Daedalus and his son, Icarus, for Daedalus’s failure. In an effort to escape, Daedalus crafts wings for himself and his child out of wax and feathers. As they fly away, he warns Icarus not to fly too close to the sun because the wax holding his wings together could melt. Icarus doesn’t listen, flies too high, and plummets to his death.
> 
> First, Alison compares her father to **Icarus**. She foreshadows a fall from grace because of his ambition and zeal. This turns out to be his reckless sexual advances toward underaged boys as an outlet to deal with his sexual repression.
> 
> Then, she compares her father’s obsession with his work and disregard of human cost to Daedalus’s thoughtlessness. **Daedalus** didn’t consider the costs of creating the disguise for Pasiphaë. His lack of concern for the consequences of his actions led to the birth of the Minotaur and, by extension, the death of dozens of innocent people. Similarly, Alison’s father’s obsession with the renovation of the house was more important to him than the well-being of his own children. In fact, he would often force them to help him with his work on the house. If they made a mistake or got tired, he would get angry and, sometimes, violent.
> 
> Finally, Alison compares her father to the **Minotaur** and her home to the Labyrinth. Her family had to be careful in their own home because they never knew when their father was just around the corner and ready to go off.

### The Bechdel Funeral Home

Alison’s great-grandfather founded the Bechdel Funeral Home. Alison’s father took over the family business after _his_ father had a heart attack. Due to the low population, the funeral home did not make enough to pay the bills, so he took on a second position at the local high school teaching English.

Alison and her brothers dubbed the funeral home the “Fun Home” because they usually had more fun in the funeral home than in their actual home. They played with the chair trolleys, the flower stands, and the smelling salts as they invented worlds of their own. Their grandmother lived in the back and the business was in the front. They would often spend the night at the “Fun Home” and have their grandmother tell them stories about their father’s childhood.

### Reacting to Death

One day, Alison’s father asked her to come to the room where he embalmed the bodies. **On the table was a dead, naked man with his chest cut open.** She was shocked to see the man’s genitals as well as his internal organs. Her father asked for a pair of scissors that he easily could have grabbed himself. He may have done this for a few reasons:

  * It may have been that he just needed the scissors. 
  * It may have been the way that her father was exposed to his first cadaver, and her father wanted to continue the tradition. 
  * It may have been her father’s attempt at eliciting an emotional response to death that he no longer felt.



**Later in her life, Alison related to the final reason as she coped with her father’s death.** After her father’s death, she would tell people of his passing in a matter-of-fact way to try to elicit an emotional response from them. This was her attempt to emote vicariously through someone else because she wasn’t feeling the sadness or grief that she thought she should be feeling.

### Alison’s Father’s Death

**Alison’s father died after he was hit by a truck while clearing brush from a home he was planning to renovate.** The truck driver stated that Alison’s father jumped backward into the road as if he had seen a wild animal. Alison doesn’t know for sure, but **she believes that his death was a suicide.** She points to the facts that Alison’s mother had just filed for divorce and that her father had been reading literature that implied that life was meaningless.

Though Alison and her mother believed his death was deliberate, Alison mentioned later that perhaps her family chose to believe that because, to them, it was less painful.**It gave her father agency over his own death.** He chose when he wanted to die and went through with it.

**She struggled to comprehend her father’s passing**. She spent her childhood watching her father prepare bodies for funerals. When it was time for his, she asked herself, “Who prepares the body of the man who prepares the bodies?” At his funeral, she and her brothers showed little emotion. In fact, the only moments where she felt consolation was in violently brushing off someone’s hand who was trying to support her. **This was likely because the action elicited an emotion from her during a time that she was mostly feeling numb.**

> **Albert Camus**
> 
> Albert Camus was a Nobel prize-winning philosopher, journalist, and author. His work contributed to the development of absurdism: the idea that life is meaningless, but we, as human beings, always inherently search for meaning, thus making life absurd.
> 
> Alison’s father had been reading Camus’s _A Happy Death_ right before he died. He had highlighted one particular line that states that people lie to themselves twice about the people they love: once for the other person’s benefit and the second time to their detriment. She relates this line to her father’s sexuality and her parent’s failing relationship.**She implies that her mother lied to herself about her father’s sexuality because she didn’t want to believe it.** At first, it was for his benefit as she gave him her affection. However, it eventually became the source of her resentment towards him.
> 
> Another of Camus’s works that Alison’s father read was _The Myth of Sisyphus_. In it, Camus examines the idea that life is meaningless, and, therefore, absurd. He uses the story of Sisyphus, a Greek mythological figure, to highlight the pointlessness of life. As a punishment for crimes he committed, the gods forced Sisyphus into the monotonous task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, letting it fall, then starting over again for all eternity. **Camus compares this to people working in meaningless or trivial jobs who commit their lives to doing the same monotonous tasks.**
> 
> **Through Camus’s definition, she compares her father to Sisyphus.** He stayed in the town in which he was born, worked in tedious jobs that he didn’t love, and kept his true passions hidden away. **In the essay, Camus also mentions that the only escape from the absurd is suicide.** Though he later retracts that statement and implies that suicide is illogical, Alison believes that her father may have never gotten to that point in the essay.
