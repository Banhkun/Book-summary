## Chapter 7: New York City and School

While on a trip to NYC in 1976, a 15-year old Alison saw the city in a new light.**** She was traveling with her father and brothers to take part in the bicentennial celebrations. They stayed with a family friend who lived in Greenwich Village, a well-known LGBT community. During her time there, she began to notice the well-groomed, homosexual men walking on the street, not trying to hide their more feminine behaviors. Her family went to the ballet, had drinks with a gay couple, and saw _A Chorus Line_. **These activities introduced her to members of the LGBT community and exposed her to LGBT stories.**

However, the trip was not without its problems, and Alison’s father wasn’t always an attentive parent. At one point on the trip, one of Alison’s younger brothers, John, wandered off.**** He walked through a known cruising area and was approached by a man who asked if he “wanted to see his boat.” At the first opportunity, John ran back to the apartment. In addition to John’s close call, Alison’s father would leave his kids to go out and “have a drink” late at night. **Alison implies that he was likely meeting up with men and leaving his children to fulfill his sexual needs.**

Years later, Alison moved to New York. **She believes that, had her father not died from the car accident, there was a good chance he’d have died shortly after with the emergence of the AIDS crisis.** This is because the LGBT community in New York was the center of the AIDS epidemic in the 80s, and Alison’s father had a tendency to go out at night and sleep with men from that community when he visited the city.

While she stands behind this observation, she notes it may be merely her attempt to find peace or meaning within her father’s passing. It would make him a tragic figure who lived a secretly promiscuous lifestyle because homophobia had forced him to repress his identity.

### Literature and Education

Once Alison developed the ability to discuss literature in an intellectual way, she and her father began to connect. When Alison was in high school, she was assigned to her father’s English class. During this time, she discovered that she enjoyed the same types of books that her father did. **Their discussions of literature extended beyond the classroom and helped them develop a closer relationship.**

When Alison started college, she and her father actively talked about the books she was assigned in her English classes. However, his excitement for the literature she was reading soon left little room for her to have her own thoughts or opinions. **She believes that he was living vicariously through her instead of connecting with her.** Because of this, she began to move away from the literature that her father loved and began to focus more on her journey into LGBT culture.

At one point, Alison swore she was never going to take another English class during her time at school, but an oversight led her to take a January-term course discussing _Ulysses_ by James Joyce. _Ulysses_ was Alison’s father’s favorite book. He gave her a variety of materials to study before she began reading Joyce’s novel. **One of these resources was _Earthly Paradise_ by Colette. **Collette was an influential voice in women’s independence in France and a known lesbian. At the time, Alison believed that her father gave her that book as a sign that he knew about her sexuality.

### Confessions

When Alison came out to her father, he didn’t seem upset. **In fact, he encouraged her to explore while in college but didn’t want her to label herself a “lesbian.”** In a letter he wrote to her shortly after she came out, her father talked as if she already knew about his sexuality. While he never directly said that he was gay or bisexual,**he talked about how he thought about putting a label on his sexuality for years, but never did.** He disclosed his envy of the “freedom” Alison and her contemporaries had to express their sexuality in the 80s.

When Alison returned home for the first time after coming out, her mother revealed many of her father’s transgressions. While sharing a bottle of wine, her mother explained the affairs her father had when they spent time in New York. She talked about his out-of-control behaviors such as shoplifting and speeding. She eventually told Alison of her plan to leave her father, a plan that Alison supported.

While home from school, Alison and her father went to see a movie. On the car ride to the theater, Alison asked her father if he gave her the Colette book as a way of reaching out about her sexuality. While he claimed that he didn’t, he said that he had his suspicions.

Then, Alison’s father opened up a little about his experiences with men. He said that his first time was when he was fourteen with a man at the Fun Home. He also said that he used to dress up in girl’s clothing, just like Alison used to dress up in boy’s clothing.**Though the conversation didn’t delve any deeper, Alison felt as though they had finally discussed the unspoken bond they shared over their sexuality.** They never discussed it again.

Following Alison and her father’s conversation, Alison continued to connect with her father. In fact, the night before he died, a friend of the family remarked that their closeness was unusual. **Although her father was like the figure of Icarus, a figure falling from grace because of his recklessness, he was there to catch and support her when she made the leap into her sexuality.**

> **_The Odyssey_(Homer) and _Ulysses_(Joyce)**
> 
> _The Odyssey_ is an epic poem written by Greek poet Homer, who tells the story of Odysseus as he overcomes massive obstacles to return home to his wife, Penelope, in Ithaca._Ulysses_ is a novel by the acclaimed Irish novelist James Joyce. In _Ulysses_ , Joyce parallels the journey of his protagonist, Leopold Bloom, to that of Odysseus in Homer’s epic poem _.**Alison relates many of her later experiences with her father to Joyce’s novel.**_
> 
> In _Ulysses_ , Bloom has a moment of reconciliation with his friend Stephen. Though this moment is a direct parallel to the moment of reconnection between Odysseus and his son Telemachus when the hero returns to Ithaca, there is much less emotion than in Homer’s work. **Alison calls her moment with her father in the car their “Ithaca moment.”** She compares it more directly to Joyce’s work as their reconciliation was not as emotional as in Homer’s epic _._
> 
> At one point in _Ulysses_ , Bloom contemplates the death of his father, Rudolph, who had left a note and then killed himself because of the persecution he experienced as a Jewish man. Though her father didn’t leave a note,**she compares her father’s death as a closeted man in Beech Creek, PA to that of Rudolph as a Jewish man in anti-Semitic Dublin.**
