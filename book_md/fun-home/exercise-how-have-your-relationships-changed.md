## Exercise: How Have Your Relationships Changed?

Throughout the course of her life, Alison and her father’s relationship changed. Though it began as a cold and distanced relationship, it eventually evolved into one of connection and empathy.

* * *

List the ways that Alison’s relationship with her father changed from childhood to adulthood. Think about their connection through literature and their sexuality.

Now, think about a relationship that you have with a family member or close friend that has changed drastically over time. How would you describe the relationship at the beginning?

How would you describe the relationship now?

Why do you think the relationship changed in the way that it did? Think about the experiences you’ve shared with this person that influenced your connection with them.
