## Exercise: Examine How You Use Body Language

Now that we’ve discussed various applications and implications of body language, think about how it affects your communication with others.

* * *

What’s one way understanding body language could help you communicate better with other people? (For example, maybe you realize that you’ve been unintentionally giving off unfriendly nonverbal signals, and you plan to change your body language to make it easier to make friends. Or, maybe you want to use your knowledge of body language to better understand how your loved ones express their emotions.)

What’s one personal context that affects your body language? (For example, maybe you grew up in a culture where it’s normal to hug people every time you greet them. Or, maybe you’re naturally shy, so you tend to have closed-off body language in public spaces.)

How might this context affect how other people perceive you? (For example, some people might feel happy and comforted when you hug them, but others might find this gesture overly familiar. If people see closed-off body language, they may think you’re standoffish because they don’t know you’re shy.)

Name one body language cue you’d like to use more to show people you’re open to friendship. Why did you choose this cue? (For example, maybe you want to smile warmly when you meet people so they feel welcome. Or, maybe you want to stand up straighter so people think you’re confident and want to approach you.)
