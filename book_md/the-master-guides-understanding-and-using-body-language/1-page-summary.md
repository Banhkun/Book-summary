## 1-Page Summary

Do you wish you could better understand the ways people communicate with their body language? Nonverbal communication plays a huge role in how people express emotions and interact with each other. With an understanding of how to use and interpret body language, you can more easily form connections with others, adapt your nonverbal signals to suit different situations, and even alter your emotional state.

In Shortform’s Master Guide to Understanding and Using Body Language, we’ve collected insights from nine experts in nonverbal communication, including self-help authors, former FBI agents, behavioral experts, and leadership specialists. First, we’ll discuss how body language impacts our communication. Then, we’ll explore some of the most important contextual factors that should influence how we interpret nonverbal signals. Finally, we’ll look at a selection of nonverbal cues you can use to show others you’re open to friendship—and that may indicate whether or not others feel the same way.

### How Body Language Shapes Communication and Connection

Body language plays a huge role in nearly every type of face-to-face communication. Consciously and unconsciously, it influences how we make judgments about others, form bonds, and establish trust in relationships. Therefore, knowledge of body language—whether your own or someone else’s—is an important aspect of communicating effectively and forming strong connections.

In this section, we’ll explore four ways nonverbal communication shapes how we interact, especially when building friendships:

  1. How body language influences first impressions
  2. How body language helps you reach your conversational goals
  3. How body language and emotions influence each other
  4. How body language affects the perception of spoken communication



#### Role #1: Body Language Influences First Impressions

In _How to Talk to Anyone_ , Leil Lowndes argues that **our body language—including our posture, how comfortable we appear, the way we smile, and the way we make eye contact—affects how others perceive us.** Whether we’re conscious of it or not, our body language constantly emits signals about the way we feel.

Using these signals, others form instinctive impressions of us within the first few seconds of _seeing_ us. Before we get a chance to utter our first words, they’ve already made assumptions about our personality, feelings, confidence level, and social or professional status. Most importantly, they’ve already decided whether we’re the type of person that they’d want to spend time with. You likely do the same with the people you meet.

Jack Schafer and Marvin Karlins explain how **sending the _wrong_ signals can impede your ability to make friends.** In _The Like Switch_ , they state that we often display “unfriendly” nonverbal cues—such as staring, frowning, or crossing our arms—without knowing it, even when we _do_ want to establish personal connections. Learning what these unfriendly cues are can help you recognize if you’re unconsciously pushing people away, and avoiding them may make it easier to make friends.

Additionally, knowing unfriendly cues can help you spot when others aren’t interested in being friends with you. Learning what _friendly_ body language cues look like helps you approach people who are receptive to meeting and getting to know you. (We’ll discuss specific friendly and unfriendly cues later in this guide.)

#### Role #2: Body Language Helps You Reach Your Conversational Goals

Once you’ve moved past the first impression, knowing how to read body language can help you get what you want out of any conversation. In _The Definitive Book of Body Language_ , Allan and Barbara Pease suggest that this is because **awareness of others’ body language helps you read their emotions. This in turn helps you control how they perceive you**. Sometimes, the emotions you read from your conversational partner may suggest that they’re not responding to you in the way you hoped or in a way that reflects positively on you. In this situation, you can change your approach until the other person responds more favorably.

For instance, say you want your new friend to think that you’re interesting. However, you notice that she starts people-watching and tapping her foot every time you talk about your job. Because you know that these two cues indicate boredom, you switch topics until you find something that causes her fully to focus her attention back on you—she’s now interested in what you have to say.

#### Role #3: Body Language Is Intertwined With Our Emotions

As we alluded to above, body language is deeply connected to emotions. **Understanding the relationship between body language and emotions can help you change your emotional state and communicate appealing signals to potential friends.**

In _Presence_ , Amy Cuddy argues that there’s a two-way link between your body language and your emotions. Your body language often _reflects_ your emotional state (as in slumped shoulders when you’re feeling upset), but you can also _alter_ your mindset by changing your body language. For example, when you change your posture to exude confidence—by relaxing and opening up your shoulders—your emotions take cues _from_ your body, and you start to genuinely feel more self-assured.

What does this have to do with forming friendships? According to Schafer and Karlins in _The Like Switch_ , confidence and ease are some of the qualities that most attract potential friends,**** as confident people are more comfortable sharing details about themselves. This builds rapport in new relationships. Additionally, confident body language displays friendliness and openness to connection, so it makes you more approachable to potential friends. Therefore, it’s possible that if you consciously adopt body language that makes you look _and_ feel more confident, you’ll have an easier time making friends.

#### Role #4: Nonverbal Cues Change How Others Perceive Our Words

In _The Definitive Book of Body Language_ , Allan and Barbara Pease also discuss how**your body language influences how others interpret your words.** They explain that during verbal interactions, people intuitively respond to each other based more on what they see than on what they hear. They suggest that your body language accounts for 60-80% of how others perceive you.

The perception the other person forms of you based on your body language determines their reaction to what you say. The Peases argue that people are more likely to respond positively to what you say when they trust you, and the degree to which people trust you hinges on how well your words and your body language align.****

**When the two align, people trust you because they feel as though you're expressing yourself honestly.** For example, your friend trusts you when you tell her you’re excited to see her because you look her in the eye and smile when you say it. As a result, she responds positively to your words by showing signs of affection—for instance, by relaxing her posture, smiling, and making eye contact.

**When your body language doesn’t align with your words, people don’t trust you because they feel as though you’re lying or hiding something.** For example, your friend doesn’t trust you when you tell her you want to see her because you avoid eye contact and clench your jaw (which are nonverbal cues that can suggest discomfort or deceit). As a result, she responds negatively to your words by showing signs of withdrawal—for instance, by crossing her arms, turning away from you, and avoiding eye contact.

Robert Greene offers further advice for judging a person’s true feelings when their words and body language don’t match. In _The Laws of Human Nature_ , he argues that nonverbal communication more often reveals hidden negative emotions than hidden positive emotions. When you see conflicting signals—a flash of a sad facial expression when a person’s words are positive—assume the negative emotion is what the person is actually feeling. For example, if someone acts happy to see you but you detect tension in their voice, they’re probably more uncomfortable than happy.

### Understanding the Context of Body Language

Now that we’ve discussed some of the ways nonverbal communication affects our perception of others and our ability to form connections, let’s begin exploring the different contexts that influence body language.

**There’s no such thing as completely universal body language.** Before you can read and apply different nonverbal cues to skillfully communicate with and understand the emotions of others, you must first understand the factors that lead to differences in body language from person to person. This helps you avoid misunderstandings that can come from interpreting nonverbal cues out of context.

In this section, we’ll examine two contextual factors:

  1. How body language varies among individuals
  2. How body language cues work in conjunction with each other



#### Contextual Factor #1: Understand What “Normal” Body Language Is for an Individual

In _The Dictionary of Body Language_ , former FBI agent Joe Navarro states that when you’re interpreting body language cues, it’s important to **consider whether the action is ordinary or unusual for the person doing it**. Factors such as personality type, neurodivergence, and culture can influence how someone communicates nonverbally. For example:

**Personality:** Someone who’s shy might naturally have more nervous or withdrawn body language compared to someone more outgoing.

**Neurodivergence:** You might interpret someone rocking their upper body back and forth as a sign of psychological distress. However, someone who’s neurodivergent may rock back and forth as a form of habitual self-stimulatory behavior (or “stimming”), which doesn’t necessarily indicate that they’re upset.

**Culture:** Some cultures might display more intimacy than others, such as through hugs and physical touch. If you aren’t aware of this context and come from a culture where this isn’t the case, you might interpret this tendency as overly familiar or indicative of a lack of personal boundaries.

> **Differences in Nonverbal Communication Across Cultures**
> 
> Several categories of body language often differ between cultures. Understanding these differences can help you avoid offending people from cultures different from your own. It may also help you understand why someone is displaying body language contrary to what you expect. Here are a couple of the most prominent cultural variations:
> 
> **1\. Level of eye contact.** Conventions around eye contact differ widely between parts of the world. In Western countries, maintaining eye contact typically indicates confidence, respect, and interest—it’s viewed positively. However, in many Asian, Latin American, African, and North American Indigenous cultures, holding eye contact may be seen as adversarial or hostile. Additionally, people from those cultures may consider holding eye contact with elders and superiors rude.
> 
> **2\. Variation in hand gestures.** The meaning of some communicative hand gestures also varies widely. Some gestures express a benign message in one culture but are highly offensive in another. For example, people use the thumbs-up sign in most of Europe and North America as an affirmative or an indicator that someone’s doing a good job. However, in the Middle East and Greece, it’s an insulting gesture of rejection or contempt.

In _The Laws of Human Nature_ , Greene also warns not to**** universally assign cues to certain emotions: Different people may use the same nonverbal cue to express different emotions. For example, one person may speak louder when they’re excited; another may do so when they’re upset.

##### Get a Baseline Understanding of People’s Body Language

To understand when body language indicates a certain emotion for a certain person, it’s important to establish their baseline of “normal” body language:**a set of nonverbal cues that signal they’re in a neutral emotional state.** Once you have this knowledge of their “normal” body language, you can more easily notice and interpret cues that represent strong emotions for them—the cues will differ from the baseline.

For example, after establishing a baseline for one person, you may find that they habitually tap their foot and it doesn’t indicate anything specific about how they’re feeling. However, they don’t typically tap their fingers—if they’re doing so, this may suggest they’re experiencing a stronger emotion such as anxiety or impatience.

In _What Every Body Is Saying_ , Joe Navarro and Marvin Karlins further explain how to determine and use this baseline. First, **make a mental record of a person’s behaviors at the _start_ of your interaction**. This allows you to get a baseline to measure your future observations against.

Second, when analyzing someone’s baseline behavior, assess it in the context of the situation they’re in. Consider things such as their surroundings and what they’re doing there so you can know what behaviors to expect and what behaviors are abnormal. For example, you should expect someone at a job interview to show more nervous behavior than someone shopping at a grocery store.

Greene (_The Laws of Human Nature_) also offers advice for establishing someone’s baseline body language. He advises that when you’re studying a certain person, watch her interact with a variety of people to figure out her default emotion. Then, pay attention to changes from this baseline. For instance, if a normally cheerful person is smiling, that doesn’t tell you much. However, if a normally neutral person is smiling, that probably indicates emotion.

#### Contextual Factor #2: Consider All Nonverbal Cues Together

In _The Dictionary of Body Language_ , **Navarro suggests also taking a person’s _whole_ body language into account before deciding what a particular cue means. **This can prevent you from misinterpreting their nonverbal communication—the combination of cues will typically paint a clearer picture of their emotional state than an isolated one.

For example, when someone smiles at another person, we typically perceive it as a cue of affection, kindness, or joy. However, a smile on its own doesn’t present the whole picture. If the person is displaying signs of tension or discomfort as well—if the muscles around their eyes are tense, their feet are pointed away from the person they’re talking to, and so on—then their smile may not represent true affection or friendliness, but _forced_ friendliness that hides discomfort.

### Reading and Crafting Body Language to Make Friends

Once you understand the importance and context of body language cues, you can begin to reliably interpret other people’s nonverbal communication. Likewise, you can craft effective body language to put forth the signals you want other people to see. This will help you to more easily form connections and make friends.

In this final section, we’ll discuss cues that demonstrate openness, friendliness, and confidence. We’ll also discuss cues that suggest someone isn’t interested in a connection.

#### Understand Open and Friendly Body Language

Friendly body language tends to be open and relaxed. These cues communicate interest, trust, and willingness to engage. If you’re approaching or trying to get to know someone, look for these cues to determine whether they’re open to it. Additionally, amend your body language so other people know you’re friendly, too.

##### Smiling

Schafer and Karlins state in _The Like Switch_ that **smiling is one of the most powerful ways to signal affection and openness.** Furthermore, smiling people are seen as more attractive and more confident.

However, in _How to Talk to Anyone_ , Lowndes warns not to flash a smile at a stranger too quickly. People don’t respond warmly to quick, instinctive smiles because they interpret them as impersonal—they assume that you’re flashing that smile at anyone you come across. They’ll then respond in kind by acting detached or distant.

Lowndes suggests that to get a warm response, you should instead look the recipient in the eyes, pause briefly, and then let out a big, warm smile while maintaining eye contact. The delay will convince recipients that you’re smiling just for them, and they’ll instantly feel like you’re happy to meet them.

##### Flashing the Eyebrows

According to Schafer and Karlins, another cue that signals friendliness when greeting others is **lifting your eyebrows and returning them to their resting position in a single, rapid movement.** In _The Like Switch_ , they argue that if someone doesn’t flash their eyebrows in greeting, we subconsciously perceive that person as someone to avoid.

Navarro (_The Dictionary of Body Language_) adds that we often flash our eyebrows when greeting friends and family. The movement happens in less than a second, signifying that we’re happy and excited to see the people we’re greeting.

##### Giving the Person Your Full Attention

In _The Fine Art of Small Talk_ , motivational speaker Debra Fine recommends acting as if there are no distractions in the room when you’re conversing with someone. **Face them openly and directly, and smile.** Nod, make eye contact, and stay focused on the speaker. If you have trouble maintaining eye contact, Fine suggests you look at the space between their eyes instead of directly at them; they won’t be able to tell the difference.

Schafer and Karlins (_The Like Switch_) emphasize that torso position says a lot about two people’s interest (or lack thereof) in each other. Generally, people with good rapport orient their torsos toward each other during a conversation. Additionally, the more people lean forward, the more interested they are. Therefore, if you wish to communicate your interest, make sure you’re positioning your body accordingly.

##### Matching Body Language

In _How to Talk to Anyone_ , Lowndes suggests imitating the other person’s gestures. **This gives the impression that you’re similar in nature and instantly puts them at ease.** For example, if they use their hands to make a point, use yours in the same way.

Schafer and Karlins affirm in _The Like Switch_ that when you have a strong connection with someone, you naturally match their body language during your interactions. For example, if a friend leans against a wall or takes a sip of their drink, you’ll repeat those actions unconsciously.

#### Embrace Confident Body Language

As we touched on earlier, Schafer and Karlins argue that confidence is a great way to draw in potential friends. The best way to project confidence is to embrace confident body language. In _Presence_ , Cuddy agrees: She states that **showing people the truest, most confident version of yourself enables you to gain their trust quickly**. This ability to connect with people is beneficial in countless scenarios, including meeting new friends.

Here are some body language cues you can use to communicate confidence and recognize confidence in others:

##### Moving Deliberately

In _The Charisma Myth_ , leadership expert Olivia Fox Cabane recommends moving slowly and deliberately. The fewer movements you make, the more confident, in control, and authoritative you’ll seem. Restless fidgeting makes you seem distracted and agitated.

##### Standing Tall

Cabane also states that standing tall will make you look and feel more confident. Additionally, Lowndes argues in _How to Talk to Anyone_ that **people interpret good posture as a welcoming signal** because it implies that you’re proud, you’re confident, and you have nothing to hide. They assume that you’re an accomplished person who deserves their attention.

In contrast, people interpret poor posture as unwelcoming. Trying to minimize your physical presence by slumping implies that you’re insecure or ashamed and don’t want to be approached.

##### Opening Up the Shoulders

According to Navarro in _The Dictionary of Body Language_ , a strong signal of confidence is extending the shoulders to be wide and open. You might observe this in people with authority and power, such as business executives. This pose contrasts with the looser, more inward posture of someone less confident.

#### Cues That Signal “Stay Away”

Some body language cues signal that other people should stay away. They may register as unfriendliness, discomfort, or lack of confidence. **Take note if you display any of these cues unconsciously—this could create barriers between you and potential friends.** Likewise, if you notice these cues in other people, it may be time to back off. They might not be open to forming a relationship with you.

##### Tension in Your Face

Schafer and Karlins (_The Like Switch_) assert that if you display a tight jaw, a furrowed brow, and narrowed eyes, you’re communicating threatening messages. Often, we’re just tense about the stressors of our daily lives, but potential friends can easily misinterpret that as unfriendliness. Navarro (_The Dictionary of Body Language_) also notes that tension in the jaw and narrowed eyes typically signal anger and irritation—something most people won’t want to deal with.

##### Crossing Your Arms

Schafer and Karlins state that this is a protective gesture that places a barrier between you and the other person. It signals anxiety and discomfort. Navarro states that people do this when they feel unsure or unsafe because folded arms cover the soft front torso, which contains many of the most important and vulnerable internal organs. Therefore, we instinctively protect this area.

##### Angling the Feet Away From Someone

Navarro (_The Dictionary of Body Language_) states that people often angle their feet away from someone they don’t like. In social situations, this is a reliable indicator of people’s true feelings, even if they’re smiling and being polite.
