## Exercise: Detect Conservative Political Slant in the News

Mayer explains that part of the Kochs’ tactics for legitimizing libertarian beliefs was to shift the political slant of the media to the right. In this exercise, you’ll try to notice both conservative and liberal bias in a news story presented in different publications.

* * *

Think of an article or news story you’ve read recently. Now try to find that same story in a different publication. Do you notice any differences between how the publications present the story? For example, do the authors portray certain political parties in a more favorable light than others? Note these differences below.

In this guide, we’ve talked about conservative ideas like governmental deregulation, lowering taxes for the rich, and self-reliance. Do any of these (or other) conservative themes appear in either of the stories you read or watched? Note instances below.

Now, imagine you’re editing these articles: How would you amend them to be more neutral? Are there details you would add or leave out that create bias? Is there phrasing that slants conservative or liberal? Jot down your edits below.
