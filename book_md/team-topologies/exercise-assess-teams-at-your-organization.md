## Exercise: Assess Teams at Your Organization

Evaluate whether teams at your workplace are set up for success or failure.

* * *

If you’re part of a team or manage a team at your workplace, reflect on your team’s most recently completed project. Was the project successful and completed on deadline, or was it difficult, and completed late, if at all? Consider Skelton and Pais’s recommendations for team size, longevity, and workload, and write down the reasons you think your team succeeded or failed, including anything you’d do differently next time.

Which of the four team types does your team most closely resemble? Write down ways that your team is in alignment with Skelton and Pais’s recommendations for that type of team, as well as ways your team differs from the ideal team. Consider how these similarities and differences shape your team’s output, and list any changes you could make to shift the team more firmly into one of the four types.

Consider a recent interaction between your team and another team, and write down which of the three modes of interaction it most closely aligns with. Write down how the team either succeeds or fails to follow Skelton and Pais’s models for interaction. List any changes you could make to encourage the team to interact with other teams more effectively.
