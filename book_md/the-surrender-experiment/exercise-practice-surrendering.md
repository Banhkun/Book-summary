## Exercise: Practice Surrendering

Singer says the first step in practicing surrender is to set aside your personal preferences, which can be challenging when making decisions. Think through your own process of decision-making and consider whether it would be beneficial to set your preferences aside in the future.

* * *

Describe a recent experience when someone asked you to do something and you said no. Why did you decide to say no instead of yes?

List all of the personal preferences that went into your decision to say no. For example, what did you want or not want to do, or what did you think you would like or not like about doing that thing?

What might you have done differently if you discarded those personal preferences? What do you think might have happened if you had said yes in this situation?
