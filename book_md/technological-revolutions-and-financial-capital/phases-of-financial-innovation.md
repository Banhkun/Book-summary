## Phases of Financial Innovation

Throughout the revolution, innovations in financial capital enable the diffusion of technology.

Carlota Perez classifies financial innovations along six types, then illustrates when innovations in each type occur.

**Type** | **Purpose** | **Examples**  
---|---|---  
**A** | Invest in new products or services  | Venture capital for radical innovations  Joint stocks for large investments   
**B** | Help growth or expansion  | Production expansion domestically and abroad (bonds)  Government funding (eg war, infrastructure investment)   
**C** | Modernize financial services themselves  | New service to clients (telegraph transfers, personal checking accounts, e-banking)  Incorporation of new technologies (communications, transport)   
**D** | Profit-taking and spreading risk  | Attract small investors (mutual funds, bonds, IPOs)  Facilitate risk taking (derivatives, hedge funds)   
**E** | Refinance obligations or mobilize assets  | Reschedule debts (Brady Bonds, swaps)  Buy active production assets (mergers, takeovers)  Acquire and mobilize rent-type assets (real estate, futures)   
**F** | Questionable innovations  | Legal loopholes (fiscal havens)  Making money from money, taking advantage of incomplete information (FX arbitrage, leads and lags)  Making money without money (pyramid schemes, insider trading)   
Phase  | Prevalent innovation  | Characteristics of finance   
---|---|---  
| A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  |   
Irruption  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | X  | Highest intensity of financial innovation   
Frenzy  |  |  |  | X  | X  | X  | Attract funds, speculate, inflate assets   
Synergy  | X  | X  | X  |  |  |  | Supportive innovations to accompany growth   
Maturity  |  | X  |  |  | X  | X  | Accompany diffusion of paradigm, escape regulatory control   
  
This table refers to when _innovation and invention_ happens - the application of the practices can last a long time afterward.

  * In Irruption, there is differentiation in financial capital: part supporting the new paradigm (types A-C), part idle capital desperately seeking profits in the old (types D-F).
  * In Frenzy, financial capital becomes entranced with itself, building a casino economy (types D-F).
  * In Synergy, it shifts to adaptive innovations to accompany the deployment of the paradigm (types A-C).
  * In Maturity, saturation and more idle money means funding of expansion of the prevailing paradigm (type B), consolidation of power (type E), and questionable propping up of profits in type F.
