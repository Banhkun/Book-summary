## The Role of Society in Technological Revolutions

**Society shapes technological revolutions by cycling between inertia and desire for growth.**

At first, society feels inertia. Each revolution is **initially received as a threat** to the established way of doing things in firms, institutions, and society - which have all optimized for the previous revolution. The new economy implies job losses, geographic displacement, and unaddressed regulatory challenges. The unfolding of the new revolution’s potential thus begins chaotically, causing a mismatch between the economy and socio-institutional systems.

  * For instance, the Suez Canal eliminated ships from the route to India and cut travel time from 3 to 1 month, obviating the network of cargo depots in England and threatening big trading companies.
  * Mass-produced automobiles displaced steam-powered trains and horse-drawn carriages, and all the industries associated with either (economies of towns at train stops, veterinarians for horses).



As the technological revolution spreads through society, frictions mount. Political pressure begins calling for action to propel the required institutional changes to accommodate the new revolution. Often the most persuasive event to induce changes in regulation is the financial collapse of the bubble of “irrational exuberance.” This spurs adaptations in government, education, and social behaviors, until the revolution becomes the “new common sense.” Only when the revolution has this proper context in society can the “golden age” of growth proceed.

**As the revolution becomes the new prevailing paradigm, it favors compatible innovations and it _excludes_ incompatible innovations.** An innovation that fits in the natural trajectory of the prevailing paradigm is readily accepted by society, allowing progress. In contrast, incompatible innovations may be rejected by investors or consumers, and are instead adapted in a minor way to the current paradigm, even though they may very well be the focal point of the next technological revolution.

As the revolution matures, technological innovation shows decreasing returns and markets become saturated. Growth and profits are threatened. Social unrest reoccurs when the growth that was promised earlier in the revolution does not materialize. This is the point of greatest reception to radical innovations, and firms experiment with new technologies to revitalize themselves. Promising innovations attract idle capital, and the big-bang event kicks off a flywheel effect of capital and labor that leads to the next revolution cycle.

Thus, Carlota Perez maintains that society shapes innovation to occur in these predictable revolutionary cycles, providing both a propelling and dampening force at different phases.

**When there is inertia in one sphere of change, unrest in another exercises enough pressure to induce changes.** When there is inertia in technology, unrest in the financial sphere (from declining profits) and social sphere (from wealth inequality) prompts looking for radical technology innovations. Likewise, unrest in technology forces past the inertia in the social sphere.
