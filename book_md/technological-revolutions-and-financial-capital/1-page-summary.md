## 1-Page Summary

A technological revolution is a cluster of new technologies, products, and industries causing an upheaval in the economy and propelling a long-term surge in development.

The five technological revolutions of the past 2 centuries, with their approximate start date:

  * Industrial revolution in 1771
  * Steam and railways in 1829
  * Steel, electricity, and heavy engineering in 1875
  * Automobile and mass production in 1908
  * Information and telecommunications in 1971



Progress does not happen linearly and constantly. Instead,**technological revolutions happen in predictable cycles** , spanning ~50 years:

  * Installation
    * A new promising technology sees explosive growth as venture capitalists, seeking high profits, invest in new activities and firms.
    * Investments reach irrational exuberance level. Many early expectations will be disappointed, leading to collapse of bubbles created by financial speculation.
    * However, this boom installs the infrastructure that paves the way for...
  * Deployment
    * **A robust growth occurs, built on the infrastructure of installation.** The technology becomes widely adopted across the economy and leads to fundamental growth in a “new economy.”
    * In maturity, the technology sees diminishing returns. The main companies have merged and become oligopolies, reducing the ferocity of competition and a common interest in comfortable profit margins. Arthritis sets in for the new incumbents .
    * Attention shifts to the next generation of radical innovations, thus continuing the cycle

Much is said about the evils of finance in propping up bubbles and profiting from technology. Instead,**financial capital is crucial in the installation and deployment of new technology.**

  * When the previous paradigm matures, it seeks radical innovations for growth.
  * When the new technological revolution appears, financial capital draws attention to it through (inflated) profits.
  * When the bubble bursts, it facilitates production capital in diffusing the new revolution.



Society shapes the development of the revolution, through initial inertia from the previous revolution, then mass acceptance and diffusion of the new revolution.

  * To make way for the new revolution, institutional creative destruction will take place, dismantling the old framework and installing the new. This means changes in regulation, politics, and ideology.



Understanding this framework can help you counter erroneous common wisdom at different phases.

  * During Frenzy, the common wisdom is that growth cannot stop and good times are here, leading to irrational exuberance. Yet a correction will likely occur.
  * During Deployment, the recession may cause pessimism regarding the full potential of the revolution. In reality, markets may be much larger, and costs lower, than anyone predicted. Thus you may benefit by envisioning the full potential of each revolution.
  * One cannot extrapolate any current period as the “new permanent” or the final crisis of capitalism.
