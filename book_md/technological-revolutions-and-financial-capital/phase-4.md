## Phase 4: Maturity

Finally, the technological revolution begins to deplete its possibilities. Refer to Phase 0 above. This is the twilight of the golden age, “though it shines with false splendor.”

**Core industries experience market saturation and decreasing returns.**

  * To increase market share, the dominant firms concentrate through mergers and acquisitions, turning into oligopolies.
  * Activities are migrated to less-saturated markets abroad, redeploying the prevailing paradigm. However, this exhausts relatively quickly because the knowledge gained in earlier phases accelerates the deployment in new markets.



Widespread market and production experience shorten the life cycles of later products because of very rapid learning and saturation curves.

Those who reaped the benefits of the golden age continue to believe in the virtues of the system. They insist on continuous progress of the current paradigm, in a complacent blindness.

But promises of constant progress and social progress are not met, leading to labor and political unrest. The young and nonconformists stage rebellions and romantic protests.

**Firms amass money without profitable investment outlets, creating idle capital.**

Financial capital begins separating from production capital again, seeking more profitable or exciting things.

  * It supports investment in marginalized sectors and the periphery of the revolution.
  * Bad loans are granted to weaker creditors, particularly internationally.
  * Unorthodox practices like tax avoidance reign.



**Radical innovations are demanded to propel further growth.** During the Synergy phase, innovations that disrupted the diffusing paradigm were rejected. Now, they are sought after by firms desperate for growth.
