## Break: Turning Point

The irrationally exuberant bubble bursts, causing a recession and social unrest. This is the trigger for regulatory and institutional change to adapt to the new revolution.

**Three tensions make the Frenzy impossible to sustain indefinitely, bringing on the recession:**

  * Real wealth cannot be produced at the same speed as paper capital gains.
  * Premature saturation: concentration of the new wealth in a small fraction of the population limits market size and prevents the economies of scale that enables further growth.
    * (Possible alleviations of premature saturation: export markets, government spending for wars, and income redistribution.)
  * Social unrest: increasing wealth inequality causes anger and violence to erupt.



### Financial Capital is Humbled

Paper values are brought back in line with real values.

Humbled by the evaporation of paper gains and pressured by the victims of semi-fraudulent practices, financial capital is more willing to accept regulatory safeguards.

  * Accountancy and disclosure legislation are common regulations.
  * Firms can decide to self-regulate to avoid government supervision.



**The significant failure of the bubble bursting is necessary for a regulatory change.** Without these seismic shifts, financial capital would never abide by regulation.

**The power shifts from financial capital to production capital.**

  * It is production capital that is mainly interested in fulfilling the technological trajectory, to profit from the investment already made. Thus its incentives are aligned with diffusion of technology and mass expansion of demand.
  * In contrast, financial capital tends to prefer short-lived capital gains rather than long-term, dividend-producing capacity.
  * “Securities analysts believe that companies make money. Companies make shoes!” - Peter Drucker



In Frenzy, financial capital separated from production capital and took on a life of its own. In the Turning Point, financial capital and production capital recouple. This recoupling is necessary for deployment and ushering in a golden age of more harmonious growth. Prior to this, too much tension exists to fully reap the fruits of the new growth potential.

### The Tone Shifts to Long-Term Growth and Diffusion

Institutions are set up to encourage diffusion of the new paradigm.

  * In the second revolution of steam power and railways, legal frameworks allowed for safe and reliable participation in capital markets to fund large investments like railways.
  * In the fourth revolution of mass production, salaries, welfare, and unemployment enabled stability in consumer purchasing of mass-produced goods. Institutions for international finance (IMF, World Bank) and protective agencies (FDIC, SEC) were created.



The social values pendulum swings from individualism in Frenzy to collective well-being in Deployment.

  * The state should promote income distribution, social safety nets, and restore real values over paper ones.



Institutional choices will shape the next two phases. With one set of choices, social cohesiveness, social safety nets, and income redistribution can happen - with another set of choices, selfish prosperity will continue.
