## Phase 0: Maturity of the Last Revolution

It helps to start from the end of the previous revolution, which offers the gestational environment for new innovation.

At the dawn of the new revolution, the previous revolution has played out.

  * Society has accepted the new common sense of the prevailing paradigm.
  * Firms and society have become conducive to the unfolding of any opportunity compatible with the paradigm (going from n â†’ n+1)
  * Socially, these conditions cause inertia and become **exclusionary** for innovations that are incompatible with the existing framework.



However, the previous revolution approaches the exhaustion of profitable opportunities.

  * Core industries encounter market saturation and decreasing returns. Productivity and growth are threatened. 
  * Firms that have stagnated become receptive to radical innovations.
  * An environment with decreasing returns brings **idle capital** looking for profitable uses.
