## Exercise: Consider Your End-of-Life Care

End-of-life care involves making numerous decisions. As we’ve seen, there’s value in considering what you might want in your end-of-life care while you have time to make those decisions. In this exercise, you’ll have the opportunity to begin thinking about three particular aspects of end-of-life care: where you’d prefer to die, what life-prolonging measures you’ll accept, and how your body should be handled after death. These are sensitive topics, but considering them well in advance is an invaluable exercise.

In the space below, write your thoughts about _where_ you’d prefer to spend your last days. Do you want to be at home? Would you rather be in a hospital? Somewhere else?

Now, take a moment to consider what life-prolonging measures you’ll be willing to take. Do you want life support with a breathing machine? Aggressive medical treatments for as long as possible? Would you prefer only pain medications? Or no interventions at all?

Finally, consider how you want your body handled after death. Would you like an in-ground burial in a casket? An above-ground burial in a mausoleum? Do you prefer a no-casket burial or cremation? Burial options will vary by location and regional regulations.
