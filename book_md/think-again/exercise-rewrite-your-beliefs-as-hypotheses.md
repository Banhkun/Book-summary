## Exercise: Rewrite Your Beliefs as Hypotheses

Grant says that to have an open mind, you must treat your opinions and beliefs not as sources of your identity but as hypotheses to be examined. In this exercise, we will explore some of your opinions and beliefs, reframe them as questions or hypotheses, and see how this changes your perspective.

* * *

Write down one of your beliefs or opinions. (For example, “I need to be financially successful to have a meaningful life,” or, “My political party is superior.”)

Now reframe this belief or opinion as a hypothesis to be tested rather than a statement of fact. To do this, rewrite your beliefs and opinions as questions. (For example: Is financial success the only thing that defines a meaningful life? What makes one political party superior to another?)

Has exploring these questions caused you to rethink some of your beliefs and opinions? Explain your answer.

How does reframing your beliefs and opinions as questions change your perspective?
