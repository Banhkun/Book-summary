## Exercise: Brainstorm a Rapid-Growth Company

Now that you understand Ismail’s ideas about rapid-growth companies and how they can outperform traditional business models, start brainstorming how you might create a rapid-growth company of your own.

* * *

What kind of rapid-growth company would you like to create? (Think about which industry you’d like to break into and how information technology could help you do so.)

What could be your company’s bold, transformative mission statement? (Think of something that would excite and inspire fans of your company.)

What kind of data or information would you need to run this business, and how would you use that information? Also, consider how you might _collect_ that information.

How might you crowdsource some elements of your business to reduce your personal risk? (Think about who you could bring in to provide the resources you need and how you’d reach those people.)
