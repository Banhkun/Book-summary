## Exercise: Identifying Your Tendency

Sometimes who we think we are or who weâ€™d like to be differs from who we actually are. Use this exercise to compare your expectations, record your results, and unveil your biases.

* * *

What tendency did you get? Record your result from the quiz here. Did you already have a guess, or did your answer surprise you?

Before reading the in-depth summary of each tendency, how did you feel upon getting your results? You might have felt nonplussed because you already knew this about yourself, or shocked and appalled at the results you received. Write down why you felt the way you did.
