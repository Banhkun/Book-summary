## Exercise: Pinpointing the Pairs

Watching two people interact varies drastically based on their tendencies, but every pairing has its high points and its low points. Use this exercise to think about how they interact.

* * *

Most of us have some important pair of people in our lives: parents, grandparents, team members, coupled friends, and so on. Pick one pair, write down who it is, and what you think each person’s tendency is. List 1 example for each person that helped you identify their type.

Does the pairing work for them, or do they clash? Based on what you’ve read, why do you think it flows or falters?

If you could give the pair one small piece of advice to improve their partnership, what would it be?
