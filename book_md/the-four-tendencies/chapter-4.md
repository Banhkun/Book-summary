## Chapter 4: Obligers

### Overview

**Obligers readily respond to external expectations, but not internal expectations.** They meet deadlines and follow through for bosses, colleagues, spouses, and so on -- but don’t follow through on things they want to do for themselves. **If there are no external expectations, Obligers almost always fail to complete the task, no matter how important it is to them.** Obligers have to learn how to create outside accountability that works for them.

Obligers make up the largest tendency, for both men and women. Furthermore, **Obligers are most likely to wish they were a different tendency.** Rubin suggests this might be because the other tendencies cause others frustration but are generally satisfied with themselves, whereas Obligers cause themselves frustration: they beat themselves up about meeting others’ expectations but not their own.

**Obligers often frequently misdiagnose their issues, as well** : because they can meet external expectations easily, they assume that laziness or self-sacrifice causes them not to meet their own internal expectations. And it doesn’t help that other tendencies, who have an easier time doing what they want to do and resisting the expectations of others, tend to judge Obligers for their incapability to meet internal expectations.

**Obligers have the most to gain from learning about their tendency and using it to their advantage.** Once they can figure out how to create external accountability that works for them, they will find it much easier to start to do things for themselves and build a happier life.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Obligers

#### Strengths of Obligers

Obligers are the “rock of the world” -- **everyone can depend on them.** They’re most likely to contribute to home and work, aiming to keep their spouses, children, colleagues, and bosses happy and fulfilled. They make great leaders, team members, family, and friends because of their reliability and dedication to others. Out of all the tendencies, they usually get along with other tendencies the best.

When external expectations align with their internal expectations, they get to live their best lives.

They do well in almost any career, as long as it has external expectations, and do particularly well in some careers that require employees to continually go above and beyond, such as corporate law, social work, medicine, tech startups, and wealth management.

Some other positive ways to describe Obligers:

  * **Good bosses and leaders**
  * **Responsible**
  * **Meet others’ expectations**
  * **Go the extra mile**
  * **Do well with external accountability**



#### Weaknesses of Obligers

Obligers simply cannot meet internal expectations, for the most part. **They need external accountability to get anything done, and if they don’t have any, they have to organize it for themselves.** Similarly, Obligers have a hard time self-motivating, and often need coaches or groups to help them accomplish things for themselves.

  * (Shortform example: An Obliger makes a great employee because when a boss asks them to do something, they have no problem doing it on time and to the best of their standards. But if that same Obliger has an internal expectation to get in shape, they’ll never make it to the gym without someone or something else they’re beholden to. In fact, this Obliger might never make it to the gym precisely _because_ they do everything their boss asks right away: “I can disappoint myself by not going to the gym, fine -- but I can’t disappoint my boss!”)



**Because Obligers consistently do what others ask of them, others often take advantage of this and ask _more_ from Obligers than other people -- which can create resentment in Obligers while they still attempt to fulfill the expectations. **

This is the difference between Upholders and Obligers: Upholders strike a balance between meeting their own internal expectations and meeting others’ external expectations. Upholders do a better job of taking care of themselves, and doing things they want to do, whereas Obligers can start to feel like the _only_ people they’re taking care of are other people.

Sometimes Obligers view their close friends and family members as extensions of themselves, and this can get them in trouble in terms of internal and external expectations. If a husband views his wife as part of his inner self, she won’t be able to ask him to do anything as an external source with expectations. And context can change this, too: a mother puts her kids before herself as external sources, but puts work before her kids if push comes to shove.

  * This can cause particular difficulty in marriage, when one spouse’s external expectations get turned into internal expectations for their Obliger spouse, and thus get neglected.



Because Obligers expend so much energy fulfilling others’ expectations, they get easily burnt out. **If they get too burnt out or the expectations are too high, Obligers can go into _Obliger-Rebellion_ mode, where they suddenly, without warning, refuse to meet any expectations: everything’s fine until it absolutely isn’t.**

  * This can happen in any realm, work, friendship, even marriage. Rubin offers an example of a person who woke up one morning and knew she couldn’t continue to hold up her marriage of 18 years, and announced, without warning, that she wanted a divorce. She said there was “no way back” after deciding.
  * We’ll talk about how to protect against Obliger-Rebellion in The Obliger’s Challenge.



Obligers who start their own business will do well with tasks like meeting deadlines and getting work done for clients, but they’ll have trouble networking or building their business, and can waste time on overly demanding clients.

Other negative ways to describe Obligers:

  * **Bad at imposing limits or saying no**
  * **Exploitable**
  * **Resentful**
  * **Overworked and burnt out**
  * **Can fall into Obliger-Rebellion**



### Variations on the Obliger

Obligers vary tremendously in _how_ they respond to external expectations. For example, high-energy Obligers meet more expectations than low-energy Obligers. According to Rubin’s diagram, the Obliger can tip Upholder or Rebel.

Some obligers attach so easily to external expectations that they ultimately _project_ expectations coming from other people and meet those. (These Obligers most likely tip Upholder.)

  * For example, an Obliger might assume that their partner expects them to wash the dishes, even if the partner has never said or suggested anything of the kind. Because the Obliger assumes this, they always wash the dishes and feel pressure to do so, even if no one has concretely set that expectation for them.



Other Obligers don’t worry about external expectations unless there are consequences or penalties attached -- they’ll do something more to avoid punishment than to fulfill expectations. (These Obligers most likely tip Rebel.)

#### Upholder Tip

Obligers who tip Upholder have a **clearer sense of their own desires and more ability to say no to things they don’t want to do.** Though they still have difficulty meeting their own internal expectations, they meet them more often and with less difficulty.

#### Rebel Tip

Obligers who tip Rebel **dislike external expectations _but still meet them_ , and get resentful about others having expectations for them. **They often feel pushed around and respond negatively to anything that feels like coercion. They don’t like routines, schedules, or structure, and they’re more quick to experience burnout and Obliger-Rebellion.

### The Obliger’s Challenge: Creating External Expectations and Avoiding Obliger-Rebellion

Obligers can fulfill external expectations, but fail to fulfill their own internal expectations, and this imbalance causes resentment. However, **Obligers can use their dependence on external expectations to motivate them to fulfill their internal expectations.**

Some Obligers respond well to light accountability: automated email reminders, highlighted unfinished to-dos, or technology like FitBits might be enough for them.

Other Obligers need other people to feel accountable to, and it can’t feel like the other people are doing a favor for the Obligers -- it has to really feel like someone expects them to do something. They can try a few different things:

  * Have someone set up supervision, fees, deadlines, or consequences.
  * Find accountability partners in the form of classmates, coaches, or trainers.
  * Go to accountability groups such as Weight Watchers or Alcoholics Anonymous, or digital groups.
  * Pair internal expectations with benefits to other people. 
    * For example, one husband and wife team decided that the wife could only exercise after her Obliger husband did -- this gave the husband an external reason to exercise. 
    * Obliger parents can also use the desire to be good role models for their children to serve as external expectations.
  * Use other external expectations to push you say no to certain things: saying no to this thing allows you to say yes to another thing, or saying no to this allows someone else the opportunity to do it.



#### Understanding and Protecting Against Obliger-Rebellion

As we said, **Obligers sometimes feel exploited -- but that’s because they are.** Think about it: if you know you needed something done, who would you ask -- the person who routinely says no, or the person who always agrees to do something?

Obligers can feel resentful because of the amount of expectations people put on them, and underappreciated because it seems like people just expect them to do what they ask. Then, because Obligers have difficulty delegating or saying no, they get burnt out. They don’t have self-protection systems: Obligers don’t protest against expectations they know are unfair until Obliger-Rebellion hits them, and that’s when they’ll suddenly quit without warning.

Because**Obligers don’t think they should have to protest**. Because they feel so much pressure to meet external expectations, they assume that others should realize the burden of external expectations. But the reality is no other tendency feels as much pressure to meet external expectations, so they don’t understand what Obligers go through.

**Expectations that can trigger Obliger-Rebellion are:**

  * Exploitative
  * Unrealistically ambitious
  * Unfair because others aren’t pulling their own weight
  * Shaming, guilting, embarrassing, nagging, or disapproving
  * Connected to distasteful or ungratifying tasks (Rubin cites cold-calling)
  * Don’t come with personal credit for the Obliger
  * Asked for by hard-to-please people or people who don’t matter



Some Obligers can channel their Obliger-Rebellion into insignificant acts -- showing up a little late, apparently, is a common form of Obliger-Rebellion. But some Obligers completely self-sabotage in Obliger-Rebellion.

Health is a major area Rubin noticed Obligers doing this. She asserts it’s because society and individuals have a lot of _external_ expectations surrounding health -- and a lot of the expectations go hand in hand with shame, guilt, or disapproval -- but the primary benefits to being healthy are _internal_. Obligers are less likely to take care of themselves and less likely to do the things they need to do to be healthy, because without external accountability it seems like the only person who will really suffer if they _don’t_ take care of themselves _is_ themselves.

Though it might not be handled correctly, **Obliger-Rebellion is an Obliger attempting to protect themselves.** Families, friends, colleagues, even doctors can help Obligers avoid Obliger-Rebellion by setting up systems that encourage them to say no more often, helping them delegate tasks, pushing them to make time for themselves (“You took care of the kids while I was away on business, so I expect you to take tonight to yourself and I’ll take the kids out for a movie.”), and encouraging them to take breaks.

### Dealing with an Obliger

At work, Obligers make excellent colleagues, employees, and bosses, due to their unwavering responsibility to external expectations. But we know they struggle with internal expectations, so **if they request accountability, find a way to give it to them, because they need it.**

  * You might have to set limits on them to avoid Obliger-Rebellion, or take work away from them if you see them becoming overwhelmed. Stop others from exploiting them.



Obligers make great spouses, as they’ll always work to meet their partner’s expectations. If your spouse is an Obliger, try to be your spouse’s accountability partner to help them meet their internal expectations -- and if you can’t, help them figure out another way.

  * Spouses can be especially helpful in making sure Obligers set boundaries and take care of themselves, and can usually learn to anticipate Obliger-Rebellion and help them course-correct before it’s too late.



It’s especially important for parents to find helpful and encouraging ways to hold their Obliger children accountable, and parents must be watchful for burnout. Help your Obliger children identify their internal expectations and desires, and then help them set up external systems of accountability.

**For doctors, Obliger patients need check-ins where it’s understood that their doctor expects them to fulfill certain expectations, and you can help them get healthier by tying their health to other people** (“don’t you want to be around for your kids?”).

Be wary, in all three realms, of setting expectations for Obligers that are too high, or of accidentally setting expectations with offhand comments.
