## Conclusion

**Life is about taking action, and taking action requires us to analyze how we respond to both internal and external expectations.** Our tendencies shape our perspectives and experiences. They shape what language we respond to, and what circumstances and environments we thrive in. Once we better understand our own tendencies and the tendencies of and others, we can start to make situations work for _us_ , instead of trying to fit ourselves into situations that don’t work.

This information should be used to harness the strengths of your tendency and manage the weaknesses. As stated, no tendency is the happiest, no tendency is the most successful. **The happiest and most successful people are the ones who’ve learned to navigate the pros and cons of their tendency, and who use their tendencies to their benefit.** Rubin offers a quote from novelist John Gardner in this vein: “Every time you break the law, you pay, and every time you obey the law you pay.”
