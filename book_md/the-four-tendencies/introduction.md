## Introduction: The Four Tendencies

Life is full of expectations, ones we have for ourselves and ones other people have for us. How do you respond to expectations? Do you fulfill them, or resist them? When, and why? Gretchen Rubin has developed a simple yet powerful personality test based on expectations that can change the way you get things done.

### How Rubin Created the Four Tendencies

Gretchen Rubin is a writer interested in human nature and patterns in human behavior, what actions we take and why we take them. Over lunch one day, a friend of hers was complaining that she wanted to keep up her running habit, but she was finding it difficult to maintain. She used to be on the track team in high school, and had no problem running then. But now, as an adult, she couldn’t make herself go running.

Why did this happen? This conversation stuck in Rubin’s head, and the more Rubin thought about it, the more she begin to suspect that a bunch of habits people do or don’t have -- being able to run without a coach, or needing a trainer to get anything done at the gym; happily taking responsibility at work, or bucking under authority -- came down to a simple “bedrock distinction” that set people apart.

From this conversation, Rubin eventually designed a simple personality test based on one question: **how do you respond to expectations?** From people’s answers to questions around this subject, she devised the Four Tendencies.

### The Four Tendencies

**The Four Tendencies describe four different personality types based on response to expectations, both internal (the expectations you have for yourself) and external (the expectations other people have for you).** Expectations are things we act on, or not. An example of an internal expectation would be, “I want to be a famous writer!” or “I need to clean my room.” External expectations would be more like, “My boss really needs this report by Friday,” or “My mother wants me to dress more modestly.”

**There are 4 ways people meet expectations, and this determines their “tendency”:** there are Upholders, Questioners, Obligers, and Rebels. The way each tendency generally responds to internal and external expectations is:

  * **Upholders meet all expectations, internal and external.**
  * **Questioners meet internal expectations, but not external.**
  * **Obligers meet external expectations, but not internal.**
  * **Rebels resist all expectations.**



Of course, how each tendency responds to expectations affects what each tendency needs to take action:

  * **Upholders value self-reliance and performance:** tell them what needs to be done, and they’ll do it.
  * **Questioners value reason and purpose:** if they feel what needs to be done is justified, they’ll do it.
  * **Obligers value teamwork and duty:** hold them accountable for something, and they’ll do it.
  * **Rebels value freedom and choice:** let them choose what they want to do, and they’ll do it.



Rubin also compares each tendency to a traffic light color:

  * Red = Rebels: expectations bring them to a halt.
  * Yellow = Questioners: they’ll proceed, but with caution.
  * Green = Obligers: ask, and they’ll go, go, go.
  * Blue = Upholders (for no stated reason other than there being no other colors in a traffic light)



Another example in the form of the lightbulb joke:

  * Q: How do you get an Upholder to change a lightbulb? A: They’ve already changed it.
  * Q: How do you get a Questioner to change a lightbulb? A: Do you really need that lightbulb, anyway?
  * Q: How do you get an Obliger to change a lightbulb? A: Ask.
  * Q: How do you get a Rebel to change a lightbulb? A: Do it yourself. 



From Rubin’s research, the US population roughly breaks down like so:

  * 41% of people are Obligers
  * 24% are Questioners
  * 19% are Upholders
  * 17% are Rebels



There’ll be a quiz to determine your tendency at the end of this chapter, but you can start to think about what type you are with this example question: how do you feel about New Year’s resolutions?

  * If you enjoy making resolutions all the time, including New Year’s, you might be an Upholder.
  * If you make and keep resolutions but feel January 1 is an arbitrary date, you might be a Questioner.
  * If you don’t make resolutions because you always give them up, you might be an Obliger.
  * If you don’t make resolutions because you don’t believe in them, or if you only make them if there’s a challenge involved, you might be a Rebel.



### A Simple System for Complex People

A lot of people, when they see this breakdown, think, “Oh, well, I’m a Questioner and a Rebel, I don’t fit squarely into one of these tendencies,” or “What tendency I am changes depending on the day or who I’m around.” Rubin would disagree: **everyone in her experience falls squarely into one tendency**.

However, the Four Tendencies fall into a Venn diagram like so:

![fourtendencies-venn.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/fourtendencies-venn.png)

**Though everyone has a main tendency, each tendency has two “tips”** \-- someone can be an Upholder but with an Obliger tip, and so on. This does affect how you respond to expectations within your overarching tendency, but everyone still has an overarching tendency.

Remember, this is a simple system designed with one aspect of personality in mind. Other factors come into play and complicate the portrait of each tendency. Your specific, individual personality determines how you _express_ your tendency, and those things can be at odds. But your tendency is still your tendency, regardless of how you express it.

  * For example, you might question everything due to your intelligence, abilities, and personality -- but if you still readily respond to external expectations and not internal expectations, you’re an Obliger in this system _and in life_.



And, of course, **everyone has some part of all 4 tendencies in them**. Obligers will question things at times; Upholders will rebel at times. Everyone meets expectations when the consequences really matter to us or someone very important to us. Everyone questions certain expectations. Everyone prefers being asked to do something instead of ordered.

### What to Do With Tendencies

Once you find your tendency, it’s tempting to compare to the other tendencies and try to figure out whether you’d be better off as another one.

Rest assured --**there are no happier or more successful tendencies**.very tendency has strengths and weaknesses. **The happiest people are the ones who know their tendency, embrace it, and work with it to achieve the best results.** The most miserable people are the ones who can’t identify their own tendency, or think they can change their own or someone else’s.

#### Tendencies and Careers

Should your tendency determine your career? Not necessarily. Any tendency can thrive in most any career, if they recognize their strengths and weaknesses in that role and adapt accordingly. For instance, people might assume that Rebels would make the best artists -- but an Upholder might actually perform better, fulfilling their own expectations with their art, but becoming successful because they can navigate other people’s expectations for them.

And a tendency that sounds great on paper for one role might come with difficulties. An Upholder sounds like a responsible person to grow a new business, but they may buckle under the flexibility required and the lack of hard rules on what to do.

#### Understanding Your Own Tendency

Obligers and Rebels are most likely to want to change their tendency -- these are the most challenging tendencies to deal with, both for the people in them and the people in other groups.

But **you can’t change your tendency, and you don’t need to.** Knowing your tendency can change the way you move through work, family life, and relationships.Once you know what spurs you to action, you know how to take action and can focus on changing your circumstances instead of changing your tendency.

  * If you’re an Upholder, you might find yourself more aware of when you’re meeting expectations you don’t need to meet or following rules that don’t need to be followed. 
  * For Questioners, you’ll be able to explain to other people the nature of your questioning so they know not to take it personally. 
  * Obligers have the most to gain from learning about their tendency: once Obligers know they have to create external accountability, they can stop punishing themselves and start fulfilling internal expectations. 
  * And Rebels might discover fun ways to trick themselves into doing the things they know they have to do.



#### Knowing Other People’s Tendency

And the benefits extend beyond knowing your personal tendency: **knowing other people’s tendencies can help us be more tolerant, not take things personally, and have an easier time persuading others based on what works for them instead of what works for us.**

For example, a Rebel child might respond better to being asked, “Do you feel like playing piano?” which allows them to make their own decision based on what they want, whereas an Upholder child will gladly practice when told it’s time to practice.
