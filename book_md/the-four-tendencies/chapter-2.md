## Chapter 2: Upholders

Now, we’ll go into detail on each of the four tendencies, breaking them down into:

  * An overview.
  * Strengths and weaknesses.
  * Specific challenges or things to keep in mind.
  * The variations of each tendency based on the tips. 
  * How to deal with them effectively.



We’ll also help you identify who in your life fits into each tendency, and how you can better communicate with them. Finally, we’ll wrap up the summary with a look at how the tendencies generally interact with one another, and how best to speak to someone else’s tendency.

### Overview

**Upholders readily respond to both external and internal expectations.** They think expectations, in general, are important, and _enjoy_ fulfilling both their own and others’. They find it easy to take action and follow-through, and have no problem forming habits. They like schedules, routines, and rules. They dislike making mistakes or letting themselves or others down.

If their boss asks them to stay late to finish a project and they know it’s important, they’ll stay (fulfilling external expectations); but if their boss last-minute asks them to stay late to finish a project and the Upholder has a lecture that evening that they signed up for months ago and are excited about, they’ll most likely go to the lecture, and work on the project later (fulfilling internal expectations).

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Upholders

#### Strengths of Upholders

Upholders can rely on themselves, and others can rely on them. They’re independent and self-mastered: they meet deadlines, keep appointments, fulfill commitments, manage tasks.

Upholders follow rules, but break them for ethical reasons based on their own inner sense of justice. Expectations don’t make them feel pressured or trapped -- **Upholders feel free, creative, and productive when they have expectations placed on them.** They don’t need others to supervise or motivate them.

They rarely feel resentful about what they have to do, nor do they get burnt out easily -- this is because they can easily fulfill their internal expectations, so they don’t feel they’re just doing things for other people all the time. Upholders enjoy fulfilling expectations for others but won’t agree to do something they don’t want to and don’t need to do, which helps them avoid resentment. They balance doing what others need them to do with doing what they need to do for themselves, which prevents burnout.

Upholders can do well in the following careers: business owners, consultants, freelancers, or coaches -- anything where they’re in charge or have to do work on their own.

Some other positive ways to describe Upholders:

  * **Self-starters**
  * **Motivated**
  * **Conscientious**
  * **Reliable**
  * **Thorough**
  * **Stick to schedules**
  * **Want to understand and meet expectations**



#### Weaknesses of Upholders

**Upholders sometimes follow the rules even when it’s better not to.** Rubin (an Upholder herself) recalls waiting at a boat taxi stand that was clearly non-functioning because someone told her that’s the taxi stand she should wait at, when a taxi stand a few yards up the river was active. No matter how many boats she saw at the other stand, Rubin continued to wait at the defunct stand.

All the tendencies assume everyone else functions like they do, and Upholders are no exception. However, because Upholders are so capable, their assumption that everyone is as capable in the exact same ways sometimes gets them in trouble. **They can be disdainful, impatient, or rude when others don’t respond to expectations the same way they do.**

They also avoid holding others accountable because they don’t have any sympathy for people who can’t meet expectations. **They don’t like pressuring others because they don’t think they should have to** \-- they think everyone should be able to respond to expectations the way they do. Upholders have a lot to gain from learning about the other tendencies: they’ll save themselves a lot of annoyance by understanding how others function.

**They have trouble delegating tasks** because they get disappointed with other people’s results. Therefore, they’d rather just do the tasks themselves, which can cause them to take on more workload than really necessary.

**Upholders aren’t very adaptable and don’t deal well with changes or last-minute adjustments.** They keep their routines and like set schedules, and believe that if something last-minute comes up, it’s because someone else didn’t plan well enough. Last-minute changes interfere with Upholders because they either create new external expectations to add to their list, or they conflict with existing external or internal expectations that the Upholder has already committed to.

Upholders can get defensive if someone, like a Questioner, challenges why they do things. They do things because people expect them to, or because they expect themselves to. This is enough for an Upholder to take action.

Upholders will find it challenging to work in aggressive or overly creative fields, environments with continuously changing circumstances, or environments where rule-breaking is a positive trait.

  * Law school might seem attractive to Upholders because it’s a busy environment that requires excellent self-mastery. But if they get hired at a firm that aggressively challenges tax laws, the Upholder may struggle with justifying why the tax laws should be challenged.
  * (Shortform example: Upholders may also struggle in creative or volatile fields like marketing, where creatives need to be able to find new ways of campaigning, and projects can fall through for no reason at all. This uncertainty and lack of routine can be difficult for an Upholder)



Some other negative ways to describe Upholders:

  * **Rigid**
  * **Struggle to adapt**
  * **Defensive**
  * **Uptight and humorless**
  * **Impatient with others**
  * **Demanding**
  * **Too by-the-book**



### Variations on the Upholder

The Upholder can tip Questioner (both meet inner expectations) or Obliger (both meet outer expectations).

#### Questioner Tip

Upholders with a Questioner tip don’t feel the need to justify themselves or their actions -- **internal expectations are important to them**. They tend to put more emphasis on internal expectations, meaning they’ll be more likely to fulfill what they want to do first, then what others need them to do.

These Upholders are more likely to question internal and external expectations to make sure they’re logical and justified. For example, an Upholder with a Questioner tip might have an easier time than Rubin with the boat taxi stands: once a Questioner tip realized the other stand was active, they’d have been more likely to change course, do the more logical thing, and go to the other stand, regardless of what someone told them.

They’re also more likely to reject social expectations, as these often don’t stem from efficiency or logic and might sometimes contradict their personal ethics.

#### Obliger Tip

Upholders with an Obliger tip will still meet internal expectations, but **external expectations carry more weight with them.** Upholders with an Obliger tip will still support themselves first -- but they’ll do it _to be able to support others_ more efficiently. They feel more pressure to meet external expectations and might get a little less enjoyment out of it.

Because of this, **they can sometimes have difficulty setting limits and boundaries, and may get burnt out meeting others’ expectations** , which could cause them to snap suddenly and refuse to meet external expectations (Shortform note: More on this phenomenon in the chapter on Obligers).

### The Upholder’s Challenge: Balancing Self-Preservation and “Tightening”

#### Self-Preservation

**Upholders are good self-preservationists** , for the most part. They take care of themselves and, because internal expectations are important to them, do the things they find enjoyable. They make time for both work and play.

Fulfilling their internal expectations protects them from experiencing resentment or burnout with external expectations. Upholders enjoy fulfilling expectations for others but won’t agree to do something they don’t want to and don’t need to do, which helps them avoid resentment. They balance doing what others need them to do with doing what they need to do for themselves, which prevents burnout. They want other people to take care of themselves the same way; in fact, they often _expect_ others to take care of themselves the same way.

In fact, **they’ll generally ignore others’ expectations if they’re in conflict with their own.**

  * Rubin cites a personal anecdote of a friend who had everyone over for dinner. At a certain point in the evening, he stood up, announced he was tired and wanted to go to bed, and kicked everyone out. Some people were shocked or offended; Rubin’s an Upholder herself, so she understood perfectly.



**Their self-preservation means they generally have good habits.** Habits are about mastering yourself, and as we know, Upholders have high levels of self-mastery. It’s generally _letting themselves off the hook_ that makes them feel bad -- they feel best when they’re fulfilling expectations.

#### Tightening

However, where other people can start off strong with a good habit and then fall off the wagon, Upholders sometimes do the opposite. **They’ll start a good habit and slowly, over time, become more and more rigid about the habit and less willing to give it up.** Rubin calls this _tightening_.

This can even happen with habits that started out as good ones but **no longer serve a purpose** , and can start to feel at odds with an Upholder’s internal expectations.

  * (Shortform example: An Upholder parent might decide to exercise every day to get back in shape. Then, once they’re in the shape they set out to be, they find themselves _still working out every day_. Even if they realize working out every day means they get to spend less time with their kids, they might not be able to reduce the days they work out.)



**Once Upholders become aware of this tendency to tighten, they can keep an eye out for warning signs:**

  * Meeting an expectation internal or external but repeatedly questioning whether the expectation deserves to be met.
  * Allowing habits to become so rigid that any variation or concession is out of the question and causes uneasiness.
  * Meeting external expectations with rigidity that feel at odds with an internal expectation.



To combat tightening, **Upholders can make sure they know what they value about the habit and how the habit aligns with their internal expectations.** This will help make sure their “productive” habits are also _healthy_ habits.

### Dealing with an Upholder

At work, upholders make great colleagues and bosses because they believe expectations are important. However, **occasionally an Upholder might need help prioritizing tasks and making priorities clear** \-- since all expectations are important to them, they might not get to the right things first.

If an Upholder makes a mistake, they’ll be upset. “No one noticed” or “everyone makes mistakes” will not make them feel better. Remind them that they tried their hardest and that’s all anyone can do.

As spouses or children, Upholders are responsible, reliable, and invested in meeting expectations. However, **avoid accidentally setting unnecessary expectations** for them -- an offhand comment like, “You’d make a great coach/soccer player!” might wedge its way in their brain whether you were serious about it or not, and you might suddenly find yourself accommodating a very rigorous training schedule for an Upholder who’s just trying to fulfill expectations.

**Upholders also occasionally need help _not_ meeting expectations.** When arguing with them, play to their values: acknowledge the rules or expectations they’re responding to, and make another priority more important than following that rule or meeting that expectation.

  * For example, an Upholder left to their own devices might work all weekend instead of spend time with the relatives who are visiting. Acknowledge that they’re expected to do their work, but that maybe this weekend it’s more important to spend time with family and load up on work early next week instead.



Remind them of their internal expectations and values, or help them clarify what those are.

  * For example, Rubin, an Upholder, first went to law school because she thought it would prepare her for many different careers, and she did very well. But during her clerkship, she realized she really wanted to be a writer. Once she had this realization, she had little trouble switching her career completely and becoming a successful writer because she was fulfilling her internal expectations -- but **it took her so long to realize** what she wanted to do because she was fixated on fulfilling the expectations in front of her.



Remember that Upholders work well with external expectations, so the other tendencies need to remind Upholders that:

  * Questioners __ will do something if you give them good reason.
  * Obligers will do something if you give them external accountability.
  * Rebels will do something if you give them freedom and choice.
