## Exercise: Practice Self-Compassion

Schwartz argues that all of our parts are well-meaning and want the best for us, but they can get stuck in roles that are damaging or counterproductive. Getting to know our parts and understanding their intentions is a key part of unburdening parts of their emotional weight and giving them the opportunity to step into new roles.

* * *

Think about a time when you felt overwhelmed by an emotion. Now consider what part might have blended with your Self in that moment. Was it an exile or protector? How can you tell?

What positive intention did that part have for you? How did it attempt to carry out that intention? (For example, if you felt overwhelmed by fear, a part may have been trying to protect you by stopping you from doing something that might hurt you.)

Brainstorm one question that you could ask that part to better understand its purpose in your Internal Family System.
