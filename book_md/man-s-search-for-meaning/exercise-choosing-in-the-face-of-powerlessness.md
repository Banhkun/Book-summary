## Exercise: Choosing in the Face of Powerlessness

Discover choices you can make in a situation that feels like it’s out of your control.

* * *

Think of a situation in your life where you felt powerless, like there weren’t any choices you could make. Briefly summarize the situation, and write about how the powerlessness made you feel.

Usually, there _are_ concrete choices available to us - we just might not like them. In retrospect, were there any choices available to you, even extreme ones? What made it hard to see those choices, or to go through with them?

Are you going through a difficult time in your life? If so, could you draw on inner lives, future goals, or freedom to choose to get you through it? Describe how it might help.
