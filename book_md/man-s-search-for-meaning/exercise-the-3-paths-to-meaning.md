## Exercise: The 3 Paths to Meaning

Logotherapy lays out 3 paths that can help you discover meaning in your life. Instead of treating them as hypothetical paths, let’s examine them as concrete questions about where you find meaning.

* * *

List 3 achievements, accomplishments, things you created, or deeds you’ve done in your life that you’re proud of. Write down why you’re proud to have done those things, and why you believe them to be meaningful.

List 2 people or things in your life you love deeply. Would you be willing to make a large sacrifice for those 2 things? Why or why not?

Write about 1 situation in your life that caused or causes you suffering. Were you able to find meaning in that suffering? If so, what was it? If not, look back at your previous responses--can you relate your suffering to a purpose that connects with one of those answers?
