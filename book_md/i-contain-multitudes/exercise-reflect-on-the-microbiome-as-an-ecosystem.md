## Exercise: Reflect on the Microbiome as an Ecosystem

Yong often uses the analogy of an ecosystem to describe the complex network of relationships between microbes and animals. They occupy every part of us, and in combination with our genes and lifestyle choices, impact our physical and mental well-being.

* * *

This idea suggests that there are ecosystems on the microscopic scale, as well as at larger scales, like in a forest, or even zooming out to the planet as a whole. How does your understanding of the relationship between microbes and animals change your perspective on the ways that _all_ living beings are connected?

Yong also suggests that microbes both _shape_ our individuality, because our microbiomes vary based on many factors (genetics, environment, what we eat), and _undermine_ our concept of individuality because our bodies contain unfathomable quantities of microbes. Where do you think of yourself on the spectrum of “individual” to “ecosystem,” and why?

Yong argues that like other ecosystems, our microbial ecosystem benefits from diversity. What are ways that you could interact with more beneficial microbes to increase your microbiome’s diversity? Given the Covid-19 pandemic and other potential risks of exposing yourself to microbes, which of these activities has a reasonable level of risk for you personally? (For example, spending more time outdoors or eating new foods might have a lower risk than spending time with lots of new people.)
