## Exercise: Show Yourself Compassion

Neff says that many people have difficulty showing themselves compassion and say terrible things to themselves that they’d never dream of saying to anyone else. Let’s explore how you might avoid this in the future.

* * *

Think of a time recently when you were critical of yourself. What’s one of the worst things you said to yourself in that moment?

How did you feel in that moment?

What could you say to show yourself kindness instead? Say this to yourself now as if you were comforting a close friend, then write it below.

How did you feel after being kind to yourself, compared with when you were critical of yourself?

In the future, when you’re critical of yourself, what can you do to show yourself greater compassion?
