## Exercise: Identify Your Purpose

Achieving your unique purpose increases happiness and fulfillment. To identify yours, consider the five components of purpose: ideals, enthusiasm, proficiency, positive effect, and financial stability.

* * *

First, identify your ideals. What traits do you want other people to see in you? What kind of behavior and traits make you feel good about yourself? (For example, your ideals are helping others, honesty, and courage.)

Next, describe what you’re enthusiastic about. What excites and interests you? What do you love doing outside of your responsibilities? (For example, you’re enthusiastic about entertaining people.)

Now, note down what you’re proficient in and how you can use those skills to make a positive effect. What skills are you most proud of and confident in using? How can you use those skills to fill a need in the world? (For example, your skills include singing and dancing. You can use these skills to raise money for charities by putting on shows and donating the profit from tickets.)

Next, consider how you can stay financially stable. What are your financial responsibilities? How do you currently fulfill them? What are some other ways you can fulfill them? (For example, your financial responsibilities are room, board, venues, and equipment for shows. You fulfill these responsibilities by working as a receptionist. You could fulfill them through ticket sales, a record deal, or a sponsor.)

Finally, identify a path in life that fulfills each component of purpose. If you can’t incorporate all of them, consider what changes you could make to add the missing components. (For example, your path is being a singer. This path fulfills all the components of your purpose except for financial stability, as you’re not well-known enough for ticket sales, record deals, and sponsors to be a practical source of income. You can add this component by meeting with agents, marketing your brand, and keeping your other job until you become successful.)
