## Exercise: Build Your Ideal Portfolio

Lynch writes that anyone can succeed in the stock market through research, persistence, smart investments, and vigilance. Think about how you can apply Lynch’s insights to build your ideal portfolio.

* * *

Do you think ordinary investors can put together and actively manage stock portfolios of individual stocks that can consistently outperform the market? Explain why or why not.

Do you think most investors would be better served by trying to beat the market with their own hand-picked stock portfolios, or do you think it’s better to put your money in an index fund that simply aims to track the market? Explain your reasoning.

Do you think it’s more effective to continually invest in the stock market regardless of the state of the economy? Or do you think it makes more sense to try to time the market to buy stocks when they’re cheap and sell them when they’re expensive? Explain your answer.
