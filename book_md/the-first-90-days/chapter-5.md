## Chapter 5: Secure Early Wins

**Your fifth principle for success in the first 90 days is to secure early wins that will prop up your credibility and provide an opportunity to invest in key relationships that will be essential for a successful overall transition.** Of course, enacting change within a company will come in waves over time and each wave will present an opportunity to (1) learn more about your company, (2) design new changes, (3) build support for that change, (4) implement the change, and (5) evaluate the results. A strong leader will deepen this process during each new wave in order to achieve more effective results for the company. However, it’s important that you start by establishing early wins that will build a foundation for subsequent waves of change down the road.

### Identifying Areas for Early Wins

How can you identify potential areas for early wins? Many people are tempted to jump on low-hanging fruit that will result in quick wins but that will not contribute to longer-term goals and will not help build momentum for the harder work that needs to be done.**** To avoid that temptation, be sure to:

1\. **Choose areas for early wins based on the expectations for your position** and as laid out in prior conversations with your boss and stakeholders. Those expectations provide insight into the company’s business goals, which should be at the heart of your early wins.

2.**Ask whether the possible early wins that you have identified will help introduce new patterns of behavior that will support a broader vision for change.** For example, perhaps you have noticed a lack of focus (marked by no clear goals or a reactionary rather than proactive approach) among your team. Reflect on how your early wins might be able to change behaviors related to those patterns. Other behavioral patterns that might require improvement include:

  * Lack of discipline 
  * Lack of innovation
  * Lack of teamwork
  * Lack of urgency



However, it’s not enough to simply avoid low hanging fruit when identifying your early wins. Instead, use the following principles to ensure that you maximize the benefits of your chosen projects:

  * Don’t become too scattered as you evaluate areas for implementing your early wins. Taking on too much early on will undermine the quality of your results later. 
  * **Focus on wins that dovetail with your boss’s priorities.** Remember the expectations conversation from Chapter 4? Use insight about your boss’s areas of interest and background to start highlighting possible early wins. Consider also which kind of early wins would most energize your direct reports and team. 
  * **Achieve the wins in a way that sets a precedent for your team.** Rather than using a quick approach that might be anathema to the company culture, use processes that set a tone for how you want your team to operate moving forward.
  * **Use STARS to identify appropriate wins.** The early wins for a realignment might be less concrete and more focused on messaging or altering the vision. By contrast, a turnaround will likely demand concrete wins in technical or financial areas.
  * Align your wins with the unique ways in which your company celebrates success. For example, if the company extols individual accomplishments, then it may be appropriate for you to take the lead on your early win. But if group victories are actively encouraged, you may want to build the early win with your team. 
  * **Elevate the right team members** by identifying who has the best background, attitude, and skill set to contribute to your early wins. 
  * Ask whether the potential project can be achieved in a short amount of time with the resources that are available.



Once you identify a possible early win project, consider whether it’s feasible and primed for success by using the FOGLAMP evaluation tool:

**F** ocus: What are the parameters of the project?

**O** versight: Who will be in charge of overseeing the project?

**G** oals: What are necessary check-points and timelines for reaching them?

**L** eadership: Who will take point on leading the project and are they sufficiently trained to do so?

**A** bilities: What assortment of team members is needed to ensure the necessary skills and backgrounds are included?

**M** eans: What resources will you need access to?

**P** rocess: Are there specific models or structures that will lead to success? Does the team need to be trained on them?

### Building Needed Credibility

Beyond thinking about what kind of wins you want to achieve, **consider also how your leadership style and reputation might impact the way those early wins are perceived and whether they foster or undermine your overall credibility.**

For example, you may be in a position similar to that of Elena, who was promoted to head of customer service for her retail company and suddenly found herself managing her former peers (managers of the company’s call centers). Elena set a tone early on by clearly communicating the goals for her new position, creating regular meetings for feedback with each call center manager, and making several thoughtful human resources changes. Because Elena took these key steps, she was able to secure various early wins in both improving customer satisfaction and cementing respect for her new authority.

If you also find yourself preparing to manage former peers, consider the following important principles for success:

  * **Accept early on that the contours of your relationship to former peers will have to change.**
  * Use formal and symbolic transition tools to render your new role concrete in the eyes of former peers (e.g., an official ceremony where your former boss passes the baton). 
  * Evaluate whether any team members will be so disappointed about not being promoted themselves that they cannot continue to effectively support the team.
  * **Strike a balance between over-exerting your authority to make a point and under-asserting yourself and thus not actually transitioning into the new role.**



More generally, all leaders will need to navigate the complex task of building credibility in their new role. Even before you formally start in that role, opinions will begin to form about your style and approach. **Once opinions ossify, they can be very hard to change.** Indeed, the phenomenon known as “confirmation bias”—where people will focus on information that confirms what they already believe and will ignore any evidence to the contrary—can easily take hold during the first stages of a new job. For that reason, it’s essential to inform the optics of your brand early on. What a successful brand looks like will vary for every role, but some general leadership traits that can help foster credibility include:

  * Being demanding but not impossible to please by setting realistic goals and holding people accountable while also celebrating and acknowledging successes 
  * Being approachable but with reasonable boundaries that acknowledge the nature of your role
  * Being decisive but thoughtful because tough calls have to be made but don’t have to happen in a reactionary fashion
  * Being focused but open to input 
  * Being proactive but not agitating. People need time and space to grow into change. Help set a sustainable pace for achieving new goals. 
  * Being tough but fair. As a leader, it falls on you to make hard decisions, but the way you do it—hopefully by preserving people’s dignity and humanity—won’t go unnoticed. 



These traits can help inform a plan for how you want to introduce yourself to the company and your team. Different processes might support the dissemination of your unique brand. For example, one-on-one meetings with each direct report might be beneficial. Or maybe you’ll decide to travel to each office location to do introductions. Ultimately, however, **if you are genuinely committed to learning about the ins and outs of the company, you are less likely to be perceived as a bulldog p** reparing to implement vast change without input and more likely to be seen as a thoughtful and engaged leader.

**As you build your brand and engage in your learning process, keep an eye out for small “teachable moments” that allow you to create an example of how you will lead.** These moments might be as simple as taking time to introduce yourself to the support staff or reacting calmly to small mistakes early on. Word will spread quickly about how you handle these seemingly insignificant encounters.

### Implementation

Once you have (1) identified important areas for early wins that align with your long term goals and (2) started building the credibility necessary to achieve them, you’ll need to implement a process for success. **Effective implementation of a new project will require the following five elements** :

  * Awareness of the project’s benefits
  * Diagnosis of why this change needs to happen 
  * Vision for strategy moving forward 
  * Plan that is based on needed expertise 
  * Support from personnel needed to implement



It’s quite possible that you’ll be missing one of these components. But for each missing piece there is a corresponding action that you can take to resolve it. For example, if there is a:

  * Lack of awareness of the project’s benefit—> Engage in collective learning about the problem (perhaps through exposure to new data or comparisons with competitors) 
  * Lack of diagnosis regarding why this change needs to happen—>Find tools to evaluate the root cause of the problem 
  * Lack of a vision for moving forward—> Bring the team together for a strategy session 
  * Lack of a plan that is based on needed expertise—>Prioritize the nuts and bolts of a plan 
  * Lack of support from personnel needed to implement—>Focus on coalition building (see chapter 8 for more on this). 



While engaging in these steps may take time, this approach is preferable to forcing change from the top down and experiencing the negative repercussions later. However, in some circumstances (such as a turnaround), it may be less important to resolve the problems identified above because the need for change is stark, and the company is anxious to implement a plan.

Less concrete but just as important as the five elements referenced above will be recognizing if or when there is a lack of cultural support for the change that needs to be made. **Changing a company’s culture can be very challenging and must be approached delicately so as to avoid a negative reaction from those attached to the status quo**. Evaluate both the positive and negative aspects of the current culture and find ways to celebrate the former while also preparing to improve the latter.

Finally, as you move towards securing your early wins, **beware any blind spots you have that could result in bombs going off which distract you and the team and undermine your hard work.** Identify potential problematic areas early on by asking about:

  * How the external environment (public opinion, economic conditions) might create challenges to achieving your goals
  * How the competitive market might change in a way that undermines your success
  * How internal gaps in skills or resources might impact your goals 
  * How organizational politics might present hurdles or landmines to enacting change 



Ultimately, it’s important to**remember that your wins will come in stages.** In the first 30 days you’ll want to achieve concrete wins that prop up your vision and build respect for your leadership style. However, as you move deeper into your role, you’ll start identifying second wave goals that are more challenging and perhaps go to issues around overall strategy, structure, or systems. Each subsequent wave will require learning, designing, building support, implementing, and evaluating results.
