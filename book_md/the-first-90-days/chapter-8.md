## Chapter 8: Create Alliances

Everyone needs alliances and support as they transition—especially into a new company, which is why you’ll want to implement the eighth principle for success: **build alliances that help support your long-term goals.** Remember your early wins? Consider who you’ll need in your corner to achieve them. Remember also that **having an alliance doesn’t mean having unanimous support. Focus on who you really need to get on board and allocate your time and energy there.** Identify early on where you might face push back or blockage—include a strategy for winning those people over in your plan. Below are the steps to take in order to effectively build your alliances.

### Know the Playing Board

In order to build your alliances, you’ll need to learn more about the landscape of your company.

#### Map Out the Players

Who do you need help from? What role do they play in achieving your objectives? At what stage will you need to get them on board? Consider creating a chart mapping out each of these players. After you have identified the various individuals with power in your company, evaluate which ones you need on board for each specific goal. What combination of these players would constitute a winning alliance? What constitutes a “blocking alliance”? Think proactively about why they might be opposed to your plan/agenda and how you can assuage their concerns.

#### Map Out the Networks

**You should be thoughtful not only about who has the power to help or hurt, but also about how they make decisions and who influences them.** Sometimes those channels of persuasion are informal but provide key insight into how information and decision making flows within the structure of the company. Identifying those channels may take time but consider the following options for gaining key insight sooner rather than later:

1\. Notice how and where your business engages with outside actors such as other companies, suppliers, or various stakeholders. Such engagements will likely highlight key focal points where important members of your company come together.

2.**** Use both formal meetings and informal interactions as opportunities to identify power dynamics within and between teams.**** Who carries authority and who is trusted/respected to provide opinions and insight? People might have influence for different reasons, such as:

  * Unique expertise
  * Power over information 
  * Access to relationships 
  * Control over resources
  * Personal loyalty 



3\. Look out for “power coalitions” which are sub groups that align to achieve certain goals or to protect certain interests.**** See if your agenda aligns with these groups, but be careful not to undermine your goals by getting caught in political tensions between distinct power coalitions.

#### Create a Diagram of Influence

A diagram can help you visualize how each of these pieces interact. Put your winning alliance at the center of the diagram and around the alliance note other individuals with power. Use arrows to indicate how those individuals might exert influence over your winning alliance.

Within these network diagrams you can also begin to code for people who support, oppose, or are undecided on your goals by highlighting them with different colors. A few things to consider as you categorize individuals on your map:

**1\. Supporters should not be taken for granted.** You should regularly engage them to confirm and deepen their buy-in.

**2\. Remember that supporters may also come from surprising places.** Perhaps you disagree with an individual in other areas but you share interests regarding one particular goal—alliances of convenience can be beneficial for everyone. Don’t discount anyone and think capaciously about who you can bring on board.

3\. If you are trying to identify more supporters, consider people who (1) have a similar vision for the company as you, (2) are also new, or (3) generally have a reputation for being open-minded or creative thinkers.

**4\. Never assume someone will oppose you and always seek to understand the basis for opposition so that you can identify any possible effective counter arguments.** Converting someone from being opposed to being on board could set a powerful tone. Consider also how can you help someone meet their goals down the road if they jump on board with you now? Some common reasons individuals may be opposed to change are:

  * Concern that disrupting the status quo will undermine what they have come to know and rely on 
  * Insecurity that they will be less important or effective if changes occur
  * Perceiving change as a threat to the culture or core values they identify with
  * Worrying about the impact change might have on their own authority and/or the possible negative attendant consequences to others in their corner or alliance 



**5\. In between the supporters and the opposition are the persuadables.** Perhaps they are agnostic, not yet informed, or waiting to decide. Here you have an opportunity to:

  * Tip them over the indifference edge by offering your support in another area of value to them 
  * Provide them with necessary information/education to make a favorable choice
  * Build momentum so that folks waiting to join the winning team choose you.



Your networking map might be quite expansive. Accordingly, **it’s important to allocate your energy efficiently and to prioritize engaging with the most pivotal people.** Evaluate what fundamentally motivates those individuals (recognition, power, personal growth, and so on). Consider also what internal and external pressures they are subject to. Are there driving forces that align with your own? Or are there situational reasons that are restraining their ability or desire to get on board? Don’t just assume that someone is opposed because they are self-interested or uncooperative. Evaluate the context in which they operate to see if there is anything you can influence or change. Also consider whether opposition may be grounded in concerns about effective implementation. Is there a way you can do a test round? Or slowly build confidence?

### Exert Your Influence

Now that you know who to focus on, you can employ distinct tools to effectively exert your influence. Examples include:

**Consultation** : Solicit feedback about your plan and engage authentically with concerns that may arise.**** Reflect back points that people have made so that they feel heard and valued in the process.

**Framing** : Approach your framing of the issue on an individualized basis.**** Each conversation should be informed by that individual’s particular background, position, and style. For example, some people might respond well to arguments grounded in hard data and facts (logical or “logos” arguments). Other people might be moved by a framing related to key principles and values (ethos driven arguments). Or, finally, you might want to tap into emotional motivators such as an inspiring vision (pathos arguments).

**Choice-shaping** : Think about ways you can affect how people perceive their alternatives. For example, if people are worried that your project will be too expansive or will set a bad precedent, consider explaining how it will be circumscribed in order to avoid creating a slippery slope. Propositions that are perceived as win-lose are tricky to sell.**** Evaluate how you might be able to create more nuance around the issue so that there are more opportunities for others to see the benefits.

**Social influence** : We care about the opinions of others that we respect. Is there a key person you can get on board first who will then be influential to the decision-making process of others? Consider also that people like to make choices that are consistent with their values and belief systems, uphold their prior commitments, repay obligations, and preserve their image/reputation.

**Incrementalism** : People are less likely to be scared off by change if it’s viewed in small approachable steps.**** How can you map out those steps for them? A good place to start might be by engaging in a team-wide diagnostic activity. The more people agree on the problem, the more likely they are to commit to work towards a step-by-step solution.

**Sequencing** : Be strategic about the order in which you bring different individuals on board. Allocating energy on the front-end to convincing one integral ally could be key to building momentum towards greater coalition building.

**Action-forcing events:** Scheduling meetings and creating deadlines can help prevent stalling or avoidance that may be undermining progress and ultimate success. Psychologically, these concrete check-points will also create momentum and build accountability for people to commit to next steps.

Ultimately, **the most important thing to remember is that alliances will be needed when implementing any changes.** If you jump towards proposed changes and solutions without simultaneously doing the work to bring necessary actors on board, your efforts may well be fruitless.

For example, when Alexia was promoted to vice president of marketing for three regions, she enthusiastically conducted a thorough review of current practices and determined that a fundamental restructuring was needed to execute a better balance between the centralization and decentralization of marketing decisions. However, what Alexia failed to recognize was that the various actors implicated in her plan (including her multiple bosses and various country managers) would likely have conflicting interests in building such a restructuring. Without proactively managing those interests, Alexia would never achieve the necessary consensus to move forward.
