## Chapter 7: Build Your Team

**The seventh principle to apply when transitioning into your new role is to build the right team so that you can achieve the right goals.** The first 90 days will be critical for assessing your current team members and identifying any needed role shifts or new hires. Human resources decisions can either set you up for a virtuous cycle that informs your long-term success, or for a vicious cycle that leaves you isolated and without needed support. To avoid the latter when building your team, consider the following potential traps:

#### Potential Traps

  * **Focusing too much on the failures of the outgoing leadership.** While you certainly want to learn from their mistakes, outwardly criticizing their work is counterproductive to the goals of moving your team forward. 
  * **Being skittish about letting people go.** If it becomes clear that members of your team are not capable of supporting your goals, then equivocating on a decision to fire them will only hurt you both in the long run. Of course, your STARS stage may impact how realistic or desirable it is to make significant human resources changes early on. And you might not have full authority to make that call. Regardless, give yourself a clear timeline for evaluating team members and making a choice about their future in the company.
  * **Doing too much too fast.** Focus on key changes that may need to be made but don’t undermine overall stability by trying to change too much at once. Holding onto a few folks who are competent but not stellar might be a necessary compromise early on as you prioritize changes at other levels. 
  * **Failing to consider organizational alignment in tandem with team development.** You cannot make informed HR choices if you don’t know what strategic direction your group is heading in. 
  * **Losing good people** by engaging in haphazard processes that make key members feel unstable. Be sure to provide positive and productive feedback to those team members that will likely be integral to your success in the future.
  * **Allocating resources to team building before the team has been finalized.** It’s inefficient and could make parting ways with some individuals even harder down the road. 
  * **Putting the cart before the horse by propelling action on priority initiatives before the team is in place.** Some key steps may need to be taken but overall your implementation will be far more effective if the final team executes it together from the start. 
  * **Shouldering the process yourself.** Building a team can be draining and complex, especially as a new leader. Lean on resources from HR and other units as you evaluate and form your team.



Bearing these traps in mind, the first step to building your team is conducting an effective assessment.

### Assessing Your Team

The first 30 days in your new role are an important time to start gathering information about your team members. Some of that will happen organically through first impressions and access to prior performance reviews. However, it’s important not to rely on that information in lieu of a consistent, objective, and formal evaluation process.

Consider, for example, Liam, who inherited a team when he was appointed to lead a struggling business unit. As he reviewed the team’s previous annual performance evaluations, he began to get the sense that his predecessor had played favorites. Indeed, as he reviewed operating results and evaluated the team himself, it became clear that the performance metrics were not a reliable basis upon which to make personnel decisions. Instead, he opted into creating his own evaluation process which more effectively informed his HR decisions moving forward.

#### Develop an Effective Evaluation Process

Conduct consistent and objective evaluations of your team and develop clear criteria for doing so, such as:

  * **Competence:** What are their technical abilities, background, and experience? 
  * **Judgment:** How do they operate under pressure or as part of a team? 
  * **Energy:** Are they still excited and engaged? Or lethargic/burnt out?
  * **Focus:** Can they implement reliably? Or are they scattered and off task?
  * **Relationships:** Do they have good rapport with others? Or do they sow tension? 
  * **Trust:** Are they reliable and dependable?



Other considerations and resources that might help you develop a consistent and objective evaluation process include:

  * **Turning to specialists** outside of your team who might be able to provide insight into the strength of an employee’s functional expertise (e.g., find support from someone in finance, marketing, or operations who might have knowledge about the capabilities of individuals who play those roles on your team). 
  * **Remembering your organizational structure** as you weigh the importance of different criteria.**** For example, if your team is geographically scattered and operates, by definition, with little integration, perhaps teamwork will be less weighty in your evaluation as compared to competence. 
  * **Using STARS.** Different competencies might be more or less important in a given STARS stage.**** In a turnaround, for example, the urgency of achieving certain tasks will likely influence HR decisions differently than the time that might be available to you for team development in a sustaining success scenario. Prepare for the possibility that some inherited team members may have notable strengths that simply don’t align with the stage the company is in. 
  * **Factoring in the relative importance of different positions for the strategic direction you are pursuing.** Perhaps some roles are not particularly critical towards achieving that end and thus a B-level report is sufficient at this time. By contrast, certain roles may be integral to achieving success and thus prioritizing proper placement for that role may be important.



#### Conduct One-on-One Meetings

As you assess each individual, consider how they perform in the above-discussed metrics but also plan on meeting with them one-by-one. The following steps will help you prepare for and implement these meetings:

**1\. Do your research first.** Review performance evaluations, personnel history, and other appraisals. Develop knowledge about their technical background and experience.

**2\. Standardize your questions across meetings to include key points of inquiry** such as:

  * What are the strengths and weaknesses of our current team strategy? 
  * What are some short term challenges and opportunities that we face? 
  * What resources could we be leveraging more effectively? 



**3\. During the meeting, observe both verbal and non verbal cues.** For example, perhaps the employee has a strong reaction to certain issues or is reticent to take responsibility.

**4\. Test their judgment** by spending sustained time with a given employee and observing whether they have good predictive abilities and can be strategic about preempting possible problems. But you might not be able to do this with every employee. Consider, instead, evaluating an employee’s judgment by asking specific questions about his or her hobbies. For example, who do they think will win an upcoming sports game or a debate? Why? Are they unwilling to opine? Do they have good rationale for their prediction? Were they ultimately right?

Beyond the one-on-one meetings, you’ll also want to evaluate the overall team dynamics and how they function as a unit. There are numerous ways to do so such as:

  * By reviewing prior meeting minutes or group reports 
  * By comparing answers to questions from the individual meetings. Are they identifying shared themes? Or do they lack cohesion?
  * By observing group dynamics in meetings to better understand if there are any leaders, or subgroups/cliques, what the tone of communication is, and so on. 



### Shaping Your Team

By the end of the first 30 days you should have completed your team assessments. Now, **review each individual and categorize them** as:

  * Keep in place—performance is good 
  * Keep with development—there is some work to be done but it’s manageable 
  * Move positions—the individual has strengths but they are not being properly utilized 
  * Replace (low priority)—the individual needs to be replaced but it’s not an urgent priority 
  * Replace (high priority)—the individual should be replaced ASAP
  * Observe—more information is needed



**As you categorize each team member, however, always consider alternatives to replacement.** Firing people can take a toll on your time and also on the company culture. Additionally, there may be legal requirements, documentation needed to sustain your decision, and so on. Alternatives to firing someone may include: (a) moving her to a new position that will be a better fit or at least less costly to you, (b) minimizing her impact by decreasing responsibilities and tasks—maybe she will leave on her own, or (c) considering whether she could be productive elsewhere in the company (without just making her someone else’s problem).

If you are still observing someone but think they may need to go, begin the process of discreetly identifying a possible replacement through internal options or an external search. And be sure to always maintain a tone of respect with all team members regardless of what category they might fall into.

### Aligning Your Team

Having good members team members is necessary but not sufficient for achieving your goals. How will roles be defined such that everyone is supporting the bigger picture? And how can you hold people accountable for their element of the equation? There are two categories of tools at your disposal as you motivate and align your team:

#### Push Tools

**These are performance measurement systems and incentive structures that motivate people through fear, reward, loyalty, and authority.** If you are planning on using these tools, consider the following key principles:

  * Define, establish, and commit to clear performance metrics that use explicit standards. For example, rather than “grow sales” specify “increase sales by 10% within the first quarter.”
  * Consider whether rewards should be based on individual or collective performance. If team members will have to rely on each other to achieve the goal, then rewarding based on collective performance is probably more appropriate. But if you simply need each employee to perform at their highest level to achieve success, individual rewards may be more effective. As you prepare award structures, keep an eye towards the different factors that incentivize people. For example:
    * An employee’s total reward = nonmonetary reward + monetary reward
    * Nonmontetary awards = advancement opportunities and other recognition
    * Monetary rewards = fixed compensation + performance based compensation. 



If you have agency to decide what weight to give these different elements of the equation, remember that the ratio of fixed compensation to performance based compensation should be informed by how directly you can measure the results of a given employee (the more directly, the more reasonable it is to compensate based on performance).

#### Pull Tools

**These tools motivate people through positive and aspirational notions about what you can accomplish together.** Creating an inspiring vision is essential and you can do so effectively by:

  * Focusing on what contributions you are making to society or what your team can accomplish together.
  * Telling a story and clearly explaining how your team fits into it. 
  * Using compelling and evocative language. For example, saying you want to launch more rockets into space is less compelling than saying you want to put a man on the moon. 
  * Considering the ideas of others while being clear about the nonnegotiable components of the plan. This creates shared ownership and greater buy-in. 
  * Using metaphors to help bring the vision to life and crystalize it for employees.
  * Repeating the vision over and over again. If your vision is too complex it will not stick. 
  * Not doing it alone. Instill the vision in other key actors so that they too can disseminate and communicate it regularly to the whole team. 



**Offsite planning can also be a good tool for strategizing and coalescing around a shared vision.** Essential to any offsite meeting, however, is a good facilitator (which may or may not be you depending on the goals and your skill sets). Be realistic about what you can achieve in one meeting, and remember that you can always have more sessions.**** Make sure that the session has a clear purpose such as:

  * Diagnostic—Helping create a shared understanding of where the company is at
  * Strategic—Getting on the same page regarding vision and next steps
  * Team building—Improving how well everyone works together 
  * Relationship work—Evaluating and improving personal dynamics 
  * Planning—Hashing out the details of a plan for implementation 
  * Conflict resolution—Working through specific tensions or hurdles 



Finally, as you evaluate what combination of push and pull factors will be most beneficial in the process of aligning your team, **remember that different team members may be incentivized by different tools so be prepared to employ them accordingly.** Additionally, don’t forget to fold-in the STARS stages to your approach. For example, turnarounds are innately fueled by push factors because everyone is keenly aware that drastic action is needed to save the company.

### Leading Your Team

Your team has been assessed, shaped, and aligned. Now, how will you lead it? What will the day-to-day processes and mechanisms of communication and planning be? Consider these factors as you plan your leadership approach:

First, it’s important to**develop an understanding of current team processes** by talking to members about how things have been done historically and reviewing meeting agendas and minutes. You’ll want to ask key questions such as:

  * How frequently did meetings occur? Who set the agenda? Did people show up with energy or try to avoid them? 
  * Who made key decisions and how were they communicated to the team? Over email? Through back door channels? Through weekly announcements? 
  * What was the leadership style of your predecessor? What differences can you identify between you and him? What impact might those differences have on the team? 



Second, you will also want to**identify areas that need improvement** and think through an implementation and communication plan for those changes.**** For example, are meetings currently too inclusive and nothing gets done? Or are they too exclusive and lack key input?

Third, **reflect on the different ways that decisions can get made.** For example, they can be made unilaterally and some scenarios might benefit from you making a hard decision yourself. By contrast, you could try and achieve unanimous consent for a particular decision. However, between those two extremes are two other possible decision making models including:

  * _Consult-decide_ , whereby you solicit and incorporate input from the team but make the decision yourself. 
  * _Build consensus_ , whereby you solicit feedback and also seek agreement among a critical mass before committing to a decision. 



Don’t assume that consult-decide is preferable when you are in a crunch just because it would be faster. You could end up doing even more work on the back-end trying to rationalize your decision to others. **Beware, also, of the action imperative here—you’re antsy to get things done in your new role and thus might skip over essential processes.** Use these considerations to evaluate which approach might be right in a given scenario:

  * If it’s a highly controversial decision consider making it yourself.**** You’ll never achieve consensus and thus you should take the hit so the team can move on as quickly as possible. 
  * If you will be dependent on other people to implement the decision, consider getting their buy-in ahead of time by building consensus. 
  * If you are working with an inexperienced team consensus building might be frustrating and ineffectual. For now, they may benefit from you making decisions while they learn and grow into their roles. 
  * If you need to establish authority (perhaps you are supervising former peers), use consult and decide to send a signal about your new role.



Also, **don’t forget about how your STARS stage might inform your approach.** Startups and turnarounds are well situated for consult and decide because concrete decisions need to be made to get things off the ground and people are looking for a direction. By contrast, realignment and sustaining success often come with a firmly established team that might respond poorly to consult and decide.

**It’s okay if you have a preference for one style of decision making over the other but don’t get too attached—it’s important to try and also build your skills in the other approaches.** Consider articulating your approach explicitly to the team so that people have clear expectations and feel like a thoughtful process was put in place regardless of the substantive outcome. Be careful not to create a hollow process, however. People will see right through faux consensus building. Once you feel more confident, you may be able to alternate between the approaches without creating confusion or instability in the team.

### Special Considerations for Virtual Teams

**Some teams face unique challenges because they are not operating in a shared physical space.** A few pointers for leading a virtual team include:

  * Bring the team physically together, from time to time, to develop rapport. 
  * Have clear rules and expectations for emails and group calls (e.g., which emails require urgent responses, how to minimize the chaos of interruptions during calls, and so on). 
  * Consider creating structure for information sharing and accountability by assigning roles for meetings (e.g., note taker or agenda lead).
  * Create some regular and consistent spaces for interaction (e.g., regular weekly meetings) so that there is some reliable form and structure. 
  * Celebrate successes to create a sense of cohesion and shared accomplishments.
