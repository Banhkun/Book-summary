## Exercise: Track Your Winning and Blocking Alliances

As you start to plan a strategy for building out your alliances, keep track of the moving pieces and players by using the exercise, below.

* * *

Identify five individuals that are uniquely situated to impact (either positively or negatively) your early win project. For each individual, write down your assessment of the following considerations: (1) what their current stance is on your project, (2) what externally drives them (e.g., certain board members, media coverage, and so on), (3) what internally drives them (e.g., wants to be promoted this year), and (4) potential strategies for influencing their perspective (e.g., will be influenced by another actor or responds well to incremental change). Use these notes to inform your next steps in building your winning alliances and fending off any blocking alliances.
