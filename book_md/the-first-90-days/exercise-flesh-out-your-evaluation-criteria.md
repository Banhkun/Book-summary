## Exercise: Flesh Out Your Evaluation Criteria

You can begin to identify top priorities for evaluating your team by assigning values to different criteria such as competence, judgment, energy, focus, relationships, and trust. As you assign a value to the different evaluation criteria, be sure to (1) check your biases, and (2) consider how the STARS stages might influence which traits need to be prioritized within your team. Consider also that different values may be pertinent to different job types or categories. For example, what you are looking for in your customer service team may be distinct from what is important in your financial development group. Iterate this exercise as many times as needed.

* * *

What are the most important criteria for evaluating your team members? After each criteria, explain how it supports your goals and the current STARS stage of your company or team. Put an asterisk next to any criteria that you deem non-negotiable and explain why itâ€™s a threshold requirement.
