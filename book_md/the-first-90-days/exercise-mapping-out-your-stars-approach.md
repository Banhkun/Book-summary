## Exercise: Mapping out Your STARS Approach

Armed with knowledge about how important the STARS stages can be to supporting your success, conduct a diagnosis of how these stages might impact your work priorities in the first 90 days of a new role.

* * *

Below, list out the key aspects of your current projects and identify which STARS category each component likely falls into. For example, you may be building a team for a new product (which may manifest as more of a start-up phase) and also overseeing efforts to improve overall customer satisfaction (which could benefit from some realignment). Once you have identified each work component, allocate it a percentage out of 100, reflecting how much of a priority it should be in your first 90 days. Remember that your particular role or business might not have work elements at issue for all five stages.

Now, choose the three components of your work with the highest priority percentages and note, below, how each of their particular STARS stages will inform (1) your leadership approach and (2) how you define success.
