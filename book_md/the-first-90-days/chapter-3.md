## Chapter 3: Match Strategy to Situation

Another key principle for your first 90 days is to **develop an accurate diagnosis of the stage of growth and development that your company is currently in**. Once you are armed with that information, you’ll be able to more effectively answer two key questions including: (1) what kind of change will I be leading the charge on?, and (2) what is my personal style of enacting change as a leader?

### The STARS Model

STARS is an acronym used to describe five different business stages. It stands for:

  1. **S** tart-up 
  2. **T** urnaround 
  3. **A** ccelerated growth 
  4. **R** ealignment 
  5. **S** ustaining success 



We will learn a lot more about the nuances and implications of these five stages over the course of the book. But, as a general matter, they are defined as:

  * **Start-up** : You are launching a new business, product, project, or relationship and will have to organize and implement the various pieces needed for success (e.g., people, money, technology, and so on). Start-ups are often defined by a lot of energy and ambition but can be plagued by a lack of structure or focus. As a leader in a start-up, you’ll have the opportunity to shape key facets of the work but also may have limited resources. 
  * **Turnaround:** The business may be a sinking ship and requires immediate action to recover or redirect. The need for change is often urgent, necessitating a “ready-fire-aim” approach that means making tough decisions earlier on and with less information than might be ideal.**** Coming in as a leader during this stage can often be high risk/high reward.
  * **Accelerated growth** : Things are moving forward within your company but a scale-up or plan for expansion may be needed by creating new structures, processes, or personnel. Adding these pieces while sustaining the core company culture and vision presents challenges and risks of undermining the factors that led to success in the first place. 
  * **Realignment** : Perhaps your company is experiencing general success but is suffering from problems rooted in stagnation or complacency. As a leader at this stage, you’ll likely have access to structures and resources that are already in place but may struggle to instill a sense of urgency or inspire motivation for the change that’s needed to bring the business to the next level. 
  * **Sustaining success** : Here a leader will be seeking to capitalize on the strong foundational success of the company but looking to help it build and grow.**** This will likely require cycling back through the start-up, turnaround, and acceleration phases to create a dynamic but sustainable approach to the company’s success. 



**Beyond understanding the business dynamics at play in each of these five stages, it’s important also to recognize how they might each embody a different kind of organizational psychology.** For example, start-ups may be energized but frantic, turnarounds may be defined by low morale, accelerated growth may require imposition of new disciplines, realignment may be plagued by denial, and sustaining success may require an infusion of new motivation for learning and growth.

Remember, too, that these stages are applicable regardless of the size or type of company that you are working for or transitioning into and also that **several stages might be at issue simultaneously for your company or within your role.**

### Applying STARS to Your Theory of Change

Once you diagnose the STARS stage(s) that are applicable to your work, you can make a more informed decision about how to successfully manage needed change in your role.

> **Supporting Example**
> 
> Karl Lewin worked at Global Foods and effectively oversaw a turnaround of the company’s European manufacturing operations. There, the company’s diffuse approach to growth (marked by too many acquisitions and poorly organized country-level operations) had led to a state of crisis. Karl recognized that urgent and decisive action would be necessary to save the company and quickly identified the need to centralize operations and close four of the most inefficient plants. He also made the tough but crucial decision to clean shop at the top of management and to make other painful but essential workforce cuts.
> 
> After his success in Europe, Karl was subsequently promoted to be the vice president of supply chains for the company’s core North American operations. There, Karl encountered a radically different STARS stage within the company. In contrast to the turnaround Karl had navigated in Europe, the North American group needed to navigate a realignment. It had achieved its basic goals, and there were no major capacity or productivity issues, but they were struggling with low customer satisfaction and general stagnation. As Karl evaluated the company’s status and the team, he encountered a disinterest in critically evaluating outputs or using any formalized tools to measure success. He realized that improved information gathering and sharing would be necessary so that the group could understand why change was needed and so that he could gain support in implementing that change.
> 
> This realignment situation in North America demanded an entirely different leadership approach from Karl than the turnaround that he had navigated in Europe. Rather than implementing change incisively through immediate action, Karl had to engage with a much more diffuse set of challenges that were etched into the psychology of the people and the company. Human resources changes were made more slowly and deliberately. Managers were not cleared out, but individuals without the vision or the skills needed to help the company grow were replaced, often through internal promotions.
> 
> Ultimately, Karl’s success in these two roles with disparate needs was grounded in his ability to effectively diagnose the STARS stage that was applicable and to adapt his leadership style accordingly.

### Applying STARS to Your Own Leadership Approach

Like Karl, **you can use the STARS diagnosis to develop a greater understanding of how to manage your own leadership style.** Two such styles that might be either helpful or counterproductive at different stages include:

  * **The “hero” role whereby the leader boldly takes action and helps redefine and redirect an organization.** This would be most beneficial in a turnaround that is craving new energy and hope. However, such an approach could be quite problematic in realignment or sustaining success scenarios where expectations and norms are already established and thus sudden change could be seen as a threat. 
  * **The “steward” approach, which seeks to make an impact through more subtle and diplomatic means.** A company in realignment might respond well to this style as the need for change is highlighted only after patient and careful observation of the history and culture of the company. This approach would likely be totally ineffectual for a turnaround, however, as the sense of urgency there demands decisive action, not prolonged deliberation. 



It’s likely that you’ll have a natural predisposition towards one of these styles over the other, and it’s important to be honest with yourself about your inclinations and strengths. Take that awareness into your new role so that you can check your tendencies and adapt accordingly.

### Using STARS to Appropriately Define Success

**As you plan for what success looks like in your role, keep in mind that it might manifest a bit differently depending on what STARS stage you are operating in.** For example, evaluating “success” in a realignment or sustaining success stage can be tricky because it’s often about subtle change or fending off problematic shifts. There must be a more sophisticated understanding of what was at issue in the past and how things could have worked out differently with different leadership.
