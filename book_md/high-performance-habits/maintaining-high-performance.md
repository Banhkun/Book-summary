## Maintaining High Performance

When high performers fall from grace, it’s unexpected because of the high-level at which they’re accustomed to performing. To sustain your success, be aware of the three traps that often cause high performers to fail: **feeling superior, being unsatisfied, and neglecting important things.**

### Trap #1: Feeling Superior

**When you become a high performer, it’s easy to feel superior without realizing it.** Because you’re at the top of your game, you may subconsciously look down on people who haven’t achieved as much as you have. People who feel superior believe:

  * They're better than the people around them.
  * They deserve admiration.
  * People just don’t “understand them.”
  * They don’t need feedback.



While you may not actively show your superiority, these thoughts often lead to condescension and dismissal. People won’t want to work with you if you demean or ignore them. While your colleagues may put up with you for a while, you’ll eventually lose the support of the people around you regardless of how strong your ideas are.

#### How to Avoid Feeling Superior

**Humility is the antidote to feelings of superiority.** It keeps you from demeaning the people around you and shows you the value other people bring to the table. It also reminds you that you always have more room to grow.

To humble yourself, consider the following practices:

  * **Look for input.** Actively seek out feedback from others. This will help you find the flaws in your concepts and show others that you’re willing to collaborate. 
  * **Hire a coach or therapist.** Your friends and colleagues are too close to you to give you an objective opinion on your behavior. Behavioral coaches and therapists have the tools and education to keep you grounded and guide you through difficult times.
  * **Care for others.** Don’t view them as “beneath you.” Remember, everyone is capable of high performance. Instead of demeaning those around you, offer your support and guidance. This builds trust and helps your colleagues grow.
  * **Own your actions.** Don’t blame others for your behavior. If you make a mistake, take responsibility. This shows that you recognize the areas you need to improve and don’t believe that you’re error-proof.
  * **Count your blessings.** Gratitude reinforces your humility by reminding you of the people that have helped you get where you are.



### Trap #2: Being Discontented

Many people believe that contentment prevents progress because it promotes “settling.” They’d rather use discontent to drive them to find “the _next_ project” or “a _better_ way.” However, while staying motivated is important, **discontent creates negative thoughts such as the following:**

  * “My work is never good enough.”
  * “I don’t deserve to be praised.”
  * “I’ll find my happiness in the _next_ project.”
  * “This project may have some good points, but look at _all_ the problems.”
  * “I’ll never be satisfied.”
  * These thoughts lead to frustration, depression, and insecurity, then infect other people.



**High performers are able to stay motivated without resorting to negativity.** While they accept critique and strive to improve, they find contentment in what they do by recognizing their accomplishments. Their positive attitude keeps them from becoming overwhelmed by their work and helps them build relationships with their colleagues and friends.

#### How to Avoid Being Discontented

**To maintain high performance, you must find contentment in your work without losing motivation.** To be content without “settling,” use the following tips:

  * **Take pride in the work you’ve already done.** While listening to feedback and critiquing your process is important, be sure to acknowledge what you’ve done well. 
  * **Share your accomplishments and encourage others to do the same.** Open communication about success boosts morale and keeps people motivated. 
  * **Reframe your perspective.** Changing the way you motivate yourself allows you to stay positive while pushing forward. For example, instead of saying, “My work’s not good enough,” try saying, “This part of my work is good, and this is what needs improvement.” 
  * **Journal your progress.** Every day, write down three things that went well. Describe any growth you felt that day. This allows you to look back and reflect on the good things in your life as well as your development.



### Trap #3: Neglecting Important Things

As a high performer, there are many areas that require your attention. **Because of this, you may sometimes accidentally neglect important things because you’re too focused on a singular task or you’ve overextended yourself with too many tasks.**

#### How to Avoid Neglecting Important Things

**As you begin to reflect on your current circumstances and listen to the people around you, you’ll likely become aware of areas you’re already neglecting.** As this happens, don’t blame your neglect on other people or external factors. Instead, take responsibility for your action (or inaction), and develop a plan to address the areas that you’ve overlooked. This requires patience, diligence, and a willingness to listen.

To avoid overlooking important things, first, consider the following tips to avoid a _lack of awareness_ :

  * **Chart the important things in your life.** Use the model discussed in “Habit #4: Increase Your Efficiency” to look at the 10 most important areas of your life and consider the amount of satisfaction you’re experiencing in each. If things seem out of balance, make a plan to invest more time in the areas that you’re currently neglecting.
  * **Listen to the people around you.** When people come to you with their concerns, listen to them. They may be introducing an issue that you didn’t know existed, helping you find the areas or people you’re unknowingly neglecting.



Now, consider the following tips to avoid _overextending yourself_ :

  * **Zero in on the most important things.** As a high performer, you likely feel the drive to excel at everything you do. While this is a noble perspective, it can also lead you to put significant levels of energy and focus into unimportant areas. Find and define the most important things in your life and be sure that you’re putting the proper amount of energy into those things.
  * **Be willing to say no.** While you may want to take on as many projects as possible, you can’t sacrifice quality for quantity. Especially when you’re busy, only agree to the projects that are important to you or your work and politely decline any offers that don’t support your goals. 



### Exude Confidence

As you work on the six high-performance habits, one of the most important characteristics to develop is confidence. Confidence helps you take bold steps in the face of obstacles or adversity. It helps you rise to any challenge because it reminds you that you have the strength to overcome and succeed.

#### The Three C’s of Confidence

**Even when under immense pressure, high performers know how to generate the confidence to push ahead.** Confidence isn’t something you’re born with. It requires patience, hard work, and persistence. As you begin your journey towards more confidence, think about the characteristics of confidence:

  * **Competence:** High performers are confident in their abilities. They use their knowledge and skills to feed their confidence. To develop competence, take the time to master important skills. The more you know about a topic, the more confident you can be in your abilities. For example, if you’re a baseball player, and you’ve spent a lot of time practicing and perfecting your swing, you’re going to be more confident when you get to the plate. 
  * **Congruence** : High performers are confident in who they are. They have a clear self-image and act in accordance with their values. To develop congruence, have a strong sense of identity, define your values, and set your intentions. Once you know those things, you won’t second guess any choices that align with them. For example, if you know you’re passionate about saving the environment, you’ll be confident in your efforts to become more eco-friendly.
  * **Connection:** High performers use their relationships to build their competence and congruence. They use interactions with their family, friends, and colleagues to learn more about themselves and their work. To develop connection, engage with the people around you and seek out opportunities for education and development. For example, if you’re a manager, taking the time to understand the dreams, fears, and concerns of your employees will give you more confidence to enact positive change.
