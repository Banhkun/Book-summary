## Exercise: Identify Your Feelings

To become a high performer, visualize and anticipate the feelings you want to feel. This will help you generate positive feelings when negative emotions arise. Remember: Emotions are reactionary feelings, while feelings are how you interpret an emotion.

* * *

Describe something that happened this week to which you had a strong emotional reaction. For instance, a driver pulled in front of you or your spouse blamed you for something unfairly. What was your emotion?

How could you have reframed the emotion into a constructive feeling?

When something triggers an emotion in the future, how can you stop yourself from reacting emotionally and reframe it?
