## Exercise: Master Transitions

Mastering transitions allows you to stay calm in the face of crisis and keep focused on your work, helping you perform more effectively.

* * *

Think of a tense situation you experienced in the past week. How did that tension impact the rest of your day and your ability to perform?

How could you release this tension? Think about mindfulness practices and breathing exercises.

Once youâ€™ve released your tension, what could you say to yourself to transition into your next activity? Write down your affirmation and explain your reasoning.
