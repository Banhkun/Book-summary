## Habit #3: Find Your Drive

Drive is the force that motivates you to perform at your pest. It helps you stay on track through even the most difficult challenges. **Drive comes from two types of forces: internal and external.**

![high-performance-habits-drive.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/high-performance-habits-drive.png)

### Internal Forces

**Internal forces are the feelings, values, and goals that drive you.** They create the feeling of satisfaction when you’ve accomplished a goal, and the feeling of frustration when you sense you’re underperforming. They come from your internal desire to better yourself and gain mastery within your field. **These forces are divided into two categories:_identity_ and _obsession_.**

#### Identity

**Identity refers to the need to hold yourself to a high standard of excellence.** High performers tie their identity to their performance, constantly self-monitoring and looking for opportunities to improve their work. When they achieve success, they feel validation and pride. However, when they underperform, they recognize their failings and commit to stronger performance moving forward.

Note: This _doesn’t_ mean that high performers allow their frustrations to take over. In fact, their regular self-monitoring prevents them from spiraling when they notice a weakness. **Instead, their instinct is to discover the areas that need improvement and take steps to strengthen their abilities.**

#### Obsession

**Obsession refers to the need to understand and master a topic.** High performers obsess over their field of choice, pouring hours of research, practice, and discussion into their craft. They don’t need an incentive or reward to commit to their work. Instead, they feel an intrinsic need to learn as much as they can and put their understanding into practice.

High performers constantly talk and think about their work. While many may view their behavior as “too much,” **high performers know that the only way to achieve excellence is to dive deeply into a topic and extract as much information as they possibly can.**

### External Forces

**External forces are factors outside of a person’s control that drive them to perform well.** Some equate these forces to “pressure.” However, while these forces do create a degree of pressure, high performers don’t view them as _negative_. This is because they actively decide which external forces hold weight in their life. **These forces are divided into two categories:_duty_ and _urgency_.**

#### Duty

**Duty is an obligation to someone or something outside of yourself.** This could be anything from an obligation to a significant other to a sense of responsibility for an organization. For example, a high-performing Marine feels a sense of duty to their country. Because of this, they’ll make sure that their actions reflect their desire to serve, even if that means sacrificing almost everything..

While underperformers may view obligation as a bad thing, high performers use it to help them get through even the most difficult challenges. **For them, duty creates an external motivation that pushes them to excel and reminds them _why_ they do what they do.**

#### Urgency

**Urgency refers to an obligation to a hard deadline** , rather than a soft deadline:

  * Soft deadlines are deadlines that don’t carry consequences. For example, if you tell yourself that you’re going to finish a puzzle by Friday but fail to do so, the ramifications won’t be severe. 
  * Hard deadlines, on the other hand, are deadlines that carry consequences. For example, if your boss tells you he needs your report on his desk by 2 p.m. for an important meeting, missing that deadline would lead to serious problems. 



**High performers hold themselves to hard deadlines because it creates a sense of urgency that helps them prioritize.** They don’t get distracted by soft deadlines, instead focusing their energy on completing time-sensitive tasks. Also, because these deadlines are usually set by other people, high performers recognize that their timeliness affects other people’s ability to do their jobs. This further encourages urgency and service.

### The Benefits of Drive, and the Risks of Its Absence

| **With Drive** | **Without Drive**  
---|---|---  
**Identity** | People with a strong identity **hold themselves to high standards and achieve or exceed those standards.** They push themselves to go above and beyond and take time to self-evaluate.  | People without a strong identity **don’t hold themselves to standards and often underperform.** They don’t push themselves to do more than the bare minimum and don’t take time to self-evaluate.   
**Obsession** | People who are obsessed with a topic**invest significant amounts of time studying, researching, and discussing their field of interest.** They take the time to implement what they’ve learned and strive to master the core concepts of their field.  | People who aren’t obsessed with a topic **don’t invest time in studying or researching a field of interest.** They may discuss it, but only at a surface level. They won’t take the time to implement what they’ve learned and they don’t care about mastery.   
**Duty** | People who feel a sense of duty to a person or group**push themselves to excel beyond the expectations of that person or group.** They understand why they’re doing what they do and who they’re serving in the process.  | People who don’t feel a sense of duty to a person or group**don’t care about the expectations or standards of others.** They don’t understand the purpose of their actions and don’t know who they’re benefiting in the process.   
**Urgency** | People who feel a sense of urgency**complete work in a timely manner.** They prioritize important things and create hard deadlines.  | People who don’t feel a sense of urgency **don’t complete work in a timely manner.** They don’t know how to prioritize and don’t use hard deadlines.   
  
### How to Find Your Drive

Drive is hard to obtain and easy to lose. Use the following practices to maintain the internal and external forces necessary to create drive: **prioritize, remind yourself of the “why,” and surround yourself with the best.**

#### Prioritize and Get in the “Flow”

**To be a high performer, know what tasks are the most important at a given moment.** This helps you maintain your sense of _duty_ and _urgency_. To do this, create a _“desk trigger.”_ Anytime you sit down at your desk, take a moment to think about who needs you the most in that moment, then focus your efforts accordingly.

**Once you know where to focus your attention, give 100% to the task at hand.** When you give all of your attention to a challenging but achievable goal, you may get in the “flow.” When in the “flow”:

  * You feel internal satisfaction.
  * You lack self-consciousness and feel calm.
  * You lose track of time. 
  * You know how you’re doing performance-wise.
  * You have the skills to complete the task, even if it’s difficult.
  * You have control over the outcome of the situation.
  * You forget about your personal needs.
  * You’re completely focused on the task at hand.



#### Remind Yourself of the “Why”

**To become a high performer, determine why you’re doing what you’re doing, then repeat the reason to yourself frequently.** Don’t just _think_ it— _say_ it. Verbalizing helps you solidify and affirm what you’re thinking. For example, if you’re an athlete with the goal of going pro, tell yourself before every workout, “This workout gets you one step closer to the big leagues. Your pain today will lead to strength tomorrow.”

**Note: Having a strong sense of _why_ you’re doing something doesn’t mean you should be married to _how_ you do it.** Be on the lookout for better and more effective ways to work towards your goals and have the humility to embrace new concepts when they come to your attention. Be willing to adopt new technology and concepts if they help you achieve your goals. Don’t get stuck in your ways of “doing things” just because they’re comfortable.

#### Surround Yourself With the Best

**To be a high performer, surround yourself with people who are smart, positive, and driven.** This helps you develop and maintain _all four_ forces (identity, obsession, duty, and urgency) of drive. It solidifies your internal standards, gives you role models who share your obsessions, creates accountability through mentorship, and urges you to take action to improve. To surround yourself with the best, consider the following actions:

  * **Make a new, positive friend.** Adding just one positive person to your life can have incredible benefits and improve your overall outlook on life.
  * **Seek out volunteer opportunities.** Positive, service-driven people are drawn to volunteer opportunities. Taking the time to volunteer gives you a chance to interact with selfless people who aren’t driven by factors such as money or prestige. These experiences and interactions will help you develop empathy and understanding that will spread into your other relationships.
  * **Participate in organized sports.** Competitive activities hone your self-evaluation skills and give you clear goals that you must work hard to achieve. You can apply the drive that you develop in a competitive atmosphere to the work that you’re passionate about.
  * **Find a mentor.** Mentors are people who are older and wiser than you. Find someone who you look up to and ask them for guidance. Talk to them often, listen to their advice, and have them hold you accountable.
  * **Earn your spot.** Work hard and achieve success to get into the same rooms as other high performers. The more you accomplish, the more doors open up to you.
