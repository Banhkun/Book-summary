## 1-Page Summary

**High performers are people who maintain their success and well-being over a long period of time.** Many people believe that if they work hard, practice consistently, and focus on the things they’re good at, they’ll become one of these high performers. However, while these are wonderful practices, they don’t lead to high performance.

High performance is _consistent_ and _continued_ success and growth at a high level. It requires that you build effective habits, adapt to your environment, and align your priorities. **There are six high-performance habits (the HP6) that will help achieve your goals in a healthy and sustainable way.**

They’re _deliberate habits_ , or habits that you actively choose to do and constantly revisit to improve your performance. They’re often challenging and require your full attention. This book explains why each of these habits is important, the dangers of not developing them, and ways to implement them in your daily life. The six high-performance habits are:

  * **Search for Clarity**
  * **Improve Your Health**
  * **Find Your Drive**
  * **Increase Your Efficiency**
  * **Generate Influence**
  * **Be Courageous**



### Habit #1: Search for Clarity

**To become a high performer, you need clarity, or the ability to identify who you are and what you want.** Clarity isn’t something that emerges on its own. It requires reflection and experimentation as you search for the values that matter to you and the goals that will define your journey. People with high levels of clarity tend to be more motivated, confident, and productive.

#### How to Search for Clarity

There are two ways to gain and maintain clarity in your life: **Identify the feelings you’re seeking and determine what’s significant.**

##### Identify the Feelings You’re Seeking

**Emotions and feelings are different.** Emotions are an instinctive response to a trigger. In contrast, feelings are your interpretation of any emotion. You _can’t_ choose your emotions, but you _can_ choose your feelings. For example, if an employee is late for the fourth time in a row, your immediate _emotion_ may be anger. However, if you take a moment to make yourself _feel_ calm, you’ll come into the situation more level-headed.

**When something happens, take a moment to think, “What _feeling_ am I bringing into this situation, and what _feeling_ do I want to receive from this situation?” **This lets you control how you handle your emotional responses. When negative emotions come to the surface, try to channel that energy into a positive feeling, using your body’s natural responses to deal with a high-intensity situation.

##### Determine What’s Significant

While high performers can tackle almost any task thrown their way, not every challenge is worth the effort. **High performers spend their time investing in purposeful things and avoid the trials that don’t hold any meaning for them.** For example, if you’re passionate about fitness, training for a marathon would be worth your time. While other challenges such as learning to cook or building a computer may be interesting, they aren’t meaningful in your life and, therefore, shouldn’t be your focus.

### Habit #2: Improve Your Health

**To be a high performer, you need to tend to your health and well-being because good health builds happiness, focus, and energy.** Your health includes your mental, emotional, and physical well-being.

#### How to Maintain Your Health

To develop healthier habits, **master transitions and treat your body better.**

##### Master Transitions

People tend to carry tension without knowing it. **To ensure that you don’t allow your frustrations to impact the rest of your day, learn to master transitions.** A transition is the moment between two tasks or interactions. For example, if you’re responding to emails, then begin working on a project, you have a moment of transition between the two tasks.

If you feel frustrated or stressed after a task, use these transitional moments to do the following:

  * Close your eyes and breathe.
  * Relax the areas of your body that are tense. Focus on your shoulders, neck, face, and jaw.
  * Dictate the energy and perspective you want to bring into your next task or interaction.



##### Treat Your Body Better

**When you take care of your body, your emotional and mental health improve alongside your physical health.** Eating healthy, working out regularly, and sleeping well give you energy, create mental clarity, and release chemicals in your brain that help with emotional management.

Improve your physical well-being by developing the following habits:

  * **Eat healthier.** Avoid overeating and cut out unhealthy foods. Find a long-term eating plan that you can stick to, then hold yourself accountable.
  * **Create a regular workout schedule.** This doesn’t have to be an intensive exercise regimen. Activities such as walking, cycling, or swimming at least three times a week will reduce anxiety levels and increase your overall health.
  * **Sleep at least eight hours a night.** Sleep gives your body a chance to rest and recover. Eight hours of sleep gives you more energy and focus during the day.



### Habit #3: Find Your Drive

**Drive is the force that motivates you to do your best work.** It helps you stay on-track through even the most difficult challenges. Driven people know their motivations, are obsessed with their field of interest, feel a sense of duty to others, and hold themselves to deadlines.

#### How to Find Your Drive

Finding your drive requires active exploration and internal affirmation. Drive is hard to obtain and easy to lose. Use the following practices to maintain the internal and external forces necessary to create drive: **Remind yourself of the “why” and surround yourself with the best.**

##### Remind Yourself of the “Why”

**Constantly remind yourself _why_ you do what you do. **Don’t just _think_ it— _say_ it. Verbalizing helps you solidify and affirm what you’re thinking. For example, if you’re an athlete with the goal of going pro, tell yourself before every workout, “This workout gets you one step closer to the big leagues. Your pain today will lead to strength tomorrow.”

##### Surround Yourself With the Best

**Surround yourself with people who are smart, positive, and driven** :

  * **Make a new, positive friend.** Adding just one positive person to your life can have incredible benefits and improve your overall outlook on life.
  * **Seek out volunteer opportunities.** Positive, service-driven people are drawn to volunteer opportunities. 
  * **Participate in organized sports.** Competitive activities hone your self-evaluation skills and give you clear goals that you must work hard to achieve. 
  * **Find a mentor.** Mentors are people who are older and wiser than you. Find someone that you look up to and ask them for guidance.
  * **Earn your spot.** Work hard and achieve success to get into the same rooms as other high performers. The more you accomplish, the more doors open up to you. 



### Habit #4: Increase Your Efficiency

**Increased efficiency helps you focus on the important things in your life and maintain your work-life balance.** Efficient people are less stressed and more fulfilled. There are three factors that impact your efficiency:

  * **Goals:** Set clear and challenging goals that give you the motivation to work effectively.
  * **Energy:** Ensure you have the energy to get through your day happily and healthily.
  * **Focus:** Focus on the tasks that are important to you.



#### How to Increase Your Efficiency

Efficiency requires planning, reflection, and focus. **Methods to increase your efficiency include planning your “five moves” and mastering important skills.**

##### Plan Your “Five Moves”

Work toward an objective and focus your energy and attention on the tasks that are most important to your success. To create a long-term plan, find your _“five moves”_ :

  * **Solidify your goal.** Make sure it’s clear and specific.
  * **Write down the five _major_ moves you’d need to make to achieve that goal.** These are big steps that require many smaller tasks to achieve. For example, if your goal is to become a published author, one of your major steps may be to “get a literary agent” or “find a way to self-publish.”
  * **Under each of your five major moves, write down a list of tasks that you need to do to accomplish that step.** For example, if your goal is to “get a literary agent,” your tasks would include researching agencies, crafting writing samples, fixing up your resume, and practicing your interviewing skills.
  * **Once you have a list of tasks, put them into your calendar and hold yourself to hard deadlines.** Giving yourself a specific schedule will motivate you to complete tasks in a timely manner.



##### Master Important Skills

**To start your journey towards mastery, define the five most important skills in your field.** Constantly be on the lookout for new educational opportunities and improved ways of working. For example, if you’re a salesperson, important skills include communication, problem-solving, customer service, negotiation, and market awareness.

**Instead of simple repetition, practice _progressive mastery_ to improve your skills. **Progressive mastery relies on setting increasingly challenging goals, attaching meaning to your process, and using teaching as a method to learn. Here are the steps of progressive mastery:

  * Define the skill you want to work on. 
  * Make long-term stretch goals that will challenge you.
  * Attach meaning to your work by reminding yourself why it's important.
  * Visualize success _and_ failure.
  * Schedule time to practice challenges and exercises created by experts.
  * Chart your progress and invite external feedback. 
  * Share your learning experience by competing or practicing with others. 
  * If you reach a goal, set another goal that challenges you even further.
  * Take time to teach others what you’re learning.



### Habit #5: Generate Influence

**To become a high performer, you need a group of people around you who are willing to support and invest in you.** The best way to achieve this is by generating _influence_. Influence is your ability to mold other people’s perspectives and behaviors. With high levels of influence, you’ll boost your performance by avoiding unnecessary conflicts and developing a network of support.

#### How to Generate Influence

Influence is not tied to personality traits such as introversion or extroversion. Anyone can become influential if they put energy into developing their relationships. If you can create strong relationships with your friends, family, and colleagues, you will begin to gain the influence necessary for high performance. **To foster these relationships, be generous and consider the ways you can use influence as a leader.**

##### Be Generous

**Be willing to provide favors.** The more willing you are to give, the more your friends, family, and colleagues will trust and respect you. Often, people avoid being generous by making the excuse, “I’m simply too busy.” If you feel you’re too busy to be helpful or generous, chances are you have a time-management problem or are just unwilling to be generous.

##### Influence and Leadership

As a leader, gain influence by using the following three principles:

  * **Change how people think:** High performers show others how they want them to think. By asking framing statements and questions such as, “Think about it like this…” or “What would you think if I…”, you can adjust the way people look at a situation. If you lead people into more efficient models of thinking, you’ll start to earn their trust. As you do, you’ll be able to shape the way that they think about their role and their impact on the world around them. 
  * **Challenge people to raise the bar:** High performers know how to challenge the people around them without insulting or degrading them. They set standards for the people around them and hold them accountable. Though they have to endure the occasional awkward conversation, high performers know how important it is to push people to meet and exceed expectations.
  * **Practice what you preach:** Once they’ve set high standards and shown people how to think, high performers adhere to the expectations they set.**** If you don’t, people will view you as hypocritical and ignore your guidance. 



### Habit #6: Be Courageous

**High performers courageously step into the unknown and take action.** Courage is the willingness to take purposeful action in service of a worthy and sincere goal despite fear, danger, or adversity. Even if they don’t know the ultimate outcome, high performers have a tendency towards action over discussion. Courageous people speak up for themselves, respond effectively in crisis, and master new skills.

#### How to Be Courageous

Courage requires a mindset of gratitude, a tendency for action, and the willingness to face your fears. High performers use these qualities to embrace risk and live confidently. **To begin to develop courage, appreciate the hardship.**

##### Appreciate the Hardship

**Hardship is often the route to success.** It develops your character, thickens your skin, and builds your skillset. For example, a world-class athlete didn’t get to the top of their game by using “get fit quick” plans. They worked out every single day, struggled through injuries, and fought to overcome obstacles.

To change your mindset on hardship, consider the following principles:

  * **Embrace the challenge.** Learn to enjoy taking on and overcoming obstacles. This will help you change your fear to excitement. 
  * **Accept that difficult and unappealing tasks are essential to growth.** There is no “easy way” to high performance. Remind yourself that the frustrating tasks you’re facing are helping you grow as a person.
  * **See the light at the end of the tunnel.** Always remember that there are better times ahead. Remind yourself why you’re doing what you do and fight relentlessly towards that goal.



### Maintaining High Performance

To sustain your success, be aware of the three traps that often cause high performers to fail: **feeling superior, being unsatisfied, and neglecting important things.**

#### Trap #1: Feeling Superior

**When you become a high performer, it’s easy to feel superior without realizing it.** Because you’re at the top of your game, you may subconsciously look down on people who haven’t achieved as much as you have.

**Humility is the antidote to feelings of superiority.** It keeps you from demeaning the people around you and shows you the value other people bring to the table. It also reminds you that you always have more room to grow.

#### Trap #2: Being Discontented

Many people believe that contentment prevents progress because it promotes “settling.” They’d rather use discontent to drive them to find “the _next_ project” or “a _better_ way.” However, while staying motivated is important, discontent creates negative thoughts.

**High performers are able to stay motivated without resorting to negativity.** While they accept critiques and strive to improve, they find contentment in what they do by recognizing their accomplishments. Their positive attitude keeps them from becoming overwhelmed by their work and helps them build relationships with their colleagues and friends.

##### How to Avoid Being Discontented

To**** be content without “settling”:

  * **Take pride in the work you’ve already done.** While listening to feedback and critiquing your process is important, be sure to acknowledge what you’ve done well. 
  * **Share your accomplishments and encourage others to do the same.** Open communication about success boosts morale and keeps people motivated. 
  * **Reframe your perspective.** Changing the way you motivate yourself allows you to stay positive while pushing forward. For example, instead of saying, “My work’s not good enough,” try saying, “This part of my work is good, and this is what needs improvement.” 
  * **Journal your progress.** Every day, write down three things that went well. Describe any growth you felt that day. This allows you to look back and reflect on the good things in your life as well as on your development.



#### Trap #3: Neglecting Important Things

As a high performer, there are a lot of important things that you have to juggle at once. **It's easy to lose sight of what’s important in your professional and personal life.** These gaps in your focus can lower the quality of your work and lead to significant failures.

##### How to Avoid Neglecting Important Things

**As you begin to reflect on your current circumstances and listen to the people around you, you’ll likely become aware of areas you’re neglecting.** Take responsibility for your action (or inaction), and develop a plan to address the areas that you’ve overlooked. This requires patience, diligence, and a willingness to listen. To avoid neglecting important things in your life:

  * **Determine what’s _actually_ important. **As a high performer, you likely feel the drive to excel at everything you do. While this is a noble perspective, it can also lead you to put significant levels of energy and focus into unimportant areas. Find and define the most important things in your life and be sure that you’re putting the proper amount of energy into those things.
  * **Be willing to say no.** While you may want to take on as many projects as possible, you can’t sacrifice quality for quantity. Especially when you’re busy, only agree to the projects that are important to you or your work and politely decline any offers that don’t support your goals. 



### Exude Confidence

As you work on the six high-performance habits, one of the most important characteristics to develop is confidence. Confidence helps you take bold steps in the face of obstacles or adversity because it reminds you that you have the strength to overcome and succeed.

#### The Three C’s of Confidence

**Even when under immense pressure, high performers know how to generate the confidence to push ahead.** Confidence isn’t something you’re born with. It requires patience, hard work, and persistence. To build your confidence, think about the following characteristics:

  * **Competence:** High performers are confident in their abilities. They use their knowledge and skills to feed their confidence. To develop competence, take the time to master important skills. The more you know about a topic, the more confident you can be in your abilities.
  * **Congruence** : High performers are confident in who they are. They have a clear self-image and act in accordance with their values. To develop congruence, have a strong sense of identity, define your values, and set your intentions. Once you know those things, you won’t second guess any choices that align with them. 
  * **Connection:** High performers use their relationships to build their competence and congruence. They use interactions with their family, friends, and colleagues to learn more about themselves and their work. To develop connection, engage with the people around you and seek out opportunities for education and development.
