## Habit #6: Be Courageous

**High performers are courageous.** Courage is the willingness to take purposeful action in service of a worthy and sincere goal despite fear, danger, or adversity. These actions don’t have to be bold to be effective. Any step toward overcoming fear or embracing the uncertain is a courageous act.**** Courage _doesn’t_ include actions that harm other people or encourage needless risk.

There are four primary types of courage:

  * **Physical:** courage in which you put yourself in danger for a worthy cause
  * **Moral:** courage in which you stand up for your beliefs in the face of adversity
  * **Psychological:** courage in which you overcome a personal fear or anxiety and grow
  * **Everyday:** courage in which you maintain positivity in the face of uncertainty



**Even if they don’t know the ultimate outcome, high performers have a tendency towards action over discussion.** While they’ll strategize and plan when necessary, they don’t get lost in talking about doing something. This allows for quick decision-making and decisive action, boosting your performance.

### The Benefits of Courage, and the Risks of Its Absence

| **With Courage** | **Without Courage**  
---|---|---  
**Decision-Making** | **Courageous people make quick-decisions and take decisive action.** Even in the face of fear or adversity, they don’t just talk about doing something. They actually do it, even if they’re afraid.  | **Uncourageous people don’t make decisions or take action.** They often talk about doing something, but they rarely actually do it, usually out of fear of failure, judgment, or retaliation.   
**Crisis** | **Courageous people act quickly in a crisis.** They don’t let the circumstances overwhelm them and respond to the needs of others.  | **Uncourageous people freeze up in a crisis.** They let the circumstances overwhelm them and focus on their own needs over the needs of others.   
**Hardship** | **Courageous people embrace hardship and don’t complain about their work.** They know that their actions serve a purpose and focus on the good they’re doing over the difficulty of their present circumstances.  | **Uncourageous people fear hardship and frequently complain about their work.** They don’t have a clear purpose for their actions and are too focused on the difficulty of their present circumstance to look to the future.   
**Growth** | **Courageous people take active steps towards growth, even when those steps require risk.** This allows them to develop skills quickly and leads them down avenues they may not have known about before.  | **Uncourageous people only take steps towards growth if there’s no risk involved.** This prevents them from developing quickly and shuts them out of avenues that could have benefited their development.   
  
### How to Be Courageous

Courage requires a mindset of gratitude, a tendency for action, and the willingness to face your fears. These qualities allow you to embrace risk and live confidently. **To build your courage, consider these tips: appreciate the hardship, share your dreams, and fight for someone.**

#### Appreciate the Hardship

People are always searching for the “easy way” to do things. Whether it's getting rich or getting fit, people don’t want to put in the work to achieve their goals. This aversion to hardship prevents people from developing healthy habits and taking risks.

**High performers know that hardship is often the route to success.** It develops your character, thickens your skin, and builds your skillset. For example, a world-class athlete didn’t get to the top of their game by using “get fit quick” plans. They worked out every single day, struggled through injuries, and fought to overcome obstacles.

To change your mindset on hardship:

  * **Embrace the challenge.** Learn to enjoy taking on and overcoming obstacles. This will help you change your fear to excitement. 
  * **Accept that difficult and unappealing tasks are essential to growth.** There is no “easy way” to high performance. Remind yourself that the frustrating tasks you’re facing are helping you grow as a person.
  * **See the light at the end of the tunnel.** Always remember that there are better times ahead. Remind yourself why you’re doing what you do and fight relentlessly towards that goal.



#### Share Your Dreams

Many people refuse to share their goals out of fear of judgment or ridicule. They’ve been taught that expressing your ambition is pretentious and demeaning. This leads people to hide their desires from others and minimize their own accomplishments.

**However, high performers overcome their fear of judgment and openly talk about their dreams and achievements,** finding**** the people that will support them and getting away from the people that tear them down. For example, you share your dream of starting a small business with Martha and Kendra. Martha tells you that you should focus on more “attainable” goals. Kendra, on the other hand, immediately starts brainstorming with you about next steps. Because you shared your dream, you now know that Martha is someone who will tear you down, while Kendra is a great source of support and encouragement.

As you start to share your dreams, consider the following tips:

  * **Ask for help.** The more you ask for assistance, the more opportunities you have to find supportive people to help you reach your goals.
  * **Don’t minimize your ambition.** If you feel strongly about a goal, share your vision with fervor. This keeps you motivated and helps you connect with high-achievers. Don’t suppress your dreams to make them more “realistic” or “relatable.”
  * **Ignore the haters.** When you have big dreams, there will inevitably be people who scoff at your ambition or want to bring you down. They’re not worth your time and shouldn’t be the reason that you abandon your goals. Just because _they’re_ not living life to the fullest, doesn’t mean _you_ shouldn’t.



#### Fight for Someone

**High performers find someone to fight for.** This motivates them to overcome difficult or frightening obstacles for the benefit of someone they care about. For example, if you want to provide for your child’s education, you may fight harder for a promotion or lucrative project.

People are more inclined to go above and beyond for others than for themselves. For example, a mother may not argue with her boss for treating her poorly, but she’ll fight for their child if she sees them being bullied.
