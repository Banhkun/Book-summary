## Exercise: Show Others How to Think

As a leader, when you show your employees how to think, you gain their trust and help them approach their work from a new perspective. This helps boost the performance of your team as a whole.

* * *

Think of a specific employee whose thinking you want to shape. How do you want them to think about themselves?

How do you want them to think of other people?

How do you want them to think of the world-at-large?
