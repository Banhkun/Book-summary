## Exercise: Examine Your Perspectives

Each person has a unique set of perspectives that determine how they see the world and how they react to people, events, and situations. Use this exercise to better understand your perspectives.

* * *

Describe a recent situation in which you and another person interpreted an event or situation differently. Whether this was an interaction between the two of you or a story in the news, you both had access to the same facts but each had a different takeaway.

What was your reaction to hearing the other personâ€™s interpretation?

Now that you have an understanding of perspectives, describe the perspective(s) that might have caused you to interpret the situation the way you did.

Now think of how the same perspective(s) influence you in other situations in your life. Is this a view that is benefitting you overall, or one that you might consider changing? Why?
