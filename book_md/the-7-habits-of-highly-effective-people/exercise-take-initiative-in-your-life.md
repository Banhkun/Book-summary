## Exercise: Take Initiative in Your Life

You need an initiative-taking mindset to grow and make positive changes in your life. Use this exercise to examine your mindset so you can become more proactive.

* * *

Describe a recent conflict or situation in which a person or circumstance was troubling you, and how you handled it.

Which aspects of that situation could you affect, and which ones were beyond your influence? Did you focus your energy and actions more on things that you could or couldn’t impact?

How could you have taken more initiative?

What are some reactive things you often say to yourself (like “that’s just the way things are”)? How can you turn these into proactive statements instead?
