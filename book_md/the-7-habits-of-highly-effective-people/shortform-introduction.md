## Shortform Introduction

_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ distills common knowledge and oft-repeated wisdom—from classic philosophy to religious teachings—into **seven lifelong practices for building a successful, fulfilling life**. Rather than small, daily actions like brushing your teeth, these habits are patterns of thinking and acting that represent a broader approach to life. Collectively, the seven habits help you to identify and accomplish the things that are most important to you.

In this classic, Stephen R. Covey is credited with creating the “business self-help” genre with advice that draws on his business management expertise as well as his Mormon faith. The seven habits are applicable for both personal and professional growth—and that has played a large part in the book’s enduring success.

The seven habits are:

  * Take Initiative
  * Envision the Life You Want
  * Prioritize Important Over Urgent
  * Seek Mutual Benefits
  * Listen and Understand the Other First
  * Collaborate to Create Possibilities
  * Practice Self-Renewal



### About the Author

Covey (1932-2012) was an educator, management consultant, and prolific author of self-help, business, and leadership books. **Covey’s drive to help others live effectivelystemmed from his desire to live that way himself**—and that set him apart from other self-help authors, according to his friend Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business School professor and author of _The Innovator’s Dilemma_.

In classes, books, and training courses,**Covey spent his career educating people on business management, leadership skills, and personal improvement** , and he accumulated a variety of accolades for his work.

  * He helped create the Master of Organizational Behavior program while on the faculty at Brigham Young University, where he had earned his doctorate. 
  * In 1983, he left BYU to **found the Covey Leadership Center** (now FranklinCovey), which continues to train individuals and organizations in personal effectiveness, sales performance, leadership, and business execution.
  * In 1996, _Time magazine named Covey one of the 25 most influential Americans_. 
  * In 2010, he joined the faculty at Utah State University. (Six years after Covey’s death, the university established the Stephen R. Covey Leadership Center.)

### The Book’s Publication

**Publisher:** Free Press, an independent publisher later acquired by Simon & Schuster.

Published in 1989, _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ was Covey’s breakout success. While some of his earlier books—including _Spiritual Roots of Human Relations_ (1970) and _The Divine Center_ (1982)—were geared toward a Mormon audience, **_7 Habits_ gained traction by targeting a mainstream audience and exploring the intersection of Covey’s areas of interest**: business, leadership, self-improvement, and how to lead a balanced life.

_The 7 Habits_ became such a cultural force that it essentially evolved into its own brand. The book spawned a number of adaptations, including:

  * _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Families _(1997)
  * _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens_ (1998), written by one of Covey’s sons, Sean Covey
  * _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Marriage _(2008)
  * _The 7 Habits on the Go _(2020)



The book was also re-released for the 25th and 30th anniversaries. **This guide refers to the 25th-anniversary edition**.

Other Covey bestsellers include:

  * _First Things First_ (1994), which elaborates on Habit 3 (prioritize important things) from _7 Habits_
  * _Principle-Centered Leadership_ (1992)
  * _The 8th Habit _(2004)



### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

When _7 Habits_ was published at the close of the 1980s, its focus on self-reflection, personal improvement, and collaboration was well-timed to satisfy new needs and interests in both the business and self-help genres:

  * As a management book, **the emphasis on personal development and effective relationships meta swell of interest in how to be an effective leader** at a time when many American corporate leaders were focused on cutting costs and boosting the bottom line. New research showing that supporting employee morale increases productivity and profit fueled interest in the concept of corporate culture.
  * As a self-help book, **the habits were equally applicable for everyday people looking for meaning, happiness, and a new definition of success in a decade of consumerism.** The ‘80s brought the rise of “yuppies,” or young professionals, whose vision of success required an impressive degree, a big paycheck, and material goods—but who struggled to find happiness and deeper meaning in life. 



#### Intellectual Context

**In the evolution of self-help books,_7 Habits_ takes a _character-focused_** **approach to self-improvement** , amid a sea of _behavior-focused_ self-help classics like _How to Win Friends and Influence People_. As an example, if you want to be a better listener, the behavior-centered (outward) approach would offer tips on attentive listening, while the character-focused (internal) approach would emphasize the importance of listening in relationships. (We’ll talk more about internal and external approaches in Chapter 1.)

Covey appears to be influenced by Peter F. Drucker, bestselling author of the 1966 classic _The Effective Executive_ and the “father of management thinking”. Drucker believed that the root of a company’s success is its people, and he urged leaders to prioritize workers and relationships over output and profits. Drucker said that effectiveness required a set of repeated practices that progressively improved competence—and Covey’s seven habits are precisely that.

#### The Book’s Impact

In the crowded self-help landscape, **_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ has distinguished itself as an enduring classic. **The book remains the fifth best-selling self-help book ever published more than 30 years after its publication, as it is a staple on the bookshelves of entrepreneurs and political leaders alike. Covey even counseled President Bill Clinton and more than 25 other national leaders on integrating the habits into their leadership.

Among the book’s many accolades, it:

  * Was a _New York Times_ bestseller for more than four years
  * Sold more than 40 million copies in over 50 languages
  * Was one of Time magazine’s “25 Most Influential Business Management Books” in 2011



### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

The book’s two signature features—the distillation of common wisdom and the habits framework—are the primary objects of praise as well as criticism:

1) The **common wisdom** at the core of the seven habits (such as identifying what’s truly important in life) is universal enough to resonate with people from diverse regions, backgrounds, and cultures. Fans feel that the timeless, universal principles add credibility to Covey’s advice and ensure that it will still be applicable for years to come. On the other hand, some critics accuse Covey of merely repackaging established truths without offering new insights.

2) The **habits**create a framework for applying the universal principles. Some praise Covey for turning the common wisdom into practices, while others argue that the habits aren’t specific enough to be actionable. For example, the book goes into detail about the importance of changing your paradigms or thought patterns in order to solve problems in your life, but one reviewer notes that Covey doesn’t explain specifically _how_ to change your paradigms. (Shortform note: Where possible, we’ve added more specific strategies to carry out his advice.)

#### Commentary on Book’s Approach

Although _7 Habits_ is considered a _business_ self-help book, it has two elements that distinguish it from most business books. First, Covey focuses heavily on developing _personal_ character and living a life guided by principles. **The book primarily focuses on the individual, intermittently explaining how the principles apply to organizations.** Considering his inside-out philosophy of self-improvement, it’s only logical that his advice for business success would start not in the office, but in the mind.

Second, **the text is sprinkled with mentions of God and faith**(for instance, Covey notes that he believes that God is the source of “correct” universal principles). Covey acknowledges that his faith colors his interpretation and application of the habits, and, according to Clayton Christensen—fellow Mormon and business author—the seven habits are rooted in Mormon teachings. However, the principles that underlie the seven habits transcend any single religion; therefore, it is not necessary to believe in God in order to understand, agree with, or apply the seven habits.

As for the effectiveness of Covey’s habits, we must first define what it is to be an effective person. **To Covey, living effectively means being aware of your guiding values, prioritizing things that help you live up to those values, and working efficiently and cooperatively with others.** And, overall, the habits appear to achieve that—but the text relies more heavily on anecdotes, fables, and common sense than on scientific research (though studies have since emerged confirming his assertions, as we’ll discuss later).

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Covey first lays out the habits’ _approach_ and _goal_ : His approach is character-driven (as opposed to behavior-focused) self-improvement, and his goal is interdependence, which balances self-sufficiency with cooperation and collaboration.

**The habits, then, are organized to reflect this method and destination** :

  * Habits 1-3 target aspects of your internal life, including your thoughts and goals. 
  * Habits 4-6 improve your interactions and relationships with others. 
  * Habit 7 discusses the importance of self-renewal (or self-care, to use the modern buzzword). This habit enables you to continue practicing and mastering the previous six habits in a virtuous cycle. 



### Our Approach in This Guide

This guide aims to simplify and build on Covey’s advice to make it as useful as possible. For clarity, each chapter follows the same organization:

  * A brief description of the principle or habit
  * Why It Matters: An explanation of the habit’s significance and merit
  * How To: Strategies for putting it into practice
  * Going Deeper: Additional details on an aspect of the habit’s importance or application



In places where Covey’s advice is limited or abstract, we’ve provided additional, specific tips. In several cases, we’ve drawn comparisons and added suggestions from Tony Robbins’s _Awaken the Giant Within_ , which has many parallels with the concepts in Habits 1-3.

Additionally, we’ve used more descriptive terms meant to be easier to understand and remember than Covey’s, and we’ve noted those changes.
