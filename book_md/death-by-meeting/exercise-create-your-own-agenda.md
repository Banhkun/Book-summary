## Exercise: Create Your Own Agenda

This exercise will help you apply these principles to your own meetings.

* * *

Think about your workplace. What would the contents of a good check-in (quick 5-minute) meeting be?

What about a good tactical (weekly, hour-long) meeting?

What topics should you cover in a good strategic (biweekly, two hours long) meeting?

And finally, what topics should you go over in your review (quarterly, off-site) meeting?
