## Part 5: Success

The team in the room accepted the finer points of each meeting and mostly liked the ideas. But while presenting, Will let slip that J.T. and Wade would be attending a meeting to assess Casey’s performance, and that Casey’s job was on the line. The team was up in arms about the possibility of Casey getting fired over meeting performance, but Casey assured the team that they needed to fix the meetings not only for his own job security, but also for the functioning of the company.

Will was feeling nervous, so he called an administrative assistant he knew in Chicago to try and get some more intel on J.T. She told him that she couldn’t say too much, but when Playsoft acquired her subsidiary company, she and her boss both almost quit after J.T. came around to the company frequently.

Will and Casey started to prepare for the fast-approaching meeting.**First, they decided that they would do a strategic meeting, as this would best show J.T. the enthusiasm that the team had developed for their new meeting strategy.** They wanted to bring up a couple of important issues and discuss them well in earshot of J.T. and Wade. Casey, who had been despondent about his situation, started to get motivated.

Rather than simulate a meeting or rehearse, the team decided to prepare by figuring out their agenda and doing research to come prepared for a great strategy session. Each member of the executive team put forward an idea for discussion at the upcoming meeting, from which they chose two for the agenda: whether they should sponsor a tournament on the PGA tour and whether they should make games other than niche sports ones.

Throughout the week, Casey didn’t do much research of his own, as he wanted to come to the meeting with a fresh perspective, able to interrogate his team’s thoughts without sounding practiced or robotic. As the team moved through the week doing their research, the spirits in the office also lifted. They were working harder, staying through dinner, but they felt as if they had a purpose.

At the end of the week, though, when Casey did a check-in, his teams were concerned—they weren’t agreeing with one another and felt they didn’t have enough data to make one clear suggestion. Casey reminded them all, though, that this was good. Well-articulated debate was what they were hoping for in the meeting.

### The Big Day

When the day arrived for the meeting, Wade’s assistant informed Casey that Wade actually wouldn’t be coming. It was only J.T. who would be at the meeting and would have the final say. Casey was nervous.

As everyone filed into the meeting room, J.T. greeted Casey, and they commenced with discussion. The leader of the first team, Sophia, presented the question at issue—whether Yip should start making games other than sports.

**As she began her presentation, Casey immediately interrupted, asking for a concrete recommendation**. Sophia hemmed and hawed, but Will then interrupted, presenting his thoughts on the issue. A spirited debate, led by Casey, began. Casey stated up front that he was opposed to the idea of expansion into different kinds of games at the moment. Some on the team, though, argued that the numbers showed that they needed to expand, because sports games were becoming less popular relative to the gaming industry as a whole. They debated this decision for about an hour.

Finally, everyone weighed in with their final decision. The room was split. Casey then made his final decision, while admitting that he had gone back and forth throughout the hour—they were actually going to contract their portfolio a bit, focusing explicitly on golf and less on other sports games. They agreed, as an executive team, that they could cut into the market share of their competitors if everyone worked harder and better. They would also have to lay off some people at the margins.

At this point, they were attempting to move on to the second topic, when J.T. finally interrupted to ask them what their numbers have been looking like. Casey was a little phased, but he responded that they don’t talk numbers at their monthly strategic meeting. J.T. pushed him, but **Casey remained steadfast—he was willing to show J.T. the numbers, but only after the two-hour meeting was up.** Will was impressed.

So they moved on to the question of PGA sponsorship—the team leader Connor began by explaining that, in the grand scheme of things, the sponsorship was less expensive than they believed it would be. There was some disagreement from Sophia, though, that the sponsorship would take away from their advertising in other areas, which was already weak. She explained, after J.T. asked about what their advertising impact was, that this was difficult to measure, because people generally bought from pro golf shops, not Yip directly.

#### J.T. Leaves

They were in the midst of a robust discussion, and wondering if their decision made earlier in the meeting to focus more directly on golf games would impact their decision on sponsorship, when J.T.’s cell rang. He took the call, spoke for a few seconds, and then informed the team that he was leaving.

People in the meeting were confused, but J.T.’s departure had deflated some of the tension. The group cracked jokes about J.T. and took a quick break. When they came back, however, they were concerned. They had been preparing for this big meeting to impress J.T. and save their boss’s job, and J.T. had just left. Some in the room wanted to discuss why he had left or what had happened, but Casey insisted that they continue their sponsorship discussion. They finished up their discussion and agreed that sponsorship looked like a good choice in theory, but that they’d have to find the right tournament.

Casey addressed the team, telling them they’d had a great meeting. He also told them to try not to worry about J.T., because they had done all that they could. The team went out for lunch together.

### Post-Meeting Fallout

Casey was mostly heeding his own advice when he got a call from a friend at a different division. The friend told him that he had heard rumors that the next day, there was going to be a big announcement that somehow involved J.T. He started to worry, wondering what it could mean, and he stayed up thinking about the meeting, J.T., and the last few weeks.

When Casey arrived at his office and found an email from Wade. Wade wrote that he was retiring and J.T. would be replacing him as CEO. It also explained that, for the past few years, J.T. had been deeply involved in the acquisition of new companies and was chiefly responsible for turning around what he saw as deficiencies in the companies that Playsoft acquired. In doing so he upset many of the leaders of these companies, but he also watched their sales spike. Wade went on to say that he felt pleased to announce this publicly and explain some of the reasoning behind why J.T. had been so tough on new acquisitions.

Casey felt all kinds of emotions at this announcement. **It was almost unbelievable, but also a total relief, because he realized that rather than hanging onto his job by the skin of his teeth, he was participating in a strategy that had made Yip better.** He talked to his wife and thanked Will, while laughing with him about what they had gone through. At the end of the day, Casey decided to start packing up early and thought about going to play some golf.

In his office, though, was J.T. He sat down and tried to explain why he was so difficult and demanding. Casey, feeling a bit emboldened, asked if J.T. actually thought the meetings were such a big problem. J.T. said yes, because bad meetings could lead to bad decisions and end with a large amount of unfulfilled potential.

Casey asked if J.T. had ever intended to replace him, and J.T. said probably not. He expanded on his role to Casey, explaining that he had been equally demanding with other executives at Playsoft subsidiaries who didn’t have issues with meetings but had issues relating to performance or expenses. Given that Casey now understood J.T.’s motivation to make Yip (and all Playsoft acquisitions) better, he started to feel a bit better about his boss.

And then, J.T. explained that Casey shouldn’t tell anyone about his performance management techniques for two reasons. If Playsoft acquired another company, and they found out about J.T.’s techniques, then they wouldn’t work. And if the executive team found out that this was all partially a ruse to help improve performance and create urgency, they’d feel less motivated to keep going on their current track, which was working well.

J.T. concluded by explaining that while it was a partial ruse, it wasn’t a full ruse, because he did expect Casey’s meetings to improve a lot. If they didn’t improve at all, he would have had to think about what to do next. While he may not have fired Casey right away, he may have had to engage Casey in an intense training program to improve. All of this made sense to Casey, and he left their sitdown feeling confident about J.T. as the new CEO.

When the team found out that J.T. was taking over as CEO, they worried, but Casey assured them that he was keeping his job, so they started to feel better. Plus, their new meeting strategy was working, and they were starting to perform better in all aspects of their business. **Yip had a new energy that they were able to sustain.**

### Conclusion

Will worked with the team to implement their meeting strategy and iron out any potential issues, which included feeling the need to schedule more strategic meetings than was necessary because of disagreements that had come up at previous strategic meetings. He made sure they understood what could be solved by just some of them and what needed a full group meeting.

Within a few months, they were up to speed, after making small tweaks on Will’s system to make it run efficiently for Yip’s needs and specific challenges. Once the team was all set, Will didn’t see too much of a role for himself at the company, so he found Casey a decent replacement and set about following his dream of making it in the film industry.

A few years later, Will happened to run into Casey at a golf course in San Francisco. They decided to play together, and Casey caught Will up on everything going on with Yip. J.T., after a year, decided to step down as Playsoft’s CEO and form his own consulting business to help struggling companies get on track. **Yip, though, was still conducting the meetings as Will had organized them.** And when new people joined the team, they were confused and scared at first by the conflict, but they got to enjoy it.

### Lessons

  * Certain directed corporate subterfuge can be helpful in building companies’ capacities.
  * If a boss cares about her company and is willing to change, she can often switch around her fortunes. 
  * Encouraging and supporting conflict can lead to better outcomes.
