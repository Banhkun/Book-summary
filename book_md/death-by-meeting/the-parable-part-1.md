## The Parable | Part 1: Yip Launches

**The following parable shows how essential following the principles of running a good meeting is.** At the end of each section, we’ll briefly review lessons learned.

Casey has a lovely wife and kids, he’s a good neighbor, and he’s a regular churchgoer. He’s an easy person to respect, and his employees like him as a person—they just don’t like him as a boss.

Casey grew up caddying and playing at a golf course near his home in Monterey, California. He loved the game, and he went to college on a golf scholarship, where he continued to excel at golf. He also studied engineering and computer science.

After college, he continued pursuing his dream to make the PGA tour, earning money playing pro golf. But, as he was finally starting to break through in big tournaments, he got the yips—everything was fine with him physically, but psychologically, he stopped being able to put.

His dreams of a pro golf career over, Casey went home to Monterey and married, bought a small house with his savings, and decided to play to his strengths and launch a realistic golf video game. This combined his interest in computer science with his interest in golfing. He named his company Yip Software.

### Launch

After two years of work on his first game with two programmers, Yip released it. Because Casey knew so much about the sport, they were able to launch a realistic game, and golfers loved it. One of Casey’s friends on the PGA tour mentioned that Yip had helped his golf game in a press conference after he won a tournament. **This made Yip relevant and led the company to sustained commercial success.**

Casey hired 12 employees and opened an office, and he continued to expand in the years following. By the time the company turned 10, Yip had eight games on the market involving different sports, all with the same exactitude that made the first one a success. He also had 200 employees. While Yip was growing, Casey and his wife Patricia had four kids.

### Growth

Unfortunately, despite all of this apparent success, it was clear to anyone who watched closely that Yip could have been twice as successful if it had a better CEO. Casey was good at spotting what customers wanted and had a clear understanding of the market. However, he didn’t care that much about winning big—he was happy if the company had a small margin and he could play golf occasionally.

It was especially clear that the company was lethargic from attending just one meeting. The Yip team knew their meetings were boring and unfocused, but they decided that it was just part of their business and they didn’t do anything about it. This was part of a larger problem of malaise. No one wanted to stay late, work weekends, or ever discuss work outside of the hours of 9 to 5. Everyone would get modest raises each year, and everyone felt comfortable.

When employees did get out of the office to go to work-related conferences, they saw a passion that was nowhere to be found at Yip. But employees rarely left. The CEO was a nice guy, and there weren’t that many jobs out there like theirs.

### Lessons

  * Casey has all of the functioning parts of a good business, but his employees are bored.
  * His employees’ boredom comes largely from the unfocused meetings that Casey leads.
  * The company would be much more productive if Casey could figure out how to lead better meetings.
