## Exercise: Strengthen Your Leadership

In _Leadership Strategy and Tactics_ , Willink stresses the importance of humility, good relationships, and taking responsibility. Think about how you can do these things right.

* * *

Think of a time when a leader of yours didn’t show humility and it hurt morale. What happened? How did you or your teammates respond?

Consider how Willink’s advice about humility could have made a positive difference in this situation. If you were in this person’s place, how might you handle it, knowing what you know now? (For example, could you use less condescending language or listen more openly to your team?)

Next, reflect on the relationships that were at play. Was the person communicating clearly with the people on your team? As a leader, how would you prevent miscommunications?

Finally, was there any blaming that held up your team’s progress toward solutions? How do you think your team would have responded if the leader accepted responsibility for every aspect of the issue?
