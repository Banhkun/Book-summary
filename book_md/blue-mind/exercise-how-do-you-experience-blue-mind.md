## Exercise: How Do You Experience “Blue Mind”?

Reflect on your experience with the Blue Mind state and the ways you interact with water.

* * *

Identify a water-based activity that you enjoy. This could be a sport like swimming or surfing, or something as simple as showering.

Describe how this activity makes you feel. Does water help you relieve stress? How?

Does water have a pleasant sensory impact? Describe this impact. Perhaps you enjoy the play of light on the water or the feeling of weightlessness when swimming.

Consider how you could further incorporate water’s benefits into your life, and list them below. You could take up a water-based hobby, listen to recordings of water sounds, or get involved in environmental activism to protect water sources.
