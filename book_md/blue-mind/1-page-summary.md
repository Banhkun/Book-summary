## 1-Page Summary

In _Blue Mind_ , Wallace J. Nichols argues that **water has a profound impact on our well-being and health because it induces a calming, meditative state** he refers to as Blue Mind. He explains that we’re naturally drawn to water because it’s critical to our survival, and he elaborates on the additional benefits water provides us with, including its capacity to reduce stress and stimulate our senses in an enjoyable way. He describes several ways people can interact with water to get its benefits, and he also addresses the relationship between our society and water.

Nichols is a research associate at the California Academy of Sciences. He also co-founded and co-directs LiVBLUE, Ocean Revolution, and SEE the WILD.

In our guide, we’ll explore why humans are so attracted to water and describe the ways it reduces stress and allows the mind to heal and rest. We’ll also discuss why it appeals to various senses, such as sight and hearing, and look at different ways of being in or around water. We’ll conclude by exploring society’s relationship with water and how it might be improved. We’ll add scientific and social context for Nichols’s ideas and discuss alternatives to the tips he offers.

### We’re Naturally Drawn to Water

According to Nichols, humans evolved to want to be near water because it’s necessary for our survival. Throughout history, we’ve naturally gravitated toward habitats that included water, such as lakes, rivers, and coasts. Water consumption is necessary for life, but there were other reasons humans as a whole were drawn to water, as well.

Experts suggest that water sources—along with open spaces with low grass and trees—make up part of a “universal landscape,” or a natural environment that has all the resources necessary to ensure humans’ survival. The accessible water source provides water for consumption as well as a source of marine food, the grass and trees offer food and room to attract and hunt prey, and the open spaces provide visual clearance to detect incoming predators. **Forming communities near landscapes like this increased humans’ chances of survival** , resulting in an evolutionary connection between humans and water.

(Shortform note: Some experts theorize that we not only evolved to want to be near water, but that water and the food it offered also caused us to evolve the way we did. They argue that the omega-3 fatty acids abundant in marine food nourished the human brain and allowed it to grow larger and more advanced than it ever had when we dwelt in forests and less water-centric landscapes. This suggests that water didn’t just help us survive—it helped us develop the large, complex brains that now distinguish us from other animals.)

### The Meaning of “Blue Mind” and “Red Mind”

Nichols uses the term “Blue Mind” to describe water’s impact on the brain. Blue Mind is a calm, peaceful, contented state similar to one achieved through meditation, and it can be induced by proximity to water.

He distinguishes Blue Mind from “Red Mind,” which is a mental state characterized by stress and arousal, and he presents **the Blue Mind state as a potent antidote to the detrimental effects of the Red Mind state.** The stress response, also known as the fight or flight response, is an important evolutionary feature that developed to help us deal with danger. It enabled us to defend ourselves from threats or remove ourselves from threatening situations by flooding our bodies with stress hormones like norepinephrine, glucocorticoids, and cortisol. These hormones enhance our senses and awareness so we can better cope with danger.

(Shortform note: Nichols may use the terms “Blue Mind” and “Red Mind” to describe states of calm and stress because these states are indeed so different as to be akin to using two different minds. The changes that _chronic_ stress in particular brings about in the brain lead you to function very differently than you do when you’re not stressed. When you’re chronically stressed, the stress response that Nichols describes never shuts off, resulting in mood problems like depression and anxiety, as well as digestive issues and decreased libido and fertility. Again, the stress response isn’t inherently bad, but it is key that you be able to switch out of it into a Blue Mind state to avoid the negative side-effects of chronic stress.)

#### The Effects of Ongoing Stress

However, this stress response also triggers when we’re facing non-life-threatening situations like the minor stresses we deal with every day as part of our normal lives. Regularly triggering the stress response can cause long-term damage to our health and well-being, especially when we experience stress that lasts three weeks or more. Such long-lasting stress can impair higher-level brain functions and make the brain’s fear and aggression structures overactive, which can impede judgment and cause depression and anxiety. It can also cause the hippocampus, the brain structure that creates new neurons (or brain cells) when the brain is learning, to atrophy, reducing cognitive ability.

According to Nichols, staying in the stress response state for too long also has ramifications on the body. It can cause reduced libido, autoimmune diseases, digestion issues, and musculoskeletal problems. All of these together lead to an increased risk of early death.

> **Additional Effects of Stress and How to Manage It**
> 
> In _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers_ , Robert M. Sapolsky explains that, even though the stress response developed to deal with immediate physical dangers, it can also be triggered by imagined dangers, which is why situations that are non-life-threatening can put us into the stress response state. All we have to do is think about our problems to trigger this physiological response.
> 
> Sapolsky also details some additional effects of the stress response, including stunted growth, poor memory, sleep disorders, and accelerated aging. He explains that stress is harder to deal with when you’re unable to vent your frustration, when you feel the stressor is unpredictable or out of your control, or when you lack a social support system.
> 
> Additionally, he offers some tips on how to better manage your stress. He recommends exercising to help you vent your frustration, establishing a consistent schedule and routine to make your stress more predictable, and strengthening your social relationships and building new ones to enhance your social support network.

However, Red Mind is not all bad, explains Nichols. Extreme sports such as skydiving, rock climbing, and surfing can induce the stress response associated with Red Mind, and **doing so in such a controlled, deliberate way can make it easier to manage the stress response from other aspects of life**. Researchers suspect that this is because dealing with the stress response from these activities helps us learn how to put into perspective the stress we experience from less dangerous activities.

(Shortform note: If you can’t do extreme sports, you might also be able to achieve their stress-reducing benefits by reframing the stress you experience in your daily life. Experts suggest that if we consciously reframe the way we think about the stress response, we can use it to our advantage to enhance our performance. If we view it as a means of unleashing a greater level of ability, we can more easily handle the stressors we’re dealing with and also help reduce stress’s negative long-term effects.)

### How Water Heals the Mind

Not everyone is able or willing to take part in extreme sports like skydiving to reduce their stress response, so Nichols suggests that **engaging with nature, particularly water, can mitigate the stress response, as well**. Extensive research using self-reported results, brain scans, and other tests shows that time spent in nature gives the brain a rest from stress, activating the parts of the brain that deal with empathy and pleasure, which calms the brain and nervous system.

You can achieve these effects not only by immersing yourself in nature through activities like fishing or snorkeling, but also by spending time in places like aquariums or near fountains, and even by looking at images of natural landscapes or listening to nature sounds.

(Shortform note: Some researchers support Nichols’s suggestion that engaging with nature mitigates stress, and they note that images can be particularly useful in circumstances that may limit how much time people can spend outside their homes, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers suggest that part of the reason observing nature reduces stress is because it induces feelings of _certainty_ about the future, and as we discussed above, uncertainties like unpredictability and lack of control exacerbate stress. Some have even suggested that not being around nature is a type of disorder— _nature-deficit disorder_ —because of how impactful nature is on our well-being.)

#### Attention Fatigue: Water Lets the Mind Rest

Nichols argues that one way water reduces the stress response is by **allowing your mind to rest.** When your mind is at rest, your emotions and empathy become more active, resulting in a relaxing, stress-reducing state.

Environmental psychologists Stephen and Rachel Kaplan established a theory of two different kinds of attention: directed and involuntary. _Directed attention_ requires you to focus intently on something, which takes up a lot of mental energy. We use directed attention when we’re focusing on work, socializing, driving, or making decisions. Exercising directed attention nonstop for long periods eventually results in what the Kaplans call “directed-attention fatigue,” which reduces our mental capabilities.

_Involuntary attention_ , on the other hand, is mostly effortless. We use it when we’re in situations that are different from our usual environments but familiar enough to be interesting without being threatening. When we pay attention to things in these situations, it’s usually only briefly and doesn’t require us to react much, and this gives our brains the chance to rest. Natural environments—particularly those that include water—promote involuntary attention.

> **Attention Restoration Theory**
> 
> The Kaplans’ theory of attention is known as the attention restoration theory. It suggests that simply being in nature is not necessarily enough to gain its restorative effects: A restorative natural setting must be large enough to make you feel fully immersed in nature, and separate enough from the real world that you feel like you’re getting away from the stresses of everyday life. This is because being in an environment that’s unfamiliar but safe triggers your involuntary attention, which is an effortless state of being.
> 
> To restore your attention, your experiences in a natural environment must also line up with activities that you feel intrinsically motivated to do (so if you dislike being on boats, sailing is not likely to provide you with nature’s attention-restoring benefits because it will probably engage your directed attention). Attention restoration theory has also faced some criticism over the fact that there’s not a large body of empirical evidence to support it.

#### Water and Creative Inspiration

Water also promotes creativity. Nichols suggests that shifting from directed attention to involuntary attention puts you into a state of mind that lets you create new, spontaneous ideas and engage in improvisational thinking. Nichols refers to this as a state of “flow.”

(Shortform note: The creativity and state of flow that Nichols describes can also help mitigate stress. Research shows that engaging in artistic or creative activities can lower cortisol levels, preserve brain function, and extend your lifespan. Flow-inducing creative activities such as improvisation are often used as therapy to treat conditions like anxiety, depression, and PTSD.)

### How Water Appeals to Our Senses

Water is enticing to us not only because it reduces stress and heals the mind but also because it has a powerful sensory appeal. This sensory appeal is part of what contributes to the Blue Mind effect.

#### Water’s Visual Appeal

As discussed above, Nichols explains that even looking at images of water can provide the positive psychological effects of the Blue Mind state. The color blue itself is calming to us. Psychological and marketing research shows that **people associate the color blue with concepts like cleanliness, openness, strength, trust, and wisdom** , and that blue is the most popular favorite color worldwide by a large margin.

Some experts theorize that people feel so positively toward the color blue because, between the blue sky and the blue water that covers most of our planet, we evolved surrounded largely by shades of this color, so we find it comforting on a biological level.

> **Ecological Valence Theory: Color Preferences Vary With Our Experiences**
> 
> Nichols implies that our attraction to the color blue is innate, but some research indicates that there may be a social component to color preference. Ecological valence theory indicates that we prefer colors that we associate with our individual positive experiences (as opposed to genetically ingrained positive associations from our evolution), and it’s supported by research that shows our color preferences can change over time and vary across cultures.
> 
> For example, if a young boy tries to pick out a pink toy at the store but is scolded by his parent because they believe pink is for girls, the boy is likely to have a lower preference for the color pink because he has a negative experience associated with it. Alternatively, if someone has a wonderful vacation at the beach, they may come to associate the blue color of the sea with a sense of happiness. While blue is still the most widely favored color worldwide, ecological valence theory suggests that this is a subjective, experiential tendency rather than a biological one.

Water also appeals to our visual sense because of its shiny, reflective surface and the way it gently moves. Nichols explains that we’re naturally mesmerized by the simultaneously changing and repeating patterns we see on the surface of water and that watching these patterns engages our involuntary attention and calms and relaxes the mind.

(Shortform note: The appealing nature of water’s shininess may explain why we like shiny objects like jewelry. Studies in consumer behavior led researchers to conclude that shiny or glossy objects remind us of fresh water and that our liking for such objects increases when we’re thirsty (suggesting a psychological association with water).)

#### Water’s Buoyant Appeal

The physical sensation of being in water is also very pleasing, writes Nichols. Because the human body is made up largely of water, and because the fat in our bodies and the air in our lungs are both lighter than water, we float, allowing us to enjoy a sense of weightlessness. Flotation—or the practice of floating motionless in water for extended periods—is **often used to treat chronic pain, stress, injury, depression, and even conditions like ADHD and PTSD**.

(Shortform note: Flotation appears to directly impact stress by shifting the brain from the fight or flight state into a “rest and recover” state. In this way, it turns off the body’s stress response, along with the negative side effects that come with it. However, not everyone floats as easily as others. People with a greater amount of muscle or a lower amount of fat are more likely to sink, which can increase the risk of drowning.)

#### Water’s Auditory Appeal

According to Nichols, the sound of water also appeals to us for many reasons. One of these is that we first heard the sounds of water when we were floating in utero as fetuses, so those sounds are deeply comforting as they remind us of being in the womb.

(Shortform note: Fetuses are also exposed to sounds like their mother’s heartbeat and the sound of her breathing, which may help explain why we find other natural sounds, like wind, soothing, as well as why white noise can be an effective way to soothe a baby.)

Additionally, since the sounds of water tend to be gentle, regular, quiet, and mid-to-low frequency, they’re inherently pleasing to our ears. Conversely, we’re frequently exposed to sounds that are overly loud, harsh, high-pitched, or arrhythmic in our daily lives from sources such as traffic and machinery. Pleasant sounds like those from water—whether it’s the sound of ocean waves, a waterfall, or a babbling brook—can improve mood, relaxation, and concentration.

(Shortform note: Research shows how water sounds improve mood neurologically by demonstrating a direct link between auditory input and emotion: The auditory cortex activates the amygdala, the brain structure involved in emotional processing. In studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, participants identified the sound of flowing water as one of the most pleasant sounds alongside a baby’s laugh and thunder. They identified machine sounds like electric drills and traffic sounds like squealing brakes as being among the most unpleasant.)

### Ways to Enjoy the Water

There are many ways to enjoy the benefits of water. Nichols explains that it’s not just being _in_ water that induces a Blue Mind state, but also being on the water, being near the water, or even looking at images of water. He describes several ways people interact with water to obtain its benefits.

#### Exercise: Swimming

Nichols explains that swimming is appealing because of the body’s buoyancy, which causes a 200-pound body to weigh only 10 pounds in the water. The water also provides resistance, so moving our bodies through it stretches and exercises all the body’s muscles while taking pressure off the joints and ligaments.

(Shortform note: Exercises that take pressure off the joints are known as _low-impact exercises_. These exercises are well-suited for people recovering from injury or dealing with joint issues, and anyone can benefit from alternating between low-impact and high-impact workouts. Swimming is particularly advantageous because it can be high intensity—meaning it’s extremely physically challenging—while still keeping pressure off the joints.)

Additionally, the physical pressure of being immersed in water—known as hydrostatic pressure—can provide a full-body soothing sensation. This pressure also restricts circulation to the extremities, which causes the heart to work harder to pump blood throughout the entire body, resulting in greater blood flow. This makes the body’s arteries relax to reduce the resistance against the blood flow, and **this arterial relaxation leads the body to activate the same neurotransmitters that activities like meditation activate**. The lungs also have to work harder to function under the pressure of the water—and deal with the increased blood flow—and all of this together can greatly improve cardiovascular strength.

Swimming also provides aerobic exercise, which promotes the release of stress-relieving hormones and neurotransmitters like endorphins and endocannabinoids. This, combined with the rhythmic breathing required for swimming, produces a state similar to that induced by meditation.

> **Hydrostatic Pressure and the Body**
> 
> Hydrostatic pressure also provides benefits like reduced swelling: In the same way that it puts pressure on the blood vessels, the force of the water pushes fluid out of the extremities by compressing the body, and it actually provides greater compression than medical stockings designed specifically to reduce swelling. It also applies constant stimulation to the skin and its nerve endings, which causes the nervous system to reduce these nerves’ sensitivity, dulling your pain receptors and thus reducing pain. The increased blood flow also clears lactic acid from the muscles, lessening post-exercise soreness.
> 
> Additionally, the meditation-like effects of hydrostatic pressure make water a great place to practice yoga or other mindfulness exercises. Finally, if you want the aerobic exercise of swimming but don’t enjoy it, there are other aerobic exercises you can do in water, including walking or running, balancing, planking, bicycling, and pushups.

#### Extreme Water Sports: Surfing and Diving

Another way of interacting with the water is through surfing. Nichols suggests that surfing is particularly conducive to the Blue Mind state because it **requires surfers to be deeply attuned to the movement of the sea** and monitor it very closely to see when they might be able to catch the perfect wave. Surfing also affects the brain in a similar way as do many addictive substances: When engaging in an activity that’s novel, risky, rewarding, and challenging, the brain produces a rush of dopamine that we can easily become dependent on. Both surfing and addictive drugs meet all these criteria. Because of this, Nichols often recommends surfing as a positive addiction that people can substitute for harmful addictions.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that addictions can’t be positive because addictions by definition are damaging to the user’s life or well-being. While an activity like surfing may produce some of the same chemicals as an addictive substance would, it doesn’t affect the brain in the same way—by making the body feel like the activity is necessary for its survival. Experts suggest that what we refer to as positive addictions are just good habits, but even seemingly good habits are harmful if they begin to dominate our lives or we continue to engage in them even when they become detrimental. For people who are prone to addiction, the idea of substituting one addiction (even a “positive” one) for another may actually be counterproductive.)

Diving is another popular water sport that Nichols discusses. Diving is particularly appealing to the senses because it involves looking at and touching things under the water—a very different experience from the things we’re able to look at and touch on land. Diving also magnifies the effects of hydrostatic pressure, which increases by one atmosphere every 10 meters below the surface. This comes with some risks, as being exposed to too much pressure can result in nitrogen narcosis (a state of euphoria or confusion from nitrogen entering the bloodstream), and coming up too quickly can result in the bends (or decompression sickness). However, diving is associated with greater adventurousness, less anxiety, and greater health overall.

> **Sensory Benefits of Scuba Diving**
> 
> Diving not only offers _new_ sensory experiences, but it even _enhances_ some senses. Nearby objects under the water appear both larger and closer than they are (though the way light interacts with water also means that distant objects appear farther away than they are). Sound also moves faster through water than it does through air, so it can feel like you’re surrounded by the sounds of the ocean and marine life. Divers are often discouraged from touching objects under the water due to safety concerns, but the feel of the equipment against your skin and the pressure and temperature of the water create an intense tactile experience as well.
> 
> While diving offers a rich sensory experience, it should only be performed with sufficient training and supervision according to your experience level since, as Nichols indicates, diving is a high-risk activity.

#### Recreation: Fishing and Boating

Some people prefer to be near the water rather than in it or under it. Fishing is a great way to do that, explains Nichols. Fishing has been shown to calm the mind and reduce stress, and the physical motions involved in fishing provide effective therapies for many ailments. For example, the motions involved in fly-fishing help improve the strength and flexibility of chest muscles in people who’ve had breast cancer surgery. **The focus and patience involved in fishing can also be good therapy for people with PTSD or other disorders.** It’s also at a skill level that’s accessible to most people, which can make it a better option than more difficult activities like swimming or diving.

(Shortform note: While the physical act of fishing can have many benefits for people, some suggest that it’s a cruel practice that unnecessarily harms fish. Groups devoted to veganism or animal welfare often note that fish can feel pain and that it’s wrong to cause an animal pain for recreation. While the issue of whether or not fish feel pain has been debated over the years, recent research suggests that they do and that they’re not only consciously aware of physical pain, but they can also experience emotional and psychological pain. Knowing that fishing causes real pain might negate some of the stress-reducing benefits that Nichols lists.)

Boating and similar activities like kayaking also offer the benefits of being in proximity to water. Activities like rowing and paddling provide a great upper-body workout, and sailing boats that require the work of multiple people can improve confidence, teamwork, and social skills. The main appeal that Nichols hears from boaters is the sense of freedom it provides—being out in the open air, immersed in nature, away from the constricting demands of daily life.

(Shortform note: While boating and kayaking provide a sense of freedom, they are among the more expensive methods of water recreation that Nichols recommends and thus require significant resources to engage in. And to achieve the physical and social benefits of these sports, you have to take significant precautions to avoid injury or other risks. It’s important to purchase reliable equipment and maintain it well, use good judgment in potentially dangerous conditions, and (as with other forms of water recreation) avoid practices that may be harmful to the environment.)

#### Working: Sailing and Commercial Fishing

Some professions also require working on the water. Sailors and commercial fishers spend long stretches of time interacting with the water to earn a living and provide food and transportation. According to Nichols, these workers also cite the sense of freedom as a major reason they’re drawn to these professions, along with the pride they take in their work and the challenge of taking on the sea every day.

These challenges can sometimes be very dangerous. Due to the demands of keeping a ship operating for 24 hours a day, sailors are often sleep deprived, and they often deal with heavy machinery that can cause severe injury. **Overfishing can also deplete fish populations and has led to government bans on fishing in some areas** , decreasing the availability of such jobs and making them a less viable option for earning a living.

> **Risks of Fishing and Overfishing**
> 
> In addition to the high risk of injury, commercial fishing has a fatality rate nearly 30 times higher than the fatality rate of the average American job. Half of these deaths come from vessel disasters (sinking or capsizing), and many others come from falling overboard.
> 
> While overfishing remains a problem, some countries like Iceland have implemented policies that effectively protect fish populations while still enabling commercial fishing so that fisherpeople can maintain their employment. However, not everyone who works on a boat takes the job on willingly: Human trafficking is a serious problem in the industry, as migrant workers are often forced into labor to make up for shortages. For such people, being on a boat represents the opposite of freedom and pride in one’s work.

### Society’s Relationship With Water

While the benefits of water are many, there are some societal obstacles to accessing them, including financial issues and environmental damage. The Blue Mind state is not as easy to attain for some people as it is for others.

#### The Cost of Water-Adjacent Properties

Nichols explains that real estate that’s near water is in extremely high demand. As a result, these properties are much more expensive than similar properties—or even higher quality properties—away from the water. People with the means to do so will often pay millions of dollars for even the shabbiest homes if they’re next to a water source. Nichols cites this as evidence of how highly we value water. However, because man-made water features also provide the benefits of Blue Mind, **you don’t necessarily need to live right by the ocean, a lake, or a river to enjoy the effects of water**.

(Shortform note: The high cost of properties near water means that water-adjacent living is becoming a privilege often available only to the wealthy. This problem is exacerbated by climate change-related weather events that often damage water-adjacent housing, resulting in rebuilding costs that less wealthy residents can’t afford. The more expensive rebuilt homes are then purchased by wealthy individuals, displacing the less wealthy and resulting in a phenomenon called _climate gentrification_. Additionally, while man-made water features can provide some benefits, research suggests that these are not as beneficial as more immersive experiences in nature.)

#### The Environmental Movement: Using Love to Inspire Action

Nichols argues that the methods we use to encourage environmental activism are misguided and that we should instead tap into our inherent appreciation for the planet to better motivate people to take action. He suggests that approaching these efforts with an attitude that places blame on people for their inaction, or that overwhelms them with depressing facts and statistics, is unproductive. These approaches make people feel ashamed and afraid, often causing them to tune out or resist the message.

Nichols recommends **encouraging people to take on a biocentric view of the natural world** —one that regards our relationship with nature as a partnership and takes into account not only how nature affects humans but also how humans affect nature. He explains that a biocentric view is one built on love and that taking on this type of worldview would prompt people to work harder to protect our natural environment.

He suggests that the way to shift our collective view of nature to a biocentric one is to tap into people’s natural emotions and the connection we feel to nature and that the best way to do this is to first establish the human connection with nature. For example, people will likely be more receptive to the idea of taking action on climate change after walking through an aquarium, and they’ll respond better to an image of a damaged environment if they first see images of that environment in its unspoiled state.

> **Human Attitudes and Effects on Climate Change**
> 
> One reason it’s hard for us to have a biocentric view of nature is that society teaches us to think remotely about the environment, viewing it as a distant object that has little interplay with our lives. This helps explain why we fail to utilize resources and practices that protect the environment despite those resources being available to us. Some experts refer to humans’ negative impact on the environment as “ecocide” and suggest that we should take direction from indigenous cultures that have a reverential view of nature in order to improve our relationship with the planet.
> 
> Additionally, shaming people and depressing them with statistics is all the more unproductive because of how relatively little control individuals have over humans’ collective impact on the environment. Powerful entities like corporations tend to have a much larger influence. Over 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions between 1988 and 2014 came from just 100 companies. Oil companies also are frequently responsible for spilling oil into the ocean and other natural environments, often with little accountability afterward. Environmental movements that both emphasize humans’ connection to nature and identify the main sources of environmental damage may be the most effective in protecting nature.
