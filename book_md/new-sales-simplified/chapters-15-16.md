## Chapters 15-16: Final Thoughts on Sales Success

Now that you know how to develop a target list, create a sales story, make effective cold calls, conduct a sales call, and execute news sales, here are a few final tips for sales success:

  * **Mind your manners:** It pays to be polite and considerate to receptionists, assistants, and other gatekeepers at a prospect’s company.**** Making a good impression on people in the company can only help your sales efforts. When you get an appointment and meet an assistant in person, take time to express appreciation to them for their help.
  * **Stay upbeat:** A salesperson needs to be in top form every day. While others such as accountants can be miserable and still do their jobs, you can’t sell with a negative attitude. Don’t spend time with complainers or get pulled into negative conversations. Be on time for meetings and arrive with a smile. 
  * **Look professional:** Salespeople should look professional, successful, and confident (not cheap, worn out, or outdated). Dress one level above your customer. Don’t wear a company logo shirt to client meetings—it sends the message that you’re self-focused.
  * **Arrive at work early:** The most successful people start work early and tackle the most important things first, especially their target list. In contrast, many reps spend the first third of the day in a reactive mode, responding to emails, calls, and customer requests. They seldom get to their target list.
  * **Take time to unplug:** To be effective, you need to take time to recharge. Unplug while on vacation and you’ll increase your performance when you return to work. If you work on vacation, you’re still using energy and creativity, not restoring it.



Finally, don’t believe those who discourage you from prospecting by telling you it’s ineffective or a waste of time. Most of the naysayers avoid it because they’ve failed at it. But with strategically selected targets, the right sales weapons, and a plan of attack, new-business development isn’t complicated.
