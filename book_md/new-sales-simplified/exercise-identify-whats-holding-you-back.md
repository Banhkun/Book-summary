## Exercise: Identify Whatâ€™s Holding You Back

A lack of knowledge or counterproductive behaviors and attitudes keep salespeople from succeeding at developing new business. Review the list of common reasons for failure to determine whether any are holding you back.

* * *

Which two or three issues on the list are the most challenging for you and why (for example, not knowing how to conduct a sales call or spending too much time servicing existing accounts)?

Many of the issues on the list are rooted in procrastination. In what ways do you procrastinate when it comes to prospecting and why?

How willing are you to improve your new sales success rate by addressing the issues and behaviors holding you back? What can you do this week to tackle one of them?
