## Exercise: Take Action to Win New Sales

Developing a target list and sales tools such as a sales story are useless without action. To succeed at news business development, you need to make it a priority and create a personal business plan to keep your efforts on track.

* * *

How much time per week do you currently devote to prospecting? How could you amend your schedule to time block at least four prospecting hours a week in two-hour chunks?

What are your sales goals for acquiring new accounts? Have you put these goals in writing? How are you tracking your progress towards meeting them? (For example, what metrics are you using to define success?)

Do you have an individual business plan laying out annual goals, strategies, action steps, hurdles, and personal development areas? If so, describe how you could improve your plan. (For example, are there elements of the plan that you could flesh out further?) If not, briefly outline two goals youâ€™d include in your plan, and two strategies for meeting each goal.

What does your pipeline look like? Do you have targeted, active, and urgent accounts? How could you improve your pipeline so that you have accounts in all three categories that keep progressing?
