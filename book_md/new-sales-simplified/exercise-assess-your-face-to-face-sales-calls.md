## Exercise: Assess Your Face-to-Face Sales Calls

A successful face-to-face sales call requires developing and following a plan with specific stages in the proper sequence.

* * *

What is your sales call structure? (For example, do your calls have a logical progression from building rapport and sharing an agenda to telling your sales story, asking discovery questions, confirming fit, and agreeing on next steps? If not, what structure _do_ they have?)

Are any of the steps outlined above missing from your call structure? If so, why? How can you incorporate them into future sales calls?

How have you wrapped up your calls in the past? Write a brief script incorporating fit, objections, and determining the next steps that you can use to end future calls.
