## Chapter 13: Making a Presentation

Many prospects expect sales reps to make formal slideshow presentations at the initial face-to-face meeting. This started with the introduction of PowerPoint in the 1990s when the ability to create slick slideshows changed the focus of many sales calls from dialogue to presentation. The seller became a performer taking the stage with the buyer as the audience.

However, as Chapter 12 explained, to win new business, you need to first learn the customer’s needs so you can offer a tailored customer-focused solution rather than a generic presentation. **Such** **a tailored presentation, given _after_ the initial meeting, can be a powerful sales tool. **This chapter looks at how to create a customer-focused presentation and how to deal with premature presentation requests.

### A Customer-Focused Format

The first step in creating a customer-focused presentation is resisting the urge to create a monologue and visuals focused on your company, processes, people, and solutions. Drop the photos or video of your buildings and campus—they don’t help you sell, and they copy rather than differentiate you from the competition.

Here’s how to structure your presentation:

  1. **Title slide**
  2. **Agenda for the meeting**
  3. **Introductory statement:** “Companies turn to (your company name) when they…” Then list three to five bullet points from the client issues section of your sales story.
  4. **Client-focused statement:** “Our understanding of your situation…” Then list issues and opportunities uncovered in the initial sales meeting and through research. (Demonstrate that you’ve listened and done your homework.)
  5. **Dialogue:** Stop and ask for input to switch the presentation from a monologue to a dialogue. For example, ask what resonated with the audience, and what was off-base. Ask a senior leader to prioritize the issues. Ask probing questions to explore the issues and their consequences further. Use what you learn to further tailor the presentation.



### When the Prospect Requests a Presentation

Prospects are so accustomed to one-sided presentations that they often request a presentation as an initial meeting. But if you don’t have enough information to create slide 4 (bullet points describing the customer’s situation), you can’t make an effective presentation. So insist on a meeting before making a presentation.

You can do so in a polite but assertive way by explaining that your goal is to provide the optimum solution tailored to the customer’s unique needs. To do so, you need to follow a specific process that places a meeting before a presentation. Insisting on your process rather than defaulting to the buyer’s process differentiates you.

Nonetheless, there are times when the prospect won’t meet with you before a presentation. Some companies have rules for RFPs and about who in the company you can talk to. In this case, your best response is to show up for the presentation but adapt it to follow elements of your sales call structure: Introduce yourself, build rapport, and share your agenda. For example, you might follow a script like this: “Here’s the way we like to work. We take the first 10 minutes to hear why you invited us in and what issues you face. With that information, we can then focus on what’s most relevant and useful to you.”
