## Introduction

Generating new business is critical to a company’s success, yet few salespeople do it well. **Many reps are intimidated by making “cold calls” (first-time calls to non-clients to ask for their business), and therefore make only half-hearted attempts** **or none at all.** Further, sales reps are often their own worst enemies, engaging in negative attitudes and behaviors that turn off buyers.

But acquiring new business isn’t difficult. In _New Sales. Simplified.,_ veteran salesman and sales coach Mike Weinberg demystifies prospecting. He presents a three-part “New Sales Driver” model:

  1. Strategically choose your targets. 
  2. Develop effective tools. 
  3. Develop a plan and act on it.



By learning some fundamental sales techniques and executing this model, anyone can become a confident, successful “sales hunter.” **And by regularly delivering new business, you can bring value to your company, your customers, and yourself.**

(Shortform note: Some chapters in this summary were combined or reorganized to eliminate repetition.) Part 1 examines obstacles to new-business development, while Parts 2-4 explain how to implement the new-sales model.
