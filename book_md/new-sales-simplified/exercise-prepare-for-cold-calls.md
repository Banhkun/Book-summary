## Exercise: Prepare for Cold Calls

Besides having a compelling sales story, a critical tool for developing new business is cold calls, but many reps fear making them. The key to making cold calls with confidence is preparing a call outline and talking points.

* * *

How do you currently prepare for cold calls?

Successful cold callers prepare by developing a positive mindset plus a call outline, including a clear objective, an effective introductory phrase, a mini-version of your sales story, and the “ask” for the client’s business.) Which of these components are missing from your preparations or could be improved?

How can you structure your calls to keep the objective of getting a meeting on track?

When can you schedule time this week to develop or strengthen your introduction and mini-sales story?
