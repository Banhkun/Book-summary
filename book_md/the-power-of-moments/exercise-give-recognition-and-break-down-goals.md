## Exercise: Give Recognition and Break Down Goals

Moments of pride are a high return on a relatively small investment of your time and effort. Reflect on situations where you can put in that effort to create moments of pride for others through recognition, and for yourself through small wins.

* * *

Think of someone you know who deserves recognition. How can you personalize their recognition to make it a meaningful moment of pride for them?

How can you commit to regularly and meaningfully recognizing this personâ€™s efforts, moving forward? Remember: Satisfying recognition stems from frequency, not grandeur.

Imagine a goal you would like to accomplish. How can you reframe the goal as a tangible destination? What small wins can you build into the journey toward this goal?

Remember that effective milestones are a) achievable and concrete and b) interesting and motivating to _you._
