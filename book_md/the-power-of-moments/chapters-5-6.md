## Chapters 5-6: Create Defining Moments With Insight

**The second element you can use to create defining moments is _insight_. Moments defined by insight inspire realizations or transformations that affect your future choices and actions**. Some of these are small, personal moments that hold special meaning for you—for example, finding your new signature drink after trying a new cocktail and realizing how delicious it is. However, this chapter will focus on the larger moments of discovery, those that deliver a shock that may change your way of thinking or even the course of your life. **Moments of insight or discovery often come with strong emotions, both positive and negative.**

#### What Insight Promises

Pushing our boundaries, risking failure, confronting uncomfortable truths—the Heaths admit that moments defined by insight aren’t always positive**. Often they’re difficult or painful, and they’re certainly not meant to be seen as a promise of success. They are, however, always a promise of a learning opportunity.**

The more moments you can define with insight, the better you can help others arrive at much-needed realizations and subscribe to the work of necessary transformations (which we’ll explore in Strategy 1), understand your motivations and values and gain confidence in your abilities (which we’ll explore in Strategy 2), or push mentees to their full potential (which we’ll explore in Strategy 3).

In this chapter, we’ll explore the three ways the Heaths suggest that you can spark meaningful, memorable insight:

  * When you want to push others to come to a realization, you can force them to confront an uncomfortable truth.
  * When you want to better understand yourself, you can purposely put yourself in situations where you are forced to confront self-truths. 
  * When someone you mentor needs to experience self-insight, you can be the one to push them into situations that hold a risk of failure.



### Strategy 1: Force Someone to Confront a Truth

The Heaths first explore how you can spark insight in others by setting up a moment in which they will be forced to confront an uncomfortable truth. They note three essential factors to making the moment defining:

  1. **Have a clear conclusion:** Know exactly what conclusion you want your audience to come to. This is often the easiest part of the process—you usually know exactly what truth needs revealing.
  2. **Operate on a short time frame:** Create a situation that will guide your audience to their discovery over a matter of _minutes or hours_ , or even more immediately.
  3. **Allow _audience_ discovery: **Let the audience discover the conclusion themselves, instead of telling them what to do. 



These factors result in an “aha! moment,” or what psychologist Roy Baumeister dubbed the _crystallization of discontent_ : a sudden moment in which any vague negativity or discomfort you’re feeling suddenly crystallizes in a pattern—you discover links between seemingly unrelated issues and the core problem becomes startlingly clear. The crystallization of discontent often provides a crucial burst of motivation to make a major change, such as someone leaving her abusive spouse, cult members leaving their organization, or alcoholics deciding to start recovery.

> **Why These Three Factors?**
> 
> **These three factors are crucial to creating insight because together, they replicate the conditions of a spontaneous crystallization of discontent.** In her book _Radical Acceptance_ , author Tara Brach discusses the Alcoholics Anonymous program, which notes that an addict begins changing when they hit rock bottom, an experience that echoes the Heaths’ three factors:
> 
>   * They realize that their lives are not within their control (an instantaneous realization, or a _short timeline_).
> 
>   * They understand that they must make a change to their lifestyle (a _clear conclusion_).
> 
>   * They have to come to this realization on their own—addiction support organizations stress that the addict is the only person who can take on the recovery process. In other words, they can’t get help until they understand the problem and decide to treat it themselves.
> 
> 


(Shortform note: While the clear conclusion and short timeframe are more “logistical necessities'' of creating a crystallization of discontent, the third factor—audience discovery—can be better understood as a “key action.” We’ll further explore its importance, and discuss how to pull it off, in the following section.)

#### Key Action: Let Your Audience Discover the Conclusion Themselves

You’ll likely be tempted to start your discussion of an issue by presenting the solutions you’ve come up with, but this is just a way to tell your audience what conclusion they’re supposed to come to. **In order to guide your audience toward the conclusion _without_ telling them what to do or what to think, you must start by discussing the problems.**

As you walk them through the problems, don’t focus on sharing what you know—this is just another way of telling them what to think. **Instead, guide them in such a way that they encounter the same problems you did and therefore discover the same conclusion you did.**

This is crucial: If you instead approach your audience’s problem by telling them exactly what’s wrong and how it can be fixed, they’ll likely become defensive or argumentative. No one likes being told that they’re doing things wrong or how they should act, and no one changes unless they _want_ to change.

> **Why We’re So Resistant to Being Told What to Do**
> 
> Most people go about telling one another hard-to-hear truths in the wrong way—by saying the truth outright. In their book _Difficult Conversations, _authors Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen explain two reasons why this approach most often leads to defensiveness and a breakdown of communication:
> 
>   * In conversations around a problem, most people tend to confuse _intent_ and _impact_ —that is, when someone’s words hurt you (the impact), you become upset and assume that they _intended_ to hurt you. As a result, you become angry at them and resistant to what they have to say.
> 
>   * Most people go into arguments with the idea that the _other_ person is in the wrong. You approach the issue by explaining all the ways they’re contributing to the problem, in an effort to make them see why you’re right. Meanwhile, they think _you’re_ in the wrong and will naturally push back, in an effort to make you see why _they’re_ right.
> 
> 

> 
> When you let someone discover a hard truth themselves, these blame games don’t come to pass. There’s no “other side” to fight against or blame for your hurt, which means you can approach the problem from the same side and focus on solutions rather than being right.

Once the audience sees the problem clearly enough to start thinking about solutions, you’re in a position to start explaining the solutions you’ve thought of. Unburdened by hurt or blame, and with a “homegrown” appreciation for the problem at hand, your audience is primed to listen to what you have to say.

(Shortform note: In their book, the Heaths focus their discussion of audience discovery on its benefit of minimizing pushback. However, audience discovery also has the benefit of being especially _motivating_. The experience of putting together a pattern creates a pleasant, exciting rush of adrenaline, even if the discovery itself isn’t pleasant or exciting. This rush makes the discovery more engaging, therefore making the audience’s desire to act stronger. On the other hand, if you were to _announce_ what the discovery should be, the audience doesn’t experience an exciting and motivating moment. You might think of it as the difference between finally completing a complex jigsaw puzzle yourself and simply viewing a jigsaw puzzle someone else completed.)

#### Example: Community-Led Total Sanitation

The Heaths provide a powerful example that shows how building a situation that gives people sudden insight into problems can lead to impressive transformations.

Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is a sanitary organization that works to build public-use latrines in rural villages across the world and teach about the dangers of open defecation practices. In one village in Bangladesh, CLTS found that people were not using their latrines, preferring to stick with the open-defecation status quo. Telling the villagers to use the latrines was useless—in response, they became defensive about their practices.

CLTS sent a representative to the village, who asked the villagers to draw a map of the village in the dirt, marking their homes and other places of importance. He then asked them to mark all the open-defecation areas in the village with yellow chalk dust. Then, he asked them to mark the places that people would defecate in the case of a rainstorm or an emergency. The yellow chalk surrounded the houses. Lastly, he asked them to mark places where they’d found feces outside of the designated areas. At this point, the map was _covered_ in yellow chalk and there was a palpable discomfort among the crowd.

The representative then pulled a hair from his head, dipped it in a nearby pile of feces, and dropped it into a glass of water. He asked, “Would you drink this?” The villagers shook their heads in disgust.

The representative asked the villagers to think of his hair like a fly’s leg, then explain that with so many open defecation areas, flies likely often landed on feces before landing on the villagers’ food. The villagers had their aha! moment and cried out in disgust as they realized what they were eating.

The CLTS method has sparked transformations in thousands of villages worldwide that are now open-defecation free. The method utilizes all three aha! moment factors:

  * **Clear conclusion:** CLTS wants villagers to realize that open defecation is unsanitary, makes them sick, and touches the whole community. 
  * **Short time frame:** The questions, visuals, and sudden moment of realization can play out over the course of an afternoon.
  * **The audience comes to the realization themselves:** The CLTS representative acts as a neutral guide to the truth: He sows the seeds of discomfort among the villagers, letting them visualize the magnitude of the problem with a map covered in yellow chalk. By presenting them with a feces-covered hair in water, he prompts their vague discomfort to find shape in an abrupt realization.



> **Insight Sparks Transformation _Only for Those Who Can Use It_**
> 
> In this example, the Heaths attribute the success of the CLTS method to their engineered aha! moment. However, the CLTS method relies heavily on underlying circumstances as well: CLTS notes on their website that this program is most effective in places that are close-knit, small, remote, and have strong leadership. There are numerous ways that these factors may contribute to the program’s effectiveness:
> 
>   * Close-knit communities are likely to arrive at the same conclusions about what to do—and if they don’t, it’s easier for friends and family to persuade each other to the right conclusion than it is for strangers to persuade one another.
> 
>   * Small, remote villages don’t need to deal with much bureaucracy and infrastructure planning when putting in pit toilets.
> 
>   * Strong leaders advocate for programs that are in their communities’ best interests, such as CLTS. Additionally, they make and act on decisions quickly and efficiently, and don’t experience as much pushback from their communities as weaker or untrustworthy leaders might.
> 
> 

> 
> This brings up an important aspect of these aha! moments that the Heaths don’t explore: **Aha! moments are meaningful and effective _only if your audience can do something about the problem._ **The insights you engineer should align with transformations that your audience can reasonably accomplish.
> 
>   * For example, creating a moment to make your friend realize the globally devastating effects of climate change won’t be particularly transformative or meaningful—she can’t solve a global problem alone, so the discovery is frustrating and useless. Instead, you might engineer a moment that helps her discover how many plastic water bottles she uses. 
> 


### Strategy 2: Set Up a Situation for Self-Insight

The Heaths explain that using insight to create defining moments for _yourself_ depends on pushing your boundaries—you must put yourself in situations that expose you to the possibility of failure. **This is because the process of stepping outside of your comfort zone and risking failure leads to what psychologists call “self-insight”:an understanding of your values, abilities, goals, and motivations.**

#### How Risking Failure Translates Into Valuable Self-Insight

Exposing yourself to the risk of failure can only go one of two ways: either you succeed, or you fail. While these outcomes may not seem equally valuable, the Heaths assert that _both_ should be celebrated as valuable learning opportunities.

It’s obvious why exposing yourself to the risk of failure and then succeeding would be a cause for celebration. It stirs up positive emotions, bolsters your confidence in your abilities, and at times can prompt positive changes in your life.

  * For example, while doing volunteer work on the weekends you realize, “This is exactly what I want to spend the rest of my life doing! How can I make this my full-time job?” __



(Shortform note: This type of discovery—realizing how you want your future to be, and therefore making positive changes in the interest of working _toward_ a goal rather than pushing _away_ from past behavioral patterns—can be understood as a crystallization of desire, an inverse of the crystallization of discontent.)

It’s much less obvious why risking failure—and then actually failing—is _also_ something to celebrate (or at least, not dread). Failure certainly doesn’t stir up the same sort of positive emotions as success. **However, the Heaths emphasize that negative emotions are especially helpful in creating meaningful moments defined by insight**.

> **The Price Tag of Failure**
> 
> Barbara Frederickson and Daniel Kahneman (author of _Thinking, Fast and Slow), _when developing the peak-end rule, found that the brain uses the emotional peaks of experiences as “price tags” or reference points when recalling an experience and making decisions based on it. We use these reference points to determine whether repeating the experience is worth the “cost.”
> 
> The negative emotions of failure create a reference point that acts as a type of warning: “If you do this again or if you continue on this route, it will cost you—you’ll feel these negative emotions again.”
> 
> For example, many addicts, when deciding to start treatment, recall going through the thought process of realizing that they could no longer tolerate the emotional “cost” of repeating the same behaviors. 

The Heaths go on to discuss the two possible conclusions that this “warning” prompts:

**Conclusion A: The cost is worth it.** You realize that you are strong enough to endure the cost of the experience and are willing to do it again, even if you risk feeling negative emotions again.

  * A sprinter experiences a humiliating defeat. She thinks to herself, “That was awful, but if I can push through that, I can push through anything.” __ She’s dedicated enough to continue the sport, even if it means experiencing failure again in the future.



**Conclusion B: The cost is too high.** You realize that the cost of the experience is too high, and you don’t want to risk feeling these emotions again. You experience your crystallization of discontent.

  * Imagine that you leave your corporate job to become the owner of a coffee shop. You like the work and you’re proud to have your own business, though the customers are demanding and the hours are very long, you’ve been having trouble finding good baristas to work for you, and the income is unpredictable. One day, you’re frazzled and you accidentally grab a cake out of the oven without a mitt, burning yourself badly. Suddenly, you realize, “I hate this job. I’m so stressed out all the time and I miss the structure of the office.” Your crystallization of discontent leads you to sell your coffee shop and head back into the corporate world, where you are much happier. You realized that the cost of owning a coffee shop was too high, and not something you wanted to experience any longer. 



> **How to Make Failure _Meaningful_ **
> 
> While the Heaths explain how failure can provide a valuable examination of your motivations and values, they don’t explore a crucial part of failure that ensures that it becomes a meaningful experience rather than a forgettable mistake: your response to it. There are numerous healthy, meaningful ways you can respond to failure in a way that serves to create a defining moment:
> 
> **Ask the right questions:** Studies have found that responding to failure by asking “what” rather than “why” leads to more positive outcomes. This is because questions starting with “why” usually invite rationalization or denial. On the other hand, questions starting with “what” jumpstart the process of learning from your situation and finding solutions based on gathered information. For example:
> 
>   * Instead of asking, “Why is owning a coffee shop so stressful?” try asking yourself, “What parts of owning a coffee shop do I like, and what parts are making me feel stressed?”
> 
>   * Instead of asking, “Why don’t my new team members seem to like me?” ask yourself, “What can I do to make sure my team members and I are working well together?”
> 
> 

> 
> **Practice self-compassion:** Many people respond to failure with self-criticism, but this doesn’t help you recover from failure—rather, it forces you to ruminate on the experience and develop feelings of shame about it. Instead, respond with _self-compassion_ , the process of forgiving yourself for past mistakes as Tara Brach discusses in her book _Radical Acceptance_. Reacting with self-compassion allows you to think about the mistake clearly and glean important lessons from it.
> 
> **Focus on growth** : Consciously respond to failure with positive messages that focus on learning and growth. In her book _Grit, _Angela Duckworth gives several examples of how you might accomplish this:
> 
>   * Instead of, “My pitch was a disaster,” you might try, “My pitch didn’t go as well as I wanted. What can I improve next time?”
> 
>   * Instead of, “Getting a promotion in this field is hard, so I shouldn’t feel bad that I haven’t gotten one,” make the subtle change toward, “Getting a promotion in this field is hard, so I shouldn’t feel bad that I haven’t gotten one _yet_.”
>

#### Shortform Commentary: Why You May Need a Mentor

The Heaths note that not all self-insight requires large risks—it may come from small, everyday risks like trying a new drink or taking a new class. These experiences are easy to do on your own, as the cost of failure is generally low.

However, you’ll likely have a much harder time pushing yourself into the most valuable experiences—those that come with a much higher cost of failure, such as taking on more responsibility at work, moving to a new city, or changing your career. You’re not alone. There’s a global upward trend in perfectionism: People are holding themselves to increasingly high standards and opting to forego growth in favor of avoiding the possibility of failure. **To break out of this mindset, it’s helpful to seek out a mentor who can support you through the process of leaving your comfort zone and exposing yourself to the possibility of failure.**

Mentors can take many forms. They’re not only found in your career field. A mentor can be anyone you admire and respect, whose advice is trustworthy and in your best interest. A parent, a teacher, a colleague, a boss, or an accomplished friend can all be mentors.

(Note: Read our guide to Ryan Holiday’s _Ego Is the Enemy_ to learn how to choose an appropriate mentor, ask them for their help, and develop a mutually beneficial relationship.)

The following section is geared toward mentors trying to push mentees into defining moments of self-insight. However, it can also help you, as a mentee, understand what makes for a _great_ mentor and the benefits of seeking one out.

### Strategy 3: Push Others Into Their Self-Insight as a Mentor

**As a mentor, your job is to push your mentee into situations that will spark her self-insight, providing the type of productive pressure that helps coax out her best self.** The Heaths note that great mentors usually issue challenges to their mentees with a four-part formula:**high expectations + confidence + direction + support. Each part of this formula is important:** High expectations alone can make people feel defensive or intimidated, but expressing confidence in them can attach a sense of empowerment to the message. Adding the elements of direction and support elevates the message of the mentor even further: “I have high expectations but I know you are capable of reaching them. Here’s a challenge that I think you should take on. If you need any help, let me know and I will have your back.”

  * **High expectations:** You’ll have to stretch to meet them.
  * **Confidence:** I know you are capable. 
  * **Direction:** Here’s a challenge I think you should take on.
  * **Support:** I will have your back. 



> **How the Mentorship Formula Cultivates a Growth Mindset**
> 
> You can help your mentee experience more instances of self-insight by helping her change the way she thinks about risk and failure. In _Mindset_ , Carol S. Dweck explains that people develop two different mindsets over the course of their lives—a fixed mindset or a growth mindset.
> 
>   * Fixed mindset: The mindset that intelligence, ability, or talent can’t be learned or improved. People with this mindset often avoid asking for help and have an intense fear of failure, because they feel it defines them and exposes the limits of their abilities.
> 
>   * Growth mindset: The mindset that intelligence, ability, or talent can be trained or developed over time. People with this mindset are comfortable asking for help when they need it and overcome failure relatively easily because they see it as an opportunity to better understand themselves and to grow their abilities.
> 
> 

> 
> As a mentor, you want to help your mentee cultivate a growth mindset. The Heaths’ four-part formula helps touch on several aspects of guiding someone into this mindset:
> 
>   * **High expectations and confidence:** By being demanding _and_ reassuring, you help them become more comfortable with challenging goals, but bolster their confidence in their ability to stretch themselves.
> 
>   * **Direction:** By giving your mentee a specific high-challenge project, you prevent them from defaulting to a project that seems easier or carries a lower risk of failure.
> 
>   * **Support:** Assuring your mentee of your support expresses to her that it’s okay to ask for your help—she doesn’t need to fear what you’ll think of her if she fails or can’t accomplish the goal alone.
> 
> 


The Heaths concede that using all four aspects of the mentorship formula will require a good deal of effort—you’ll need to scope out appropriate challenges for your mentee, and you must be ready to lend support when it’s needed. This extra work is worth it: Under the guidance of a mentor who applies productive pressure and will help them recover from failure, mentees are more confident in taking on the types of challenges that expose them to risk, therefore multiplying their opportunities for moments of self-insight.

#### Example: Encouraging Improvement as a Coach

Imagine two scenarios in which you’re a coach, trying to get a sprinter on your team to improve her time in the 400m race:

**Scenario A:** You say, “My fastest sprinters are running the 400m race 15 seconds faster than you. Work harder and keep up!”

  * In this scenario, you apply high standards _only_. As a result, your message comes across as harsh and condescending, and she responds with defensiveness. She thinks, “Coach is picking on me because she doesn’t like me. There’s no use trying to improve—she’ll never like me as much as the fastest sprinters.”



**Scenario B:** You say, “I want you to improve your 400m time by at least 15 seconds. I know you can do it—I can see you have the potential to be one of my best sprinters. I know a group of your top teammates practice together on Saturdays, and I’d suggest asking if you can train with them. I’m here to get you on—or even past—their level, so don’t be afraid to ask for my help.”

  * In this scenario, your high standards were followed up with assurance, clear direction, and a reminder of your support. In this way, you’ve reframed your standards as an attainable goal. Your sprinter thinks, “I’m not the fastest right now, but Coach thinks I can improve, or even _excel_ , with some dedicated practice. I’ll ask her to help me come up with a training plan so I can get there.” 



> **Helpful Guidelines for Choosing Appropriate Challenges**
> 
> As a mentor, you may work with a mentee who isn’t on the exact path you chose—as a result, you might find it difficult to determine which challenges are “right” for her. Two guidelines to work within are those of your mentee’s ambitions and the limits of her ability.
> 
> **1) Consider her ambition:** Talk to your mentee about what her ambitions are, and shape your challenges accordingly. Kim Scott in _Radical Candor_ discusses two types of team members who are well-positioned to handle new challenges but have very different ambitions: superstars and rockstars.
> 
>   * Superstars are those mentees who are high performing and very ambitious—they want challenges that will allow them to take on new roles, develop their skills quickly, and boost them to the top of their field.
> 
>   * Rockstars are those mentees who are high performing but like where they are—they want challenges that keep things interesting and develop their skills, but don’t disrupt their status quo too much.
> 
> 

> 
> **2) Give “Goldilocks” challenges:** This concept, from Daniel Pink’s _Drive_ , means directing your mentee toward projects that are challenging enough to stay interesting, but not so challenging that they become overwhelming. Choose a challenge that pushes the upper limit of her abilities but doesn’t go beyond it.

#### Let Failures Happen

**The Heaths stress that “support” doesn’t mean shielding your mentee from all risk.** It’s critical that your mentee be exposed to the risk of failure in order to achieve self-insight. This is difficult, as it goes against all instinct. Naturally, we want to protect those we’re helping.

As a mentor, your goal shouldn’t be to protect your mentee from failure, or the results of their failure. Instead, your goal should be to _normalize_ failure—don’t shame your mentee for it but talk to them about ways they might recover from it. In turn, your mentee will stretch for novel experiences that will continue to reward them with defining moments of self-insight.

> **How to Talk About Failure**
> 
> The Heaths encourage you to normalize failure instead of shielding your mentee from it but don’t fully cover _how_ you might do this. As Carol S. Dweck explores in _Mindset_ , the way you respond to your mentee’s failure is key in determining whether or not she will grow from the experience.
> 
> For example, imagine she auditioned for a role but didn’t make the callback. You’ll likely be tempted to respond in one of the following fixed-mindset ways that serve to shield her from her failure:
> 
>   * “Well, _I_ thought you were the best audition.” (She knows this isn’t true.)
> 
>   * “They must have a deal with one of the others. Otherwise, they’d have picked you.” (She understands she can shift blame to others instead of taking ownership of her failure.)
> 
>   * “You’re so talented—you’ll definitely get the next one.” (She learns that talent is the only thing that matters.)
> 
>   * “Musical theatre isn’t important anyway, don’t waste any more time thinking about it.” (She internalizes the message that anything she’s not good at isn’t worth her time.)
> 
> 

> 
> **Instead, choose to respond in a way that acknowledges her failure rather than sugar-coating it.** This helps her learn from the experience and, more importantly, encourages her to _continue trying_ : “You tried your best, but the other actors at the audition had more musical theater experience. Keep practicing with your weekly group and you’ll move up into their ranks.”
