## Chapters 10-12: Create Defining Moments With Connection

The fourth element you can use to create a defining moment is _connection._ Moments defined by connection are experiences that strengthen your relationships with other people. They stir up a host of positive emotions—validation, intimacy, empathy—that make you feel closer to and seen by the people around you.

In this chapter, we’ll first look into what types of experiences can strengthen group relationships, and then we’ll examine how you can deepen your personal relationships.

### Part 1: Use Connection to Strengthen Group Relationships

Defining moments for groups happen in experiences that create a shared meaning for everyone present—experiences that underscore the mission everyone is working toward together. These experiences are essential for reminding the group members that they’re united in something important and larger than themselves.

There are three steps to create moments of connection for groups: **1) Create a shared moment, 2) Allow for voluntary struggle, and 3) Reconnect members with their work’s meaning.**

> **Why These Three Strategies Strengthen Groups**
> 
> In his book _The Culture Code, _which explores what makes for strong, connected cultures, Daniel Coyle reveals three crucial psychological elements that solidify one’s place within a culture and contribute to the success of a group: safety, vulnerability, and purpose. Each of the Heaths’ three steps helps establish these elements:
> 
>   * **Safety:** Coyle describes safety as the feeling that you belong within the culture. When you stage a social group event, you help members connect with like-minded people and understand their place within the group.
> 
>   * **Vulnerability:** Coyle describes vulnerability as the ability to expose your personal weakness and ask for support. When a group collaborates against a shared struggle, members expose their weaknesses and learn to ask one another for help.
> 
>   * **Purpose:** Coyle describes purpose as the feeling that you’re part of the group for a reason. This ties to the third step we’ll explore in this section—reconnecting members with their work’s meaning. Creating a moment to clarify the meaning and impact of a group member’s presence reminds them _why_ they contribute to the group’s cause.
> 
> 


#### Step #1: Create a Shared Moment

It’s human nature to constantly tune into the responses and emotions of a group and compare them to our own, synchronizing our reactions to the group’s.

Many of our natural defining moments—weddings, graduations, bar mitzvahs—have a built-in social aspect because they’re reasons to gather. The Heaths stress that engineered defining moments, if they are to be as meaningful as these natural moments, need a similar built-in social aspect that allows group members to bounce their emotions off one another.

##### Why Organizations Need Shared Moments

The Heaths note that this step is especially important—and novel—for large organizations, who rarely put forth the effort to gather all their members together in one place.

**Creating a shared moment is your organization’s opportunity to build a meaningful, memorable peak into the general flatness of your members’ everyday tasks.** Gathered together, they’re met with the social reality of their impact and are surrounded by like-minded people that make them feel excited, supported, and connected to the cause. It’s just not possible to capture this energy and convey the magnitude of an organization or movement via email.

> **The Motivational Cost of Remote Work**
> 
> Organizations across the world are increasingly turning to remote work as an option for their employees, but this presents a serious motivational challenge due to the lack of shared moments.
> 
> Researchers find that _most_ employees don’t find this setup appealing—in fact, they found a significant decline in job satisfaction and employee motivation among remote workers. Many employees attribute this to a lack of social contact: Without the opportunity to meaningfully collaborate and chat with colleagues or see the impact of their work on clients, the work experience becomes endless, disengaging flatness.
> 
> Though you may not be able to create an in-person shared moment for your remote employees, the following tips can help you work on creating a sense of belonging similar to that fostered by shared moments:
> 
>   * **Allow autonomy:** Once a remote employee has proven their ability to deliver on your expectations, give them the same amount of autonomy that you’d give to any of your office employees. This helps them feel like a true part of the team, rather than an outsider who needs babysitting.
> 
>   * **Include everyone:** Many remote employees work in different time zones. Be mindful of everyone’s work hours and ensure that decisions aren’t made until everyone has had an opportunity to log in and give their input—this reinforces the idea that remote employees are as important to the team as office employees.
> 
>   * **Send packages:** Remote employees are used to doing most of their work via email, so getting a piece of physical mail—such as a thank you note or a package of company goods—is a delightful surprise that reminds them that they’re a valuable part of the team.
> 
>   * **Set up ways to “mingle”:** Remote employees don’t have the opportunity to chat around the water cooler like office employees, so make sure they have spaces to casually chat and get to know one another—such as virtual lunches or coffee breaks or Slack channels dedicated to fun chatter.
> 
> 


Once you’ve created a shared moment that lends social reality to your members’ efforts, you can build on it by offering up an opportunity for voluntary struggle.

#### Step #2: Allow for Voluntary Struggle

The Heaths explain that groups bond quickly when they face adversity together. You can see examples of this everywhere: Your chemistry study group becomes close friends after many all-nighters at the library. Fraternity hazing is a month of hell in exchange for brotherly bonds among your pledge class.

(Shortform note: Shared struggle is a powerful bonding tool—the Heaths discuss how it might bring together people who are already part of the same group, but studies have shown that pain or struggle enhances bonding in groups of people without any shared identity. Part of the reason for this is that struggle naturally forces group members to ask for help and show vulnerability, which is a foundational element of relationship-building.)

The Heaths caution that you can’t give your organization members just _any_ struggle with the expectation that they’ll feel motivated and connected to your cause as a result. They suggest _inviting_ group members to the voluntary struggle. Your invitation should include three elements:

  1. **Participation as a choice:** There’s no sense of obligation to join—members join solely because they want to, and there is no punishment for deciding not to participate.
  2. **Autonomy:** Participants can make their own decisions regarding their work.
  3. **Meaningful mission** : The members’ struggle is connected to a larger sense of meaning. 



This last point merits deeper exploration, as creating connections**_to the work itself,_** rather than just between the people involved, is the third step to strengthening group connections.

#### Strategy #3: Reconnect Members With Their Work’s Meaning

No matter how excited you are about the cause you’re working for, it’s all too easy to forget your work’s meaningful big picture among the flatness of your day-to-day tasks. **The Heaths urge you to strengthen a group’s connection to the meaning of their work by focusing on cultivating their sense of purpose rather than trying to channel their passion**.

Your passion, your enthusiasm and excitement for the work at hand, is certainly not a bad thing. It is, however, very individualistic: Your enthusiasm depends largely on who you are as a person and how much you enjoy the type of work you’re doing. Because it’s experienced alone and depends on the enjoyment of the work, passion can easily burn out when the work gets boring or the cause is meeting too many obstacles.

Purpose, on the other hand, is a strong motivator—especially in a group setting. Purpose is rooted in the feeling that your efforts (even if you don’t particularly enjoy them) have an impact or some sort of meaning in something much larger than yourself. Cultivating a feeling of purpose in a group by showing members the impact of their work ties them together in a sense of connection to something meaningful, and allows them to power through dull tasks or endless obstacles.

> **The Negative Effect of Chasing Passion**
> 
> In addition to being a poor motivator, there’s no evidence that passion is a route to happiness. Most people believe that the only way to find a job you truly enjoy is to find your passion and follow it. This advice has been mainstream for years, and acts as the starting point for many career books such as Richard Bolles’s _What Color Is Your Parachute?_
> 
> However, others argue it’s not _good_ advice. The “passion hypothesis” has caused a decline in workplace satisfaction over the years: Studies cited in Cal Newport’s _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ show that only 45% of Americans report being happy with their jobs, likely because they feel that they _should_ be doing something that aligns with their passions.

#### Example: GreenSpace Volunteer Rally

To better understand how shared moments, voluntary struggle, and a meaningful mission can come together in a successful moment of connection, let’s look at the example of GreenSpace.

GreenSpace (GS) is an organization that builds and maintains parks, playgrounds, and community gardens for underserved neighborhoods and schools in Detroit. They rely heavily on the work of volunteers for myriad tasks. When volunteers started putting in half the hours they used to, GS decided to create a defining moment that would reconnect volunteers with their mission.

##### Step 1: Create a Shared Moment

The GS founder went _all out_ pulling together a volunteer rally.**** He rented out the Detroit Institute of Art; he filled the temporary exhibition gallery with photographs of people enjoying GS parks; he bussed in volunteers from all corners of the city; he hired caterers to make appetizers with vegetables from GS community gardens.

##### Step 2: Reconnect Volunteers with the GS Mission

The founder gave a speech about the triumphs of GS so far, current struggles, and goals moving forward. Then, an 18-year-old woman spoke about her experience growing up in Detroit and spending time in the safe space of a GS park and then revealed that she’ll be studying urban planning at university. The energy of the volunteers was palpable—being in a crowd of excited, like-minded people reignited volunteers’ passion for the work.

##### Step 3: Allow for Voluntary Struggle

To help with his goals, the founder presented the idea of a new Community Task Force. If interested, volunteers could sign up to run community events to advertise GS’s work and mission, recruit new volunteers, and regularly survey community members for feedback and new ideas. At the end of the rally, there were _200 volunteers_ signed up for the Community Task Force.

### Part 2: Use Connection to Deepen Individual Relationships

While the “shared moment + voluntary struggle + connection to meaning” formula works for creating connections that deepen group relationships, creating defining moments by strengthening _individual_ relationships requires a different route.

The Heaths explain that, contrary to what you might think, relationships do not naturally deepen or grow stronger over time.**Without regular maintenance, relationships easily plateau—they won’t develop any further without a bit of engineering**. A properly maintained relationship has positive peaks that serve as the defining moments that deepen the relationship.

The Heaths clarify that in the context of relationships, these positive peaks happen in instances of _responsiveness_ —moments of engagement with someone else that make it clear that you’re listening to and care about them. Responsiveness conveys three essential messages:

  * Support: I actively support you and will help you get what you want or need. 
  * Understanding: I know what’s important to you and who you are.
  * Respect: I respect who you are and your wants or needs.



These three messages together accomplish the goal of responsiveness—to make someone feel special and seen. These positive feelings bolster emotional wellness and self-esteem and establish feelings of security in the relationship. Without responsiveness, relationships struggle and stagnate.

> **How Does Responsiveness Contribute to Defining Moments?**
> 
> Part of the reason that instances of connection and responsiveness can be so memorable is that they’re _novel experiences_ in our current world.
> 
> In _Lost Connections, _journalist __ Johann Hari writes that people are spending less time than ever participating in meaningful, in-person social activities where they might establish connections with others—such as dinner parties or group outings. The problem is that our world is becoming increasingly connected online—which means our interactions are focused on superficial _communication_ rather than a true, supportive _connection_.
> 
> As we become more and more accustomed to communicating with messages, tags, and likes, the experience of true _connection_ that comes from opening up to another person and receiving respect, support, and understanding in return stands out as a pleasant surprise.

#### Responsiveness in Personal Relationships

**In personal relationships, responsiveness is part of a formula: vulnerability + responsiveness = intimacy _._** In practice, this formula looks fairly simple: You share something (vulnerability) and then wait to see if the other person shares something in return (responsiveness). By choosing to respond, they express respect _,_ understanding _,_ and support.

**The Heaths stress that intimacy doesn’t come from either responsiveness or vulnerability alone—it’s crucial that there’s an _exchange_ between the two. **When completed, this simple exchange opens up the possibility to continue sharing and learning about one another, to build intimacy and trust. In other words, it allows the relationship to progress instead of plateauing. It’s important to keep in mind that this exchange doesn’t happen naturally—someone needs to take the first step of vulnerability in order to start the cycle.**** If you want richer, deeper connections in your life, you must either be willing to be open with others or recognize when others are making the step to be open with you.

For example, you meet a girl on your first day of sleepaway camp. You reach out with vulnerability: “I’m nervous being so far from home for the first time.” Your relationship can develop in one of two ways:

  * She doesn’t recognize your attempt at connection or chooses not to engage: “Oh. Well, you’ll get used to it.” The relationship that could have deepened to “best friends” screeches to a halt at “acquaintances.”
  * She engages with your vulnerability and responds with her own: “Honestly, me too! I miss my parents a little.” You quickly become best friends because you both chose to complete the exchange of vulnerability and responsiveness, allowing your relationship to deepen rapidly.



> **The Importance of Aligning Expression and Reception**
> 
> The Heaths’ approach to responsiveness is somewhat one-size-fits-all: Someone expresses vulnerability, and by expressing vulnerability in exchange, you reveal that you see them, care about them, and understand them. **A crucially important point that this approach misses is that _not everyone gives and receives support, understanding, and respect the same way._**
> 
> Many missed opportunities for connection and responsiveness come about because one person’s _expression_ of care and understanding is misaligned with the other person’s _reception_ of care and understanding. Once you know what makes someone feel seen, it becomes much easier to respond meaningfully to their attempts to connect with you.
> 
> Gary Chapman’s _The Five Love Languages_ is well-known for its lessons in determining what actions make you _and_ those in your life feel seen and understood. The book focuses on the way we express love through five “languages'': acts of service, physical touch, words of affirmation, gifts, and quality time. Knowing someone’s love language means that when they open up to you, you can respond to their vulnerability in a way that aligns with the way they view understanding and care—thereby deepening your relationship.
> 
> For example, your friend reveals to you that she’s behind on a project at work and is worried she’ll be fired if she doesn’t get it done.
> 
>   * You reply with _your_ love language, words of affirmation: You say, “That’s so stressful. You’re so organized, though—I know you can do it.” Rather than feeling understood, she feels that you’re just saying nice things as a way to brush off her concerns.
> 
>   * You reply with _her_ love language, acts of service: You say, “That’s so stressful. How about I pick up your kids from school each afternoon and feed them at my place? That way you can stay late at work without worrying. Let me know if I can do anything else.” Your friend feels understood and deeply connected to you because you’ve shown that you care _in a way that makes sense to her._

##### Shortform Commentary: How Responsiveness Makes for Better Teams

Most people wouldn’t think of their workplace as an appropriate setting for being vulnerable with others or practicing responsiveness. This thinking leads to long-term relationships that never deepen.

  * For example, you’ve been sitting next to the same colleague for five years, and barely know them because you always have the same conversation: “Hey, how are you?” “Can’t complain, and you?” “Living the dream.” Even if she were to attempt opening up to you by saying something such as, “This has been such a long week, I’m feeling so overwhelmed,” it’s likely you wouldn’t recognize the attempt and would brush her off (“Yeah, TGIF right?”) rather than reciprocate her vulnerability (“Me too. I’m feeling nervous about the Smith account. What’s got you feeling overwhelmed?”)



**Learning to spot vulnerability _and reciprocate it_ in the workplace is crucial to building strong, innovative teams. **Shame and vulnerability expert Brené Brown discusses the importance of workplace vulnerability in _Dare to Lead_. According to Brown, when team members are encouraged to express and engage with their vulnerability, it creates a sense of _psychological safety—_ the understanding that you can express yourself freely, without fear of mockery or harsh repercussions. She goes on to describe the benefits of psychological safety: Team members are more likely to push against the status quo, trust and rely on one another, and come up with creative and innovative ideas.

In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott—former team leader at Google and CEO coach at Dropbox and Twitter—provides guidelines for starting the process of building vulnerable, trusting connections at work. She notes that the best place to start is by asking your team members questions about themselves, and then engaging with their responses. It’s important not to delve into deeply personal questions straight away—trust is built up through small, repeated exchanges of vulnerability and responsiveness.

#### How Organizations Can Use Responsiveness In Client Relationships

It’s easy to understand how responsiveness supports personal relationships such as with your partner, your friends, or your colleagues. However, the Heaths point out that you might not realize how important it is to support your _professional_ relationships with responsiveness. Doing so can help you better connect with the clients you interact with on a regular basis.

**The Heaths reveal that treating your clients with responsiveness shows them that you understand and validate their feelings and makes for a satisfying experience that boosts their loyalty to your organization.** On the other hand, canned responses—all too common in client services—create an unsatisfying, invalidating experience for clients.

##### Example: What Client Responsiveness Looks Like

Imagine that one of your customers is having a problem with her new smartphone. She’s called your troubleshooting service five times in an attempt to figure it out. Each call starts the same way: “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” “Are you running the most recent software?” You can understand how your customer might find repeatedly answering the same questions infuriating. Your lack of responsiveness makes her feel that she’s seen as another number in the system, rather than as an individual.

This problem is easy to turn around with responsiveness. The next time she calls, you start with: “Hi Mrs. Brown, I understand you’re having an ongoing issue with your smartphone. Can you tell me what you’ve tried already? Don’t want to make you needlessly repeat steps.” This new type of interaction, which acknowledges her past experiences and builds from them, shows her that you see her and care about her. The connection of this moment has the potential to reshape her negative perception of your company—though she approached you with a problem, she’ll likely leave with an overall positive impression.

> **Can Technology and Client Responsiveness Coexist?**
> 
> Many of the experiences of client responsiveness that the Heaths discuss happen _between people_. However, most people are increasingly interacting with organizations by distant, digital means. Is it possible to practice responsiveness and create meaningful, memorable connections with clients in digital settings?
> 
> Organizations looking to strengthen loyalty among clients that they don’t interact with in person can do so by focusing on the individual relationships they build with clients just as much as they focus on their product and costs.
> 
> Perhaps counterintuitively, “deepening relationships” in this sense depends on machine learning rather than making connections between people. By collecting data on the way clients use your service, your algorithm can determine the experience each client wants and refine your service’s relationship with them. The client, as a result, thinks of your service as _valuable_ and _unique._
> 
> Here are a few examples of what this could look like:
> 
>   * A bank might track a client’s data in order to learn what type of transactions she makes in certain locations or on certain days. The bank uses the information to create customized home screens on their ATMs that show the client quick-access buttons to her two most common transactions—these buttons change depending on the time of day and location of the ATM.
> 
>   * A streaming service asks, “What’s up?” each time a client logs in to browse for something to watch. The question is accompanied by a list of moods and activities that the client can choose from. The service’s algorithm comes up with show and film suggestions depending on the client’s response. Over time, the service can predict how the client will feel and what she’ll be doing throughout the week and can curate suggestion lists such as “Shows for a Quick Lunchtime Watch” or “Our Top Films for Sunday Night Chilling.”
> 
> 

> 
> Both of these organizations’ gestures make the client feel, in a small way, that she’s seen and understood—despite the fact that she’s interacting with an algorithm rather than a person. The connection makes her start to think of the organization as a “friend,” increasing her loyalty to them.

### Conclusion: What Defining Moments Give Us

The Heaths’ book demonstrates that there are many positives to creating more defining moments in your life. Some of these moments can produce tangible outcomes like more revenue from satisfied clients, better work from loyal employees, or higher test scores from motivated students. Other moments will grant you more personal positives, like more confident children, deeper relationships with your friends and family, and a better understanding of your capabilities, motivations, and values.

Above all, however, looking for moments that you can enhance with elevation, pride, connection, or insight can multiply the rich experiences that make your life meaningful. **Focusing on meaningful moments is a way to reconnect with what’s important to a well-lived life.** Investment in these moments offers you the opportunity to re-engage with your life and fight against the everyday flatness that causes days, months, and years to speed by.
