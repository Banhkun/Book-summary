## Exercise: Practice Responsiveness and Vulnerability

A key to strengthening your ties with the people around you is to practice responsiveness and be willing to show vulnerability. This exercise will help you think about how you can practice both of these elements in your personal relationships.

* * *

Think of someone with whom you would like to strengthen your relationship. (Do you and your coworker routinely resort to talking about the weather because you don't really know each other? Are you holding back from telling your professor how much her class has helped you through this year because your relationship has never extended past the classroom?) Describe your current dynamic.

What can you share with this person in order to take the first step in the cycle of vulnerability and responsiveness?
