## Exercise: Engineer an Aha! Moment

Telling someone what they need to do is not nearly as effective as letting them realize on their own what they need to do. Think of someone you know who needs to confront an uncomfortable truth and how you might guide this person to make the realization themselves.

* * *

Remember the three elements of creating an effective moment of discovery: 1) have a clear conclusion in mind 2) keep the timeframe short 3) let your audience make the discovery themselves.

What is the clear conclusion they need to reach?

How can you lead them to this conclusion in a short timeframe (a few minutes or hours)?

How will you present the issue, so that they become aware of the problem on their own?
