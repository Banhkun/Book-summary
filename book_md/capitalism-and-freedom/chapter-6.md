## Chapter 6: Public Schools

Even in a capitalist society supposedly based upon voluntary exchange between individuals, **we have come to accept a large role for the government in the management of economic affairs and the provision of certain goods and services**. We’ve seen this already with important government functions like the curbing of monopolies and regulation of the money supply.

But should the government play such a key role in our lives? Is much of what the government does truly defensible in the context of a society that claims to value economic freedom?

**One sector where the government plays a nearly monopolistic role is in the financing and administration of children’s education**. In this chapter, we’ll explore:

  * Why K-12 education provides broad benefits to society;
  * How the American system of government-run schools eliminates choice and competition in education, thereby producing bad results;
  * How giving parents the freedom to choose where to send their children to school will boost economic freedom and yield better educational outcomes; and
  * Why vocational and technical education should not be supported with taxpayer money.



### Neighborhood Effects of Education

We discussed neighborhood effects in Chapter 2. To recap, neighborhood effects describe

those actions by an individual (let’s call them “Individual A”) that:

  * Confer a _benefit_ upon other people that by its nature makes it infeasible for them to be charged by Individual A for their receipt of that benefit; or
  * Impose a _cost_ upon other people that by its nature is infeasible for them to receive compensation from Individual A.



Because of the nature of such transactions, they make voluntary exchange impractical. Transactions that yield significant neighborhood effects _should_ be undertaken by governments, not the private sector.

**The provision of education to children and adolescents has strong neighborhood effects.** Especially in a democratic system, society broadly benefits by having a population that is literate, civic minded, and adequately prepared to take on the responsibilities of citizenship. Basic education instills these qualities in young people and confers significant benefits upon everyone else, but it is impossible to “charge” everyone else for the “value” of the benefit they receive. Therefore, it is appropriate that governments guarantee K-12 education (although we’ll explore later in the chapter why neighborhood effects don’t apply to education beyond this age range).

### Government Financing vs. Government Administration of Schools

Because of the clear neighborhood effects, nearly all advanced, industrialized countries make significant investments in public education. In the United States, K-12 public education is financed primarily through property taxes assessed on those owning property within a given school district. This is often supplemented by additional money from the state and federal government, usually based on standard school aid formulas.

**But while the _financing_ of education through public money can be justified on the basis of neighborhood effects, its _administration_ cannot be. **Having governments actually run the schools and directly provide educational services means that**** parents are legally mandated to send their children to the school for which they are zoned, even if the quality of education at that school is known to be poor or if they dislike the content being taught.

Children attend school in government-owned buildings and are taught government-approved material by government-paid teachers. Parents, given a choice, may not wish to send their children to school in a large physical building, which is expensive to maintain, and where their money as taxpayers might be spent on all manner of activities that they do not deem appropriate or relevant to their child’s education (including art, music, gym, and extracurricular clubs and sports).

#### Elimination of Choice for Parents

If parents do _not_ wish to have their money put to such uses or to send their children to low-quality neighborhood schools, their only options are to:

  * Pay out-of-pocket for expensive parochial or private schools, which effectively means that they are paying twice for education (as they will still be paying taxes to finance public education), or
  * Move out of their school district to one with better schools, a process that is also expensive, cumbersome, and entails significant disruption to one’s life.



### Vouchers and School Choice

This state of affairs is clearly in conflict with economic freedom, eliminating, at least in a practical sense, the right of individuals (parents) to enter into voluntary contracts to pay for the services they wish to receive (education).

The solution to this problem is to decouple the public _financing_ of education from the public _administration_ of schools. **Instead of paying taxes and having no choice in the matter of where to send their children to school, parents should instead receive a voucher from the government.**

This voucher would be redeemable for educational services up to a certain amount for each child, provided that they are spent on approved education providers that meet certain minimum standards. Beyond that minimum requirement, parents would be free to spend their vouchers on whatever educational option they deem to be best for their children.

#### Equality of Opportunity

**This introduction of school choice would greatly enhance equality of opportunity, particularly for children in underserved communities.** Under the existing system of the government’s near-monopoly on K-12 education, children in such communities are trapped in failing schools.

The tax base of their neighborhood is usually too poor to raise adequate funds to finance decent schools. Because of their poverty, these children’s families rarely have the necessary funds to send them to private school or to move out of the neighborhood. Thus, the system locks in an incumbency advantage for underperforming public schools that only families of means can hope to escape. It is inherently prejudicial to economically disadvantaged children—and in America, this often means children of color.

**With a voucher system, disadvantaged families would be able to spend their money on schools of _their_ choice, enabling them to escape their failing local schools. **Because the vouchers would be standardized, these families would have the same purchasing power for educational services as everyone else—reducing their comparative disadvantage in the market and enabling them to compete on more equal footing with families of greater means.

This would also be likely to break down _de facto_ racial segregation in the school system, as children of color would have greater freedom to leave the neighborhood schools for which they are zoned.

#### Introducing Competition

**A voucher program would also inject some much-needed competition into the market for education providers.** Because government-operated schools enjoy a near-monopoly on the provision of educational services, they have little incentive to become more efficient or to raise their standards.

They receive guaranteed revenue that their “customers” are legally _required_ to pay them in the form of taxes, regardless of performance. Teachers, like the school system itself, have few incentives to perform well because they are not paid more for producing better results. Their wage increases are instead tied to their acquisition of certain teaching degrees and to seniority (where the longest-tenured teachers automatically receive higher salaries).

**Vouchers would deprive underperforming schools and teachers of their guaranteed revenue stream.** With parents having greater freedom in the choice of where to send their children to school, market forces would introduce more efficiency into the system. Government-run schools that produced poor results would soon find themselves deprived of revenue (like any other seller that produced inferior goods); ineffective teachers would find themselves out of a job.

Over time, resources would flow to those schools that produced better results and away from those that didn't, as they would in any market.

### Against Subsidized Higher Education

**As one proceeds in one’s educational career, however, it becomes more difficult to justify direct public expenditure on educational institutions on the basis of neighborhood effects.** When young people reach college age, their continued education might confer some general benefits on society, but by and large, the students _themselves_ are the beneficiaries.

This is because of the high degree of specialization that usually characterizes education at this level. The knowledge and skills gained tend to have much more limited application in the economy. It is difficult to argue, for example, that society benefits directly from one’s decision to study Norse mythology or French literature at a university. Such studies might confer non-economic benefits on those who choose to study them, but it is not a cost that ought to be subsidized through taxation.

Public support for technical schools or vocational schools present a similar problem. Learning a skill for a particular trade might very well increase an individual’s earning power in the job market. But we as taxpayers will never see the return on investment from that individual’s education. The costs, in taxes, are borne entirely by society; the gains, in higher wages, are enjoyed entirely by the individual. This arrangement is a violation of economic freedom because it forces taxpayers into an involuntary exchange for which they may receive no benefit.
