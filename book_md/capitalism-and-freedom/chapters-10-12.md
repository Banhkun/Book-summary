## Chapters 10-12: Inequality and Redistribution

**One of the cornerstones of a society based upon voluntary exchange is the right to keep what you earn.** After all, what you earn in the market is a product of the productive capacity of your own labor and capital.

Yet critics of capitalism assert that one’s right to private property is _itself_ an injustice. They claim that capitalism as a system inherently leads to unequal—and, according to their worldview, unjust—outcomes.

In this chapter, we’ll explore why income and wealth inequality are not injustices, but rather, the natural outcomes of a system based upon economic freedom. We’ll see how inequality is not merely a regrettable by-product of capitalism but vital to the maintenance of a voluntary exchange system. Lastly, we’ll explore how **redistributive government policies like progressive income taxes fail to achieve their stated goals of reducing income inequality.**

### Payment According to Product

The fairest and most efficient way to allocate resources in a system of voluntary exchange is through payment according to product. Essentially, you get what you put in. Your compensation is a direct result of the value you create in the economy through your labor (the work you perform for which you are paid in wages and tips) and your capital (the productive assets you own, like land or machinery).

**Outcomes are unequal because human beings all have different endowments of energy, talent, and capital.** Some jobs are more unpleasant, entail more risk, or require longer hours than others—because fewer people will wish to do such jobs, they tend to be more highly compensated. Those who avoid such jobs tend to receive _alternative_ compensation in the form of greater job security or more leisure time. Presumably, these individuals place greater value on such non-monetary rewards.

A system that mandated equal compensation would therefore produce unequal outcomes, because individuals doing unpleasant work would receive the same money as those doing more leisurely work. But because one group values money more than the other, the total compensation would be more unequal than it was before.

#### Inheritance and Economic Freedom

In a capitalist society like the United States, where there is great mobility of people and capital and a tremendous variance in the level of individual talent, it is extremely difficult to determine what the source of someone’s wealth is at any given time.

**Far too many factors come into play to determine one’s net worth, many of them completely beyond an individual’s control.** It is simply impossible to determine how much anyone’s wealth is “earned” or “unearned,” however we choose to define the terms. But even if a system could somehow be devised that only redistributed “unearned” wealth (like from an inheritance) and left “earned” wealth alone, it would still be harmful to economic freedom.

This is because **there is no moral difference between earned wealth and inherited wealth.** Even if you inherit a vast fortune from your family, it is still ultimately a product of human endeavor—at some point, someone _did_ create that wealth. Moreover, economic freedom demands that individuals have the ability to do as they please with their property, so long as it does not impose a cost on someone else. Thus, choosing to pass property along to one’s heirs is a perfectly legitimate act within a capitalist system.

#### The Injustice of Redistribution

If we accept that payment according to product is a just and rational way to allocate resources within a system of voluntary exchange, then **any forced redistribution schemes are inherently unjust.**

There is no moral justification for a majority to compel a minority to hand over its property—whether it’s a gang of armed robbers telling you to hand over the cash in your wallet or a majority of voters passing legislation to legally confiscate wealth from the so-called “1 percent.”

Moreover, inequality of outcomes also creates the basis for voluntary exchange itself. If we all received identical compensation or had all of our needs taken care of by the government, we would have no reason to buy, sell, or trade with others through markets. After all, in any voluntary transaction, the buyer lacks what the seller has and seeks to obtain it through exchange.

Lastly, inequality enables entrepreneurs to use their extra resources to invest in new ventures that can yield higher rates of return—which creates new opportunities and benefits society as a whole.

### Capitalism: Enemy of Inequality

Contrary to the views of anti-capitalists, **advanced capitalist countries have _less_ inequality than underdeveloped countries or those with legal caste systems.**

Moreover, ownership of property represents a far smaller share of national income in capitalist countries than it does in underdeveloped or non-capitalist societies. In advanced capitalist societies, wages earned through labor represent a far greater share of national income. That’s no coincidence. Labor is far more productive in such societies, and thus, provides workers with greater opportunities and earning power.

The record of capitalism has shown it to be highly successful at raising the standard of living for the vast majority of people living under it. Through efficient mass production, modern capitalism gives the majority of people access to those goods and services that were historically only available to the very wealthy.

Capitalism, unlike a socialist or caste system, also creates the possibility of upward mobility. Your position in the wealth hierarchy can change, and is not established by law or custom.

#### Against Progressive Income Tax

**To combat the alleged dangers of income inequality, most industrialized countries have established systems of progressive taxation.** Under such a system, the marginal rate of taxation increases the more one earns. Thus, your income from $0-$49,000 might be taxed at 12 percent, your income from $50,000-$99,999 might be taxed at 25 percent, and so on.

Yet they seldom succeed in reducing inequality or even raising more revenue than would be earned through a non-progressive tax system. **One problem with progressive taxation is that it increases _pre-tax_ income inequality.** If high earners know that their top marginal tax rate is going to be high, lucrative jobs become less attractive than they would otherwise be. The only way to compensate for this is to make these kinds of jobs even _more_ well-paid—thereby increasing inequality.

**Progressive tax codes are also nearly always more complex than alternatives**. They contain all sorts of loopholes and deductions that tax certain kinds of income (like capital gains) at different rates than other kinds of income (like standard wages and tips).

This adds an element of arbitrariness into the tax code and is often the product of special-interest lobbying. It also creates a strong incentive for wealthy people to devote inordinate resources to devising complex tax-avoidance schemes to help them lower their overall tax liability. This tax avoidance spending is extraordinarily wasteful.

This is why progressive taxation often fails even on purely redistributive grounds—the loopholes and carve-outs give those who can afford to pay tax professionals (who are likely to be wealthy themselves) an opportunity to avoid paying their share owed by law.

#### The Flat Tax

**A flat tax is more efficient and equitable than a progressive tax.** Under a flat tax, everyone would pay the same rate, regardless of income level or income type. A flat tax plan would also broaden the definition of “income,” taxing more _types_ of income than the present system does, while closing loopholes and special-interest exemptions.

Because the tax _base_ would be broader, a flat tax would also enable the overall tax _rate_ to be much lower. By closing loopholes and strictly limiting deductions, a flat tax would likely yield more revenue than a progressive system, while smoothing out inequalities in the tax code. Because the rates would be uniform and all types of income would be equally subject to taxation, there would be far less incentive for individuals and businesses to waste resources on tax avoidance schemes.

### Anti-Poverty Programs

Progressive taxation is not the only policy by which the government attempts to redistribute income and alleviate poverty. Through a range of programs, including the provision of public housing, the establishment of federal and state minimum wages, and social insurance (most notably Social Security in the United States), public authorities have attempted—nearly always with the best of intentions—to raise the standard of living of the worst-off members of society.

But **these anti-poverty programs:**

  * **Injure economic freedom by confiscating property from one segment of the population to give it to another,**
  * **Enable the growth of large and increasingly unaccountable government bureaucracies, and**
  * **Paternalistically presume that the government knows what’s best for the people rather than the people themselves.**



Moreover, they usually fail to achieve the goals for which they were created. Instead of alleviating poverty, they exacerbate it and give rise to new social problems—which, in a vicious circle, create a rationale for even _more_ ineffective government action.

#### Public Housing

Public housing programs are designed to alleviate the shortage of housing and ensure that everyone has a roof over their head. In the United States, federal housing programs destroyed existing housing units in urban areas to make room for new, government-subsidized housing projects.

**This was counter-productive. The poor design of this program resulted in a net _decrease_ in the supply of available housing units, **because local special interest groups demanded that slums be cleared and that new government housing be set up in its place**.** Unfortunately, this sort of special-interest lobbying is central to how federal programs of this type work, as they inevitably come to serve the few at everyone else’s expense.

With the public-housing program, this created a situation where more people had to crowd into fewer and fewer housing units, decreasing the standard of living for the occupants of these projects and taking a severe toll on the emotional development of children living there.

By concentrating housing projects in certain geographic areas of cities, federal housing policy created pockets of poverty. This, in turn, destroyed the tax base of these communities, leading to lower-quality schools and fewer economic opportunities to escape neighborhood poverty.

If the government wishes to alleviate housing insecurity, it would be better (and more in accordance with economic freedom) to give families direct cash grants to buy or rent homes in the neighborhoods of their choice.

#### The Minimum Wage

Minimum wage laws backfire in a similar way. The case for a minimum wage is that it provides a basic livable income for people who would otherwise not be able to survive on smaller wages.

**But just because a state passes a minimum wage law, it does not mean that employers will _hire_ people at that rate. If labor becomes too expensive, employers will simply demand less of it. **By reducing employment opportunities at the lower end of the wage scale, minimum wage laws harm the very people they are designed to help. Surely a job that pays less than some arbitrarily defined minimum wage is better than no job at all.

#### Social Security

Perhaps the most famous redistributive program in the United States is Social Security. Social Security is a government pension system that pays benefits primarily to elderly and disabled citizens. It is financed by payroll taxes collected on people during the course of their working lives. As a compulsory program, no one has the option of _not_ paying into Social Security.

Essentially, **the government mandates that everyone purchase a retirement plan and forcibly takes money from people to compel them to purchase the _government_ plan—not a private alternative. **This is the most coercive way that such a system could be designed. Taxpayers are forced to hand over their money to purchase a product that they might very well have elected not to purchase if they had been given free use of their own money.

Even if they were still compelled to purchase a retirement annuity of some sort, many people might have elected a _private_ alternative. But because they are taxed to pay for Social Security, they are deprived of such a choice (and would essentially be paying double if they still chose to purchase a private plan with their after-tax money).

Moreover, the way Social Security is financed represents an unjust redistribution of income from the young to the old. A person retiring today is far more likely to receive more in benefits than they contributed in taxes than a young person just beginning to pay into the system.

This is doubly unfair, as older people are more likely to have accumulated wealth through a lifetime of savings and capital accumulation, whereas young people are less likely to have wealth of their own. **Social Security taxes the comparatively poor young to benefit the comparatively well-off old.**

In the end, Social Security is premised on a paternalistic assumption that government bureaucrats can plan your future better than you can and that you shouldn’t be trusted to handle your own money.

### Negative Income Tax

But one should not take these criticisms of anti-poverty programs to mean that being pro-capitalist necessarily makes one indifferent to poverty. Indeed, alleviating poverty benefits _everyone_ throughout society.

**The problem arises when anti-poverty measures are coercive, are targeted only to certain groups of people, or distort the proper functioning of the market.** To get around these traditional defects of such programs, governments should adopt a negative income tax.

A negative income tax provides a direct cash subsidy to people earning below a certain income threshold. To illustrate how this would work, we’d need to know:

  * The income threshold (the amount below which there is no tax liability);
  * The income tax rate (the rate at which earnings _above_ the income threshold are taxed); and
  * The subsidy rate (the rate at which incomes _below_ the income threshold are subsidized).



Let’s assume that the income threshold is $50,000—that is, those earning below this amount pay no taxes. Let’s further assume that the income tax rate is 20 percent (we’ll assume a flat rate for simplicity’s sake, though the negative tax rate could be graduated). Lastly, let’s assume that the subsidy rate is also 20 percent.

  * Under this scenario, a person earning $40,000 would receive a subsidy of $2,000 from the government (the $10,000 difference between the income threshold and this person’s income, multiplied by the 20 percent subsidy rate).
  * A person earning $100,000 would pay a tax of $20,000 (the $100,000 income multiplied by the 20 percent income tax rate).
  * A person earning $50,000 would receive no subsidy nor pay any taxes (because their earnings would be precisely at the threshold).



**A negative income tax would redistribute income, but on a far more equitable and transparent basis than traditional tax-and-transfer programs.** It would effectively guarantee a certain basic income for everyone. It would also be more efficient than the current patchwork of welfare programs, most of which are targeted to specific groups (like veterans, widows, the elderly, and so on). The narrow and targeted nature of such benefits programs requires an expensive bureaucracy to maintain and administer them.

The negative income tax would deliver cash benefits directly to people without forcing them to jump through endless government red tape and would give them the freedom to spend their money as they saw fit.
