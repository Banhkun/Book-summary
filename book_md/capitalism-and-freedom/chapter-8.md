## Chapter 8: Monopoly Power

In the last chapter, we saw the hollowness of charges that capitalism is an instrument of oppression and discrimination. In a similar vein, those who favor a movement away from a system of voluntary exchange toward one of central state control over the economy often cite monopolies as a dangerous—and inevitable—aspect of capitalism.

But this is also incorrect. **While monopolies are indeed harmful to individual liberty, free-market capitalism in fact offers the best antidote to the dangerous concentration of economic power they represent.**

In this chapter, we’ll explore:

  * The two types of private monopoly (industrial and labor), as well as public monopoly;
  * Why public monopolies and government support for private monopolies pose the greatest threats to economic freedom; 
  * Policy ideas to discourage monopolies; and
  * Why notions of “corporate social responsibility” are inherently dangerous to a system of voluntary exchange.



### The Myth of Industrial Monopoly

In Chapter 2, we looked at the three types of monopolies: private unregulated, private regulated, and public. But within private monopolies, there are two sub-categories: industrial and labor monopolies.

**An industrial monopoly is when a private company fully corners the market share for a particular product or service.** This enables the company to set prices more or less at will, as it is in no immediate danger of competition. The industrial monopolist exerts unchecked leverage over customers, employees, and suppliers.

Although such monopolies are certainly harmful to the free market and to basic principles of economic freedom (which, as we saw in Chapter 2, is why supporters of voluntary exchange ought to be in favor of antitrust laws), they are actually quite rare in the United States.

Although some industries are indeed heavily concentrated (like smartphones, where a relative handful of producers control nearly 100 percent market share) and others are diffuse (like the restaurant industry, which features hundreds of thousands of independent competitors), **few industries that are not government-controlled can be said to be monopolistic in the modern American economy.**

### Labor Monopoly and the Problem of Unions

**A labor monopoly is when a set of workers in an industry gains full control of its labor market.** This is usually achieved through labor unions and “closed-shop” contracts, which stipulate that all employees hired by management must be members of the union (a topic we explored in the last chapter). With a labor monopoly, unions can demand higher wages of employers, the costs of which ultimately get passed along to consumers.

As with industrial monopolies, however, labor monopolies are rare. The vast majority of unions simply lack the kind leverage necessary to exert this level of control. But even without a monopoly, there is a special danger that a heavily unionized workforce in a key industry can collude with the owners of capital in that industry (who would traditionally be the adversaries of labor) to drive up prices for consumers.

This is precisely what happened with the United Mine Workers (UMW) and the coal companies during the 1930s. The UMW scheduled strikes or work stoppages in order to halt the production of coal whenever the supply of coal in the market got too high. This had the effect of driving prices of coal up—with the union and the mine owners sharing in the profits of this collusion.

#### Labor Unions: Wage Depressors

Although labor monopolies are rare, unions still influence the structure of the economy in important ways. Because of their collective bargaining power, unions drive up the price of labor in the industries where they are most prevalent. But by raising the “price” of labor, unions drive down the _demand_ for labor in those industries—just as price increases in any industry cause buyers to either reduce overall demand or seek substitutes.

By reducing employment in one sector, unions then drive people to seek work in other sectors. This makes the labor markets in _those_ sectors more competitive. Because employers in those industries have more workers competing over the same number of jobs, the result is to reduce wages in those non-unionized industries.

Labor unions tend to be most prevalent and powerful in those industries that feature a highly skilled labor force (which would likely receive higher wages even without the union) and weakest in those industries dominated by a low-skill workforce. Thus, **the real effect of unions is to enrich highly skilled, highly paid labor at the direct expense of unskilled workers.**

### Public Monopoly

As we’ve seen, the private sector is not really the source of most monopolistic behavior in the United States. **Instead, monopolies are most prevalent in those industries that are most heavily controlled by the government.**

Public monopolies can occur when the government directly produces goods for sale. Because they are taxpayer-supported and don’t need to earn a profit to stay afloat, these government monopolies can easily undercut private competitors. Examples of this form of government monopoly include the post office and the construction and maintenance of roads and highways.

But in a capitalist economy like the United States, there are few examples of the government directly providing services for sale of which it is the sole provider. Instead, a more common form of public monopoly is when the government uses its regulatory authority to entrench private firms and lock out potential competitors within a particular industry.

In the United States, for example, many utilities like water and electricity are provided by “public utilities,” which are effectively private monopolies backed up by government subsidy and regulation. Historically, other examples of these mixed public-private monopolies have included:

  * Agricultural price supports (where the government establishes price floors for certain agricultural commodities by paying farmers _not_ to grow them); 
  * The Civil Aeronautics Board (which effectively allowed only a few major carriers to provide commercial air service, before it was abolished in the first wave of deregulation in 1978); and
  * The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a government agency that controls the airwaves and determines which private operators are licensed to broadcast.



#### Tax Policy and Monopoly

**Governments have a number of tools at their disposal to reduce private competition within an industry.** Tariffs, for example, tax imported goods and services and make it more difficult for foreign firms to compete. This enables domestic firms to gain a competitive advantage that they might otherwise lack, but leads to less choice for consumers.

Private monopolies or near-monopolies also benefit from poorly designed features of the US tax code. For example, corporate, capital gains, and dividend taxes all disincentivize shareholders from putting corporate profits toward new investments. Because investors face a tax penalty when they sell stock or collect a dividend, it is often a better option to simply plow money back into an existing large company by purchasing more shares. This chokes off investment into other ventures that might be more productive and yield a higher rate of return.

The effect is to protect large incumbent businesses by giving them the lion’s share of available capital, even when they have little productive use for it.

### The Injustice of “Corporate Social Responsibility”

We often hear the view expressed by public officials and activists that large private businesses like those we’ve been discussing in this chapter have a greater responsibility to their communities and societies beyond simply making money. This is the idea of “corporate social responsibility.” But corporate social responsibility is at odds with how private firms, especially those with shareholders, should behave in a free-market economy.

**The role of the corporation in a free society is to maximize profits for its shareholders—period.** The corporation and its officers (including the CEO) are _hired_ by the shareholders to manage the firm’s day-to-day operations and to prioritize profit maximization with every decision they make.

After all, the shareholders are the _owners_ of the corporation—expenditures are made with _their_ money. Thus, when a CEO or board of directors decides to make a corporate gift to a hospital, school, or other philanthropic endeavor, it is doing so with other people’s money. The shareholders did not choose to have their money spent this way. Presumably, if they wished to make such gifts on their own, they would do so.

But for a corporation in which they have invested as shareholders to do this amounts to unelected corporate leaders imposing an arbitrary tax. This situation is compounded further by wrongheaded public policy, which awards corporations with generous tax deductions for such gifts—effectively subsidizing this unsanctioned use of shareholder wealth.

(Shortform note: Friedman expanded on this idea further in his famous 1970 article for the _New York Times Magazine_ , “The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.” Friedman’s ideas were highly influential in the shareholder value maximization model, which became popular with business leaders beginning in the 1980s. This model of business activity held that the most important measure of a company's success was the financial returns to its shareholders.)

#### Price Ceilings and the Road to a Planned Economy

**Corporations are also pressured to demonstrate social responsibility by keeping prices of certain staple goods low so as to prevent inflation.** But this is also ruinous in the long-run to a free economy.

If corporations cannot get the price they want for a particular good, they will simply produce less of it. The inevitable results of such price ceilings are shortages and the emergence of black markets. With such a state of chaos in the market for core commodities, governments would inevitably face enormous political pressure to step in and manage production and distribution directly. From there, it is a slippery slope to a planned economy and the end of voluntary exchange.
