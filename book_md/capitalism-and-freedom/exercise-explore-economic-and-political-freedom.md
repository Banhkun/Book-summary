## Exercise: Explore Economic and Political Freedom

Examine the link between economic and political freedom.

* * *

Do you think there are freedoms that are more important than the freedom to spend your own money as you wish? Why or why not?

Do you think political freedom stems from economic freedom, or the opposite? Why or why not?

Beyond what we covered in the summary, do you think there are services provided by the government that could be better provided by the private sector? If so, name them and explain your answer.
