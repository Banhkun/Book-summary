## Chapter 5: Against Keynesianism

In the last chapter, we analyzed monetary policy—a government’s control of its money supply and its currency’s value—and its impact on economic freedom. In this chapter, we’ll turn our attention to _fiscal_ policy—how (and how much) the government chooses to tax and spend.

In particular, we’ll focus on the once-dominant Keynesian school of economics—and why its simplistic assumptions failed to deliver the real-world benefits it promised.

### Keynesian Economics

**Following the Great Depression, there was a groundswell of public support for aggressive fiscal policy on the part of the federal government.** The public wanted the government to offset the collapse in private spending with large, deficit-financed spending from the federal government (that, is, increases in spending _without_ offsetting tax increases).

The intellectual underpinning of this policy was the Keynesian school of economics. Named for the British economist John Maynard Keynes, Keynesianism argued that gross domestic product (GDP) was primarily made up of four components:

  * Consumer spending
  * Government spending
  * Investment
  * Net exports



According to this theory, when a severe recession or depression caused a decline in one or all of the other three components (especially consumer spending), government spending could make up for the shortfall by infusing cash into the economy.

#### Counter-Cyclical Spending

**Countercyclical fiscal policy is at the heart of Keynesian economics.** It states that**** during a recession, the government should stimulate the economy by raising spending and cutting taxes to “prime the pump” and infuse cash into the system. This gives consumers and businesses the necessary funds to make purchases.

When the economy begins to recover, however, the government should pare back its expansionary fiscal policies. This cycle of spending during the slump and austerity during the recovery is meant to ensure that aggregate demand in the economy remains stable.

**Unfortunately, it has historically been difficult for policymakers to turn the fiscal pump on and off at the right time.** New spending programs are hastily voted on, but often only go into effect after the crisis has passed and they’re not needed anymore. Because these programs inevitably create beneficiaries, politicians tend to be highly reluctant to end them, for fear of antagonizing voters. The result over time is a cycle of higher spending, higher taxes, higher borrowing, and higher inflation, all to pay for an out-of-control welfare state.

#### Multiplier Effects

**Another lynchpin of Keynesian economics is the fiscal multiplier effect.** According to this principle, when the government spends money, it creates new spending power in the economy above and beyond the original government expenditure. This is best illustrated by example.

  * Let’s say that during an economic downturn, the government sends you a check for $100. You then proceed to save 20 percent of it ($20) and then spend the remaining $80 on goods and services of your choice.
  * But because one person’s spending is another person’s income (and vice versa), the recipient of the $80 you just spent _also_ proceeds to spend _their_ new income.
  * Even if they save the same 20 percent of it as you did, that still leaves them with $64 to spend. In just these two cycles, the private expenditures made possible by the government (your $80 + the other person’s $64) equals $144—more than the initial $100 jolt of government spending.
  * This cycle continues on and on, stimulating more aggregate demand. In this particular cycle, since one-fifth of the money is being saved in each round of spending, we can say that the multiplier is 5—in other words, the initial $100 increase in government spending

leads to $500 in private spending.




Thus, according to Keynesian economics, government fiscal policy delivers great return on initial investment.

### Crowding Out: The Problem With Keynesianism

**Unfortunately,** **the simple Keynesian analysis leaves much out of the equation.** It neglects to consider _what_ the government spends money on. If the government uses its fiscal power to publicly subsidize some service that you once paid for with your own private spending (like access to a beach), then in theory, it has freed you up to spend that money on something else—thereby adding new private spending into the economy.

But since you had been freely spending your money to get access to the beach, it is reasonable to assume that you placed a higher _value_ on that use of your money than you did on alternative uses. Since you are now getting that access for “free,” you are unlikely to increase your spending on other goods or services above and beyond what you were already spending, because you don’t value those other goods and services as highly.

The subsidy, in this case, would cause you to _pull back_ your private consumer spending. Government spending therefore crowds out private spending.

#### Borrowing Funds, Diverting Spending

We see this further when we consider _where_ the government is acquiring the funds for its aggressive fiscal policy. Most likely, it is borrowing the money from investors and issuing bonds to those creditors.

This, of course, does _not_ increase the total stock of money in the private sector—it merely moves it from one party (the purchaser of government bonds) to another party (the ultimate recipient of government spending). Under most economic conditions, those investors _would_ have spent the money they used to purchase bonds on some other set of goods and services in the private sector.

**The borrowing in and of itself, then, diverts and offsets spending that would have otherwise occurred.** If we return to our previous example with the $100 check you receive from the government, the multiplier effect is closer to $0 than it is to $500.

Government bondholders will only be willing to lend money to the government if they receive an adequate rate of return. If the government borrows too much money, this will cause a general rise in borrowing costs throughout the economy. This will have a dampening effect on consumption and investment, as potential borrowers will be wary of taking out a mortgage or an auto loan at high prevailing interest rates.

### An Outsized Role for Government

**Keynesian economics thus fails to deliver on its core promises.** It is also at odds with economic freedom. Because it places such powerful emphasis on aggressive fiscal policy to recessions, Keynesianism explicitly calls for the political management of the economy.

During recessions, fearful legislators clamor for new outpourings of federal expenditure, unwilling to consider the knock-on effects of their actions. The result has been the growth of both the scale and scope of government since the Great Depression—the state is vastly greater than it was before the 1930s and is engaged in a range of activities in which it has no legitimate business.

Moreover, because the government plays such an outsized role in national GDP, government officials have enormous—and, from the point of view of supporters of economic and political freedom, dangerous—influence over decisions made by individuals and firms in the private sector.
