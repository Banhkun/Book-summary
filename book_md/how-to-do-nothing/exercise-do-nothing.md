## Exercise: Do Nothing

Consider how you can implement Odell’s approach to doing nothing—leaving behind the attention economy mindset and changing how you use attention and time.

* * *

Odell explains that doing nothing requires taking back control of your attention. Were there moments in the past day when your attention was manipulated? How can you avoid these manipulation tactics next time?

According to Odell, under the attention economy, we feel pressured to use our time efficiently and productively. Are there areas in your life in particular where you feel this pressure? For example, maybe you paint as a hobby but feel like you should be making money off of your art.

Odell argues that to resist the attention economy, you can devote your time and attention to connecting with the world around you. How can you use the area of your life mentioned above to connect with the world? For example, maybe you could start painting local nature scenes or join an art class.

Do you agree with Odell’s claim that doing nothing can contribute to social change? Why or why not?
