## 1-Page Summary

In modern life, the need to always do _something_ can be overwhelming. You may feel as though you have to use all your available time to advance your career or accomplish something productive. In _How to Do Nothing_ , professor and visual artist Jenny Odell argues that **this feeling is created by broader social and economic forces and that devoting attention to “non-productive” things is a form of healing and social activism.** Odell’s suggestion of “doing nothing” refers not to _inaction_ but rather to actions that don’t have clear or immediate value, like sitting in nature, making art for its own sake, or learning about an abstract topic that interests you. Our guide explores Odell’s argument in three parts:

  * **Part 1: The Attention Economy** explains why people feel a constant need to be productive and examines the impact of this feeling.
  * **Part 2: What It Means to Do Nothing** outlines Odell’s critiques of other approaches to doing nothing and then introduces her method.
  * **Part 3: How to Do Nothing** shows how Odell’s method of doing nothing benefits both individuals and society.



(Shortform note: _How to Do Nothing_ is part of a growing trend of articles, books, and other media about finding joy and managing stress in an increasingly overwhelming modern world. For example, Austin Kleon’s _Keep Going _explores how to remain creative and find joy in creativity even while under stress. But while works like Kleon’s focus on the individual level, explaining how you can make your _own_ life less stressful, _How to Do Nothing_ tries to paint a broader picture—Odell explains why modern life in general is so stressful and outlines the social changes required to improve it. Odell still offers practical, everyday advice, but this isn’t the book’s only focus.)

### Part 1: The Attention Economy

Before Odell discusses doing nothing, she first outlines the problems it’s meant to solve: the consequences of the _attention economy_ , or **the mindset of placing monetary value on time and attention.** Part 1 of our guide explains how the attention economy works and explores its negative impacts.

(Shortform note: The concept of the attention economy was first proposed by 20th-century American psychologist and economist Herbert A. Simon and amounted to a shift in how to understand information. Simon suggested that instead of thinking of information—advertising, media, ideas, and so on—as a scarce commodity sought out by consumers, we should instead think of the attention of consumers as a scarce commodity sought out by information (or the people who create it). This understanding informs many of the economic shifts Odell discusses, as companies changed strategies to adapt to a new, information-rich world.)

#### How the Attention Economy Works

Odell explains that in the 1980s, corporate deregulation—the elimination of laws and rules regarding corporate conduct—as well as the loss of labor power allowed the wealthy and major corporations to monetize much larger portions of people’s lives. The cutting of social safety nets and stagnation of wages also put people in a situation where they couldn’t say no to more work or worse working conditions without risking their livelihoods. This economic shift led to a _mindset_ shift: **People had to start thinking of their time and attention in terms of monetary value.**

(Shortform note: The development of the attention economy also correlates with a general trend in the developed world away from manufacturing and toward a knowledge- and service-based economy. In this new economy, a much larger portion of wealth comes not from concrete things like houses, cars, or oil but from intangible things like data or intellectual property. This is important because while tangible things are limited in supply, intangible things aren’t—for instance, unlike cars, computer files can be endlessly reproduced at little to no cost. But while supply is nearly limitless, demand is not. Therefore, success in this new economy requires getting attention to _create_ demand.)

##### The Monetization of Time

The increased monetization of time, Odell explains, means **people are almost always “on” in some way.** Over the past several decades, the line between when people are and are not working has grown blurrier. More jobs are temporary gigs or rely on self-promotion, meaning people have to use their time not only to _do_ work but also to ensure they _have_ more work to do in the future.

(Shortform note: The increased monetization of time doesn’t necessarily mean people are getting paid more for all the time they’re “on.” In fact, with the rise of gig and remote work, unpaid overtime has risen sharply over the last few decades—time when workers are doing work-related tasks but not getting paid. This can mean constantly keeping an eye on their email inboxes, taking urgent after-hours work calls, or simply blurring the lines between when they’re on or off work.)

##### The Monetization of Attention

Odell suggests that **the internet and social media have increasingly monetized attention.** The internet generates more money than ever through pay-per-click ads, donations, sponsorships, and so on. And with the vast amount of information available on the internet, people have to compete to be noticed, and some use social or psychological manipulation to try and boost engagement. Even if you aren’t trying to garner attention of your own online, simply using the internet and social media means facing hordes of people clamoring for your attention, many of whom are manipulating you to try and boost engagement.

(Shortform note: Over the past decade or so, there’s been a shift in the monetization of attention as more online businesses move from pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements on free content to subscription services, sponsored content, and content behind paywalls. This also means a change in strategy, as subscription services are less concerned with the views on each individual piece of content and more concerned with maintaining their existing customer base. But while this might lessen the constant demands for consumer attention, it won’t stop attention from being monetized—especially as more subscription services compete with one another.)

#### Consequences of the Attention Economy

Odell explains that **the attention economy** has two main consequences: loss of context and social atomization.

##### 1) Loss of Context and Depth

Odell explains **there’s no room for context and depth in the attention economy**. Learning about the intentions and complexities behind an action, statement, or viewpoint requires a lot of time and probably won’t get very much attention. On the other hand, broader, shallower, and context-free actions, statements, and viewpoints take little time to produce and get a lot more attention. For example, people tend to present generalized versions of themselves on social media, or they use “clickbait” designed to generate outrage—both of which forgo a nuanced perspective in favor of something more marketable.

Without context and depth, people are more easily misled and manipulated. They lack a full understanding of a given situation, and so they’re more likely to go with the most obvious or most popular interpretation, whether or not it’s actually true. For example, Shirley Sherrod, a US Department of Agriculture official in the Obama administration, was asked to resign when a portion of a speech she gave decades earlier was posted online without context to make it seem like she was biased against white people.

(Shortform note: Many authors and academics have noted a shift in society away from context and depth, though they disagree on what’s causing this change. While Odell points to technological and economic changes, others suggest it’s because poor education leaves people without the skills to think deeply or because of a general lack of technological and media literacy.)

##### 2) Social Atomization

The attention economy also leads to social atomization, or **people becoming disconnected from one another and their communities** ,**** explains Odell. Since people are “always on,” they have less time to devote to nurturing connections with the people around them. In addition, succeeding in the attention economy requires people to constantly advocate for or “market” themselves through things like self-promotion or networking. This leads them to see each other as customers, or potential sources of monetary value, rather than as friends and community members.

Atomization has contributed in large part to the modern era’s epidemic of loneliness and lack of meaning in life, explains Odell. It also hampers social and political activism—when people lack deep connections with one another, it’s more difficult to organize them in pursuit of a specific goal.

> **Social Atomization and Capitalism**
> 
> Many socialist, Marxist, and leftist scholars argue that social atomization is not just a feature of the attention economy but actually inherent to capitalism. To explore this argument, let’s contrast capitalism with another economic system: feudalism.
> 
> **Feudalism:** Under feudalism, people were born into a community and generally stayed in that community for their entire lives. Each person had their own specific role within the community—the town blacksmith, the feudal lord or vassal, the family assigned a specific parcel of land, and so on—and therefore everyone worked together as part of a cohesive whole. Feudalism was by no means idyllic, and people were often impoverished and exploited, but because _community_ was the basic social unit, people were not atomized.
> 
> **Capitalism:** Under capitalism, people often have to leave their homes and communities behind to find work, traveling to a new place with economic opportunities where they don’t know anyone. Instead of everyone having their own unique role, workers compete with one another for jobs, while businesses compete with one another for customers—meaning they’re actively at odds with one another instead of being part of a larger whole. Some scholars argue that the separation of the working class into competing individuals is purposeful on the part of the employer class, as it prevents labor organization.

### Part 2: What It Means to Do Nothing

After explaining what the attention economy is and why it’s harmful, Odell **discusses different methods people have used to try and resist it.** In Part 2, we’ll discuss the methods she believes are flawed and then outline her method of doing nothing.

#### Wrong Ways to Resist

Odell critiques two conventional methods people have tried using to resist the attention economy: running away from society and doing a temporary “detox.”

##### 1) Running Away From Society

The first form of resistance Odell critiques is leaving society entirely—going “off the grid” in some kind of isolated location or commune. **This common fantasy of running away is impractical and self-defeating** , argues Odell. Trying to live outside of and separate from our capitalist system is nearly impossible, as it requires total self-sufficiency.

Furthermore, running away from society won’t necessarily get rid of the attention economy _mindset_ of viewing time and attention in terms of monetary value—you can still bring these deep-seated beliefs with you and apply them to your new community.

Lastly, Odell argues that any benefit of running away isn’t worth having to sever all connections with the people, environment, and history of your local community.

(Shortform note: Early Mormon history shows why it’s so difficult to escape capitalism. Under founder Joseph Smith, Mormons lived communally, rejecting private property in favor of social ownership. But over time, this system frayed and eventually collapsed due to infighting and outside persecution—people with wealth objected to the idea of giving it up to be shared with an influx of poor and destitute converts, and there were constant disagreements over how to distribute the communal wealth and property. In addition, non-Mormons often responded violently to these communes, viewing them as political and economic competitors. Eventually, Mormons gave up their communal system and reintegrated with America’s capitalist economy.)

##### 2) Doing a Temporary Detox

The second common understanding of doing nothing is as a temporary detox, or a break from the attention economy, explains Odell. This often takes the form of retreats where you “unplug” or getaways to remote locations without the internet or other common luxuries. Odell argues that the problem with this approach is that **it fails to challenge the overall mindset behind the attention economy—viewing time and attention in terms of value and productivity**. While retreats might help with stress or burnout in the moment, they don’t change the long-term habits that make people stressed and burned out in the first place.

(Shortform note: Many of the temporary detoxes Odell discusses are themselves _participating_ in the attention economy. This is because they’re a part of the _wellness industry:_ a blanket term referring to beauty products, fitness services, retreats, and other products marketed as physically and mentally healthy. The wellness industry is worth billions or even trillions of dollars (depending on how you calculate it) and has grown massively in the past few years. Because it’s so vast, companies and products in the wellness industry have to compete for the attention of consumers—offering a reprieve from the attention economy while perpetuating it.)

#### The Right Way to Resist: Doing Nothing

Odell believes that to resist the attention economy, you must do nothing. Doing nothing refers to two major mindset shifts:

  1. **Refusing to engage with the attention economy**
  2. **Devoting time to connecting with the world around you**



Essentially, doing nothing refers not to _inaction_ , but rather to devoting time and attention to things you care about that are hard for capitalism and the attention economy to monetize. Odell argues that **doing nothing is an effective method of resistance because it actively refutes the _mindset_ of the attention economy**, instead of just trying to get away from the circumstances it creates. It also helps address both main consequences of the attention economy: reduced context and social atomization.

To illustrate how “doing nothing” can be a form of resistance, Odell references “Old Survivor,” the last old-growth coastal redwood tree in the Oakland, California area. In the 19th century, the timber industry—a capitalist institution—was cutting down all of the old, massive historic redwood trees in the area for lumber. However, Old Survivor was too small, inaccessible, and gnarled to be worth cutting down, so it was ignored and therefore lived on. In a sense, it resisted simply by doing nothing, and it lived on while all the trees that were “useful” to capitalist society died.

(Shortform note: Just as Old Survivor lived on because it wasn't "useful," oppressed peoples throughout history have also resisted by refusing to be productive. In situations where large, organized rebellion proves difficult, oppressed people have commonly resorted to subtler, more personal forms of resistance. This can include sabotage, lies, petty theft, and foot-dragging or refusing to work productively. Odell isn’t talking about living under oppression, but the fact that it’s a tactic used under those conditions suggests just how potent a form of resistance it can be.)

> **Quiet Quitting and Doing Nothing**
> 
> While “doing nothing” might seem like it refers to how you use and think about your free time, some people apply a similar mindset during their working hours. In particular, the phenomenon of _quiet quitting_ , or no longer going above and beyond at work, has gained traction in the past few years. Quiet quitting applies the tenets of doing nothing to work hours—quiet quitters reclaim their time and attention by no longer putting in extra work, and quiet quitting encourages people to connect with the world around them by defining themselves in ways separate from their careers.
> 
> Reactions to this concept have been varied, with some viewing it as a consequence of a younger, less motivated generation while others argue it derives from a lack of economic opportunity. Regardless, quiet quitting shows that for some, doing nothing goes beyond free time and into the workday.

##### 1) Resisting in the Right Way Adds Context and Depth

**Doing nothing gives you a new appreciation for context and depth in your life,** according to Odell. Under the attention economy mindset, activities that involve context and depth are “non-productive” because they lack monetary value. But by doing nothing, you’ll stop thinking of context and depth in this way and instead will appreciate how they can connect you to the world. This can apply on a personal level, with you finding more meaning in life through deeper engagement with the things you care about. It can also apply on a broader social level, with people taking the time to refine and contextualize the ideals of their social cause instead of relying on general outrage and discontent.

For example, imagine you’re visiting a beautiful natural landscape. Under the attention economy, you might be tempted to take pictures, post them on social media, and then move on—using your time efficiently to get attention. But if you do nothing instead and just sit and watch, you can gain a far more profound appreciation of the natural beauty: You’ll notice details you otherwise would have missed and see how different parts of the landscape, like animals, plants, and natural features, interact. “Doing nothing” therefore gives you a deeper understanding of the scene and contextualizes it within a broader ecosystem.

(Shortform note: In some cases, “adding” context and depth back in isn’t as simple as it sounds. Sometimes, they’re lost forever. For an example of how this occurs, we can look to modern agriculture and food production. Modern-day techniques maximizing productivity and efficiency have led to a major loss in biodiversity, as many farmers have stuck to only a few high-yield species of crops or livestock while allowing many others to go extinct. It’s also caused the loss of local food cultures and knowledge, as traditional recipes and farming techniques are abandoned in favor of efficiency. This makes connecting with our physical and cultural environment even more important, as it allows us to preserve context and depth before it's too late.)

##### 2) Resisting in the Right Way Prevents Social Atomization

Odell argues that doing nothing also helps prevent atomization. **Once you escape the attention economy mindset, you’ll stop viewing others in terms of monetary value** and will instead start viewing them as members of your community. With that perspective, you can connect with the world around you by forming genuine social bonds. This not only helps address personal loneliness and emptiness but also helps people band together to organize around social issues.

(Shortform note: Contrary to Odell, some scholars argue that the changing nature of leisure is one of the main culprits of social atomization—if this is true, “doing nothing” and avoiding the urge to be productive may not prevent atomization. In _Bowling Alone_ , Robert D. Putnam argues that community in America has declined in part because of _individualized leisure_. Technological advancements mean that instead of using leisure time to connect with others and participate in group activities, more Americans stay home and use their television or computer. Therefore, preventing social atomization might require more than changing how you think about work and productivity—it might also require changing how you think about leisure.)

### Part 3: How to Do Nothing

After explaining why doing nothing is the best way to resist the attention economy, Odell elaborates on _how_ to do nothing. In Part 3, we’ll explore the two elements of Odell’s method:

  1. **Changing how you use your attention**
  2. **Changing how you use your time**



#### Change How You Use Your Attention

Doing nothing requires changing how you use attention, explains Odell. In particular, she emphasizes the importance of self-awareness—that is, **noticing where you place your attention.** Odell argues that you can take back control through self-awareness—by being aware of attention manipulation and value-based thinking.

(Shortform note: Being in the moment and noticing where you place your attention not only resists the attention economy but also can help in managing depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. This mental state is also known as mindfulness, and in the past few years, it has grown increasingly popular among therapists and psychologists as a therapeutic technique. Studies show mindfulness therapy and strategies like breathing exercises or meditation are effective methods of treating anxiety, depression, and stress—suggesting opting out of the attention economy mindset and focusing on the world around you can do the same.)

##### 1) Be Aware of Attention Manipulation

Odell explains that in the attention economy, people attempt to manipulate your attention through a number of different tricks—clickbait, addictive social media apps, flashy advertisements, and so on. Therefore, **taking back control of your attention requires you to be aware of when your attention is being manipulated.** Once you understand how people are trying to grab your attention, you can be more intentional in giving your attention to what you _really_ care about, instead of to whatever is manipulating you.

For example, you might see a headline making a bold claim you strongly disagree with. Instead of getting angry, clicking on it, and giving the author attention, you could recognize that whoever wrote the headline is _trying_ to make you angry and choose to ignore it instead.

(Shortform note: To take control of your attention, it can help to understand in detail how others are trying to manipulate it. In _Contagious_ , Jonah Berger explains that for an idea to attract a large audience, it must be connected to an effective trigger—in other words, it must be associated with a specific concept or stimulus, an association that people usually achieve through marketing. For example, Corona’s advertising associates the beer with beaches, causing people to think about the product when they think about beaches or sand. By paying attention to how triggers make you associate regular, everyday things with products or ideas, you can actively resist attempts to manipulate your attention.)

##### 2) Awareness of Value-Based Thinking

According to Odell, the attention economy mindset also **creates strong thought patterns relating time and attention to value**. For example, you might get frustrated with yourself when you feel like you’re not being productive, dismiss a task or activity because you see it as lacking practical value, or feel anxious whenever you aren’t working. She suggests you notice when you’re having these thoughts and directly challenge them, recognizing that they’re part of the harmful attention economy mindset.

For example, you might enjoy painting for yourself but worry you’re wasting time if you don’t get value out of it, either by building a following on social media or by selling your paintings. Instead, recognize this worry comes from the attention economy and that if you do monetize painting, you’ll likely enjoy it less.

(Shortform note: To help challenge value-based thinking, you can set goals for yourself based on what will bring you joy or satisfaction. This not only distracts you from the attention economy mindset but also gives you an incentive to do nothing. For example, in _Keep Going_ , Austin Kleon suggests making art for the people you love and care about instead of making it for money or acclaim on social media. Making art as a gift not only avoids the attention economy mindset but also gives you the satisfaction of bringing someone else joy.)

#### Change How You Use Your Time

In addition to changing how you use your attention, Odell suggests changing how you use your time. Specifically, she argues you should **devote time to familiarizing yourself with and connecting to the world around you.** Odell offers three ways you can put your time to good use by connecting with the world around you: exploring your environment, learning about local history, and getting to know your neighbors.

(Shortform note: In addition to changing how you use time, you can also have a positive impact on your life by changing how you _think_ about time. In _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ , Dale Carnegie explains that devoting your focus and energy to the present moment will reduce your anxiety. This is because when you think too much about past or future worries, you’re adding those stresses to the stresses of the present—the burden of which can strain your mind and cloud your thinking.)

##### Explore Your Environment

First, Odell advises you to **do nothing by taking time to explore the natural environment.** This adds depth and context to your life in two ways:

  * When you learn about your natural environment, you see it in a deeper way—instead of just seeing “a bird” or “a plant,” you’ll recognize specific species and what makes them unique, interesting, and worth preserving.
  * Learning about your natural environment also helps you see yourself as part of a larger _bioregion_ or ecological area, instead of as an individual disconnected from the natural world.



Exploring your environment could mean walking around in nature, but it doesn’t have to—even if you live in a city, you can still take time to discover what kinds of flora and fauna live around you and are native to the area.

(Shortform note: Odell argues on behalf of bioregionalism, or the belief that politics, society, and the economy should be defined by bioregions, or areas defined geographically and ecologically. Bioregionalists argue that if societies are organized around local bioregions, people will no longer be able to ignore the consequences of unsustainable exploitation—the signs will be all around. Examples of bioregional institutions might include a cuisine based on what grows and lives in the area, an economy based around sustainably harvesting natural resources from the region, and laws designed to protect the unique circumstances of the region’s ecosystem.)

##### Learn Local History

**You can connect with the world around you by learning the history of your city, town, or neighborhood,** Odell says. As with exploring the natural world, learning local history allows you to gain a new appreciation for where you live and what makes it unique and worth preserving. It also contextualizes _you_ as a part of that history, causing you to think about how you impact your community and how you can contribute to or connect with it.

> **Resources for Learning Local History**
> 
> Odell doesn’t explore in depth how to learn about your local history. Here are some resources you can use to begin your research:
> 
>   * Search for local historic sites, memorials, and museums, as these locations often provide insight into past events. The National Register of Historic Places can help with this.
> 
>   * Find local historical societies or preservation societies—they have useful information and experts who can help you in your search.
> 
>   * Check out archives of newspaper articles, legal records, or historic maps. These archives can often be found online or at your local library.
> 
> 


##### Get to Know Your Neighbors

Finally, **Odell recommends taking time to get to know your neighbors.** This allows you to become a part of a local community, even one as small as your apartment building or block, which in turn helps prevent atomization. As well as making you less lonely, knowing your neighbors makes it easier for you to organize around important issues and support one another. This could mean something as simple as knowing someone who’ll lend you a cup of sugar or as complex as having a group of tenants who can collectively pressure their landlord to make a much-needed repair.

> **Advice on Getting to Know Your Neighbors**
> 
> Since we’re often so disconnected from our neighbors, it can be difficult to know _how_ to integrate yourself into your community. Here’s some practical advice for getting started on this process:
> 
>   * Volunteer for a cause you care about, showing up in person rather than just sending a check.
> 
>   * Join local community interest groups like a tenants’ union, homeowners’ association, or committee on a local issue.
> 
>   * Participate in groups based on your interests—a local sports league, community theater, or art class, for example. Your local recreation department or public library can be a good place to start this search.
