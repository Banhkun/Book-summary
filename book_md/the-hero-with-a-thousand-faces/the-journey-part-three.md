## The Journey, Part Three: Return

**After the completion of the quest, the hero must return home with their bounty** , be it Jason’s Golden Fleece, or the Little Briar Rose of German legend. The final piece of the monomyth now requires the hero to share this wisdom, this hard-won prize back to the real world, where it will benefit the hero’s community, and, possibly, the universe.

### Refusing the Return

But sometimes, mythology records a hero unwilling to return to the world. Just as they may have refused the initial call to adventure, so **they may refuse their duty to return home and bestow their newfound wisdom upon the rest of humanity**. Even the Buddha, after his victory at the Tree of Enlightenment, doubted if it was even possible to bring the joy of true enlightenment to other mortals. It is tempting for the hero to simply turn away from the world and reside forever in Paradise.

#### King Muchukunda

In an ancient Hindu legend, King Muchukunda is granted his wish for eternal sleep after helping the gods defeat an army of demons (his Ultimate Boon). He further requests that anyone who attempts to rouse him be burned to a crisp when he lays eyes upon them. He sleeps through the ages as empires and civilizations rise and fall.

After a great period of time, a youth named Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu, Lord of the World) comes to power. In the course of a battle, Krishna is pursued by an enemy barbarian king into the cave where Muchukunda is enjoying eternal sleep. As Muchukunda awakens, the barbarian is burned alive, as is Krishna. Muchukunda laments what he has done and curses the folly of his worldly pursuits. As he emerges from his cave, he sees that men have become smaller and crueler. **Despairing, he retreats back into his cave to live a life of asceticism and self-denial.**

### The Pursuit

If the hero has won the Ultimate Boon through trickery or manipulation of the gods,**their return home may be marked by a chase as the gods seek to regain the elixir that has been stolen from them**.

In a tale from Siberia, the original shaman, Morgon-Kara, is said to have possessed the power to bring souls back from the dead. The High God decides to challenge Morgon-Kara by getting hold of the soul of a man, putting it in a bottle, and hiding the opening of the bottle with his thumb. The man becomes sick and his family seeks out Morgon-Kara to help heal him. After searching high and low for the missing soul, Morgon-Kara sees that the High God of Heaven is holding the man’s soul hostage in the bottle. Morgon-Kara then transforms into a wasp and stings the High God, causing the latter to jerk and move his thumb from the bottle’s opening, thereby freeing the captive soul. Angry at this ruse, the High God splits the shaman’s drum, limiting his power forever.

**Sometimes, the hero will use decoys to delay or confuse the pursuer.** In a legend of the Maori people of New Zealand, a fisherman’s wife swallows the couple’s two sons. He uses magic to force her to vomit the boys out, then uses other spells to further hamper his ogre/wife. When she goes to fetch water, he causes the water to retreat away from her. When she calls out for the man and his sons in pursuit of them, he causes the trees and huts of the village to speak back to her, causing great bewilderment on her part. This distraction enables the man and his sons to escape in a canoe.

### Outside Intervention

Sometimes, the hero will require aid from a third party in order to return home from the realm of the supernatural. **The hero, indeed, may need to be rescued himself.**

The Eskimos tell the story of Raven, who ventured into the belly of a whale with fire-sticks, where he meets a beautiful girl. This girl is, in fact, the soul of the whale. Raven also notices a strange tube running along the backbone of the whale, dripping oil. The oil is delicious, and because he’s impatient for more, he rips off a piece of the tube, killing the whale and causing oil to pour into the belly. The girl never returns—he has extinguished the whale’s soul. The whale washes ashore, where the villagers carve up pieces of it to take home as food and fuel, freeing Raven from his captivity inside the beast. Raven uses his fire-sticks to force his way out of the whale (a symbol of rebirth). The villagers look at him curiously. When they find the fire-sticks he has left behind, Raven tells them that fire-sticks found inside a whale are a deadly omen. The villagers flee, leaving Raven to enjoy all the whale-meat for himself.

In a legend from Japan, the sun goddess Amaterasu retreats into a cave in fear, depriving the world of light. Her fellow gods devise a plan to entice her to come out. They cause roosters to crow, bonfires to be lit, and liturgies to be recited, making Amaterasu think that her retreat into the cave has had no ill effect and that the world is carrying on merrily as before. As she emerges, the gods hold a mirror up to her (symbolic of the world, which is reflected in her light) and tie a rope behind her around the entrance to the cave, telling her that she can retreat into the cave no further than the line of the rope. **This is the origin of sunrise and sunset, the daily retreat and emergence of the sun goddess.**

#### The Escape of Inanna

If you recall, the Sumerian goddess Inanna descended into the underworld, guarded by her sister/double Ereshkigal. When she goes down, she leaves instructions for her messenger Ninshubur to rescue her if she fails to return. When we left her, she was left to face the seven judges of the underworld, as she stood naked before them. The judges turn Inanna into a snake and then fasten her to a stake, where they leave her for three days and three nights.

Alarmed, Ninshubur puts Inanna’s rescue plan into action. He goes to the god Enki, who creates two sexless creatures who bring the food of life and the water of life to sprinkle over Inanna’s corpse. This causes Inanna to rise up and ascend from the underworld, with an army of demons at her side, with whom she wanders through the streets of all the cities of Sumer.

### Return

Now, at last, the hero returns to the ordinary world with their divine boon in hand. **The hero’s journey has been an exercise in uniting the world of the unknown with the world of the known** —for the two are mirror images, opposite sides of the same coin. The challenge now is to communicate to the ordinary world the wisdom and enlightenment that the hero has learned in their quest to the land of the gods.

One of the hardest things for the hero to accept is **the reality of the sorrows and banalities of ordinary human existence**. The North American legend of Rip Van Winkle presents an interesting case of the challenges of the returning hero.

Rip Van Winkle falls asleep one night (his own version of the journey to the world of darkness and the realm of the subconscious). When he awakens, he realizes that he has been asleep not for one evening, but instead, for _decades_. His handy musket which he fell asleep next to has rusted into uselessness; he has grown old and stiff in the joints; he has grown a foot-long beard; and when he approaches his hometown, he recognizes the place, but sees that it is populated by strangers. The townspeople marvel at the spectacle of Rip, with the mayor demanding to know if he is a Federal or a Democrat (it happens to be an election day in the town)—Rip, of course, fell asleep during the days of British colonialism and doesn’t even understand the question, professing instead his loyalty to the British crown. The people pronounce him to be a Tory spy and usher him into the stockades.

Or consider the plight of the Irish hero Oisin on his return journey from his 300-year sojourn with the daughter of the King of the Land of Youth, whom he had rescued from a spell which had transformed her head into that of a pig. He marries her and they dwell in bliss for centuries in the land of Tir na n-Og. Oisin yearns to return to Ireland, but his wife warns him that if he leaves to return to his homeland, he will never return to her and will lose his gift of timelessness, instead becoming a blind old man. Nevertheless, she gives him a steed to carry him on his journey home. When he returns, he shows off his otherworldly powers by lifting an unliftable stone and attempting to blow on the legendary horn of the Fenians (mythological giants in ancient Irish lore). But as he reaches for the horn, his powers suddenly diminish. He loses his legendary protective steed, slips, and becomes a blind old man, as his wife forewarned.

**The dangers that face the hero or mythological figure who returns to the secular world are reflected in rites and traditions throughout human history**. The Aztec god-king Moctezuma never set foot on the ground, but was instead always carried on the shoulders of his retinue. The divine being can never be sullied by contact with the filthy and un-sacred surfaces of earthly existence, lest they lose their spark of divinity.

### Dual Kingship

**The true hero is one who can move seamlessly between the two worlds, without destroying or compromising either**. We see this in the Transfiguration of Christ from the New Testament, in which the body of Jesus becomes radiant with the glory and grace of God.

Jesus brings Peter, James, and John to a mountain. He becomes radiant before them and converses with the Old Testament figures of Moses and Elias. God then declares from on high that Jesus is His beloved Son, striking fear into the three men whom Jesus had brought. But Jesus touches them and tells them not to be afraid. Suddenly, Jesus has transformed back again into a man. He has crossed and re-crossed the divine threshold, he is the master of both worlds. Jesus tells the men not to share the vision they have seen with anyone, “until the Son of man be risen again from the dead."

Notably, this vision has only appeared to those who have forsaken worldly pursuits and secular desires. **The individual must embrace their own self-annihilation**. These figures of ascetic self-denial are represented across the world’s religious traditions, from the wandering mendicants of the East, to the Wandering Jew and itinerant monks of medieval Europe. The manifestations vary, but the concept is universal.

### Mythology Today

Thus far, we have walked through all of the phases of the monomyth, exploring the mythological template using examples from cultures all over the world and throughout recorded history. For indeed, **the variations of the monomyth are endless**. Some stories emphasize specific parts of it more than others, sometimes certain elements and motifs are left out entirely, and sometimes the steps happen in a different order than it has been presented in this summary.

Beyond the variation of mythological traditions between cultures,**the individual myths _themselves_ transform over time**. Regrettably, some of these changes end up removing much of the great aura of mystery from these early myths. With the coming of secularization and rationalization, supernatural elements are often played down or meant to be interpreted simply as allegory or instructive fable: the gods are no longer a living, breathing part of the human experience. In Hellenistic Greece and Imperial Rome (centuries after the mythological, heroic age of _The Iliad_ and _The Odyssey_), the ancient gods were treated as mere literary characters, with the saga of Mount Olympus reduced to a comic supernatural romance.

Similarly, the overwhelming influence of the Confucian tradition, with its humanistic and moralizing tendencies and its emphasis on social hierarchies and filial piety, has little use for the old mythologies of ancient China. Today, these myths (to the extent that they are shared at all) only serve to buttress the Confucian worldview—becoming anecdotes about provincial officials who are elevated to the status of local deities by a grateful population.

Even the figure of Jesus Christ has come in for this treatment in the western tradition. No longer the World Redeemer, he is seen by many as nothing more than a historical figure who preached a simple, kindly doctrine of peace and goodwill toward one’s neighbors.

It is easy for this to happen to myths in modern, science-driven society, because **it is easy to prove that the myths aren’t literally “true**.**”** As history, biography, and science, mythology is obviously nonsense. But to make this observation is to miss the point about what myths are and what purpose they serve for the human experience. **They are about the endless journey of the soul, the adventure into the furthest recesses of the self.**
