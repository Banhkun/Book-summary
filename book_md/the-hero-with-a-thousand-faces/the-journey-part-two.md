## The Journey, Part Two: Initiation

Now we move into the main action of the myth, wherein **the hero undergoes a series of trials and tests,** with the aid of their supernatural helper. The hero might also discover the existence of a benevolent, omnipotent power guiding all things in the universe.

#### Connection with Our Subconscious

Removed from the confines of their safe and familiar world, the mythological hero now confronts a land of symbolic and allegorical figures—according to the psychoanalysts, the same imagery we see in our dreams. Just as the images are instrumental in helping the hero achieve their transformation, they are also **puzzles that each of us must unlock in order to understand what our subconscious is trying to tell us.**

Unlike the ancients, we do not have the benefit of allegory and mythology to help us make sense of the bubbling up of our subconscious. As a secular, rational society, we increasingly lack the language to process this—psychoanalysis may be the closest thing, but it’s not a substitute for the power of mythology and religion. Indeed, **we have rationalized and argued our gods away**. It is only through studying these ancient soothsayers and shamans and the dead gods they once worshipped that we can truly grasp our fullest humanity.

### Descent into the Underworld

In mythology,**the hero’s journey often requires entering the underworld or the land of the dead**.

#### Psyche and Her Tasks

In the ancient Roman novel _Metamorphoses_ , Psyche pleads with the goddess Venus to release her lover Cupid (the goddess’ son) so that the two can be married. Venus beats Psyche and orders her to conduct a series of tasks:

  * First, she orders Psyche sort an enormous quantity of foodstuffs before night. Thankfully, an army of ants helps Psyche accomplish her task (supernatural aid). 
  * Next, Psyche must collect golden wool from a flock of wild sheep whose bites carry deadly venom. Fortunately, a green reed shows her how to obtain the wool without being poisoned. 
  * Next, Psyche must retrieve water from a spring at the top of a high mountain guarded by dragons. Once again, she’s aided by an eagle who helps her fetch the water. 



In her final and most fearsome task, Psyche is told to descend into the underworld and bring back a box full of supernatural beauty. Her last supernatural helper, a high tower, instructs her how to safely go down into the underworld and gives her charms and amulets to ward off the demons and hell-hounds she will encounter there. In doing so, **she earns the elixir of mortality, which will enable her to live with Cupid forever in Paradise.**

#### Inanna

The oldest story of descent into the world of death comes from the world’s first civilization—the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia, in what is now Iraq. The goddess Inanna goes down to the underworld, guarded by her sister (and enemy) Ereshkigal. At each of the seven gates of this hell, Inanna is ordered by the gatekeeper to remove a part of her clothing—in due course, she removes her crown, rod, necklace, stones, breastplate, ring, and garments, finally presenting herself naked before the judges of the underworld.

The dual image of the two sisters, Inanna and Ereshkigal, is important. Indeed, duality is a common theme in mythology. **The hero often finds the monster to be an aspect of themselves**. This is because **all journeys are ultimately about identifying and conquering a new aspect of the self**. As we’ve seen, this is often done through the act of swallowing or being swallowed.

### Union with the Goddess

The ultimate adventure often comes through the marriage of the hero to the goddess. **The goddess is the epitome of beauty and represents the feminine ideal in all its aspects** —mother, sister, mistress, and bride. She is the ultimate hope for the hero, assuring him that he will be returned to the blissful world he knew before the journey. This is the classic maternal goddess figure, the “good” mother.

But there is also a dark twist on this theme. For **there is a “bad” mother figure, a goddess who attempts to either harm the hero, spurn his advances, hamper him in his quest, or tempt him into desire**.

Needless to say, these figures are deeply rooted in psychological complexes as we grapple with **balancing 1) our need for the love and protection of our parents (especially our mothers) 2) with our concurrent need to grow up and become independent adults**.

Sometimes, the goddess assumes both forms—either a decrepit hag who transforms into a beautiful maiden, or vice versa. Only the truly perceptive hero can fully discover the mysterious nature of womankind. The hero who can show her the right type of kindness is the one truly worthy of being king or even reincarnated God.

#### Niall

In an ancient legend of Ireland, five brother princes separately come across an ugly old woman at the bottom of a well. Looking for water to drink, each brother, in turn, asks her if they can drink from her well. She says they may, but only on the condition that they give her a kiss. The first four refuse, remarking that they would rather die of thirst than put their lips to her hideous countenance.

The fifth brother, Niall, consents to the woman’s request and kisses her. After he does so, she transforms into the most beautiful woman in the world. She reveals herself to be the living embodiment of Royal Rule and tells Niall that he has earned the right to his father’s kingdom. **He has shown himself willing to embrace the ugly and the beautiful, as a good and noble king should.**

### Facing the Father

In keeping with the Oedipal themes that run so strongly throughout so much mythology, the figure of the father-god is often a fearsome ogre whom the hero must either overcome or reconcile with. **This echoes the psychological rivalry and subconscious hatred that Freudian psychoanalysts believe so many children (particularly young men) feel toward their fathers.** The father is the archetypal enemy, because he is the original intruder who enters the infant’s life after the serenity and union with the mother (goddess) in utero. In Freudian terms, one cannot live a peaceful and productive emotional life as an adult without resolving these deep-rooted childhood conflicts.

We see the fearsome father figure in the Puritan tradition of early New England. These religious pilgrims to the New World believed in a vengeful, harsh version of the Christian God, who would not hesitate to inflict terrible torments on the unbelieving sinner. Yet they also believed in a vision of God as the redeemer, the figure through whose mercy one could be saved from the fate of eternal damnation and suffering.

**The father represents the passage away from the comforting world of the nursery and into the world of adult responsibilities and manhood** (he also represents the future husband for the female hero). The father must shepherd this stage of growth. This transformation is illustrated quite graphically in Australian tribal rites of circumcision performed by men on adolescent boys in ceremonies that are meant to mark their passage into manhood (in this case, the literal “liberation” of the penis from the “protection” of the foreskin). Alternatively, there can also be a ceremony in which the young male initiate consumes the flesh or blood of the elder male tribesmen, in order to imbibe their essence. Such rituals are practiced among the Yolngu indigenous people of Australia, but also have echoes in western mythology—perhaps most famously in the Christian rite of communion and the eating of the flesh and blood of Jesus.

#### Twin Warriors of the Navajo

Often, it is a protective, nurturing mother-goddess figure who shields the hero from the wrath of the father and provides them with the charms or amulets they need to face the father.

We can see this theme if we return to the Navajo myth of Spider Woman and the Twin Warriors of the Navajo. Recall that these two young men set out to seek their father, the Sun. The supernatural Spider Woman gives them amulets and charms that she promises will subdue their enemies’ anger. In their journey, the twins survive encounters with crushing rocks and boiling sands until they reach the house of the Sun. They use Spider Woman’s spells to get past the fearsome dogs, serpents, winds, and lighting that guard the entrance.

When the Sun emerges, he seizes the twins and hurls them at spikes at the north, south, east, and west corners of his house. But the boys come bouncing right back, thanks to Spider Woman’s protection. He then shuts them up in an overheated sweatlodge, but still the twins survive, with help from the winds. As his last test, the Sun forces the twins to smoke a poison pipe—but a caterpillar gives them something to put in their mouths to block the smoke, enabling the brothers to pass the pipe back and forth harmlessly. At last the Sun relents, and admits that, indeed, he is their father. The Twin Heroes have won his confidence and respect.

#### Phaethon

**But the father must make sure that the son is truly worthy**. In one famous Greek tale, Phaethon pleads with his father—the god Phoebus, driver of the solar chariot—to be able to take the reins and drive the chariot himself. Although initially reluctant, warning his impetuous son of the catastrophes that can result from untrained hands riding the chariot, Phoebus ultimately yields to Phaethon’s stubbornness.

This proves to be a grave mistake. Phaethon quickly loses control of the solar chariot, scorching the skies and igniting the earth. Finally, the Almighty Father Jove hurls a thunderbolt at the chariot, killing Phaethon and causing him to crash to the earth like a falling star.

### Enlightenment

**After conquering their fears, the hero at last achieves their long-sought enlightenment**. They have shattered the bounds of consciousness and reached a divine state. Mythological and religious traditions throughout history and across the world teach us that **this power lives within us all—we achieve it through our own herohood**.

In Buddhism, there is the figure of the Bodhisattva, overflowing with sympathy and compassion for the masses of humanity who must endure the suffering of existence. On the cusp of achieving nirvana, ultimate enlightenment, he turned back—vowing instead to bring _all_ creatures to enlightenment first. As such, all of existence is infused with his presence.

**In many traditions, this figure of ultimate enlightenment assumes both male and female forms.** The Bodhisattva is represented as both masculine Avalokiteshvara and feminine Kwan Yin. The Great Original of ancient Chinese lore similarly embodied both masculine Yang and feminine Yin. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, Adam, the original man, also contains the original woman—Eve is created from his rib.

This motif symbolizes the mystery of creation and the division of the original matter into its component parts.**All things are one because they come from the same essential elements**. The male and female aspects (the essential ingredients of life) are contained in all things. This has real significance for the heroic cycle: this is the moment when the hero comes face-to-face with the awesome majesty of creation.

This moment represents the final shedding of the divisions and boundaries that mark the world he or she has left behind and the recognition that God or the universal spirit resides within the hero—in the Judeo-Christian tradition, we are all made in God’s image; in the Buddhist tradition, we are all reflexes of the image of the Bodhisattva. **The hero is freed from the impulses, desires, hostilities, and delusions of the day-to-day world** and achieves the state of being summed up by the Buddhist Eightfold Path: “Right Belief, Right Intentions, Right Speech, Right Actions, Right Livelihood, Right Endeavoring, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.”

It is worth noting that, while myth often represents this desire to bring enlightenment to the world as a supreme act of love and an example of the universal brotherhood of humankind, it has seldom played out that way in the pages of history. In actual human practice, the protection and love of God are only extended to members of the in-group, while those outside of the exalted community are persecuted. Thus, we have the historical irony of European Christian society—whose religion has at its core a doctrine of universal love—tearing itself apart through sectarian warfare and launching brutal wars of colonial expansion against the non-European world.

### Bounty

In this stage of the hero’s journey,**the hero achieves their goal and is reborn as a superior being**. This is often shown by the ease with which the hero is now able to obtain the things that they seek. In the Irish legend of the Prince of the Lonesome Island, the hero is rewarded by being able to eat from a table with food that automatically replenishes, freeing him from hunger and want—he has achieved**limitless bounty, indestructible life, the Ultimate Boon.**

This concept has its roots in infantile psychology, where even **the newborn child appears to have some vague idea of mythology and an awareness of a state of bliss** beyond the distractions of the day-to-day world. We see this when the infant reacts to being torn away from the mother’s breast, or the temper tantrum when she is deprived of the things she wants. These are actually primal urges, fantasies for bodily indestructibility, endless and instant gratification, and protection from malevolent outside forces. These unconscious, infantile fantasies remain with us and live on in the myths, fairy tales, and religious doctrines that humans have created.

Many folk traditions explore this concept of indestructibility through the motif of the spiritual double or doppelganger. **This is an external soul of the individual, another part of the self, that exists free from the injuries that the physical body endures**. Only by destroying that soul (sometimes represented as a literal object like an egg) can the individual truly be extinguished. Among some Australian aboriginal people, a young man being initiated to the tribe is taken to a cave and shown a slab of wood with carvings on it. He is informed that this object is, in fact, his body and that he should never remove it lest he experience agonizing pain.

### Grace of the Gods

The Ultimate Boon is variously represented across mythological traditions—the inexhaustible milk of Jerusalem in the Book of Isiah, the Olympian gods feasting forever on ambrosia, the Japanese gods drinking _sake_ , the Aztec deities of pre-Columbian Mexico consuming the blood of humans. **The hero seeks the grace of the gods, their energy substance, their elixir of impenetrable being.**

But the gods may also be jealous in guarding the power of this elixir from the hands of the hero. They may only be willing to release it to those who are truly worthy. And sometimes, the hero must resort to trickery to obtain this bounty.

In a Polynesian legend, the hero Maui seeks to wrest fire from the fire god Mahu-ika in order to bestow its powers to mankind (much like the Greek legend of Prometheus). Maui challenges the fire guardian to a competition of feats of strength, the first of which is tossing. Mahu-ika tosses Maui up into the air, chanting an incantation as the hero rises and falls. Maui then does the same to Mahu-ika, chanting the same incantation. But as the fire guardian is falling, Maui calls out magic words that cause Mahu-ika to break his neck upon landing. Maui cuts off the head of the fire god, enabling him to share the boon of fire with the world.

Sometimes, however, this part of the myth is twisted, and **the _hero_ instead becomes a tyrannical ogre and usurper, from whom the world must be saved all over again**. In the Zoroastrian Persian legend of Jemshid, this Emperor of the Golden Age succumbs to the temptations of the powers he has won through his struggles. He revels in his own glory, declaring himself to be the greatest sovereign that ever lived and that all domestic joy springs from him. But no sooner does he speak these words than the wrath of God descends from the heavens, forcefully reminding Jemshid that he who neglects the worship of the almighty brings only ruin and death upon himself.

### The Folly of Physical Immortality

**But the search for _physical_ immortality, instead of spiritual enlightenment, will always end in failure for the hero**, for it is to confuse the meaning of what the hero’s journey is supposed to be all about. As the Japanese proverb says, “The gods only laugh when men pray to them for wealth.”

Still, this desire for earthly glory has led humans to undertake extraordinary journeys: famously, the Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon accidentally discovered Florida in the course of pursuing the fabled Fountain of Youth. Sometimes the hero starts out seeking something tangible—weapons to slay his enemies, eternal life, material wealth—but through the struggle of the adventure wins an infinitely greater prize: self-actualization and enlightenment.

#### Gilgamesh

In the ancient Sumerian _Epic of Gilgamesh_ (the world’s oldest surviving work of literature), the legendary king Gilgamesh seeks immortality in the form of the plant “Never Grow Old.” He comes to a cave by the sea, where he meets a manifestation of the goddess Ishtar. She urges Gilgamesh to turn back from his quest for immortality and instead accept the pleasures of mortal life, to “Regard the little one who takes thy hand, let thy wife be happy against thy bosom.” But he insists and she guides him to the ferryman Ursanapi (a supernatural helper) who will convey him across the waters of death to the land where Utnapishtim lives (Utnapishtim is the sole survivor of the great flood from the Babylonian creation story and the Babylonian precursor to the better-known Biblical figure of Noah).

Utnapishtim tells Noah that the plant he seeks grows at the bottom of the sea. Gilgamesh thus ties stones to his feet and goes into the sea to descend to the ocean floor. He finds the plant and plucks it from the seabed, though it cuts and mutilates his hand. When he returns to shore, Gilgamesh rests, but the plant is stolen from him by a serpent who instead consumes it and thereby gains the power to shed its skin—thus achieving perpetual youth. Gilgamesh breaks down and weeps at his misfortune.

#### King Midas

The Greek fable of King Midas is a neat illustration of **the woe that accrues to the hero who seeks mere worldly possessions or wealth from the gods**. Midas wins from the god Bacchus the right to request anything he desires. Foolishly, Midas wishes to have everything he touches turn to gold. Bacchus grants this wish, and, sure enough, every twig, apple, and stone Midas touches becomes golden. He orders a magnificent banquet to celebrate what he believes is this glorious bounty, only to realize his folly. When he touches the meat, it becomes inedible gold, as does the wine in his chalice. When his beloved daughter comes to comfort him, she too is transformed into a lifeless golden statue.
