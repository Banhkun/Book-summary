## Exercise: Managerâ€”How Transparent Is Your Organization?

Reflect on your level of organizational transparency and how that impacts your employees.

* * *

What kind of information do you withhold from most of your staff (with the exception of top executives or pertinent employees)?

Do you think employees would be interested in or benefit from knowing any of this information? Why or why not?

What do you think the consequences would be if you made this information accessible to all employees?

How could you minimize one of these consequences?

What is one type of information that you currently withhold that you could consider sharing with your staff?
