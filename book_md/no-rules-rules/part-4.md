## Part 4: Thrive Globally | Chapter 9: Accommodate Cultural Differences

By 2011, Netflix had cultivated a culture of autonomy and accountability that was enabling the company to produce great results in the U.S. Hastings began expanding the company into other countries—first in Canada, then Latin America, Europe, and Pacific Asia. By 2016, Netflix was in more than 130 countries worldwide.

(Shortform note: Netflix is now in 190 countries, setting the stage for the company’s next phase and a new form of disruption: producing non-U.S. content. This strategy seems to be paying off. Netflix has a roster of international hits, including the wildly popular Spanish show _Money Heist_ and the record-breaking South Korean drama _Squid Game_.)

Still, Hastings knew from his past international travels that certain experiences and practices can’t be translated directly into other cultures. **He considered whether the corporate culture he’d worked so hard to develop would work outside the U.S.** , or whether it would cause confusion and misunderstanding.

He made a plan to make the international expansion as smooth as possible: He would find foreign job candidates who could adapt to the culture he had carefully cultivated at Netflix. The company would then train those new hires on the ins and outs of working within a culture of autonomy and accountability. Additionally, **while Hastings acclimated international employees to the Netflix way, he would also remain open to adapting to and learning from their cultures.**

> **How to Preserve Your Company Culture Abroad**
> 
> Aside from Hastings’s give-and-take approach to cross-cultural adaptation, companies can preserve their core philosophies by adhering to Meyer’s principles when expanding operations to other countries:
> 
>   * **Determine the pressure points.** Identify the specific aspects of the company culture and the country’s culture that are likely to cause conflict, such as decision-making processes (consensus or authoritarian?) and the approach to timelines (rigid or flexible?).
> 
>   * **Make sure everyone is heard.** Use a common language and speak slowly and clearly during meetings, then summarize what was discussed. Give every cultural group the chance to contribute by asking international participants to give their input.
> 
>   * **Preserve creativity.** It’s prudent to put formal systems in place when it comes to departments like finance and IT, but keep creative departments flexible.
> 
>   * **Have a diverse workforce in every office.** Having homogeneous staff at each office might create chasms between international offices. For example, a Singapore office with mostly young creatives might have a hard time communicating with an office in Copenhagen with mostly middle-aged finance experts. Ensuring diversity helps all employees get used to working with other cultures on a day-to-day basis.

### Compare Culture Maps

Hastings wanted to remain vigilant about finding the areas in which Netflix’s corporate culture clashed or aligned with local cultures so that he could lead his American and foreign employees in being as effective as possible.**** Hastings found a tool for this task when he read _The Culture Map_ by Erin Meyer, who co-authored this book. Meyer had created culture charts that used scales to measure norms for various behaviors, such as communication and decision-making. By comparing the charts of different cultures, **Hastings could quickly and easily see how two cultures were similar as well as different, and that insight could help him develop ways to bridge those differences.**

> **More Rules for Bridging Cultural Gaps**
> 
> Aside from her culture charts, Meyer has four important rules to guide you as you navigate cultural differences in international offices:
> 
>   * **Be patient.** You may have to learn a whole new set of leadership skills that are more relevant in another setting. Similarly, even if you orient employees toward your company culture, it may take time for them to unlearn habits that aren’t aligned with the culture.
> 
>   * **Understand how _all_ cultures within an office relate to each other. **If you’re leading a multicultural team, go beyond learning how _you_ should approach each team member and figure out how each one perceives other members.
> 
>   * **Look at the positives in every culture.** It may be frustrating to work in a place where people are conflict-averse when you’re used to candid discussions and confrontation. Learn to appreciate how and why other cultures do things the way they do.
> 
>   * **Keep adapting.** The more diverse your team, the more flexible you should be when it comes to understanding and accommodating differences.
>

### Adapt Candor Cross-Culturally

Hastings found that his employees from other cultures often struggled most with Netflix’s culture of candor. This was a cornerstone of Netflix’s culture, but **each country’s attitude toward candor and providing feedback—especially to superiors—differed greatly.**

Through their experiences in countries with indirect cultures, Netflix’s leaders learned important lessons for creating **a comfortable middle ground in which employees from indirect cultures can still adhere to the company’s culture of candor.**

(Shortform note: To better understand a culture’s approach to candor or other company practices and attitudes, consult an expert such as a local corporate anthropologist. This anthropologist can serve as a “culture translator,” helping you understand local norms and behaviors, as well as correcting any stereotypes that you might have about a culture. Another way to understand cultural nuances is to ask employees directly about their expectations and preferences.)

#### Lesson #1: Create More Opportunities for Formal Feedback

According to Hastings, Netflix leaders discovered that **employees in indirect cultures struggled to give feedback on the spot** —but if they were given guidelines and assigned to prepare feedback, they excelled as they would on any other task. Managers thus learned not to expect impromptu feedback among employees and instead tweaked their strategy, making feedback an agenda item for meetings, providing instructions and a clear structure for the feedback, and investing time and effort in relationship building to soften the sting of negative feedback.

(Shortform note: During these formal feedback sessions, you shouldn’t just be mindful about your delivery of negative feedback but also of the culture’s attitude toward _positive_ feedback. While some cultures thrive on praise and positive reinforcement, others see praise from their managers as unwelcome. In Japan, for example, praised employees may feel embarrassed and worry that the praise might cause their co-workers to view them with mistrust. In these situations, it might be better to commend the team rather than singling out an individual.)

#### Lesson #2: Learn About Other Cultures and Adapt Your Feedback Style Accordingly

The way people interpret the tone of communication is relative. A message that may sound straightforward and perfectly acceptable in an American office could be considered rude and aggressive in a Singaporean workplace—and the same message could sound indirect and fluffy to a Dutch employee.

Netflix employees must understand the company’s emphasis on candor while also keeping in mind that their colleagues from other cultures may have different attitudes toward frankness. To prevent cultural differences from impeding progress and efficiency, **Netflix employees across the globe must adapt to giving and receiving feedback that is more (or less) candid than they’re typically comfortable with.** This might mean softening your negative feedback by refraining from placing blame and by framing the critique as a suggestion.

> **How to Give and Receive Feedback in Other Cultures**
> 
> Meyer goes into more detail on general principles for cross-cultural feedback in _The Culture Map_ :
> 
>   * Explain how you normally deliver feedback in your culture.
> 
>   * Don’t try to mimic the other culture, because you risk offending the other person.
> 
>   * If you’re used to _receiving indirect negative feedback_ , learn to view direct feedback as a sign that the other person respects you enough to be honest with you.
> 
>   * If you’re used to _giving indirect negative feedback_ and find yourself in a more direct culture, be explicit about both positive and negative comments, but make sure that you keep the amount of both types of feedback balanced over time.
> 
>   * If you’re used to _giving direct feedback_ , one way to adjust to indirect cultures is by not mentioning the negative at all. Instead, praise only the positives—employees can infer what’s not being addressed directly.

### Conclusion

The key takeaways for organizations are whether and how to apply the practices that Hastings implemented at Netflix. Modern companies have two primary options for how to structure their organizations:

1) The rules-and-process approach is best for maintaining consistency and safety. **Rules and processes maintain order and safety for the group at the expense of individuals’ freedoms.**

(Shortform note: Make sure you regularly review and update your policies and procedures to comply with changes in regulations. Not doing so could put you at risk of non-compliance with updated employment law and emerging cybersecurity threats, among other issues.)

2) The autonomy-and-accountability approach is best for promoting innovation, which is essential for many companies today. **Autonomy and accountability create more flexibility for people to move and adapt quickly.**

(Shortform note: If you need evidence to show just how crucial flexibility is for a company, look no further than the Covid-19 pandemic. The companies that survived were those that were able to adapt and navigate their operations systems and employees through uncertain times.)

If your company’s success depends on being relevant and innovative rather than safe and consistent, then use the autonomy-and-accountability model for your _overall_ organization. Leading a company with this approach requires you to make space for improvisation while providing enough direction to avoid chaos.

Hastings writes that you should think of the CEO’s role as the leader of a jazz band—the musicians (employees) need freedom and flexibility, but without the right conditions, the beautiful music becomes a loud mess. By virtue of having an innovative culture, your company will constantly evolve. **Even once you’ve established a culture of autonomy and accountability, you must continue to maintain it, direct it, and tweak it where necessary** , as Hastings did. Finally, as the leader of a jazz band, you should not only expect but also welcome constant change.

> **Assess Your Adaptive Leadership Abilities**
> 
> Hastings provides a general analogy between the leader of an innovative company and a leader of a jazz band, but he doesn’t get into the specific characteristics you need to become an effective leader in a rapidly changing landscape. The type of leader Hastings alludes to here is an _adaptive leader_ , one who can foresee future needs, communicate those needs to gain support, respond promptly and appropriately to disruptions, and remain accountable and transparent.
> 
> In _The Practice of Adaptive Leadership_ , Alexander Grashow, Marty Linsky, and Ronald Heifetz outline six characteristics to consider when assessing your adaptive leadership abilities:
> 
>   * **Multiple selves** —acknowledge, accept, and be mindful that you play different parts in different contexts.
> 
>   * **Psychology** —recognize your triggers and how you respond to your surroundings.
> 
>   * **Loyalties** —assess where your loyalties lie to discover biases that may be affecting your decisions.
> 
>   * **Repertoire** —identify and develop your strategies for promoting change.
> 
>   * **Roles** —reflect on how other people perceive you, and remember that other people’s perception of you doesn’t mirror who you really are.
> 
>   * **Authority** —consider the boundaries of your authority and how much you can stretch these bounds without too much resistance to respond to changes.
