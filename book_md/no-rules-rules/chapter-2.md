## Chapter 2: Fire Good Employees to Make Room for Great Ones

The previous chapter discussed how Hastings decided to pay top dollar to attract and retain Netflix’s top talent. However, Hastings also realized that having a high concentration of talent doesn’t just mean hiring and keeping the best people—**it also means firing good employees to make room for great ones.** In this chapter, we’ll discuss how Netflix lets go of adequate employees and manages the potential pitfalls of this practice.

### Fire Any Employee You Wouldn’t Fight to Keep

To separate good employees from great ones, Hastings says that Netflix encourages managers to regularly assess their staff’s standing by asking themselves, “Would I fight to keep an employee if he said he was thinking of leaving?” (Netflix calls this the “Keeper Test.”) If a manager wouldn’t fight to keep an employee on the team, then **the manager should either talk to the employee about how he can improve or offer him a generous severance package.**

Hastings believes that each employee should remain in a position only as long as the employee is the best person for the job and the job is the best fit for the employee. Someone may be the perfect match for a job when he starts, but over time that can change, depending on the employee’s growth and the company’s needs.

(Shortform note: Leaders who take Hastings’s approach to firing—letting go of people who are no longer a good fit—should apply the same rule to _themselves._ In _Good to Great_ , Jim Collins writes that exceptional leaders have a “company-first” mentality: They prioritize the success of the organization over their personal ambition, even if it means giving up control to someone else who can better steer the company forward. Some of the signs that it’s time for you to step aside are: seeing an increase in resignations from your team, feeling uninspired and incapable of coming up with new ideas, and realizing that there’s someone who can do your job better than you do.)

### Think of the Company as a Team, Not a Family

At most companies, you have to do something wrong to get fired, but at Netflix, you can be fired because your manager has found (or thinks they _can_ find) someone better. This is why the company encourages employees to think of Netflix not as a family—as many companies promote—but as a professional sports team. Hastings asserts that families are supposed to support each other no matter what, even when some members fail to pull their weight, and **that mentality leads organizations to keep low-performing employees out of sentimentality.**

(Shortform note: Contrary to Hastings, Ray Dalio argues that treating employees like family is actually beneficial to a company. In _Principles_ , he writes that the family approach strengthens relationships, making them more special than _quid pro quo_ employment agreements. Dalio adds that this familial bond makes employees feel like they have a shared mission, so they struggle well _together_ and help each other grow. It’s worth noting that Dalio’s hedge fund Bridgewater still lets go of underperforming “family members.”)

By contrast, Hastings writes, sports teams frequently trade players if they think they can upgrade. Additionally, professional athletes are expected to perform at the highest level, understand that their performance counts more than mere effort, continuously refine their skills, and form a strong bond with their team.

In taking this approach to hiring and firing, Hastings says that Netflix tries to remove the shame of being let go. Although it’s always disappointing to be fired, employees should be proud to have been a part of the organization for the time they were there, just as sports players are when they are traded from a championship team. **When new hires start working at Netflix, they must understand this mentality** —and by taking the job, they’re choosing to sacrifice some job security to work on a winning team.

> **How to Reduce the Shame of Getting Fired**
> 
> Hastings writes that thinking of a company as a sports team instead of a family takes away some of the stigma of being let go. However, this mentality doesn’t make the experience any easier—professional athletes themselves struggle with being traded. Even though they know that being let go is part of the job, athletes still describe the experience as tough, emotional, and shocking.
> 
> It just goes to show that whether a company takes the family approach or the professional sports team approach, getting fired is never easy. To help diminish the shame for fired employees, Brené Brown recommends that you:
> 
>   * Clearly explain why they’re being let go. Be as straightforward as possible so that you don’t confuse them with ambiguity.
> 
>   * Discuss how you can make the process easier for them.
> 
>   * Stay calm and steadfast in your decision. Avoid becoming defensive, and be honest even if the employee gets emotional.

### Create a Fast Firing Process and Provide a Generous Severance Package

Many outsiders view Netflix’s policy as harsh and even unethical. For many, the prospect of losing a job suddenly—despite hard work and dedication—is daunting, and it can have financial, professional, and emotional consequences. However, Hastings has no qualms about the practice: He pays employees top-of-market salaries and makes sure that new hires understand the company’s ethos and practices around maintaining a high concentration of talent. Additionally, **exiting employees receive generous severance packages** (anywhere from four to nine months’ salary, depending on the person’s position).

> **A Fear of Firing May Indicate Poor Culture Fit**
> 
> Outsiders, and even employees, might view Netflix’s firing policy as ruthless, despite the promise of a substantial severance package: After all, receiving money doesn’t always soothe the emotional pain of being fired. The _Wall Street Journal_ , for one, published an article discussing the Netflix culture and the company’s “blunt firings.”
> 
> However, what outsiders may fail to acknowledge is that these blunt firings are nothing new to employees—Netflix leaders explicitly describe the kind of environment the company has, so anyone who joins Netflix knows exactly what they’re signing up for. Furthermore, some argue, while an employee may feel demoralized or struggle to overcome the fear of being fired, it doesn’t mean that the Netflix culture is wrong; rather, it might mean that the employee simply isn’t a good fit for the culture.)

Such large severance packages can be expensive, but Netflix can afford them because they cut other firing-related costs. In most companies, when a manager is considering firing someone, the manager creates a performance improvement plan (PIP) for the employee, giving the employee an opportunity to make improvements and protecting the company from being sued. However, Hastings argues, PIPs are expensive: The employee continues receiving pay, plus the manager and human resources spend hours documenting the progress. **Netflix’s approach cuts the time and expense of a PIP and instead puts that money into a large severance package.**

(Shortform note: PIPs are not only expensive in comparison to severance packages, as Hastings says, but they may also be ineffective because they address the wrong problem. PIPs focus on performance issues—or the _symptoms_ of the problem—rather than the _root cause_. One way to stop relying on PIPs to improve performance is to instead focus on improving communication: Be clear about job expectations from the beginning of the hiring process, then constantly remind employees about what they’re supposed to deliver.)

The company is able to eliminate the need for PIPs because the culture of candor means that every employee gets constant feedback on how to improve. (We’ll discuss this culture of candor in more detail in Part 2.) Exiting employees must also sign an agreement not to sue Netflix to receive their severance packages.

(Shortform note: It takes a special kind of employee to understand Netflix’s culture and maintain peak performance without job security—most people need a sense of safety at work. In _The Culture Code_ , Daniel Coyle writes that psychological safety is important because it strengthens ties between team members, increases employee loyalty, and helps teams stick together through difficult times.)

Hastings contends that many of Netflix’s employees feel that the benefits of working in a talent-concentrated environment are worth the lack of job security. However, as we’ll talk about next, Netflix’s leaders had to be careful that the cut-throat policy didn’t create fear.

### Prevent a Fear of Firing

The strict performance standards at Netflix can cause employees to feel that the possibility of being fired is an ever-present threat. While this fear can motivate employees to work tirelessly to keep their jobs, Hastings recognizes that people do their best work when they’re inspired by passion, not fear.

(Shortform note: Fear may be effective, but research agrees with Hastings: This negative motivator is likely to backfire. Aside from passion, other positive motivators for employees are good leaders, recognition, stability, and the chance to make a difference. Another interesting motivator is self-indulgence, which employees may get from money or fame; however, you should take care that this particular motivator doesn’t override the company’s objectives.)

To minimize anxiety among employees, Netflix uses two strategies.

#### 1) Employees Ask the Manager Directly

If an employee is unsure about her standing, Hastings writes that she should ask her manager directly whether the manager would fight to keep her if she said she was leaving. The employee can decide how to move forward based on her manager’s answer: She can rest assured that her job is safe, ask for specific feedback to improve her performance, or discuss whether she’s still the best fit for the job.

(Shortform note: Before giving your response, it’s important to consider whether your perception of your employee’s performance is fair. In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott writes that when it comes to perceived low performers, you should first reflect on whether you’ve done anything to hold the employee back—have you been clear about your expectations and given them ample feedback? Equally important is your response to high performers. Don’t just shower them with praise; make sure that they stay challenged and that you support their continued growth.)

#### 2) Managers Hold a Post-Exit Q&A Session With Remaining Employees

Whenever an employee is fired, the people on that person’s team are left wondering what happened, whether or not their former coworker saw it coming, and if they could be next. Hastings describes these post-exit Q&A sessions as an opportunity for managers to be open about what happened, which alleviates employees’ fears.

(Shortform note: It’s not a common practice to have a Q&A session with remaining employees after someone is fired. If your company doesn’t have the same level of openness that Netflix has, experts recommend at least addressing the firing by making a short statement, which should clarify the process for handling performance problems. This way, you can reassure employees that the firing happened after a fair process and that they won’t get fired out of the blue.)
