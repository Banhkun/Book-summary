## Exercise: Manager—How Do You Pay Your Employees?

Reflect on how your company determines pay, and how that impacts employee performance.

* * *

What is the pay structure at your company? (For example, are employees paid a salary, are they eligible for bonuses, and do they get raises?)

If you helped shape those policies, why did you feel they were the best choices for your organization?

In what ways do you think this pay structure _optimizes_ employees’ productivity (and creativity, if applicable)?

In what ways do you think this pay structure _detracts_ from employees’ productivity (and creativity)?

What is one aspect of Netflix’s pay structure that you’d consider adopting, and why?
