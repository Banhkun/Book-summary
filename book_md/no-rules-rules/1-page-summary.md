## 1-Page Summary

When Netflix launched in 1997, the company was essentially a mail-order version of Blockbuster, the video rental store that dominated the home entertainment industry at the time. Today, Netflix produces award-winning content, has more than 200 million subscribers across 190 countries, and is consistently listed among the best places to work. (Shortform note: Netflix had 167 million subscribers at the time of the book’s publication, but that number has since grown to over 200 million. The company experienced a boom at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, gaining more than 36 million subscribers in 2020 as a result of lockdowns around the world.)

**To achieve this level of success, Netflix had to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing industry.** The keys to Netflix’s success have been unconventional business practices:

  1. Hire and keep the best employees—at any cost.
  2. Promote candor through constant feedback at all levels.
  3. Eliminate controls, such as allotted vacation time and approval processes.



**These practices have created a company culture that focuses on empowering employees to innovate and take accountability,** rather than conditioning them to simply follow protocol. In _No Rules Rules_ , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings details his logic in cultivating the company’s culture, while co-author and business professor Erin Meyer provides context for how these unusual business practices shaped the company’s success. We’ll explore each practice in detail in this guide.

### Practice #1: Have Only Top Employees

The first critical business practice that Hastings established at Netflix was to have only top employees. This practice grew out of Hastings’s early experience at Netflix: A few years after Netflix was founded in 1997, the company was hit with the repercussions of the 2001 dot-com crash. Venture capital funds dried up and Hastings was forced to lay off a third of his 120 employees, including many who produced adequate work. Although Hastings feared that the layoffs would decimate morale, he discovered that his remaining staff buzzed with energy and produced high-quality work.

Hastings soon realized that **by eliminating less-than-stellar workers, he was left with a higher level of talent per employee.** This created a talent-concentrated environment in which top performers thrived: High-performing employees were eager to work with other talented workers they could learn from and who pushed them to produce quality work, which in turn increased individual satisfaction and morale. Seeing how a lean, high-performing workforce improved the company, Hastings vowed to hire only the best employees.

> **A Better Way to Handle Layoffs**
> 
> Hasting’s narrative of events tends to romanticize the idea of layoffs—while Netflix experienced an uptick in performance after cutting down its workforce, research suggests that layoffs are merely a short-term fix and typically lead to a 41 percent decline in job satisfaction and a 20 percent decline in job performance. A reduced staff also means a heavier workload for remaining employees, which then leads to higher rates of burnout and turnover.
> 
> Instead of laying off workers during a crisis, some suggest finding ways to cut costs in the short term, such as asking employees to go on unpaid leave for a few weeks. If layoffs are unavoidable, make them as painless as possible by giving affected employees other opportunities, whether it’s by helping them find jobs in other companies, giving them the chance to pitch business proposals and win grants, or providing them with training to gain new skills that they can use elsewhere.

#### Pay Top Dollar for Top Talent

As Hastings cultivated a high-performing workforce, he faced the threat of other companies poaching his employees. **Hastings realized he would have to pay top dollar to maintain the company’s high concentration of talent,** and he implemented three measures to get employees to stay:

**1) Pay top-of-market salaries.** Hastings knew that Netflix had to pay enough not just to attract the highest-performing employees but also to prevent them from being poached. He prioritized paying his employees more than any other company would offer them.

(Shortform note: While Hastings believes in paying top-of-market rates, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates thinks you should just pay “north of fair.” In _Principles_ , Dalio recommends paying employees just enough so that they don’t have to worry about money and can focus on their work, but not so much that they’ll become complacent—they should still be motivated to work hard and earn more.)

**2) Eliminate performance-based bonuses.** At most companies, employees earn annual bonuses if they achieve predetermined goals. However, Hastings claims, this format assumes managers can accurately predict which achievements will be most valuable to the company in the year ahead, and those metrics are constantly subject to change. Instead, Netflix rejected bonuses and put that money into larger base salaries.

(Shortform note: Hastings mentions one drawback of bonuses—that job candidates prefer _guaranteed_ money over the _possibility_ of a bonus—but this doesn’t give a complete picture of the flaws of the bonus system. Paul Marciano expands on these flaws in _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work. He explains that_ bonuses may prompt employees to slack off once they reach their goal, or they may cover up ineffective management—employees may work hard simply because they’re motivated by a reward, not by a good manager. Marciano recommends finding ways to empower and show respect to your employees so they’re motivated by _engagement_ instead of bonuses.)

**3) Give raises that reflect employees’ market value.** Unlike at other companies where an employee may get a three percent raise each year, a Netflix employee who’s performing well and whose skills are highly valuable may get a 20 percent raise one year to reflect the market demand for her skills—but the following year, Hastings says, if the market hasn’t changed, that same employee could receive no raise.

(Shortform note: Netflix’s unorthodox approach to giving raises means that employees can experience a windfall year after year. Some argue that this is unsustainable from an economic perspective. However, some experts suggest that raising wages is not an economic issue but a management issue. **Many companies choose to invest their huge earnings in share prices rather than their employees,** but initial higher wages are easier to cut back if the company falls on hard times**.** Evaluate whether your company is justifying low wages and meager raises by saying it’s a safeguard against losses. Then, start viewing employees as an investment that can help your company thrive in any economic condition.)

#### Fire Any Employee You Wouldn’t Fight to Keep

Aside from putting measures in place to attract and retain top talent, Hastings realized that **maintaining a high concentration of talent also meant firing _good_ employees to make room for _great_ ones**. At Netflix, managers regularly assess their staff’s standing by asking themselves, “Would I fight to keep an employee if he said he was thinking of leaving?” If the manager wouldn’t fight to keep the employee on the team, then they should either talk to the employee about how he can improve or offer him a generous severance package.

(Shortform note: Leaders who take Hastings’s approach to firing—letting go of people who are no longer a good fit—should apply the same rule to _themselves._ In _Good to Great_ , Jim Collins writes that exceptional leaders have a “company-first” mentality: They prioritize the success of the organization over their personal ambition, even if it means giving up control to someone who can better steer the company forward. Some of the signs that it’s time for you to step aside are: seeing an increase in resignations from your team, feeling uninspired and incapable of coming up with new ideas, and realizing that there’s someone who can do your job better than you do.)

### Practice #2: Promote Candid, Frequent Feedback

The second unconventional business practice that Hastings implemented at Netflix was to promote candid, frequent feedback at all levels. Hastings learned that he could maximize the potential of all the company’s talented employees by encouraging them to be open and vocal with everyone on the team—superiors, colleagues, and subordinates. In fact, **frequent feedback became so ingrained in Netflix’s culture that _not_ speaking up was considered an act of disloyalty, **because it inhibited the company’s improvement.

(Shortform note: Some may think that it’s best to maintain the peace and keep people comfortable by sugarcoating feedback or letting small issues slide. But like Hastings, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio believes that it’s actually a sign of care and respect to tell people what they need to improve. In _Principles_ , Dalio writes that everyone at his hedge fund Bridgewater not only has the privilege but the obligation to speak up because doing so allows people to address issues and weaknesses right away instead of letting them fester and cause bigger problems later on.)

#### Provide Guidelines for Giving and Receiving Feedback

Even if everyone in the organization agrees on the value of candor, well-intended but poorly received feedback can create counterproductive tension and resentment. To avoid this, Hastings took several steps to develop a _culture_ of candor:

**1) Let employees give the boss feedback.** Leaders set the tone for a candid environment by encouraging their staff to let them know when they’re veering in the wrong direction.

(Shortform note: As Hastings says, it’s important for managers to receive feedback. However, be mindful that in a typical company, employees normally don’t speak up because they’re afraid of offending their bosses or hurting their careers. Manage their fear by creating a psychologically safe environment. For example, consistently and authentically engage with your team by having honest conversations and giving them genuine praise.)

**2) Teach employees how to give and receive feedback.** Hastings says that when giving feedback, you should make it helpful and motivating—the goal is for the individual, team, or company to improve, not to hurt the recipient, vent, or advance your own agenda. You should also focus your feedback on how someone can improve, not on what she’s doing wrong.

(Shortform note: Helpful feedback isn’t always about points for improvement. In fact, experts recommend that you give positive feedback more frequently so that employees will be more receptive to negative feedback.)

When receiving feedback, Hastings says you should be open without getting defensive or giving excuses, then reflect on whether you should act on the feedback. (Shortform note: One way to stay open to feedback is by making sure to separate the actual feedback from the messenger. You might be tempted to discount valid feedback just because of the person who’s giving it, if you dislike that person.)

**3) Give feedback anywhere, anytime.** Don’t wait until the “right moment” to give constructive criticism—by then, the other person may not have the opportunity to _use_ your feedback to _correct_ the issue. (Shortform note: Netflix employees are even encouraged to give feedback in the middle of a meeting, if they feel the need to. However, some experts argue that it’s best to give feedback in private in two instances: first, when other team members aren’t affected; and second, when you want to coach the employee after he receives feedback from others.)

#### Formalize Feedback

No matter how much you preach the benefits of candor, some people will still avoid giving and receiving honest feedback because it’s often uncomfortable. For that reason, Hastings implemented two processes to ensure that everyone participates:

##### Process 1: Annual Written 360-Degree Reviews

Hastings created a non-hierarchical feedback system—the annual written 360. (Shortform note: A “written 360” refers to a 360-degree review, which is also called multisource feedback, multi-rater feedback, or multi-source assessment.) Each employee receives written feedback from any colleague who wants to give it—including bosses, supervisors, coworkers, and subordinates. Feedback recipients can follow up with commenters about how to improve, and these discussions are often more valuable than the initial comments.

(Shortform note: Make the most of 360s and the vital feedback they provide by following up with individuals to make sure that they understand the feedback. Then, work with them to address the feedback in three steps: First, make them aware of what they need to do to implement the feedback. Second, make sure they commit to making the necessary changes. And third, motivate them to change by setting goals for their improvement.)

##### Process 2: Live 360-Degree Reviews

Hastings saw that the _discussions_ following written feedback were effective, so he implemented _live_ 360 reviews. A manager and her team gather for several hours and go around the room as each employee takes a turn receiving feedback. Although this process can be uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing, the feedback could save _receptive_ employees from being fired in the future.

(Shortform note: Such open discussion can create a good deal of tension between those giving feedback and those receiving. While you want to manage this tension, some argue that having a little drama during a meeting is a good thing. In _Death by Meeting_ , Patrick Lencioni writes that having disagreements keeps participants engaged, so you should actively look for signs of disagreement. Pay attention to comments and people’s facial expressions, and prod further when you notice that they’re trying to avoid conflict.)

### Practice #3: Eliminate Controls

The third unconventional business practice that Hastings established at Netflix was to eliminate controls. **This meant giving employees enough relevant information that they could make big decisions on their own—** a practice that was only possible with the culture of radical transparency and candor that Hastings had established. In this section, we’ll discuss how this transparency also increased Netflix’s flexibility and efficiency.

(Shortform note: Hedge fund Bridgewater has a similar principle of extreme transparency, which Ray Dalio describes in _Principles_ : The firm records all meetings and interviews and makes these recordings available to the entire team. Additionally, each employee has a personality profile, which allows co-workers to see everyone’s strengths and weaknesses at a glance. Bridgewater also makes use of an in-house app that allows team members to rate each other in real-time. Such levels of transparency can be uncomfortable, but Dalio emphasizes the importance of putting the team’s best interest before your pride.)

#### Empower Employees by Giving Enough Information

Hastings made sensitive information, such as financial data, available to all employees. By being transparent about this information, Hastings allowed for _dispersed decision-making_. In other words, he created an organizational structure in which executives and managers lead by giving employees enough relevant information instead of exercising control over employees’ decisions.

**With access to relevant information, employees could operate more autonomously and make decisions on their own** —they could determine the risks they were willing to take and take ownership of the consequences, without having to seek approval from higher-ups.

(Shortform note: Netflix takes pride in giving its employees the power to make big decisions by providing them with enough relevant information, but some argue that this practice might just be a covert way of exercising control. They argue that managers may already know what decision they _want_ employees to make and manipulate them by giving selective information that will point them in the desired direction. This bogus empowerment can erode trust and demoralize employees who can detect that the empowerment is inauthentic.)

> **Empowerment Only Works in Some Situations**
> 
> Netflix empowers its employees to use the information they have to calculate—and make—risky decisions. Hastings found that this led to some big wins for the company. However, empowerment doesn’t work in every scenario. While delegating responsibilities to team members and asking for their input _can_ improve job performance and satisfaction, the results vary depending on the task and circumstances. In particular, research shows that:
> 
>   * Empowering employees encourages creativity, but it doesn’t improve the performance of routine tasks—in these cases, employees tend to view empowerment as an additional burden.
> 
>   * Different cultures have different degrees of receptivity to empowering leadership. Eastern cultures tend to be more open to leaders who give additional responsibilities, while Western cultures, ironically, may view empowering leaders as controlling.
> 
>   * Less experienced employees respond more positively to empowering leaders, possibly because they see additional tasks as a chance to prove themselves.
> 
> 

> 
> By understanding the type of employees you have and the kind of work they do, you can figure out how much empowerment you should give them to produce positive outcomes.

However, this system comes with a great deal of risk: Employees could make decisions that are costly and harmful to the company’s progress and reputation. For this reason, the authors stress, dispersed decision-making can only work under certain conditions:

##### Condition #1: A High Concentration of Talent

Meyer explains that if the company has developed a high concentration of talent, every employee should be deserving of the trust and freedom to make decisions without oversight or controls.

(Shortform note: Not a lot of companies have the level of talent that Netflix has, so it may not be easy to trust employees to make decisions without oversight. In _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins says that another way to develop a strong sense of trust is through indoctrination: Align new hires tightly with the corporate philosophy so that they can operate autonomously while adhering strongly to the company’s core values.)

##### Condition #2: Emphasis on Innovation Over Error Prevention

Meyer explains that in some industries and organizations (such as vehicle manufacturers), controls are necessary to ensure safety and accuracy. On the other hand, if the company’s success depends more on adapting and staying relevant in a changing market, then leading with context is an important way to promote innovation.

(Shortform note: Meyer makes a clear distinction between companies that should be led by control and those that shouldn’t: Companies that need _controls_ are those whose businesses rely heavily on safety and accuracy, while companies that need _relevant information_ are those that rely on creativity and innovation. However, some creative companies may only _appear_ as if they’re leading with relevant information, when in fact they have more abstract, self-imposed unspoken controls in place such as profits and shareholder expectations. In _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Clayton M. Christensen argues that these hidden controls reveal themselves when creative companies try to pivot but are blocked by their self-imposed controls.)

##### Condition #3: A Loosely Coupled Organizational Structure

An organization that has a dispersed decision-making system is called a loosely coupled organization. In these organizations, each department is independent enough that lower-level managers and employees can make decisions without greatly impacting other departments. As a result, employees enjoy more freedom, departments have more flexibility, and progress moves more quickly throughout the organization.

(Shortform note: One way for companies to get around a _tightly_ coupled system—one where there are layers of approvals—is to create a spin-off organization that has a different structure more suited to handling innovation. In _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Clayton M. Christensen writes that these smaller spin-off companies have more freedom to invest in new ideas in the face of disruptive innovations, unlike larger companies that typically manage their risks by taking a wait-and-see approach to big changes.)

##### Condition #4: Company-Wide Alignment

When you lead by giving relevant information, you allow your employees to find their own routes to a common destination—and your job is to ensure that everyone knows which direction to go. Meyer explains that the CEO provides information to the senior managers about the general direction and values of the company, those leaders use that information to give their teams another layer of information that homes in on their specific responsibilities, and the process continues down to the most junior employee.

(Shortform note: Creating company-wide alignment means getting rid of forces that constantly oppose each other, slowing down progress or causing a company to stagnate. Researcher Jim Collins advises sticking to your core philosophy even when introducing major changes, and making sure you correct any misalignments right away—for example, if you value teamwork, eliminate incentives that reward individual performance.)

#### Abolish Vacation and Expense Policies

With a highly motivated staff and a culture of candor and accountability, Hastings was able to give Netflix employees more autonomy to make big decisions. It also enabled Hastings to implement another unconventional measure at Netflix: He abolished the vacation policy and the travel and expense approval process.

(Shortform note: Hastings uses unconventional practices at Netflix to drive the message that great freedom comes with great responsibility, but he doesn’t explain how companies that _don’t_ have Netflix’s unusual culture can create enough accountability to make the risky move of _abolishing_ limits on vacations or expenses. To foster more accountability in your workplace, experts say you should be clear about your expectations, ensure that everyone has both the skills and the resources they need to do their jobs, set milestones to track progress, give feedback, and ensure that employees see consequences following undesirable behaviors.)

##### Eliminate the Vacation Policy

Netflix neither allots vacation time nor tracks days off, giving employees more control to create a work-life balance. This makes it easier to attract top talent and sends a message to employees that management trusts them. To prevent employees from taking _too much_ vacation, Hastings instructed managers to provide enough relevant information for employees to make good decisions—for example, this may include telling employees that they can’t take time off within two weeks of a deadline, or that no more than one team member can be out at a time.

On the other hand, to ensure that employees still took _enough_ vacation, he encouraged leadership at all levels to take big vacations, talk openly about them, and encourage employees to do the same.

(Shortform note: There are a few alternatives to the unlimited vacation policy that may encourage employees to take time off: First, you can implement a _minimum_ vacation policy, which relieves employees of the pressure of determining what’s considered an acceptable amount of vacation time. Second, you can impose mandatory time off—employees have to take one week off every four months (or any other specified time period). Third, you can reward people who go on vacation with spending money.)

##### Eliminate Travel and Expense Policies

Hastings also eliminated travel and expense approvals and instead made it Netflix’s policy for employees to “act in the company’s best interest.” For instance, it’s in the company’s best interest for an employee to stick to a modest budget for lodging, unless she’s in an unusually expensive area and must pay up to afford a hotel that allows her a decent night of sleep before a presentation. This policy empowers employees to use their judgment, but it also requires managers to provide information about what’s appropriate and inappropriate so that employees can make wise decisions.

(Shortform note: Some employees may disagree with the company’s idea of what’s appropriate and inappropriate—for example, they may think they “deserve” a pricey meal if they’re asked to work out of town on a weekend. To resolve any disagreement with your company’s policies, try using some negotiating tactics. For example, in _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss suggests the strategy of showing the other person how helping you achieve your desired solution will satisfy their own wants. In the case of the pricey meal, you can explain how the extra expense eats into the budget for the venue of the company’s summer outing.)

To let employees know that their bosses could be monitoring their actions and thus discourage overspending and abuse, Netflix managers regularly check a sampling of expenses. Hastings also says it’s important to reinforce the threat of getting caught by telling employees when someone is fired for overspending.

(Shortform note: Even though Hastings and Meyer say that you should publicize these firings to let employees know you’re paying attention, there are certain things you should do as a manager to protect the dignity of the person being fired. Research suggests that making the effort to do so has a positive effect on the employee’s reaction—if they’re made to feel shame, they might view the firing as unfair and lash out by badmouthing the company. Allow them to leave with their dignity intact by not sharing the fired employee’s name and by not making a spectacle of the firing. Give them a chance to quietly pack up their belongings when other employees aren’t around.)

### When Going Global, Accommodate Cultural Differences

By 2011, Netflix had cultivated a culture of autonomy and accountability that was enabling the company to produce great results in the U.S. The company began expanding globally and, by 2016, Netflix was in more than 130 countries worldwide.

(Shortform note: Netflix is now in 190 countries, setting the stage for the company’s next phase and a new form of disruption: producing non-U.S. content. This strategy seems to be paying off. Netflix has a roster of international hits, including the wildly popular Spanish show _Money Heist_ and the record-breaking South Korean drama _Squid Game_.)

As Netflix expanded,**Hastings considered whether the corporate culture he’d worked so hard to develop would work outside the U.S**. He made a plan to make the international expansion as smooth as possible: He would hire foreign employees who could adapt to the culture he’d cultivated, the company would then train those new hires on the ins and outs of working within Netflix’s culture, and he would be willing to adapt to and learn from the cultures of his new employees.

> **How to Preserve Your Company Culture Abroad**
> 
> Aside from Hastings’s give-and-take approach to cross-cultural adaptation, companies can preserve their core philosophies by adhering to Meyer’s principles when expanding operations to other countries:
> 
>   * **Determine the pressure points.** Identify the specific aspects of the company culture and the country’s culture that are likely to cause conflict, such as decision-making processes (consensus or authoritarian?) and the approach to timelines (rigid or flexible?).
> 
>   * **Make sure everyone is heard.** Use a common language and speak slowly and clearly during meetings, then summarize what was discussed. Give every cultural group the chance to contribute by asking international participants to give their input.
> 
>   * **Preserve creativity.** It’s prudent to put formal systems in place when it comes to departments like finance and IT, but keep creative departments flexible.
> 
>   * **Have a diverse workforce in every office.** Having homogeneous staff at each office might create chasms between international offices. For example, a Singapore office with mostly young creatives might have a hard time communicating with an office in Copenhagen with mostly middle-aged finance experts. Ensuring diversity helps all employees get used to working with other cultures on a day-to-day basis.
> 
> 


#### Adapt Candor Cross-Culturally

Hastings found that his employees from other cultures often struggled most with Netflix’s culture of candor. This was a cornerstone of Netflix’s culture, but **each country’s attitude toward candor and providing feedback—especially to superiors—differed greatly.**

(Shortform note: To better understand a culture’s approach to candor or other company practices and attitudes, consult an expert such as a local corporate anthropologist. This anthropologist can serve as a “culture translator,” helping you understand local norms and behaviors, as well as correcting any stereotypes that you might have about a culture. Another way to understand cultural nuances is to ask employees directly about their expectations and preferences.)

Through their experiences, Netflix’s leaders learned important lessons for creating a middle ground in which employees from indirect cultures can still adhere to the company’s culture of candor.

##### Lesson #1: Create More Opportunities for _Formal_ Feedback

Formal feedback is less daunting than delivering _impromptu_ feedback. Make feedback an agenda item for meetings, provide instructions and a clear structure for the feedback, and invest time and effort in relationship building to soften the sting of negative feedback.

(Shortform note: During these formal feedback sessions, you shouldn’t just be mindful about your delivery of negative feedback, but also of the culture’s attitude toward _positive_ feedback. While some cultures thrive on praise and positive reinforcement, others see praise from their managers as unwelcome or embarrassing.)

##### Lesson #2: Learn About Other Cultures and Adapt Your Feedback Style Accordingly

Keep in mind that colleagues from other cultures may have different attitudes toward frankness. Discuss and explore these cultural differences. Adapt to giving and receiving feedback that is more (or less) candid than you’re typically comfortable with. This might mean softening your negative feedback by refraining from placing blame and by framing the critique as a suggestion.

> **How to Give and Receive Feedback in Other Cultures**
> 
> Meyer outlines some general principles for cross-cultural feedback in _The Culture Map_ :
> 
>   * Explain how you normally deliver feedback in your culture.
> 
>   * Don’t try to mimic the other culture, because you risk offending the other person.
> 
>   * If you’re used to _receiving indirect negative feedback_ , learn to view direct feedback as a sign that the other person respects you enough to be honest with you.
> 
>   * If you’re used to _giving indirect negative feedback_ and find yourself in a more direct culture, be explicit about both positive and negative comments, but make sure that you keep the amount of both types of feedback balanced over time.
> 
>   * If you’re used to _giving direct feedback_ , one way to adjust to indirect cultures is by not mentioning the negative at all. Instead, praise only the positives—employees can infer what’s not being addressed directly.
