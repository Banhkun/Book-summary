## Exercise: Identify Your Selection Committee

Imagine that your current company has developed a revolutionary product and is choosing a niche that will propel you across the chasm. You’ll need a niche selection committee, which consists of the smallest group of decision-makers in your company—every person who would be able to veto the decision.

* * *

Who would you include on your selection committee, and why? (What is each member’s role, or how could they block the decision if they’re not included?)
