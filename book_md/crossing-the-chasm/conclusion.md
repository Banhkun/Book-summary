## Conclusion: Post-Chasm Strategy

In the preceding chapters, we’ve discussed Moore’s strategy for crossing the gap from the early market into the mainstream market. Just as you have to transition marketing strategies to cross the chasm, there are other changes that need to take place as your company transitions into the role of a mainstream vendor. In this chapter, we’ll discuss the changes to company financial structure, personnel, and the role of R&D that Moore identifies as necessary to survive in the mainstream market.

### Financial Structure

As Moore explains, start-up companies in the early market often run on investment capital from venture capitalists. In this environment, the company’s survival depends primarily on managing investment risk. He explains that sales in the early market are not so much a source of funding for the company, but a way of demonstrating that the product is marketable, which gives the financial backers a sense of security.

However, he points out that companies in the mainstream market must be able to sustain themselves on their own profits.

Furthermore, **he identifies two pitfalls of depending on venture capital for your company’s operating budget**. First, he warns that companies running on venture capital can develop a “welfare mentality,” losing their sense of focus and urgency.

Second, Moore points out that start-ups often use “hockey-stick forecasts” showing no revenue for a period of time, followed by exponential growth of profits. When sales start to pick up in the early market, these forecasts briefly appear to be coming true, but the growth cannot be sustained indefinitely. Thus, if you make promises to investors based on hockey-stick forecasts, you may not be able to keep them, especially when you come to the chasm.

(Shortform note: In _Pitch Anything_ , Klaff observes that most venture capitalists are well aware of the unbridled optimism that goes into generating hockey-stick forecasts, and thus put little faith in them. He advises that you can set yourself apart and increase your credibility by abstaining from unrealistic projections.)

Consequently, Moore advises companies to become self-sustaining on profits as soon as possible, preferably before they reach the chasm. He asserts that assembling the whole product is the most expensive part of a startup venture, and thus advises you to save the bulk of your investment capital for assembling the whole product during the chasm crossing.

> **Self-Actualization in the Early Market**
> 
> In _High Output Management_ , former Intel CEO Andrew Grove explains that employees are motivated by a hierarchy of needs, with the highest tier being “self-actualization,” or the sense of achieving your highest potential in life.
> 
> This perspective, combined with Moore’s warning about a corporate welfare mentality, helps to illustrate an important point about employees’ mindsets in the early market: In the early market, your employees may feel they’re achieving their highest potential simply by taking a revolutionary idea and turning it into a working product, regardless of how well it sells. Their sense of self-actualization comes from advancing the state of the art, not from building a profitable business.
> 
> This works at first, when you’re running on venture capital and doing the initial development work, but, as Moore warns, it can drive the company into a welfare cycle: **You’re more interested in developing new technology than making money, so the technology you develop isn’t focused on a profitable market sector**. Thus, you don’t bring in enough sales revenue to become self-sustaining, so you continue to run on venture capital, which allows you to continue to focus on developing new technology instead of making lower-tech refinements that would make your product more marketable.
> 
> To break this cycle, employees need to view the profitability of the business as a higher purpose than simply developing innovative technologies. As we’ll discuss more in the section on personnel, this shift in mindset is not easy for most people to make.

### Personnel

When you transition your R&D department to its new role as Moore describes, some engineers may complain that they’ve been relegated to “polishing cannonballs,” that is, making refinements that are trivial and superfluous. Because of this, according to Moore, **there’s usually significant turnover throughout the company during or immediately after crossing the chasm as employees’ roles change.**

Moore explains this by contrasting the pioneer mindset that brings success in the early market with the settler mindset that brings success in the mainstream market. Pioneers thrive on innovation, while settlers thrive on managing what’s already been invented. Settlers thrive on following the rules set by industry standards, while pioneers ignore the rules, or find them overly constricting. Moore asserts that most people have either a pioneer or a settler mindset, and very few can transition between the two easily.

> **Pioneers and Settlers on the TALC**
> 
> The psychographic categories on the TALC (technology adoption life cycle) were developed to describe the different types of customers who adopt a new technology at different stages of maturity. However, the same psychographic profiles could be applied with minimal modification to the population of technology _producers_. We could adapt the categories as follows:
> 
> **Innovators:** These are people who love technology for its own sake and develop new inventions just to see if their ideas will work.
> 
> **Early Developers:** Corresponding to the early adopters, these are producers with the vision to identify exciting applications for new technological discoveries, and the influence to drive development from initial proofs of concept to products that can actually be deployed.
> 
> **Standardizers:** Corresponding to the early majority, these are pragmatic producers whose interest lies in refining and standardizing existing technologies so they can be produced, deployed, and supported on a larger scale.
> 
> **Replicators:** Corresponding to the late majority, these are producers who have no interest in doing their own development work, but are happy to mass-produce copies of a standardized product for which there is predictable demand.
> 
> **Laggards:** On the producer side, a laggard would be a company that continued to manufacture products after they were obsolete and the demand had tapered off. This might be a rather small population, since companies practicing this would have trouble staying in business. However, niche markets for products that have been superseded in the mainstream market may sustain a few small producers almost indefinitely. For example, automobiles thoroughly supplanted horses in mainstream transportation by the mid-twentieth century, but professional horse breeders and horse traders still serve a variety of niche markets today.
> 
> As with customers on the TALC, psychographic differences between producers would lead to gaps that might impede the development of a product, and the largest gap is likely between the early developers and the standardizers.

#### Compensation

Because of the turnover that usually happens at the chasm, Moore advises that it’s better to give pioneers cash bonuses rather than equity in the company, since they are likely to move on as the company makes the transition. However, he concedes that this can be difficult, because the company is usually short on cash during the chasm crossing.

(Shortform note: Moore’s rationale here seems to be that pioneers’ role in the company is functionally temporary, almost like a contractor who provides services you need to get the company going and then moves on to another project. Opinions on paying contractors in equity are varied, but most commentators seem to agree that equity is best reserved as compensation for long-term commitment, while cash is more appropriate for short-term services. Moore’s recommendation echoes this perspective.)

### Research and Development

In the early market, your research and development (R&D) department started with an innovative idea and turned it into a revolutionary product that would appeal to early adopters.

Moore points out that **as you cross over to the mainstream market, your R &D department must refocus from developing a revolutionary core product to developing a whole-product solution** based on your core technology.

At first, this may mean developing or integrating some new features to make your product appeal to your chosen niche market. However, Moore notes that as the technology matures, your R&D focus increasingly shifts from new capabilities toward refinements that make the product easier to service and support.

> **Defining Research and Development**
> 
> When Moore discusses refocusing R&D on product refinements that enhance serviceability, some engineers might take issue with calling this new focus “R&D”.
> 
> In Chapter 1, we discussed using the TRL (technology readiness level) system to measure technological maturity. The TRL system also illustrates the different phases of engineering work that take place as a technology matures.
> 
> At TRL-1, you conduct basic research. **Basic research** is when you study principles of science or engineering to better understand them, without a specific application in mind.
> 
> At TRL-2, you identify a possible application for the scientific knowledge you’ve gained, which serves to focus your studies. At this point, you transition from basic research to **applied research.**
> 
> At TRL-3, you transition from research to development: You’ve done enough research to understand the theoretical operating principles of your design, but you need to design components that can turn your theory into reality. Thus, **product development** continues from TRL-3 up through TRL-9, where the official TRL scale ends.
> 
> As we discussed in chapter 1, you would typically reach TRL-9 in the early market. At TRL-9, initial product development is complete, and so the term “research and development” arguably does not apply to subsequent refinements that don’t add new capabilities.
> 
> Instead, after reaching TRL-9, you must either find a new technology to develop, or transition from “research and development” to “**production support engineering**.” This is the transition that Moore describes, even though he still refers to it as “R&D” afterward.
