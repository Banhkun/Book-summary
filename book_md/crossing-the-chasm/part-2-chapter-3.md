## Part 2 | Chapter 3: High-Level Strategy

In the first two chapters, we discussed Moore’s explanation of the technology adoption life cycle (TALC), and how the gaps in the TALC create a chasm between the early market (innovators and early adopters) and the mainstream market (early majority, late majority, and laggards).

In this chapter, we’ll first discuss Moore’s general strategy for succeeding in the early market. Then we’ll consider Moore’s argument for why a company must cross the chasm, after which we’ll present an overview of Moore’s strategy for crossing the chasm, which uses a metaphor based on the World War II D-Day invasion to discuss focusing on a niche market.

Moore’s strategy can be broken down into four main steps, which we’ll elaborate on in the next four chapters: choose your niche, provide a whole product, position your product, and set up distribution.

### Early Market Strategy

According to Moore, the best-case scenario for a high-tech startup to sell to the early market follows approximately this chronology:

  1. You develop a breakthrough technology with at least one compelling application. 
  2. You show it to tech-savvy innovators, who agree it is revolutionary.
  3. You connect with early adopters and help them see how your product could transform their industry. 
  4. The early adopters consult the innovators who’ve already adopted your product.
  5. The innovators back up your claims, resulting in a major project contract with an early adopter.
  6. You use the funding from the first major project to refine the product for the customer’s application and generate a few marketable spinoff products in the process.
  7. You continue selling your product to early adopters until the early market starts to saturate. 



> It’s worth noting that Moore’s best-case chronology is just that: a chronology rather than a strategy. It depicts how your business should ideally develop in the early market, but, by itself, doesn’t tell you how to achieve this ideal.
> 
> For example, how do you develop a breakthrough technology? That’s beyond the scope of _Crossing the Chasm_ , although Charles Duhigg addresses it to some extent in Smarter, Better, Faster. Similarly, how do you make sure that the innovators agree your product is revolutionary? We may infer that you do this by first making a technological breakthrough, and then marketing and positioning your product in ways that appeal to innovators as a psychographic group, but Moore doesn’t provide much specific advice on this issue. The same applies to most of the other steps in the chronology. Thus, while the best-case chronology gives you something to aim for, you may need additional resources to develop a comprehensive strategy for the early market.

#### Early Market Problems

However, Moore acknowledges that in real life things don’t always work out according to the best-case scenario. He offers solutions to a few common problems that can come up in the early market phase.

**Problem:** You don’t raise enough capital up front to fully develop your product for the entire market of early adopters.

According to Moore, the solution is to scale back your expectations and focus on a smaller set of customers with more specific needs. This reduces development and marketing costs by narrowing the scope of both technical development and marketing.

(Shortform note: If you have a compelling innovation, and just need more money to finish development or adequately market it, presumably another solution would be to ask your financial backers for additional capital, or appeal to additional investors. In _Pitch Anything_ , Oren Klaff argues that the key to persuading investors to back you is controlling their frame of mind by packaging your ideas correctly and knowing how to maintain a psychologically dominant position.)

**Problem:** You sign a contract with an early adopter before you have developed your product enough to deliver on it.

Moore says that solving this problem requires a three-pronged approach: First, you shut down marketing, since there’s no point looking for new customers when you don’t even have the resources to deliver products to the one you have. You also confess any exaggerated claims to your customer and scale back your promises as much as possible. Then, you focus all your resources on product development to meet the remaining deliverables of your contract.

(Shortform note: A contrasting school of thought argues that by over-committing, you can actually become a brand leader. While this theory might not advocate the kind of _contractual_ over-commitment that Moore deals with here, the strategy is functionally similar: First, you commit to delivering something extraordinary, then you focus all your resources on actually delivering it.)

**Problem:** You can’t articulate a compelling application for your product.

According to Moore, the solution to this problem is to reevaluate whether you have actually made a technological breakthrough.

If you have, he directs you to focus on developing and marketing one specific application.

(Shortform note: This implies that your real problem is you’re not communicating your product’s application clearly because you’re trying to promote too many possible applications at once. The “strategy canvas” developed by Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne in _Blue Ocean Strategy_ could be a useful tool for determining which application to pursue: Plot the value of your product’s features for a given application, and then plot the top few competing products on the same chart, giving you a visual of how much unique value your product or idea provides in that application. The charts would help you choose the application that provides the most unique value.)

If you haven’t actually made a true breakthrough, Moore suggests presenting your product as a supplement to some existing technology.

(Shortform note: Presumably you would only do this after first identifying a compelling way in which your product complements existing technology. Once again, the strategy canvas could be useful for identifying the unique value your product provides as a supplementary product in a given application.)

### Why You Must Cross the Chasm

Having mastered selling your product in the early market, it might be tempting to stay there, but Moore says this is not an option. He estimates that three to five significant contracts with early adopters will saturate the early market. After that, your sales will stagnate unless you start attracting early major customers.

(Shortform note: This might be a slight exaggeration, given relative category sizes. Moore asserts that innovators make up about 2% of the market and early adopters make up about 16.7% of it. Thus, if there are only about five customers in the early market, who represent about 18.7% of the total, then there are only about 27 customers in the total market. For most products, the market probably consists of more than 27 potential customers, in which case there might be more than five early adopters.)

Moore also asserts that **you make most of your profits in the mainstream market, because that’s where the majority of customers are**.

(Shortform note: To quantify this, if we assume the early and late majorities each make up a third of the total market, we might initially estimate that the mainstream market makes up about two-thirds of your total sales. However, some sources claim that in recent years, the distribution of the categories has shifted, such that the early majority now makes up a larger fraction of the population.)

#### Dangers of the Chasm

Moore advises crossing the chasm decisively as soon as you reach it, because while you’re in the chasm, your company is vulnerable to a number of dangers.

For one thing, Moore warns that **your success in the early market has made competitors aware of your product**. If they’ve lost a few early-adopter sales contracts to you, they will be looking for ways to reclaim their market share.

(Shortform note: Moore doesn’t go into detail about what this focused competition looks like, but George Stalk and Rob Lachenauer discuss this kind of “hardball” competition at length. Perhaps, given enough time, your competitors will reverse-engineer your product and copy it or even develop a new version of it that gives them a competitive advantage. Perhaps they’ll focus advertising efforts on highlighting your product’s shortcomings, relative to theirs, or use other so-called “competitive blunting” tactics to avoid losing market share to your product.)

For another thing, Moore notes that your financial backers have seen your success in the early market, and they are excited about your revenue growth. As the early market saturates and sales stagnate, they become worried that something is wrong with your company. Some may even take advantage of the situation to drive down your stock value so they can buy up a controlling interest in your company and make sweeping changes. Moore calls the latter “vulture capitalists.”

(Shortform note: The term “vulture capitalist” is widely used in business to refer to any venture capitalist who buys up companies when they hit rock bottom, implements draconian measures to turn them around, and then sells them at profit.)

> **Products That Died in the Chasm**
> 
> To further drive home the dangers of the chasm period, Moore discusses the Segway, a personal transportation device which, according to Moore, failed to break into the mainstream market because it couldn’t navigate stairs. He likewise cites Motorola’s Iridium network, a satellite phone system that never caught on with mainstream customers because it had poor signal reception indoors.
> 
> However, the technical nature of these product failures begs the question of whether they actually died in the chasm, or before they even got there. Recall that, according to Moore, one of the key distinctions between the early and mainstream markets is that early-market customers evaluate a technology based on its own technical merit, whereas mainstream-market customers evaluate it mostly based on reputation and market share.
> 
> Thus, if a product fails due to publicized technical limitations, such as the inability of a mobility device to climb stairs, or a phone’s poor reception, it seems likely that it was still in the early market at the time of its demise. If Segway failed because it couldn’t climb stairs and Iridium failed because its signal couldn’t penetrate walls, then it would appear that both these products died _before_ they reached the chasm.
> 
> **Other Perspectives on Segway’s Failure**
> 
> In the case of the Segway, others have offered a variety of explanations for its failure in the market. For one thing, there is an active market for scooters and bicycles and similar transportation devices that don’t climb stairs. However, rather than competing for a share of the scooter market, Segway presented its product as an alternative to _walking_. Arguably, it was only this marketing decision that made stairs a problem for the Segway.
> 
> So, why didn’t the Segway company just pivot its marketing strategy, and take over the scooter market?
> 
> For one thing, their product retailed for about $5,000, which was roughly 10 times more than a motorized scooter, and 100 times more than a non-motorized scooter. The price alone put it out of reach of a large percentage of scooter buyers.
> 
> The Segway also looked different from other scooters, and became a punchline for making its users look like “dorks.” This further narrowed the potential customer base.
> 
> Furthermore, the safety of the Segway was called into question, particularly after the owner of the company accidentally ran his Segway off a cliff and died in the crash.
> 
> In the end, it appears Segway was unable to identify any compelling application where none of these concerns would have been show stoppers. Thus, the Segway may actually have died in the _application gap_ , rather than the chasm: A few innovators thought it was cool, but it wasn’t practical enough to attract early adopters.

### Strategy for Crossing the Chasm

By now you know why the chasm exists, and why you shouldn’t linger there. But how do you get across? At a high level, Moore’s strategy for crossing the chasm consists of focusing your efforts on becoming the market leader in a very specific niche market, then expanding into other niches until you dominate the market.

According to Moore, the reason this works is that **it has an amplifying effect on marketing.** Recall that members of the early majority communicate closely within their own industry, but not outside of it. Moore also asserts that all marketing is ultimately dependent on word-of-mouth. Word of mouth spreads quickly through a small niche market: If just a few customers are impressed with your product, everyone will hear about it, whereas in a large market, their voices would be lost in the crowd.

(Shortform note: Regis McKenna, a pioneering marketer who made his name publicizing tech companies and their products (including Apple, America Online, and Compaq), echoes Moore’s assertion that word-of-mouth is the most effective method of marketing. His premise is that word-of-mouth is an experience that turns raw information into effective communication. The marketing message is inherently tailored to the individual, and feedback is instant, increasing its impact and reducing misunderstandings. He goes on to cite the “90-10 rule,” namely that 90% of the population’s decisions are determined mostly by the influence of the other 10%.)

Moore breaks down his strategy into four steps, which we’ll discuss in the next four chapters. In Chapter 4, we’ll examine his advice on how to choose your niche. In Chapter 5, we’ll consider the issue of providing a whole product that will appeal to the early majority. In Chapter 6, we’ll discuss Moore’s recommendations for positioning your company as the market leader. Finally, in Chapter 7, we’ll talk about tailoring distribution to your target customers.

#### Moore’s D-Day Metaphor

Moore uses D-Day of World War II as a metaphor to illustrate his strategy. In his metaphor, the early market is like England, the mainstream market is like Western Europe, and the chasm is like the English Channel. He likens your target niche market to the beaches of Normandy. Just like the Allies established a foothold on the beaches of Normandy, expanded into nearby territory, and ultimately liberated all of Europe, your goal is to first conquer your target niche, then expand into adjacent market sectors, and ultimately dominate the entire market.

Moore emphasizes the combative nature of his strategy. He says the suppliers that your product must displace are like the Axis Powers, who will perceive your attempt to take their market share as an act of aggression. Similarly, he likens the companies you partner with to the Allied Forces.

> **Combative and Non-Combative Strategies**
> 
> In _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , Kim and Mauborgne advise you to create new, uncontested markets through innovation. In this way, they argue that you can create new opportunities where there are few if any competitors, instead of meeting existing competitors combatively. Their strategy actually bears a strong resemblance to Moore’s, despite the sharp contrast between Moore’s combative perspective and their non-combative viewpoint.
> 
> As Kim and Mauborgne explain, the key to value innovation is targeting a specific market, and knowing what your target customer values. Then you create a product with a unique combination of features tailored to their values, so your product stands alone as the clear solution to your customer’s needs. In their view, this creates a “blue ocean,” or uncontested market for your product.
> 
> This sounds very much like Moore’s strategy of targeting a specific niche market. In Moore’s model, once you become the market leader in your niche, you’ll tend to remain the market leader (as long as your product doesn’t become significantly _inferior_ to the competition) because the early majority prefers to buy from the market leader.
> 
> Thus, establishing yourself as the market leader in your niche neutralizes the effects of competition to some extent. Moore views this as victory over aggressive competitors, while Kim and Mauborgne view it as a marketplace relatively free of competition.

#### Choosing a Niche for a Weld Inspection Product

As a hypothetical example to illustrate Moore’s strategy, imagine you have developed a revolutionary imaging technology for detecting defects in welds. When you reach the chasm, you decide to target inspection of welded pipe joints in nuclear submarines as your niche industry. This niche offers several advantages:

First, pipe joint failures in submarines tend to have disastrous consequences, as in the case of the USS Thresher. This gives your prospective customers a compelling reason to thoroughly inspect their pipe welds. Since your product makes it easier to assess weld quality, this also gives them a compelling reason to buy your product.

Second, the US Navy and its shipbuilding contractors are well funded. They can afford to buy your product.

Third, this industry is small and closely connected, since there are only a few shipyards in the United States that build nuclear submarines. As they start to realize the advantages of your new weld inspection probe, word will spread quickly.

Finally, once you dominate this niche, you’ll have access to adjacent market sectors. For one thing, you’ll have a foothold in the shipbuilding industry, allowing you to branch out into other weld-inspection venues at both naval and commercial shipyards.

For another thing, the stainless steel piping systems used in nuclear reactors are physically similar to the stainless steel piping systems used in food processing plants. Contractors specializing in welded stainless steel piping often provide services to both the nuclear industry and the food processing industry. Thus, inspecting pipe welds in nuclear naval vessels puts you in a position to branch out into inspecting pipe welds in food processing facilities as well.

In this way, by focusing on and dominating one small niche, you can, using Moore’s strategies, position your company to become a more mainstream provider of services to a wider swath of companies.
