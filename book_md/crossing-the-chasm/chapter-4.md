## Chapter 4: Strategy Step 1—Choose Your Niche with Customer Profiles

As we discussed in the previous chapter, the first step to crossing the chasm is to select a niche market. In this chapter, we will discuss _how_ you select an appropriate niche.

#### Intuition Versus Analysis

Moore observes that, prior to crossing the chasm, you can’t survey your early-majority customers or otherwise gather data on them, because you don’t have early-majority customers yet. This makes it difficult to commit to a decision that will determine the fate of your company, because you don’t have enough data to substantiate your choice analytically.

As Moore points out, **without enough data to make a _rational_ decision, you are compelled to make an _intuitive_ decision**. Moore observes that we’re often better at intuitively predicting the behavior of individual people better than we are at predicting the behavior of vague categories like “the electric vehicle market.” Thus, he recommends that you envision a _target customer_ by generating hypothetical customer profiles, which we will discuss in the remainder of this chapter.

(Shortform note: Moore is not the only one to advocate intuitive decision-making in situations like this. Malcolm Gladwell encourages you to harness the power of “unconscious thinking,” which is his term for the mental processes that make up intuition. He contrasts “unconscious thinking” with “conscious thinking,” or analytical decision making. By comparison, unconscious thinking is faster, less susceptible to stress, and less sensitive to available data, having both the ability to operate with less information than would be necessary for analytical thinking and also the ability to automatically “thin slice”: filter out irrelevant information.)

### Step 1: Generate “Customer Profiles”

A “customer profile” is simply a description of an archetypical customer. As we just discussed, you don’t have early-majority customers yet, so you’ll use characterizations of _hypothetical_ customers to choose your niche.

Moore advises that you make your customer archetypes as lifelike as possible so your intuition can accurately predict their behavior. **A customer profile should include characteristics like age, job title, industry, gender, race, and interests, especially as their interests relate to your product.**

(Shortform note: Jack Matsen blogs about creating customer profiles for your current customers. Matsen breaks down his profile into four categories of characteristics: demographics (race, sex, age, income, education, job title, family status), psychographics (lifestyle, goals, interests, values), behaviors (purchase history, product usage, customer loyalty), and geographics (city, state, region). While certain behavioral characteristics, like purchase history, may not be relevant at this stage of the adoption cycle, Matsen’s organization could work well for Moore’s customer profiles.)

To develop your list of customer profiles, Moore recommends soliciting anecdotes from people in your company who have experience interfacing with existing customers. Make sure to capture all known customers’ uses of your product, plus any other uses that seem plausible. Moore estimates that after you generate 20 to 50 customer profiles, it will become apparent that some of them represent the same archetype, leaving you with about 10 unique characterizations.

> **Jungian Customer Profiling**
> 
> Some sources suggest using the 12 standard “Jungian archetypes,” psychological profiles based on the work of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung as a starting or reference for developing customer profiles. In brief, the 12 Jungian archetypes are:
> 
>   * The “hero” is on a quest to prove his worth.
> 
>   * The “everyman” carefully follows the crowd.
> 
>   * The “innocent” is naive and vulnerable.
> 
>   * The “lover” values relationships above all else.
> 
>   * The “caregiver” is someone whose life revolves around helping others.
> 
>   * The “explorer” wanders through life looking for meaning.
> 
>   * The “rebel” finds meaning in challenging the accepted norm.
> 
>   * The “artist” wants to make a lasting impression on the world through creativity.
> 
>   * The “jester” just wants to have a good time.
> 
>   * The “sage” is on a quest for truth.
> 
>   * The “visionary” is someone whose life revolves around achieving great things.
> 
>   * The “ruler” is determined to maintain control of her domain.
> 
> 

> 
> Assuming that a couple of the Jungian archetypes don’t fit any realistic user of your product, that leaves about 10 unique characters, consistent with Moore’s estimate.

### Step 2: Build Purchasing Scenarios Based on Customer Profiles

**Once you have your list of hypothetical customers, you can flesh them out into purchasing scenarios**. Each scenario ultimately represents a market niche. Moore suggests formatting each scenario as three sections, all of which should fit on a single page:

**1\. The first section is basically your customer characterization** , with demographic information and so forth. Moore also notes that for some scenarios more than one person is involved in the purchase. He differentiates between the “economic buyer,” who approves funding for the purchase, the “technical buyer,” who sets up the product once it is purchased, and the end user, who uses it once it is set up. Depending on the scenario, these might all be the same person, or might be different people. If they are different people, Moore reminds you to include customer profiles for all of them.

(Shortform note: While the terms “technical buyer,” “economic buyer,” and “end user” are widely used, some sources refer to the “end user” as the “functional buyer” instead.)

**2\. The second section is a description of the scenario without your product**. In the current market, what are your prospective customers attempting to accomplish, and how are they going about it? What problems do they have with this approach that your product could solve? What are the financial consequences of these problems?

**3\. The third section is a description of the scenario with your product.** How can your customers use your product to achieve their goal? What features of your product enable them to succeed? What financial benefits will they reap as a result?

> **Sample Purchasing Scenario**
> 
> For this example, we will assume you have developed a revolutionary weld inspection device, but have not yet selected a target niche.
> 
>   * Demographics: Marvin is a male in his 40’s. He’s a small-business owner-operator who provides welding services to local farmers. He is therefore a combination of an economic buyer, a technical buyer, and an end user.
> 
>   * **Scenario without our product:** Marvin drives his welding truck to a customer’s farm, where he repairs cracks and holes in aluminum irrigation pipes by welding them closed. He does a basic visual inspection of his welds and doesn’t notice any defects. The next day, the farmer calls him again and says the pipe is still leaking, so Marvin drives back out to his customer’s farm. He finds that a couple of his welds had hairline cracks that he couldn’t see, but that caused them to fail when the irrigation pipe was pressurized. He’s able to fix the pipe, but he loses half a day on rework, and his customer loses a day of irrigation.
> 
>   * **Scenario with our product:** As before, Marvin drives out to a customer’s farm to repair irrigation pipes. After completing his welds, Marvin connects our weld inspection probe to his phone and scans them. He identifies hairline cracks in a couple of welds that might have been caused by impurities in the aluminum. He grinds out the cracks, re-welds them, and uses our weld inspection probe to verify that they’re solid. Relative to the scenario without our inspection probe, he saves half a day and the cost of making an extra trip. He also cultivates a better relationship with his customers, because he can guarantee _all_ his welds are water-tight.

> **Customer Journey Maps**
> 
> Business blogs describing how to create customer profiles and purchasing scenarios often advocate using “customer journey maps,” which chart your customer’s interactions with your company as they become acquainted with your product, decide to buy it, and finally, use it to achieve a goal. A journey map highlights every point of contact between the customer and your company, as well as the customer’s decision points along the way.
> 
> The second and third parts of Moore’s purchasing scenarios could be developed into a type of customer journey map, tracking the problem your customer needs to solve and how they use your product to solve it.
> 
> While customer journey maps are often used later on to identify pain points in the purchasing process and streamline the sales process, considering them up front as you select your niche could help you determine how easily your customer will be able to assemble the whole product.
> 
> We’ll discuss assembling the whole product in the next chapter.

### Step 3: Select the Best Scenario

After you’ve developed a series of scenarios, present them to your niche market selection committee. According to Moore, this should be the smallest group of decision-makers in your company, consisting of every person who would be able to veto the decision. Have each member of the committee individually rate each scenario against four _critical_ factors, five _preferred_ factors, and the size of the market:

#### Four Critical Factors

**1\. Compulsion Factor:** According to Moore, the most important factor is whether the financial consequences of the problem your product solves are severe enough to compel the economic buyer to make the purchase. If they aren’t, then Moore says they will probably express curiosity about your product but not actually buy it. In this case, the scenario can be eliminated.

(Shortform note: In _The Way of the Wolf_ , Jordan Belfort argues that you can sell anything to anyone, provided you can bring them to a point of complete confidence in the product, the seller, and the manufacturer. However, Moore’s observation implies that Belfort’s model is incomplete. The customer could be confident in the quality of the product, the integrity of the distributor, and the company behind the product, but they still won’t buy it if they don’t believe they need it. Thus, before you worry about creating confidence in the product or the seller, you need to create confidence in the severity of the problem that the product solves.)

**2\. Accessibility Factor:** Next, Moore questions whether the hypothetical customers, especially the economic buyer in this scenario, actually exist, and can be reached effectively through an available sales channel. If not, the scenario can be eliminated. (Shortform note: We’ll discuss distribution channels in Chapter 7, and which types of distribution work best for reaching different types of customers. In this context, we’ll also contrast the different types of customers that Moore identifies with the types of customers that Brian Tracy identifies in _The Psychology of Selling._)

**3\. Completeness Factor:** According to Moore, another critical factor is whether you can actually deliver the whole product. We’ll discuss how you deliver the whole product in more detail in the next chapter, but here Moore advises that if you can’t be ready to deliver it within three months, the scenario should be eliminated.

(Shortform note: Business bloggers often recommend keeping product launch schedules within a four-month time frame. Moore’s three-month limit on assembling the whole product implies a similar time frame for launching your whole product. While these numbers may seem arbitrary, the fact that different experts intuitively agree on similar time frames gives them more credibility.)

**4\. Competition Factor:** Finally, Moore considers whether there are already direct competitors in this niche. If so, he says that puts you at enough of a disadvantage to warrant eliminating this scenario.

(Shortform note: Moore’s fourth critical factor for scenario selection is a key tenet of _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , which advises that your product must provide _unique_ value to your customers, implying there are no current competitors providing the same value.)

#### The Five Preferred Factors

**1\. Network Factor:** Moore encourages you to consider to what extent you already have connections with other companies who would be involved in supplying the whole product in this scenario. The ability to leverage existing connections makes the scenario more attractive. (Shortform note: We’ll discuss corporate alliances that enable you to supply whole-products in more detail in the next chapter, where we’ll contrast Moore’s advice with Regis McKenna’s advice on maintaining alliances.)

**2\. Distribution Factor:** Similarly, Moore asks whether you have existing sales channels capable of reaching the customer in this scenario. He notes that it takes time for a salesperson to become fluent in the language of a new industry, so existing sales channels make the scenario more attractive.

(Shortform note: If you don’t have existing sales channels, and you or your sales force must learn the lingo of your target market, Chris Slocumb has a few tips for you. In addition to seeking out industry publications and trade groups, which you’ll be doing anyway as you study your target market, he suggests signing up for professional development courses within that industry to get some inside exposure to the language. He also stresses the importance of pronouncing industry jargon correctly to avoid damaging your credibility when you speak with potential customers.)

**3\. Pricing Factor:** Moore also directs you to consider how well the price of the whole product fits into your customer’s budget, and to what extent the price structure will motivate your partners and distributors to continue supporting the product.

(Shortform note: Moore’s third preferred factor resembles an inverted form of his first critical factor (making sure your product is compelling). If _not_ buying your product costs your customer more than _buying_ it (because it solves an expensive problem for them) then they can afford it. However, it still makes sense to examine the price structure in more detail, once you’ve narrowed your list of scenarios.)

**4\. Credibility Factor:** Moore advises that you establish a good reputation in your target niche market. He notes although it’s likely that at first, while entering the market, you’ll likely not be very credible, you can build credibility very quickly within a specific niche. (Shortform note: Because of the ease with which this problem is overcome, and because Moore devotes little space to it, we can infer that this is one of the less important factors.)

**5\. Infiltration Factor:** According to Moore, you should also evaluate the extent to which you can leverage sales in this niche to expand into other adjacent markets. (Shortform note: Given that expanding into adjacent niches is part of Moore’s high-level strategy, we can infer that this is one of the more important preferential factors.)

#### The Size Factor

According to Moore, the final factor to consider when selecting your niche is the size of the market that each scenario represents. The niche market that you choose must be large enough to provide meaningful revenue, but small enough for you to dominate.

Moore argues that to become the de facto standard, your product needs to account for more than half the total sales in the market. Thus, when you cross the chasm, he suggests **targeting a niche that is worth one to two times what your current annual sales are.** For example, if your sales last year amounted to $3 million, pick a market segment that is worth $3 to $6 million.

If the niche market your scenario represents is too large, Moore recommends focusing on a closely connected sub-segment of it, such as the market within a certain geographic region. If the market is too small, he recommends looking for a super-segment of it, or choosing a different scenario.

(Shortform note: Market size also plays an important role in managing the risk of competition. In _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Christensen explains that disruptive innovations can allow small start-ups to displace large established companies partly because the market for new technology starts out small: Large companies need large markets to maintain revenue, and thus cannot afford to bother competing in niche markets. This gives small startups an advantage when targeting niche markets. As Christensen points out, once the startup dominates the niche and begins to expand into adjacent markets, incumbent manufactures of now-outdated products are often unable to recover from the loss of market share. This effect contributes to making Moore’s strategy effective, and highlights the importance of choosing a niche that is small enough for you to dominate.)

#### Scenario Elimination

Moore advises that you call a meeting of the selection committee to discuss ratings and reach a consensus as soon as everyone has had a chance to rate the scenarios individually. He observes that typically about two-thirds of the scenarios are eliminated in this meeting. At the meeting, everyone individually re-evaluates the remaining scenarios. Repeat until either you all agree on the best scenario to select your niche, or you eliminate _all_ the scenarios.

If you eliminate all the scenarios, then Moore says you’re probably not ready to cross the chasm yet. Focus on the early market for the time being, and continue to brainstorm purchasing scenarios for future evaluation.

(Shortform note: This could depend on why they were eliminated. If you eliminated all your scenarios because there was too much competition, that might imply the opposite: You waited too long and missed the window of opportunity, while other companies carried the same technology across the chasm ahead of you.)

Moore observes that you don’t necessarily have to pick the _best_ scenario in order to cross the chasm successfully. You just have to pick one that’s workable and make it work. However, he does caution that scenarios can be based on false assumptions. To mitigate this risk, he advises doing market research to validate the assumptions of your chosen scenario, but he also advises you to move forward while the research is being conducted, because, as we’ve discussed, lingering in the chasm is also a risk.

(Shortform note: For reference, business blogs report that a market research project typically takes six to 12 weeks to complete, depending on the methods used. As a rule of thumb, they also suggest that market research costs about as much as buying a new car. Just as cars vary in price, depending on the quality of the car, its capabilities, and its features, market research projects vary in cost over approximately the same scale. If you’re in the chasm, the risk of standing still for this time, while incurring these expenses, is greater than the risk of moving forward without the data, at least in Moore’s view.)
