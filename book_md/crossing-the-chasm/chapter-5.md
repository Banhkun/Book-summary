## Chapter 5: Strategy Step 2—Provide a Whole Product for Your Niche

Now that you have identified a target customer who has a compelling problem your product can solve, you need to make sure your target customer can buy the complete solution. In this chapter, we will discuss Moore’s “Simplified Whole Product Model,” which we briefly introduced in our earlier discussion of the psychographic categories of customers. Here, we’ll explore Moore’s advice on how you can use the model to identify your whole product and how you can make sure the whole product is available to your target customer.

### Understand the Whole Product Model

#### Levitt’s Whole Product Model

Moore starts his discussion by introducing Theodore Levitt’s “Whole Product Model,” which consisted of four nested circles:

![crossingthechasm-wholeprodmod.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/crossingthechasm-wholeprodmod.png)

  * The center ring is labeled the “generic product,” and represents the core technology, or the core product that you produce. 
  * The next circle represents the “expected product,” or the solution that your customer expects to get once your product is set up. 
  * The third circle is called the “augmented product,” which represents the maximum capabilities of the product when combined with existing third-party add-ons. 
  * The outer circle represents the “potential product,” and represents the maximum capabilities of the system when combined with addons that _could potentially be developed in the future._



Moore then introduces his own “Simplified Whole Product Model,” which focuses just on the elements of the whole product model that are relevant to crossing the chasm. Specifically, he leaves out augmented or potential products, which you won’t be concerned with when introducing a new technology. We’ll discuss Moore’s simplified whole product model next.

#### Moore’s Simplified Whole Product Model

(Shortform note: Like Levitt, Moore refers to the core product as the “generic product.” Today, however, the term “generic product” has come to mean an un-branded low-priced alternative, so to avoid confusion, we will use the term “core product” in place of Moore’s “generic product.”)

Moore presents his “simplified whole product model” as a pair of concentric circles with the outer ring divided into sectors, as shown below. The center represents the core product, and each sector represents one of the interfacing products or services that you add to it to assemble the whole product. Because of its shape, Moore also refers to this figure as a “donut diagram.”

![crossingthechasm-wholeprodsimp.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/crossingthechasm-wholeprodsimp.png)

For example, if the core product is a smartphone, one sector would be electricity to charge the phone, another would be the operating system that runs on the phone, and another would be a data plan from a phone service provider.

### Shortform Commentary: Implications of Moore’s Sectors on the Whole Product Model

To derive Moore’s simplified whole-product model from Levitt’s whole product model, you first eliminate the outer two rings, leaving only the “generic” product in the center, surrounded by the “expected” or “whole” product. You then divide the remaining outer ring into sectors, reflecting the different interfaces or complementary products or services that your customer must have in order to make your product work.

If we were to add the third ring, the _augmented_ ring, back into this model, the augmented ring could no longer be represented by a continuous circle—any additional products or services that would fall into the augmented circle would interface with only certain segments of the second, the _expected,_ ring.

For example, if the core product is a smartphone, and we wish to augment its capabilities with a third-party app, the app has to interface with the phone through the operating system, which would be one sector of the whole product ring. Similarly, if we want to augment the phone with a hardware peripheral that communicates with the phone via wifi, then we would want to show it interfacing through the wifi sector. If we try to show this graphically, the augmented whole product model would begin to resemble a flower with petals extending from each sector, or looping across sectors, if a certain addon interfaces through multiple sectors.

We can illustrate this for our smartphone example below:

#### Why Whole Products Matter

Moore notes that when you make a sale, you’re typically only obligated to deliver the core product. However, recall that while innovators and early adopters are usually willing to take ownership of assembling the whole product for themselves, the early majority are not. As Moore points out, if you don’t arrange for the whole product to be supplied, you’re taking a serious risk: If your customer can’t get the whole product set up easily, they may feel cheated. Moreover, because early-majority customers are sensitive to reputations, one dissatisfied customer who tarnishes your product’s reputation can have a devastating effect on your sales.

(Shortform note: Regis McKenna also echoes this warning, in his book _The Regis Touch_ , asserting that a customer who is impressed with your product will likely tell two or three other people about it, but a customer who is disappointed will probably vent his disillusionment to about 10 other people.)

### Identify Your Whole Product

To identify your whole product, Moore advises that you draw a “donut diagram,” and label the sectors with everything that your product depends on or has to interact with in order to solve your target customer’s problem. For example, does it need electricity, fuel, or wifi? Does it need to “talk” to other software or machines?

Depending on how they intend to use your product, different customers may need different whole products. Thus, Moore advises that you focus only on the niche application of your chosen target customer. This allows you to keep the whole product as simple as possible, since you don’t have the resources to supply a whole product for every conceivable application.

For example, suppose your company has developed a new type of camera sensor with ground-breaking low-light image quality. You could design a security camera system around your core technology and market it to department stores. In this case, to deploy your system effectively, your customers will want to network a large number of cameras, and they’ll want advanced software features like automatic object-removal detection to help them catch shoplifters. On the other hand, if you select homeowners as the target customer for your security cameras, they’ll need a very simple installation procedure, and will probably want the system to interface with a phone app so they can view the camera feed remotely when they’re not home. Thus, your cameras will need to interact with different networking equipment and monitoring software depending on whether you target the commercial surveillance market or the home surveillance market. This, in turn, could affect which companies you need to partner with to supply a whole product.

> **Minimum Viable Products**
> 
> Reinforcing Moore’s advice to keep the product simple, albeit in a slightly different context, Peter Theil introduces the concept of the Minimum Viable Product, or MVP. Theil’s MVP is not necessarily a functional product, but rather a rudimentary mockup that allows you to test your product against potential customers. As such, an MVP might be just an informational video or web page to gauge interest in the idea, or a mockup that allows you to demonstrate how the product would work, even though important functions of the product are performed manually by the person conducting the demonstration.
> 
> Theil’s focus is primarily on the early market: He discusses MVPs in the context of marketing to early adopters and technology enthusiasts. However, his emphasis on using the simplest product possible to test your assumptions can be extrapolated to whole-product design.
> 
> Your customer profiles include assumptions about how your product could solve your target customer’s problems, giving them a compelling reason to buy it. What is the MVWP (Minimum Viable Whole Product) that would allow you to test these assumptions?

#### Determine How the Rest of the Whole Product Will Be Supplied

Once you’ve identified every component of your whole product, and listed it on your donut diagram, you need to figure out how to supply each of those components. Based on Moore’s observations, there are essentially three possibilities:

  1. In some cases, the interfacing product or service is readily available, and the risk of the customer struggling with setup is low. For example, if your product uses 120V AC electricity, your customer can just plug it into an electrical outlet. 
  2. Some interfaces may be specialized enough to warrant supplying the component yourself and bundling it with your product. For example, most smartphones ship with the operating system already installed. 
  3. Finally, you may be able to partner with another company that will deliver part of the whole solution. For example, maybe you want to deploy a hydrogen-powered car, and you coordinate with another company that can supply hydrogen fuel to set up fueling stations for your customers.



(Shortform note: When Moore stresses the importance of making sure the whole product is readily available and discusses the above options, he doesn’t explicitly compare and contrast the benefits of each method. However, he spends much of the chapter talking about how to manage corporate alliances, implying that he considers partnerships a particularly important method or resource for supplying the whole product.)

### Partner Up to Deliver the Whole Product

Moore notes that partnering with other companies to deliver a whole product can be mutually beneficial: You benefit by ensuring that the whole product is available to your customers, and your partners get new customers without the cost of additional marketing.

(Shortform note: McKenna stresses the importance of relationships with other companies not only for supplying the whole product, but also for establishing your company’s reputation by association. He says securing an alliance with an established, reputable company can give a startup instant credibility with customers.)

#### Strategic Alliances Versus Tactical Alliances

Before getting into the mechanics of partnering with other companies, Moore draws a contrast between “strategic” and “tactical” business alliances. He goes on to assert that tactical alliances are useful for crossing the chasm, while strategic alliances are not.

Moore describes a “strategic alliance” as a merger or a formal agreement to engage in large-scale coordination between companies, and cautions that these often seem attractive in theory but don’t work out well in practice. He says they work best between peer companies of similar corporate culture, but even in a best-case scenario, managing them consumes a lot of resources.

By contrast, Moore describes a “tactical alliance” as a simple agreement between companies to cooperate in delivering the whole product to the target customer.

> **Alternative View on Strategic Versus Tactical Business Alliances**
> 
> Not all authors share Moore’s view on the difference between “strategic” and “tactical” business relationships. Regis McKenna argues that “strategic relationships” with other companies are crucial to the success of high-tech start-ups. In contrast to Moore, he asserts that relationships between small start-ups and large, well-established companies can be particularly beneficial.
> 
> McKenna states that “strategic relationships” can take many forms, including joint ventures, equity purchases, agreements to share information or technology, and agreements to manufacture or distribute a product or component. However, he emphasizes that a strategic relationship is not a merger or an acquisition, and asserts that when a large, established company acquires an innovative startup, the merger often kills the startup’s culture of innovation, hindering its development work.
> 
> Thus, McKenna’s “strategic relationships” resemble Moore’s “tactical alliances.”

#### Creating and Maintaining Tactical Alliances

Having warned against “strategic” alliances, Moore goes on to offer advice on creating and maintaining tactical alliances.

When choosing your partners, Moore advises you not to solicit partnerships with companies that would be directly competing with each other. A partner tends to be less willing to cooperate with you if you’re also partnering with their rivals.

(Shortform note: In _Good Strategy Bad Strategy_ , Richard Rumelt argues that the best way to gain an advantage over a competitor is to pit your strength against their weakness. If you look at your alliance from your partner’s point of view, their partnership with you gives them a specific strength, and a rival without that partnership then has a weakness that your partner can exploit. However, if you also partner with that rival, you essentially give a similar strength to the rival, so that, in your partner’s eyes, your partnership is no longer a unique strength. The company partnering with you will then be less motivated and committed to making your partnership work, because their efforts in making it work won’t bring them as much return on their investment.)

According to Moore, **it’s crucial that you make sure your alliances benefit all parties, and that the benefits are equitable**. In his experience, partners back out if it looks like the partnership would benefit you more than them. However, he also notes that if the partnership favors the other company enough to be equitable, and to motivate productive cooperation, someone at your own company will inevitably think it’s too generous.

(Shortform note: In this situation, you may have to defend the fairness of the terms of the partnership to critics within your own company. In _Never Split the Difference,_ Chris Voss discusses negotiation tactics, including tactics based on the concept of fairness. Voss observes that people’s aversion to _unfairness_ is so strong that it can drive them to make irrational choices or agreements. In this case, though, you could refer to fairness to encourage _rational_ thinking, by arguing that demanding a larger share of the profits might prove demotivating for the partner company, which ultimately will hurt, not help, you.)

Moore also advises you not to rush formalization of your alliances, and to use formalized alliances only as communication channels, not as leverage to enforce coordination. In his view, this promotes mutual trust, which is essential for the alliance to work. He also advises trying to communicate with partner companies at the level of management whose decisions most directly affect your customers. With large companies, this is often the staff at their local sales office, while with small companies, it may be their corporate executives.

> **McKenna’s Advice on Maintaining Alliances**
> 
> According to McKenna, there are two keys to making corporate alliances, or “strategic relationships” work:
> 
>   * **Adequate separation.** Both companies retain their autonomy, identity, and culture. He warns that when one company becomes dependent on another, it sets itself up for failure, should the other company eventually decide to switch suppliers.
> 
>   * **Adequate communication.** There should be a clear understanding up front about objectives, expectations, allocation of responsibilities, and the timeline over which each company will fulfill its responsibilities.
> 
> 

> 
> McKenna’s point about adequate separation resonates with Moore’s advice, as well as with his aversion to “strategic alliances” that involve mergers or excessive coordination between companies.
> 
> However, McKenna’s point about communication contrasts with Moore’s perspective: Moore cautions not to formalize alliances too soon, while McKenna advises formal delineation of responsibilities up front.
