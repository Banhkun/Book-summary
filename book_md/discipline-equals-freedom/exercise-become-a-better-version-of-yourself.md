## Exercise: Become a Better Version of Yourself

To become the best version of yourself through discipline, Willink cautions against negatively comparing yourself to others. Instead, you should be inspired by what’s possible and focus on becoming better than _you_ were yesterday.

* * *

Write about a time you negatively compared your own progress on a goal to someone else’s. For example, maybe a friend lost more weight than you did in the last year. How did comparing yourself negatively to that person make you feel?

Did comparing yourself negatively to this person help you make any progress toward your own goal? Why?

Rather than comparing yourself negatively to this person, let their success inspire you. Compare yourself to this person in a positive way by writing about something you have in common that seems to have helped them achieve success.

Now, instead of comparing yourself to the other person, think about your current condition in relation to the goal you mentioned above. Write two ways you can apply daily discipline to your life that would improve your current progress toward this goal one month from now.
