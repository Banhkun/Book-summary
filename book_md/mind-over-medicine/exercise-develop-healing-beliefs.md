## Exercise: Develop Healing Beliefs

Lissa Rankin says that positive beliefs are a major contributor to self-healing.

* * *

Think of a negative belief you have about your health. What is it? How does the belief make you feel?

What evidence is there to support that this belief is true?

Now, imagine how your life would be different if you didn’t have this belief. How would it affect your daily actions and your long-term perception of your life?

What is the positive opposite of the negative belief you’re thinking of? For example, if your belief is that you’re too weak to heal, imagine that you’re strong. How does it make you feel to consider this positive belief? What evidence supports _this_ truth?
