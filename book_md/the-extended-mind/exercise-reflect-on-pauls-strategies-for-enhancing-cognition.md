## Exercise: Reflect on Paul’s Strategies for Enhancing Cognition

You’ve learned a total of nine strategies for using your body, your environment, and your personal connections to enhance your thinking. Think back to memorable strategies from each category and consider how you might implement them in your life.

* * *

Which of Paul’s strategies for _using the body_ to enhance your thinking appeals to you the most, and why? Describe how you might integrate this strategy into your daily routine. (For example, perhaps you like the idea of learning to listen to the body because you’ve been meaning to start a meditation practice for a while. To make this strategy part of your routine, you could set an alarm every morning to prompt you to meditate for five minutes.)

Which of Paul’s strategies for _using the physical world_ to enhance your thinking appeals to you the most, and why? Describe how you might integrate this strategy into your daily routine. (For example, perhaps you feel that you don’t spend enough time in nature despite it being something that has always rejuvenated you and brought you joy. To implement Paul’s strategy, you could take a 10-minute walk through a nearby park before work.)

Which of Paul’s strategies for _using other people_ to enhance your thinking appeals to you the most, and why? Describe how you might integrate this strategy into your daily routine. (For example, perhaps you’re a graphic designer, and you really like Paul’s idea of learning by teaching others because you’re a natural extrovert. To make this strategy part of your routine, you could post on social media offering free weekly graphic design lessons for whoever wants to learn.)
