## 1-Page Summary

If you imagine a genius scientist or philosopher, you may picture someone sitting alone, lost in thought, slowly formulating their world-changing ideas entirely in their head. However, truly effective thinking could look very different. In _The Extended Mind_ , science writer Annie Murphy Paul argues that **optimal cognition isn’t about withdrawing deeper into our minds—it’s about engaging more with the world outside of our heads.** Intelligence has less to do with our neurobiology and more to do with how well we use the external world to enhance our thinking.

According to Paul, people who know how to make use of external aids have such a cognitive advantage because **modern society is at odds with our neurobiology.** Our brains evolved to suit a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in which we were actively engaged with our bodies, the world around us, and our relationships with each other. However, the world has quickly changed, and our society, full of abstract ideas, artificial environments, and social isolation, no longer stimulates our brains in a way that unlocks their full potential.

Once you start thinking in a way that suits your brain’s biology, Paul argues that you can tap into your full cognitive potential. Specifically, you can learn and understand complex ideas more thoroughly, focus more intently on your goals, come up with more creative solutions to your problems, and communicate, collaborate, and empathize more effectively with those around you.

In this guide, we’ll cover three categories of strategies: We’ll begin by detailing the ways you can use your _body_ to improve your thinking. Then, we’ll discuss how to enhance cognition using the _physical world_. Finally, we’ll explain how to optimize your thinking through your _interactions with others_. In our commentary, we’ll help you further understand and implement these strategies by providing additional context from psychological research as well as books like _Hyperfocus _and _Spark_.

(Shortform note: Paul separates her book into three parts: Thinking With Our Bodies, Thinking With Our Surroundings, and Thinking With Our Relationships. This structure is arguably effective because it follows a logical outward progression: You begin by focusing on thinking with your body, then you expand into your immediate surroundings, and finally, you tap into the thoughts of others.)

> **Become Happier by Catering to Your Biology**
> 
> The mismatch between our ancient neurobiology and modern society doesn’t just make it harder for us to think optimally—it also makes it harder for us to achieve optimal _happiness_. In _The Happiness Hypothesis_ , Jonathan Haidt uses an evolutionary lens to analyze humanity’s struggle to find happiness.
> 
> Haidt explains that we evolved to have a negativity bias: We typically fear and dislike bad things more than we enjoy good things. This negativity bias gave our hunter-gatherer ancestors a strong aversion to risk, which helped them avoid life-threatening danger. However, in our modern society in which we’re typically not in danger of sudden death, this negativity bias just makes us more likely to be unhappy.
> 
> But there’s good news: Just like we can improve our thinking by engaging with the world outside our minds, Haidt argues that we can achieve happiness by similarly catering to our biology. Our brains are naturally satisfied by the gradual progression toward difficult goals. By choosing gratifying goals that draw on our strengths, we can make ourselves happy. In particular, two goals that have the most positive impact on happiness are deepening meaningful connections with others and gaining more autonomy over your life.

### Enhancing Cognition Using Your Body

The first way you can use external aids to enhance your cognition is by actively engaging with your body. By paying attention to how your body feels and how you’re choosing to move it, Paul argues, you can access a more expansive way of thinking.

Let’s examine four strategies for how to use your body to think more effectively.

#### Strategy #1: Listen to Your Body

Paul asserts that **by becoming more sensitive to how your body feels, you can access a wealth of quick and accurate _subconscious knowledge_. **The brain perceives and stores vastly more information than you’re aware of, and it understands far more complex and subtle patterns than you can consciously grasp. This subconscious information manifests as an intuition you can feel in your body as subtle physical sensations.

Consequently, research has shown that people with greater bodily awareness display instinctive skills in cognitively demanding domains. In one study, researchers found that financial traders who could more accurately report the rhythm of their heartbeat made more profitable decisions than traders who were less aware of their bodies.

(Shortform note: Contrary to the outcome of this study, Mark Douglas argues in _Trading in the Zone_ that the most successful traders entirely ignore the instinctual signals their bodies give them while making trading decisions—particularly emotional signals. Douglas claims that 95% of trading errors occur because traders are too afraid of losing money, and they let this fear compel them into making irrational decisions. To avoid situations in which you mistake your irrational fears for subconscious intuition, Douglas advises practicing purely logic-based trading in which you follow a system of unchanging rules that dictates all your trading decisions.)

Listening to your body has other benefits, too. Paul reports research showing that **people with more bodily awareness possess greater emotional intelligence.** Why? Because of how emotions form. When you perceive a stimulus, physical sensations manifest in your body; then, your brain’s interpretation of those physical sensations creates emotions. By cultivating greater awareness of bodily sensations, you can consciously influence how your brain interprets those sensations and creates emotions. This allows you to exert some degree of control over your emotions from moment to moment.

(Shortform note: Another theory, the James-Lange theory of emotion, shares Paul’s premise that you create emotions by interpreting your physical responses to stimuli—however, this theory disagrees with Paul’s claim about controlling your emotions. The James-Lange theory contends that all emotions are caused by _unique_ physiological experiences, so it’s impossible to reinterpret the sensations of one emotion as a totally different one. Thus, if you want to improve your emotional regulation, you may be more successful with biofeedback training. This involves learning specific techniques to directly control your physiology, such as deep breathing in response to a stress-induced jump in heart rate.)

To get better at listening to your body, Paul recommends **practicing mindfulness meditation.** In particular, including a “body scan” in your meditation, in which you take time to focus on how each part of your body feels in turn, helps you develop a greater sensitivity to your bodily sensations. Additionally, it helps to keep a special journal to track the decisions you make every day and how your body feels when you make them. By reflecting on which gut feelings lead to positive outcomes, you may realize which gut feelings you can trust and which you should ignore.

(Shortform note: Mindfulness meditation and journaling both help you build bodily awareness—and they’re two of the most psychologically healthy habits you can practice—because they have one big thing in common: They both involve directing attention toward your consciousness. You’re focusing on your thoughts and feelings rather than solely thinking and feeling about the external world, which is a unique practice in daily life. Therapy is another effective way to build self-awareness for this same reason—a therapist prompts you to observe yourself. Furthermore, observing yourself helps you notice and accept your thoughts and feelings without judgment, which is psychologically healthy.)

#### Strategy #2: Exercise Strategically

Another way you can use your body to improve your cognition is by exercising in a way that matches the kind of thinking you want to do. Paul distinguishes among mild exercise, moderate exercise, and heavy, sustained exercise, and she asserts that **each level of physical exertion has a different effect on your brain.**

First, Paul states that mild exercise (which includes standing and _fidgeting_ , which is any small repetitive movement) boosts your ability to focus and your overall quality of thought when compared to simply sitting still. It costs energy to restrain your natural impulse to move, and this mental drain weakens your cognition. Consequently, Paul recommends using a standing desk rather than a sitting desk, if possible, and allowing yourself to freely fidget and switch positions while working.

(Shortform note: Arguably, this tip is less about engaging in exercise and more about avoiding an excessive amount of _sitting still_. You may have heard the phrase “sitting is the new smoking” due to its negative health effects—although this isn’t literally true, sitting for too long does stall digestion and metabolism and may interfere with sleep quality. Both of these effects can cause a range of health concerns. While fidgeting in a seated position may help you think, it’s not enough to ward off the risks of a sedentary routine. If you don’t have access to a standing desk for work, make sure to take breaks from sitting at least once an hour.)

Second, Paul explains that moderate exercise, which includes brisk walking and any other brief or light physical activity, boosts your thinking in the same way as mild exercise but with an even stronger effect. Unlike mild exercise’s impact, this cognitive enhancement lasts for up to two hours after you stop exercising. Thus, Paul recommends that you exercise before work whenever possible and work out the body while taking breaks from cognitively demanding tasks.

(Shortform note: While Paul emphasizes the short-term cognitive benefits in the hours after exercising, evidence shows that regular exercise significantly improves your cognition in the long run, too. In _Spark_ , John Ratey asserts that exercise produces a specific protein in the brain that creates more connections between neurons and strengthens the signals between neurons, resulting in improved cognition on a long-lasting, biological level.)

Last, Paul asserts that heavy, sustained exercise that significantly raises your heart rate for 40 minutes or more has a very different effect on the brain. This kind of exercise _impairs_ your thinking: As your brain devotes more mental resources to managing your body, it reduces activity in the prefrontal cortex. As a result, you fall into a mild trance state in which it’s harder to think logically, but it’s easier to come up with new ideas and creative connections. Therefore, **if you need a boost of creativity, try heavy exercise.**

(Shortform note: This state of “transient hypofrontality” caused by heavy, sustained exercise is likely at least partly responsible for the “runner’s high” described by distance runners. In addition to triggering looser, more creative thinking, the runner’s high involves losing a sense of time, increasing your mindfulness of the present moment, and experiencing peaceful euphoria. Your creative thoughts during this period of transient hypofrontality will be harder to remember after you return to a normal cognitive state, so make sure to write them down.)

#### Strategy #3: Use Your Body to Think Through Ideas

Paul explains that performing specific motions can enhance your ability to learn, understand complex ideas, and think through problems. The brain is exceptionally good at learning physical skills through practice, a holdover from our evolutionary past. We can remember things we’ve physically done much more easily than words or images. Consequently, you can process and synthesize abstract concepts more effectively if you express them in your body.

First, Paul asserts that **by engaging in bodily motions while learning abstract concepts, you can recall those concepts more easily later,** especially if you’re able to repeat the same learned movements. Ideally, these movements will be conceptually related to the ideas themselves—for instance, you may move your hands to act out the different stages of a butterfly’s life cycle—but physical movement makes ideas easier to remember even if the motions have nothing to do with them. For example, raising your arms every time you study the capital of Iran will help you remember what it is in the future.

(Shortform note: In the early 1990s, the idea that each student has a unique “learning style” became popular, as did the theory that teachers could achieve the best results by presenting information in different ways to different students. In this framework, the kind of movement-assisted learning Paul describes here is known as “kinesthetic learning.” However, in recent years, research has shown learning styles to be, for the most part, a myth—several studies have demonstrated that students who study according to their preferred learning style learn no better than students who don’t. In reality, learning through movement has been shown to improve comprehension and memory for all students—we’re _all_ kinesthetic learners.)

Similarly, Paul explains that you can more quickly understand abstract concepts on a deeper level by imagining yourself as part of the material you’re learning and acting the concept out. For example, if you want to learn the anatomy of an eagle, moving your body as if you’re a bird and pointing to the spots on your body where its bones and organs would be will help you more deeply comprehend how its body functions.

> **Learning Through Movement in Virtual Reality**
> 
> Paul explains that due to our biology, we learn best through physical practice—and many people predict that virtual reality (VR) will soon make this kind of education extremely common. For example, for years, medical students have been learning treatment procedures by running expensive, hands-on simulations with high-tech dummies or human cadavers. VR has already begun to make this kind of hands-on experience more easily accessible to students and infinitely repeatable in a digital environment. Additionally, VR allows students to gain experience with a wider variety of rare medical cases.
> 
> Other institutions, too, have begun experimenting with VR: _The New York Times_ has created a curriculum of VR experiences for classrooms. Many of these experiences enhance learning by placing the student at the center of a setting that’s normally merely conceptual—a high-tech version of the imagination exercise Paul recommends. In this curriculum, students fly through the solar system past Pluto, go back in time to historic moments in the history of the Olympic Games, and look around inside the Large Hadron Collider.

#### Strategy #4: Gesture With Your Hands to Think and Communicate Better

Paul asserts that another way we can use the body to enhance our cognition is by gesturing more with our hands. This is because **our gestures are more in touch with our subconscious minds than the words we say.**

When we’re learning something new, or when we’re struggling to understand a particularly challenging idea, we instinctively gesture to represent ideas that we don’t consciously understand clearly enough yet to put into words. This kind of gesturing helps us clarify ideas and come to a better understanding of what we already know, both in our conversations with others and when thinking things through on our own. You can use this to your advantage: **The next time you find yourself deep in thought, gesturing more expressively may help you discover valuable insights.**

(Shortform note: The fact that hand gestures are so connected to the subconscious mind means that when someone is lying, their hands frequently give away that they’re not being truthful. Research has found that when a person lies, they instinctively gesture with their hands more than normal. This is perhaps because lying requires more quick, rigorous cognition than telling the truth—liars may gesture as a subconscious attempt to help themselves invent details on the fly and monitor whether others are believing their lies.)

Additionally, Paul argues that gesturing is one of the most effective ways we can enhance our communication with others. Linguists believe that communication through physical gestures developed before verbal language—consequently, the gestures we make are often just as information-rich as the words we say. **By gesturing more in our conversations with others, we vastly increase the chance that they’ll understand what we’re saying.**

(Shortform note: According to Vanessa Van Edwards, author of _Captivate,_ while gesturing with your hands can improve the clarity of your communication, _too much_ gesturing can distract your listeners or make you look untactful. To appear expressive yet in control, imagine a box extending from your shoulders down to your waist to contain your gestures. If you really want to optimize your gesturing, try filming yourself in conversation with a friend to see how you appear to others.)

### Enhancing Cognition Using the Physical World

Now that we’ve discussed how to incorporate your entire body into the act of thinking, let’s expand our focus outward. The second way we can use external aids to enhance our cognition is by more intentionally engaging with the immediate physical world around us.

Let’s take a look at two strategies for using external objects and the environment around us to think more effectively.

#### Strategy #1: Give Your Thoughts Physical Form

If you’re trying to learn something, solve a problem, or generate new insights, **Paul recommends giving your thoughts physical form** —whether by writing them down, representing them in images, or modeling them in some other tactile way. Moving your thoughts from your head into the physical world means that you don’t have to actively remember as much, giving you more mental capacity to think effectively.

(Shortform note: Many experts argue that a strict system dictating how to habitually externalize your thoughts is the key to personal organization. For instance, _The Bullet Journal Method_ , _Getting Things Done_ , and _Building a Second Brain_ all offer distinct, intricate systems of organizing your thoughts outside of your head. These systems have much in common: They detail how to sort the information you record, as well as how and when to review and act on that information.)

If you can give your thoughts a physical form that you’re able to physically manipulate, that’s even better, according to Paul. Biologically speaking, the brain is much better at making sense of physical objects than abstract ideas, so **you’ll get better results working through your thoughts with your hands than in your mind.** For example, if you’re trying to determine a seating arrangement for your wedding reception, you could write your guests’ names on slips of paper and physically move them around until you’ve found the ideal configuration.

(Shortform note: If your ideas are too big or complex for you to turn them into a physical model, you may be able to replicate the experience of thinking with your hands using 3D modeling software. Software like this allows you to design and manipulate objects in a virtual, three-dimensional space. Although you’ll lose the tactile sensations that aid cognition, the ability to free up your working memory by externalizing spatial ideas is still invaluable.)

Additionally, Paul explains that externalizing your thoughts creates distance from them, allowing you to judge them more clearly and objectively. This distance also helps you come up with creative new ideas, as inspecting your thoughts externally helps you see them in new ways.

Paul states that this understanding should completely change the way you approach the creative process. When you’re doing anything creative, many people assume that you should come up with an idea, work out all the details, then manifest it in the world as a finished product. However, Paul argues that **the ideal creative process is iterative: Externalize your thoughts, assess them, and repeat.** By critiquing and finding inspiration in each successive draft, you’ll end up with a much better final product.

(Shortform note: The creative process Paul outlines here closely mirrors Stephen King’s writing process as he describes it in _On Writing_. King almost always creates multiple drafts when writing his novels. Like Paul, King acknowledges that attaining distance from your work helps you cultivate a clearer perspective and come up with better ideas. Therefore, to create even more distance, King recommends that you write a first draft as quickly as possible and then work on other projects for a while before returning to revise. King takes at least six weeks between finishing his first draft and revising one of his pieces.)

#### Strategy #2: Find the Right Place to Think

Paul argues that **the setting in which you work has a significant impact on the quality of your thinking and thus, the work you do.** First, your ideal workspace should be _private_. Biologically, the human brain isn’t suited for abstract, conceptual work, so you need space to deeply focus when undertaking this challenging type of task. If, while you’re working, you see movement, hear nearby conversations, or notice other environmental changes around you, it can easily derail your train of thought.

(Shortform note: In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey claims that our hunter-gatherer neurobiology not only explains why we’re so easily distracted in the wrong workspace but also why we’re so drawn to multitasking. Constantly noticing new stimuli in our environments helped keep our ancestors alive, so the brain rewards us with dopamine every time we start a new task. Thus, many of us like to constantly switch between multiple tasks while working. However, multitasking in this way makes each task take 50% more time than if it was our sole focus.)

Second, Paul recommends **intentionally arranging and decorating your workspace according to your preferences.** This improves your thinking in a few ways: Designing your workspace gives you a sense of ownership and control over it, which research shows makes you more confident, more focused, and more successful at accomplishing your goals. Additionally, decorating your workspace in ways that reflect your personality and values serves as a continuous reminder of what kind of person you are. This connection to your identity keeps you comfortable and psychologically healthy, which provides a significant boost to your productivity.

(Shortform note: Just because Paul advocates decorating your workspace with objects that reflect your identity doesn’t mean you should keep _everything_ you enjoy on your desk. Instead, intentionally select just a few personal items so you can keep your workspace tidy and organized. Experts say that just as choosing how your desk is arranged gives you a productive sense of control, intentionally organizing your environment does, too. This is why organization guru Marie Kondo describes tidying up as “a life-changing art”—she claims that the tidying mindset of _imposing your values with intention_ on the world can improve all areas of your life. Additionally, research shows that cluttered, disorganized environments actively drain your mental energy.)

Third, Paul states that **your workspace should be as close to nature as possible.** The brain interprets lush natural landscapes as safe and prosperous, so spending time in this kind of environment soothes and rejuvenates us. Aside from boosting your mood, spending time in nature will improve your focus and impulse control. Work within sight of lush greenery, if possible, whether that’s next to a window or near indoor plants. Furthermore, occasionally taking time to walk through a natural environment will give you nature’s psychological benefits for some time after you leave.

(Shortform note: In the workplace, even artificial plants have a positive effect on employee health—visually, they’re the same as real plants to the human brain, so they provide many of the benefits Paul describes. They also require much less maintenance than real plants. Outside of work, researchers claim that spending two hours a week in nature is enough to experience its health-boosting benefits. It doesn’t matter how that time is split up throughout the week, and spending more time than this in nature doesn’t seem to provide significant additional health benefits.)

### Enhancing Cognition Using Other People

We’ve covered how to expand your thinking with the body and the physical world, taking advantage of the fact that our brains thrive in a tactile, physical environment. Now, let’s explore how to take advantage of the fact that our brains thrive in a _social_ environment.

Here are three strategies for enhancing your thinking with the help of _other people_.

#### Strategy #1: Imitate Others

If you want to learn a new skill or accomplish a goal, Paul suggests closely imitating a highly skilled expert. Humans are naturally proficient imitators: As children, we learn everything about navigating the world by imitating those around us. Thus, **imitating an established expert is one of the most effective ways to learn and succeed.**

Strategic imitation involves more than mimicking _exactly_ what someone else does—most of the time, imitation requires you to interpret experts’ actions and adjust them to suit your specific situation. To do this effectively, you must understand not only _what_ the experts do but also _why_ they’re doing it.

For example, if you want to become a sci-fi screenwriter, Paul might suggest writing a story that imitates Star Wars. If you just imitate it superficially and write a story about a farmer named Luke who befriends robots, your movie probably won’t be very good—because you don’t understand _why_ Star Wars succeeded. However, if you dig deeper and imitate the qualities that make Luke Skywalker a compelling character, your story will be more likely to succeed.

According to Paul, once you master this kind of imitation, you can learn from a wide range of experts in fields that aren’t obviously connected to your work. For instance, if you’re elected to public office, you could study how successful investors decide which companies to bet on to learn how to make high-stakes decisions.

(Shortform note: In _Range,_ David Epstein argues that the more superficially unrelated an analogical case study is (while still matching your situation at a deeper level), the more likely it is to spark creative, useful ideas. For example, if you’re elected to public office, you may want to study the decision-making of record label talent scouts or professional _Magic: The Gathering_ players—something as far away from your role as possible, while still incorporating decision-making elements.)

> **When Imitating, Don’t Be Fooled by Randomness**
> 
> It’s more difficult than it seems to learn by imitation. One reason for this is that you can never know for certain which decisions led to someone’s success. In _Fooled by Randomness_ , Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that we vastly underestimate the amount of randomness at play in the world; thus, when we see someone achieve wild success, it’s typically due more to luck than skill. When one person succeeds in a given field, we fail to consider the many more people who made the same decisions and still failed due to bad luck—this is a mental error called survivorship bias. Imitating these “experts” can lead us to copy useless behaviors and unwittingly overestimate how likely we are to succeed.
> 
> With this in mind, Taleb argues that success is more about mitigating the risks of failure than copying the skills of experts. To mitigate risks, first, recognize that anything you assume to be true might be totally incorrect. You can still try to deduce the deeper purpose behind experts’ decisions; just don’t be overconfident in your interpretations and consequently take unnecessary risks. Second, anticipate rare, random events as if they’re bound to happen. Because people underestimate the probability of improbable or “impossible” events, you can find success by being one of the few to correctly predict it.

#### Strategy #2: Enhance Your Thinking Through Teaching and Debate

We’ve previously established that it’s sometimes necessary to retreat into solitary thinking to work through your ideas without distraction. However, Paul explains that **thinking with other people activates more complex parts of the brain than thinking alone** , resulting in greater understanding, memory, and insight. Paul states that ideally, you should set an alternating schedule in which you budget time to think alone as well as think with others.

(Shortform note: In _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport offers several schedules you can use to balance thinking in solitude and engaging with others: With the “bimodal” schedule, you set aside several days, weeks, or months at a time to do nothing but engage in deep solitary work, and then you engage with the world when you get back. With the “rhythmic” schedule, you block out several hours every day to do deep work, and you make it a daily habit. With the “journalistic” schedule, you make it a habit to engage in deep solitary work every time you get a few minutes to yourself.)

One way you can use social interaction to enhance understanding is by _teaching someone else_ —Paul argues that **you can often learn more by teaching than by receiving personal instruction.** The social and emotional pressure that you feel when preparing to teach someone else powerfully motivates you to comprehend the material. Additionally, by considering how best to explain the material, you prompt yourself to synthesize a more refined understanding of the topic. Teaching someone face-to-face is ideal since you’re motivated by the satisfaction of watching your students benefit from your work. However, you get some cognitive benefits by recording yourself for others to watch later, too.

(Shortform note: This understanding of “learning through teaching” has valuable implications for management. In a workplace setting, you can accelerate skill acquisition by establishing a program for peer learning—in other words, by teaching your employees to teach each other how to improve their work. Set up opportunities for co-workers to share knowledge face-to-face. These could be one-on-one mentorship sessions or weekly meetings in which team members take turns presenting their knowledge regarding a specific, ongoing project.)

**Another way you can increase the quality of your thought using others is through debate.** Paul explains that we’re much better at spotting other people’s errors than our own. If there are any logical flaws in your thought process, your debate partner is more likely than you to notice and correct them. Additionally, you’re more motivated to refine your thinking and find more evidence to back up your claims when you know you’ll be defending your stance. For these reasons, constructive debate leads to more logically sound thinking on both sides.

> **Rules for Having the Most Constructive Debates**
> 
> Framing a discussion as a debate improves both sides’ thinking; however, it also risks provoking unconstructive emotions. In a debate, both sides are tempted to achieve the satisfaction of winning, which may lead to bad-faith arguments and an unwillingness to compromise.
> 
> To hold the most constructive, productive debates possible, consider following “Rapoport’s rules”: a set of self-imposed rules for debate with roots in the psychology research of Carl Rogers. Rapoport’s rules aim to criticize an opponent’s argument while maintaining respect for them and finding mutually beneficial solutions to whatever you’re debating.
> 
> Rapoport’s rules, as articulated by philosopher Daniel Dennett, are:
> 
>   * Attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”
> 
>   * List any points of agreement (especially if they’re not matters of general or widespread agreement).
> 
>   * Mention anything you’ve learned from your target.
> 
>   * Only then can you say a word of rebuttal or criticism.
> 
> 


#### Strategy #3: Bond With a Team

Finally, Paul explains that **we can enhance our thinking by bonding with a team.** Our neurobiology changes drastically when we see ourselves as part of a group of people like us, in ways that often make it easier to accomplish goals. When you’re sufficiently bonded, you’ll have an easier time communicating with teammates, empathizing with them, and learning from them. When you’re in the same room as a team and working together to accomplish a task, that task feels more important, and you’ll deploy more focused attention to accomplish it.

(Shortform note: Although bonding with a team has many benefits, as Paul details, it also has a dark side. In _The Lucifer Effect_ , Philip Zimbardo describes how humans’ morals are drastically shaped by their immediate surroundings. In particular, we instinctively sacrifice our individual morals to satisfy the expectations of those around us, especially those we see as part of the same group as us. Thus, bonding with a team can make you less likely to protest if the group wants you to do something immoral. Stay aware of this risk, and if necessary, leave your group to find one that shares your morals.)

There are many ways you can form these bonds with others—Paul asserts that just about anything that makes it feel like your team is one entity will activate your group-oriented cognitive skills. For example, you’ll naturally feel closer to your team if you all take your lunch breaks together or agree to wear casual attire on Fridays.

(Shortform note: In _Leaders Eat Last_ , Simon Sinek claims that as a leader, you can promote this kind of productive, fulfilling group bonding by demonstrating to your subordinates that you’re putting their needs over your own. This is because the root of group bonding is the neurochemical oxytocin, which your brain releases when it senses that you can trust the people around you. Showing those around you that they can trust you gives them oxytocin, which encourages them to be more empathetic to their fellow team members. This creates a chain reaction of group bonding.)
