## Exercise: Apply Lessons from Barbarians at the Gate

In this exercise you’ll have a chance to contemplate how you can apply lessons from _Barbarians at the Gate_ to your own business situation.

* * *

Twice, prior to the RJR Nabisco LBO, Ross Johnson arranged for his company to be acquired by a larger company and then worked his way up to CEO of the company that bought him out. In hindsight, this strategy probably worked much better for him than trying to compete with those companies head-to-head would have. What’s hindering your own progress right now? For example, is there a rival you can’t seem to out-compete (as in Ross Johnson’s case), or some other obstacle that’s holding you back?

How could you ostensibly sell out to the rival or obstacle you described above, or join forces with it to conquer it from within?

Burrough and Helyar conjecture that Ross Johnson initiated the RJR Nabisco LBO (which ended up cutting his career short) because he became restless and obsessed over the company’s low stock price. What problem are you most focused on solving right now in your own career? What could you do to ensure that your focus on solving it doesn’t distract you from the bigger picture or lead you to do things that are ultimately counterproductive?

We discussed how the precautions Johnson took to make sure he wouldn’t lose any corporate perks or influence in the LBO, or lose the favor of the board if it didn’t happen, backfired, ultimately costing him his position at the company. What are you most afraid of losing right now, and what are you doing to guard against that loss?

What unintended consequences could the actions you listed in the previous question have? What risks or losses could your precautions potentially incur?
