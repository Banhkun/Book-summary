## Exercise: Design Your YouTube Channel for Success

In this exercise, you’ll have a chance to apply Travis and Cannell’s advice to your own YouTube business.

* * *

What makes your videos unique, and how does that make them valuable to viewers? If you’re already running a YouTube channel and have a clear idea of the unique value you provide, describe it below. Otherwise, brainstorm a few ideas for the unique value that you _could_ provide. Recall that anything you’re both good at and passionate about can be a good topic to build a channel around.

Briefly describe your viewers. What are the unique or defining characteristics of your target audience? How might you build your target audience? This might be by posting more regularly or engaging your audience in live-streams.

Given your answer to the question above, brainstorm a few things you could do to build a sense of community between you and your target audience. For example, is there a convention where they get together (either in person or online) that you could attend or arrange to speak at? Or are there certain key influencers whom you could collaborate with on a project?

Recall that there are several ways to make money on YouTube, including YouTube ads, affiliate marketing, promoting your own company or merchandise, and crowdfunding. Some revenue sources are a better fit for a given channel than others. What revenue stream do you think _best_ fits your channel, and why?
