## 1-Page Summary

**In _Primal Leadership,_ Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis, and Annie McKee argue that the most important trait for a leader to have is emotional intelligence.** A leader who’s emotionally intelligent will create a positive climate for their group in which productivity, collaboration, and performance will soar. The authors argue that a critical mass of emotionally intelligent leaders and groups is the _foundation_ of a sustainably successful organization. **The purpose of _Primal Leadership_ is to teach individuals and organizations how to lead with emotional intelligence so they can achieve long-term success.**

Daniel Goleman is a psychologist and the _New York Times_ best-selling author of both _Emotional Intelligence _and _Social Intelligence. _He’s also an internationally known lecturer and was a science journalist for the _New York Times_ for years, writing about brain and behavioral sciences. Richard Boyatzis is a Distinguished Professor of Organizational Behavior, Psychology, and Cognitive Science, and an award-winning organizational theorist. He’s an expert in emotional intelligence, behavior change, and competence. Annie McKee is the best-selling author of _Emotional Intelligence,Resonant Leadership, _and _Becoming a Resonant Leader. _She’s also an academic, speaker, and advisor to top global leaders.

In this guide, we’ll explain what emotional intelligence is, why emotionally intelligent leadership is critical for group effectiveness, how to lead with emotional intelligence, and how you can boost your own emotional intelligence and that of your group and organization. Throughout the guide, we’ll connect the author's concepts to theories and recommendations of other experts in cognitive science, behavioral psychology, business, and management.

### Part 1: What Is Emotional Intelligence?

**The authors define emotional intelligence (EI) as the ability to understand and manage our own emotions while also being able to understand and influence the emotions of others.**

Emotional intelligence is composed of _four main skills_ : self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Each of these skills contains a set of microskills—specific competencies that give people the ability to successfully execute the skill:

  1. **_Self-awareness_ is the ability to understand your own emotions**—what caused them and how they might impact other people. The microskills you need to excel at self-awareness are: understanding your emotions, knowing your strengths and weaknesses, and having self-confidence. 
  2. **_Self-management_ means that you’re able to manage and rationalize your emotions**—that you know when it is and isn’t appropriate to express them and how to do so effectively. The microskills you need to excel at self-management are: emotional control, adaptability in the face of ambiguity and challenges, high personal standards, personal motivation, and optimism.
  3. **_Social awareness_ is the ability** **to understand the emotions of other people and consider why they might be feeling a certain way.** The microskills you need to excel at social awareness are: being empathetic, being able to read the politics, social networks, and power relationships of a group, and being able to foster an emotional climate.
  4. **_Relationship management_ is the ability to use your understanding of other people to manage your relationship with them**—to be supportive when necessary, assertive when necessary, sympathetic when necessary, and so on. The microskills you need to excel at relationship management are: the ability to inspire others, the ability to help people reach their goals and cultivate their abilities, the ability to spot the need for changes, the ability to resolve conflict, and the ability to bring people together as a team.



> **Updating the Emotional Intelligence Skill Inventory**
> 
> The four skills outlined here indicate a progression of first getting a handle on your own _self_ and then getting a handle on your relationships with _others_ : To master EI, you’d start with self-examination, then move to self-control, and then repeat the process by looking outward. The terms correspond to this framework—switching between “awareness” and “management,” first applying it to yourself and then to other people. In this way, the authors indicate that EI is a progressive skill that starts by looking inward and ends by looking outward.
> 
> In Daniel Goleman’s earlier book, _Emotional Intelligence_ , he defines emotional intelligence as consisting of five main skills rather than four and doesn’t include the comprehensive list of microskills that he discusses in _Primal Leadership._
> 
> _Emotional Intelligence_ asserts that the five main skills of emotional intelligence are _self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy_ , and _social skills._
> 
> **_Self-awareness_** is defined almost identically in both _Emotional Intelligence_ and _Primal Leadership_ ; however, the former notes that one of the keys to being self-aware is having an emotional vocabulary—knowing that the emotion “love” could be caused by feelings of acceptance or trust, or that the emotion “shame” could be due to guilt or humiliation. This emotional vocabulary helps you understand _why_ you’re feeling certain emotions.
> 
> **_Self-regulation_** is what Goleman calls **_self-management_** in _Primal Leadership_ , but in _Emotional Intelligence_ , Goleman adds that we should take particular care to manage our anger, anxiety, and sadness. If we don’t manage these emotions, they’re more likely to become common occurrences and negatively impact other parts of our lives.
> 
> In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Goleman defines **_motivation_** as being able to control your impulses, being hopeful, and being able to achieve a high state of focus while working toward goals. While _Emotional Intelligence_ lists motivation as one of its main skills, _Primal Leadership_ includes it, along with the associated skills of impulse control and hopefulness, as microskills of **_self-management._**
> 
> _Empathy_ is also only a microskill of **_social-awareness_** in _Primal Leadership_ , however, in _Emotional Intelligence_ , Goleman lists it as one of the five major EI skills. He defines **_empathy_** as the fundamental skill that allows us to understand others along with their wants and needs. He notes that empathy is especially important in “caring professions” like sales, management, and teaching—an argument he discusses in depth in _Primal Leadership._
> 
> **_Social skill_** is the final main EI skill in _Emotional Intelligence_ and is virtually the same as **_relationship management_** in _Primal Leadership._ In _Emotional Intelligence_ , he breaks _social skills_ down into four abilities: organizing groups, negotiating solutions, personal connection, and social analysis. These abilities closely align with the **_relationship management_** microskills of bringing people together as a team and resolving conflict, and the **_social awareness_** microskills of fostering an emotional climate and being able to read the politics, social networks, and power relationships of a group, respectively.

The authors explain that most good leaders possess _at least 6 total microskills_ and have _at least one microskill_ of each of the _four main skills_. However, if you lack one of the _four main skills_ , meaning you have no _microskills_ in that area, your leadership may be ineffective and lead to poor group performance.

#### Emotionally Intelligent Leaders Create Harmony

**Emotionally intelligent leaders are critical for group success because they create something the authors call _resonance—_** an atmosphere where members of the group are emotionally synchronized. **We’ll refer to this effect as _harmony_**. When a group has _harmony,_ they’re able to reach their maximum potential for collaboration, productivity, and performance—the vital components for success.

(Shortform note: Psychologists and behavioral scientists have proven time and again that groups that are emotionally in sync always outperform their counterparts who lack interpersonal relationships and open communication.)

**Leaders are able to influence their group’s emotional state because it’s human instinct to take emotional cues from the most authoritative person in the group**. So, the _leader’s_ emotions will impact how the _group_ feels and acts; therefore, success hinges on how emotionally intelligent the leader is.

(Shortform note: Experts call this phenomenon “emotional contagion.” Research shows that people's moods might be as easy to catch as their germs, and this is extremely common in groups because the attitude of the leader is likely to shape the attitudes of team members. For example, when the team captain is positive and motivational, the team is much more likely to win the game. But if the captain is discouraged, team members are more likely to lose hope and perform poorly.)

##### How EI Skills Create Harmony

**EI leaders create harmony by using the _four main skills_ of EI to set the emotional tone of the group.**

If the leader is (1) _self-aware_ and can (2) _manage her own emotions_ , she’ll be able to remain positive in the face of uncertainty, empowering her group to do the same. If the leader is (3) _socially aware_ , she’ll be able to (4) _effectively manage her relationship_ with the collective group and with individual members—she’ll use empathy to read the emotions of the group and choose the most effective response to handle the situation based on their needs.

So when the leader possesses all four EI skills, she’s able to accurately read and respond to any situation, which allows her to create and maintain emotional _harmony_.

> **Communication Skills Improve Leadership Abilities**
> 
> Experts argue that effective leadership depends on good communication skills, meaning _emotional regulation, emotional_ and _social expressiveness, emotional sensitivity, social sensitivity,_ and _social control._ These correspond closely to the skills and microskills the _Primal Leadership_ authors refer to as _emotional intelligence_ :
> 
>   * **_Emotional regulation_** is the ability to control your emotions and impulses, a microskill of _self-management_.
> 
>   * **_Emotional_** and **_social expressiveness_** is the ability to emphasize emotions in your communication, allowing you to motivate and influence others. This skill closely aligns with the _self-awareness_ microskill of understanding your emotions, the _social awareness_ microskill of being able to foster an emotional climate, and the _relationship management_ microskill of being able to influence others.
> 
>   * **_Emotional sensitivity_** is ultimately what the authors refer to as the _social awareness_ microskill of having empathy—you’re able to accurately read and understand people’s emotions so you can properly respond.
> 
>   * **_Social sensitivity_** refers to the _social awareness_ microskill of being able to read the politics, social networks, and power relationships of a group.
> 
>   * **_Social control_** refers to the _social awareness_ of microskills of understanding when change is necessary and how to start it, the ability to resolve conflict, and being able to bring people together as a team.
> 
> 

> 
> Ultimately, expert opinions and the argument made by the authors of _Primal Leadership_ closely align and support one another. Someone who possesses the communication skills outlined above would be an emotionally intelligent leader, and someone who possesses EI skills would be a good communicator.

#### Non-Emotionally Intelligent Leaders Create Discord

The authors explain that when a leader lacks EI, she creates what they label group _dissonance,_ meaning group members are conflicted on how to act and feel, which leads to negativity and poor performance. We’ll call this effect _discord.****_ A leader who lacks _even one_ of the four main EI skills can create discord:

**If a leader lacks _self-awareness_ , she’s unable to understand her emotions and what caused them, making her unlikely to _manage_ them well.** Consequently, she’s likely to express herself ineffectively and unintentionally spread negativity to the rest of the group. If this kind of leader feels stressed, defeated, or disappointed, she’s likely to express these emotions through her words, actions, and body language. This will create conflict in the group on how to feel and act, decreasing productivity and motivation.

**If the leader lacks _social awareness,_ she won’t be able to effectively _manage her relationships_** —she’ll have difficulty understanding the emotions of group members and is likely to read situations wrong and act ineffectively. For example, if this leader notices that her group isn’t meeting company goals due to a lack of motivation, she might approach the group with a demanding attitude, telling people to work harder. This will make the group feel resentful, misunderstood, and even less motivated to complete the task.

> **Discordant Leadership Causes Toxic Followership**
> 
> The authors of _Primal Leadership_ argue that leaders who lack EI create discord in groups. Group discord can lead to what experts call toxic followership, when group members exhibit unethical behavior, manipulation, and failure to acclimate to the team, eroding group cohesion and causing a lack of effectiveness, productivity, and success. Toxic followership happens as a result of prolonged states of group discord.
> 
> However, experts explain that the leader is not the only one who can spread the disease of toxic followership to the group. Often, the initiator of the spread may be a disgruntled employee who is seen by group members as the “cynic.” To prevent anyone from becoming a cynic in the first place, experts recommend fostering a positive climate by using the EI skills discussed by the authors. However, if a cynic does arise, you can handle this person by interjecting when they speak to redirect the conversation to a more positive tone. For example, if the cynic says “that person doesn’t know what they’re talking about,” you can say “what I think they meant was…”

### Part 2: How to Create Group Harmony

**The authors explain that there are six primary _leadership styles_ that can create group harmony: visionary, coaching, collaborative, poll-taking, standard-setting, and authoritarian. **Most effective leaders use many of these six styles on any given day or week, applying the style that’ll be most effective based on the situation, people, and emotions involved.

To effectively use each of these styles, it’s important to exhibit the microskills they’re based on—if you lack the necessary microskills, you might end up creating discord rather than harmony. For example, if you try to create harmony with the visionary style but lack the ability to inspire others, you're more likely to create discord.

> **Additional Leadership Styles**
> 
> While the six leadership styles discussed in _Primal Leadership_ are common, experts note that there are four additional styles that are prevalent in US work culture: laissez-faire, transformational, transactional, and bureaucratic. Laissez-faire leaders delegate many tasks to team members but provide little to no supervision. Transformational leaders focus on communication and motivation to achieve organizational goals. Transactional leaders are focused on mentorship and establishing rewards to achieve group success. Bureaucratic leaders designate tasks hierarchically and rely minimally on collaboration. Each of these styles can produce harmony in the appropriate context.

#### Visionary

**A visionary leader creates group harmony by motivating people to move toward a shared goal or dream**. A leader enacts this style __ by __ articulating the dreams and goals of the team but not specifying _how_ they’ll reach those goals. She inspires her team to move in the right direction while leaving room for them to develop their own way forward through innovation, creativity, and collaboration.

(Shortform note: Experts note that one of the downsides to relying on visionary-style leadership is that it’s possible to lose short-term focus. These leaders are often so focused on moving toward some future goal or dream that they can become distracted or unmotivated to complete goals or tasks that are more immediate. Consequently, the team may fall behind on deadlines or benchmarks.)

#### Coaching

**A coaching leader creates harmony by encouraging and helping individual employees reach their full potential.** A leader enacts this style by working with individuals to identify personal and career aspirations and to create a plan of action to achieve them. She motivates employees to complete difficult tasks and overcome challenges that may be hindering their progress.

> **Coaching During Covid**
> 
> Experts note that in our post-Covid world, the coaching leadership style is needed now more than ever. During these difficult times, we’re required to navigate losses, the challenges of working from home, and a decrease in social interactions. Many people lose their motivation as a result. The coaching leadership style is one of the most effective styles to deal with these obstacles, experts explain, because it creates motivation and momentum for employees by establishing exciting short- and long-term goals. So not only can employees feel a near-immediate sense of accomplishment, but they will also have goals to work towards in the future as well.

#### Collaborative

**The authors call this style _affiliative_ , and it creates harmony by building strong relationships among team members. **A leader enacts this style by forming interpersonal relationships with employees—by sharing emotions, providing support during hard times, and giving praise for jobs well done.

(Shortform note: This leadership style is widely discussed among business and management experts, and is also referred to as “people-first” or “servant” leadership. Experts explain that, in addition to the benefits discussed by the authors, servant leadership is beneficial to the community as well: These leaders aren’t _only_ concerned with the well-being of their employees, but the well-being of the community and environment as a whole. Experts add that in our present circumstances—the Covid pandemic and environmental crises due to global warming—these leaders are especially sought after and needed.)

#### Poll-Taking

**The authors call this style _democratic_ , and it creates harmony by involving group members in decision-making.** This style shows employees that the leader values their input and ensures that everyone’s on the same page about decisions. A leader enacts this style by laying out problems and solutions and asking her employees or stakeholders what they think the best option is.

(Shortform note: In _The Culture Map,_ Erin Meyer argues that leadership styles ultimately break down to two types: egalitarian and hierarchical. While the vast majority of leadership styles in the US, and included in this list, are hierarchical, poll-taking is uniquely egalitarian. This is the one leadership style addressed by the authors where both employees and leaders are treated as equals, having equal say in the decision-making process.)

#### Standard-Setting

**The authors call this style _pacesetting_ , and it’s used to create harmony by setting an example for employees to follow** which can help the group overcome challenges and accomplish exciting goals. In this style, a leader sets high standards for herself and her team, quickly identifies shortcomings, and demands perfection. Rather than giving employees specific guidelines, she expects them to simply watch and learn from her.

**This style creates harmony _only_ if the leader is able to _empathize with others_ , is _aware_ and _in control_ _of her emotions_ , and is _able to bring people together as a team_**. Without these microskills, standard-setting will create discord because it can make employees feel burnt out and confused about what exactly the leader wants from them.

(Shortform note: Experts explain standard-setting leadership can also create discord by eroding employees’ confidence. Not only will this decrease motivation and productivity, but it can also lessen an employee’s EI abilities—self-confidence is a microskill of self-awareness, so if you lack confidence your self-awareness will decrease. And according to the authors’ argument, your ability to self-manage is likely to decrease as well.)

#### Authoritarian

**The authors call this style _commanding_ , and it’s used to create harmony by providing strict direction in a critical or high-stress situation. **A leader enacts this style by giving orders and expecting immediate compliance without explaining her reasoning. She controls the situation very tightly, and if employees fail to follow orders, they are faced with threats or punishment.

**This style creates harmony _only if_ the leader is able to _empathize with others_ , and is _aware_ and _in control_ _of her emotions_**. Without these microskills, authoritarian leaders will create discord by making group members feel intimidated and putting them in a bad mood because of her demands and lack of empathy.

(Shortform note: Psychologists explain that an example of an extremely well-known authoritarian leader is Bill Gates. Gates built one of the most successful tech companies to date because of his authoritarian leadership, characterized by high demands and quick turnarounds. However, a number of employees have recently come out to describe him as demanding, impatient, unrelenting, and condescending, reporting that most employees were dissatisfied with his leadership because he created discord in the workplace.)

### Part 3: How to Increase Your Emotional Intelligence

**The authors explain that emotional intelligence is something anyone can learn as long as they’re motivated, committed, and put in solid effort.**

The most effective technique to learn EI is _self-directed learning_ , a model that allows individuals to develop personalized goals, learning plans, and measures of achievement. The model lays out five steps that individuals must go through to acquire a new skill—in this case, increased EI.

In the sections below, we’ll discuss each of the five steps and how to accomplish them.

> **The Flaws of Self-Directed Learning**
> 
> Self-directed learning is a recognized education method that has roots in Ancient Greek schooling, emphasizing a student’s self-directed planning and evaluation of their learning process. While the authors present self-directed learning as a sure-fire method to gain emotional intelligence, some management experts say it’s not so easy—despite the fact that self-directed learning is supposed to foster motivation and commitment, experts explain that the method isn’t always enough to keep busy bosses on track.
> 
> For example, if organizations encourage leaders to take on the self-directed learning process but then leave them to figure the rest out on their own, the stresses of work and home life may outweigh their desires to work on new skills in their downtime. To avoid this outcome, experts recommend that organizations support individuals throughout the learning process, answering questions and giving advice or direction, providing learning materials and libraries, and giving leaders opportunities for hands-on practice with their peers.

#### Step 1: Identify the Leader You Want to Be

**The first step in becoming an emotionally intelligent leader is to imagine the _ideal version_ of yourself as a leader—which microskills do you want to possess and which leadership styles do you want to excel at? **

To do this, the authors suggest imagining the leader you want to be in 10 years. Who’s around you? How do your followers feel about you and how do you feel about them? What's the environment and emotional climate like? How do your interactions create harmony?

Further, the authors warn against creating goals based on what _other people_ want or expect from you. Other people’s standards provide _extrinsic_ motivation (motivation driven by external rewards) rather than _intrinsic_(motivation driven by internal satisfaction), undermining the purpose of self-directed learning and making you less likely to succeed.

> **Visualization Can Help You Manifest Your Goals**
> 
> The authors explain that imagining the leader you want to be in 10 years will help you identify your learning goals. Many experts claim that this visualization process can go further and actually help you _manifest_ your goals as well. In other words, simply imagining yourself achieving your goals can bring them to fruition.
> 
> In _Think and Grow Rich_ ,__ Napoleon Hill argues that we can achieve any goal through visualization, or what he calls “autosuggestion.” To do this, imagine that you’re already in possession of your goal. Similar to the authors’ suggestion, Hill says to imagine who you’re with, how you feel, where you are, and how you’re interacting with people once you’ve accomplished your goal. Then, let this vision come to life in your head for a few minutes every day—imagine yourself conducting daily life as this person. The more you do this, the more you will become this person in real life.
> 
> Further, Hill says that for the visualization process to be effective, your goal must be an “all-consuming desire.” Like the authors, Hill explains that this desire must be your own, not someone else's, and you must fully dedicate yourself to achieving it.

#### Step 2: Identify Your Current Leadership Competencies

Once you’ve identified the leader you _want_ to be, you must examine the leader you _are_. Identify which of the main skills and microskills you rely on so you can identify the gaps between your _ideal_ and _current_ self—these are the areas you can improve.

**To discover your _current leadership,_ reflect on your strengths and weaknesses in the four main skills of EI: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management**.

Also consider which of the six leadership styles you rely on most frequently, and then examine which microskills they use. For example, a coaching leader relies on the ability to help people reach their goals and cultivate their abilities.

Finally, explore which leadership styles you lack and which microskills you need to improve on to master that style.

(Shortform note: In _Goals!_ ,__ Brian Tracy lays out a twelve-step process that will help you achieve any goal. One of these steps is to assess your starting point. Like the authors, he explains that before you can create a plan and get to work, you need to understand your strengths and weaknesses and where you’re starting from. Without this self-assessment, you may be unaware of the barriers that are hindering you from success and the areas you need to improve on.)

The authors warn, however, that **our self-analysis can often be inaccurate because our ego causes us to see a positively-skewed image of ourselves**. To overcome this distortion, they recommend seeking _negative_ feedback from people who know you well and who interact with you on a regular basis _._ Ask them to judge your microskills in each of the four main EI skills. You can make this an anonymous survey so no one fears retribution and can respond honestly.

> **Blind Spots Can Lead to an Inaccurate Self-Assessment**
> 
> In _Thanks for the Feedback_ , Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen add to the authors’ argument, explaining that one of the reasons people aren’t good at accurately self-assessing is because of our “blind spots”—behaviors that we see as unimportant or don’t notice but that other people see as disruptive or obvious. Consequently, receiving feedback from others is the most accurate way to self-assess.
> 
> For example, when we have an emotional reaction to a situation, it might seem much more intense to others than it does to us. Or, we may roll our eyes when we hear something we think is silly without realizing we’re doing it. While we think we might be very good at understanding and controlling our emotions and impulses, others might have a very different perspective because of the behaviors that exist in our blind spots.

#### Step 3: A Practical Plan for Improvement

**Now that you know what you need to improve on, you should create a _learning plan_ that’ll help you gain the skills and microskills you lack.**

The authors recommend that for your learning plan to be most effective, you should choose goals that align with your strengths and that are realistically achievable.

**The authors also say to create tasks that focus on learning rather than meeting benchmarks.** For example, a learning goal like “practice sharing an inspirational vision with a peer twice a week” will be more effective to improve inspirational competencies than a benchmark like “present an inspirational vision at the board meeting by next month.” Ultimately, focus on the learning process rather than the outcome.

> **SMART Goals, an Alternative Approach to the Learning Process**
> 
> Another popular strategy recommended by experts for creating achievable goals is the SMART method.
> 
>   * _S_ : Make your goals _specific_ —identify the specific microskills you want to improve on and what improving in these areas would look like.
> 
>   * _M_ : Make your goals _measurable_ —what does it look like when you’ve achieved your goal? For example, you could set a benchmark like “be able to sell my product to the board at the next meeting.”
> 
>   * _A_ : Make your goal _attainable_ —are you giving yourself ample time to complete your goal and do you have the resources necessary?
> 
>   * _R_ : make your goal _realistic_ —is this goal something you are motivated to achieve?
> 
>   * _T_ : make your goal _time-specific_ —when do you want to achieve your goal?
> 
> 

> 
> The SMART plan both supports and contradicts the authors’ suggestion. They both recommend making your goals specific (identifying the skills and microskill you need to work on), attainable, and realistic. However, the authors don’t address a time limit and disagree with “measurable” goals like benchmarks. Further, the authors recommend focusing on your strengths when designing your goals—for example, if you’re good at self-awareness but weak in relationship management, you might approach interactions with others with an attitude of being aware of their needs—while the SMART plan asks you to focus on your weakness when choosing goals.

#### Step 4: Develop New Habits

**Next, the authors recommend identifying areas in your life where you can regularly practice your new skills so they override your old habits.** To make this change, acknowledge your bad habit, consciously practice a skill to replace it, and use that new skill at every opportunity until it becomes an automatic response.

For example, if you realize you need to replace defensiveness with emotional self-management, you can commit to pausing before you respond to questions to make sure you fully understand the other person’s perspective and can formulate a genuine, non-hostile response.

**It’s necessary that you practice new EI skills because to override old habits and build new ones, your brain needs to create new neural pathways** , and these pathways can only be formed through repeated action.

(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins calls this process of rewiring our brains _neuro-associative conditioning_ , or NAC. He explains that there are six steps to successfully rewiring your brain: (1) identify your goal and what’s getting in the way, (2) create a sense of urgency to change, (3) disrupt your usual pattern, (4) create a positive pattern to replace the old one, (5) reinforce your new pattern, and (6) make sure your conditioning is successful. Ultimately, these are the same suggestions made by the authors but broken down into more descriptive steps.)

#### Step 5: Develop Supporting Relationships

While this is the last step, the authors recommend that you develop supporting relationships _throughout the learning process._ These relationships should be with people who’ll help and encourage you to accomplish your goals.

**The authors argue that these relationships are especially beneficial with a mentor or coach who has expertise in your field, can understand the barriers you face, and can give you feedback on your progress.** For a supporting relationship to be effective, they note you must trust the other person, feel safe disclosing personal information to them, and be able to be honest with them—the authors call these elements _trust_ , _psychological safety_ , and _candor_.

(Shortform note: The authors don’t go into much detail about what trust, psychological safety, and candor look like in a relationship. Experts provide a more complete picture: In supporting relationships, you and the other person feel comfortable asking each other for advice, follow each other's recommendations, respect each other, forgive each other for mistakes, and are usually involved in each other's personal development.)

### Part 4: How to Create an Emotionally Intelligent Group and Organization

**The authors explain that once a leader becomes emotionally intelligent, her next responsibility is to spread this emotional intelligence to her group and organization.**

First, leaders should focus on fostering EI competencies within their group. Then, they should look at the underlying norms that dictate how people think and behave in the organization and change them if they lack EI.

(Shortform note: Business and management experts second the author's argument, emphasizing that leaders are the foundation for organizational change. When leaders are emotionally intelligent, they will spread their EI skills to their group members. And because organizational culture is shaped by the actions and feelings of employees, this will work to change the organization’s culture. Ultimately, organizational change must start with leaders, move to groups, and then tackle the organization as a whole.)

#### Creating Emotionally Intelligent Groups

**The authors explain that to create an emotionally intelligent group, you first** **need to understand the current EI practices of the group**. **Then, you need to uncover the ideal vision for the group and formulate a plan for achievement.**

##### Step 1: Identify Current EI Competencies of the Group

To uncover the EI of your group, **examine how well each of your employees exhibits the EI microskills. Then, examine how prevalent these microskills are in group interactions.** Next, ask your employees to self-report their competency in each of the microskills, and then to report how well the group exhibits these competencies during interactions as a whole. When individuals or the group score low in a certain microskill, question employees about why they think that is.

**This investigation will uncover the norms of the team that dictate _how_ and _why_ they act so you can determine which microskills to work on**. For example, you might discover that a group norm is to interrupt others if someone thinks their idea is better, indicating you need to improve on group empathy and managing impulses and emotions.

(Shortform note: Experts second this approach to improving team EI. They explain that both individual attention and group work are necessary to bring groups together as a cohesive whole. Working only one-on-one with individuals will prevent group relationships that are needed for effective collaboration from forming, while only working with the collective group may leave individuals who need extra help behind, which can cause discord.)

##### Step 2: Identify the Ideal Vision of the Group and Create a Plan of Action

**Once you’ve uncovered the group reality, gather people's individual visions of _ideal_ emotionally intelligent interactions so you can create group goals and a plan of action to achieve them**. For example, if you want to foster support in place of the norm to interrupt others, set a standard that members must allow each other to finish speaking _and_ provide feedback before proposing other ideas. This shows self-awareness, self-management, and empathy for the people speaking.

> **Techniques to Explore EI**
> 
> Management specialists explain that two techniques you can practice with your group to enhance EI are role-playing and “storyboarding.” When role-playing, members take on others’ opinions and interaction styles which can help everyone in the group understand why that person may be acting the way they do. For example, someone’s passive-aggressive behavior might not be because they have a superiority complex, but because they feel inadequate in the situation.
> 
> Storyboarding is another technique that helps group members understand each other’s ideas—each member writes their ideas and feelings on a small poster. Both of these techniques are shown to improve trust and participation.

#### Creating an Emotionally Intelligent Organization

The authors explain that once you’ve created emotionally intelligent groups, you can move on to implement EI throughout the organization. **Emotionally intelligent organizations have a culture and set of norms that are founded on five components: truth, transparency, integrity, empathy, and healthy relationships.**

(Shortform note: Experts add that in addition to EI, organizations also need to have _balanced incentives or motivators, clear authority and decision makers, accurate and timely information, and clear organizational structure _to function properly. When these four components become misaligned, for example the _organizational structure_ becomes a power-hungry hierarchy because the _incentives_ are too money-focused, the organization can become what experts call a “passive-aggressive organization.” This type of organization is the antithesis of an emotionally intelligent organization. So, when creating new norms and culture based on EI, be aware of how these four factors may be impacting the organization’s culture.)

The authors note that changing an organization’s culture is hard, but they recommend a few steps to do so:

**1._Uncover the emotional and cultural reality of the organization_** by asking employees at all levels of the organization open-ended questions. These questions should explore what employees care about, like, and dislike in the organization, and what’s helping or hindering their success. Within their answers, shared language will emerge that’ll uncover the underlying feelings, complex norms, and overall culture of the organization—in other words, the emotional reality.

> **Interviews Provide More Accurate Data than Questionnaires**
> 
> Experts explain that interviews and open-ended questions are more effective than questionnaires at uncovering people's true thoughts, ideas, and feelings for a number of reasons.
> 
>   * **Interviewers can gather non-verbal data from employees**. For example, if the employee acts nervous after the interviewer asks a question, that will let her know that she might be discussing a sensitive topic.
> 
>   * **Interviewers can gather more precise data** because employees have the opportunity to clarify questions, and interviewers have the opportunity to follow up on answers that are too vague.
> 
>   * **Interviewers can adjust their questions in real-time.** When employees are interviewed in person, interviewers have more flexibility to go into depth on certain questions or ask additional questions that might help them gather more information. This is especially helpful when exploring a general topic like organizational culture.

**2._Uncover the ideal emotional and cultural climate of the organization_** by asking employees how they think the organization should incorporate the five components into daily functions and interactions. The shared language that emerges will generate goals and will motivate people to change by tapping into their hopes for the future.

(Shortform note: In _Crucial Accountability_ , the authors explain that getting people involved in finding solutions to problems, such as overcoming an organization's cultural barriers, is one of the best ways to accomplish your goals. This is because when employees are involved in coming up with goals or solutions, they’re more intrinsically motivated to actually see these goals accomplished. Further, organizational culture is created by how people in the organization act and feel—so if your employees are motivated to change, you’re almost guaranteed to achieve your cultural goals.)

**3._Bring the ideal culture to life by getting people—leaders and employees—emotionally involved_**. A great way to do this, the authors explain, is to bring people together to share a unique experience that highlights the new culture you want for the company. For example, you can bring employees together to watch an inspirational movie that illustrates the __ five components and have a discussion afterwards.

> **Strategies to Gain Emotional Buy-In**
> 
> Experts add to the authors’ advice on how to gain emotional buy-in from employees by laying out a number of recommendations:
> 
>   * Make the change real. Put visual reminders around workspaces so employees are constantly looking at the image they want to uphold, for example, positive quotes or posters.
> 
>   * Create a clear vision that you passionately share with employees—vividly and emotionally describe what you want the culture to become. This passionate speech will inspire employees.
> 
>   * Establish constant and open communication—regularly discuss with employees instances where they’ve excelled in the new standard and instances where improvement is necessary. Also, encourage employees to discuss their feelings—excitement, concern, doubt, and so on.
> 
> 


**4._Make these changes_ _sustainable_** by ensuring that emotionally intelligent leaders who uphold the five components are present at every level of the organization. Further, make the development of emotionally intelligent leaders and employees an ongoing process—continue training people in EI and hire people who are emotionally intelligent.

(Shortform note: Business and management experts agree with the authors that EI leaders are crucial for sustainable change, but add that diversity is another key component to making organizational change sustainable. When leaders are diverse in age, gender, personality, race, background, and so on, organizations have a higher potential to develop unique and creative solutions, making them better at handling obstacles and unexpected issues. A diverse range of leaders also will be more effective at managing and relating to diverse employees.)
