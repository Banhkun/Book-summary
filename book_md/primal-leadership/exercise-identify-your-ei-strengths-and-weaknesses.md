## Exercise: Identify Your EI Strengths and Weaknesses

To improve your emotional intelligence, identify the EI skills and microskills you rely on so that you can then identify your weak spots. One of the best ways to do this is to analyze which leadership styles you rely on: visionary, coaching, collaborative, poll-taking, standard-setting, or authoritarian.

* * *

Which of the six leadership styles do you typically use when managing your team?

When using these leadership styles, what microskills allow you to be effective?

Which of the six leadership styles do you rarely use or feel youâ€™re bad at (are unable to create harmony with)?

What microskills would you need to improve in order to get better at using those leadership styles?
