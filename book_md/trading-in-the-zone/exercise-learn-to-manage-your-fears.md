## Exercise: Learn to Manage Your Fears

Mitigating the influence of negative thoughts and emotions is key to becoming a consistently successful trader. Explore your fears and take away their power.

* * *

Describe your goal(s) for trading. Go beyond “making money” to see if there are other motivations lurking in the background (for example: proving something, being right, getting an emotional high, or impressing your colleagues).

What fears stem from those goals (for example: being wrong, looking bad, or missing out)?

When do those fears surface? See if you can identify any patterns in the circumstances that trigger your fears. (For example, you might uncover that you’re more fearful of posting a trade after you experience two or more consecutive losses.)

What techniques can you use to manage your fears going forward? (For example, you might focus on wins you’ve had in the past, get input from a friend, write down your negative thoughts, or recite a mantra like “Every loss brings me closer to a win.”)
