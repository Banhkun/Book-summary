## Chapter 2: The New Landscape of Processed Food

**Food processors, free of marketing restrictions and backed by the government, set out to make processed food the food of choice.** They modified any food they could. Labels such as low-fat, fat-free, cholesterol-free, high-fiber, low-fiber, and low-carb became the norm. Foods that once consisted of two- or three ingredients, such as mayonnaise and whipped cream, now had tumbling lists of additives.

If a nutrient once thought healthy was found to be otherwise, the food-like product was reengineered to reduce the bad and include the good. A new set of health claims was printed on new boxes. The public followed this advice until new evidence contradicted those claims. And because health claims couldn’t be printed on fruits and vegetables, healthy foods were often left in the dark.

In fact, the fate of real food in supermarkets is still dependent on what science dictates. If carrots are said to be healthy, people will buy them. If not, they won’t. **A new subgroup of food science has formed to exploit the benefits of certain whole foods based on a particular nutrient.** Walnuts, once deemed fatty, are now hailed for their omega-3 compounds. Pomegranates and blueberries are touted for their antioxidant properties. In fact, antioxidants are so popular now that the Mars Corporation is funding a scientist at the University of California, Davis, to study the antioxidant compounds in chocolate. In the near future, chocolate may be considered a healthy food because of those findings.

> **The Era of Atkins**
> 
> In 2003, the Atkins diet took over the world after cardiologist Robert Atkins claimed that carbohydrates made people fat and unhealthy. He pushed the consumption of proteins and fat to lose weight. This fad diet took over the world, and people everywhere stopped eating carbohydrates.
> 
> Bread and pasta manufacturers began to re-engineer their products to reduce carbs and increase protein. Low-carb breads and pastas flooded the market, some even stamped as “Atkin-friendly.” Unfortunately for vegetable and fruit farmers, there was no way to make a potato or banana low-carb. These foods became doomed under this fad.
> 
> Before 1973, a label of “imitation” would have been added to these breads and pastas. Without the label, these highly processed food-like products were consumed en masse.

### Rise of the Lipid Hypothesis

With so much emphasis put on nutrients for health, you’d expect to see the healthiest population in the world. This expectation suggests that the science and policies surrounding food are sound and unquestionable, which has rarely been true. In fact, **the most significant nutritionism movement of the last 30 years is based on conjecture and contributed to the current health epidemic—the lipid hypothesis.**

  * As a reminder, the lipid hypothesis states that fat and cholesterol, mostly from meat and dairy, lead to increased rates of heart disease. The evidence came from assumptions made about health and eating habits surrounding WWII. Scientists believed that meat and dairy rationing during the war related to low rates of heart disease. Likewise, rising rates after the war were linked to Americans resuming normal eating habits. This claim was supported by evidence of the low rates of CHD in other cultures that ate mostly plant-based diets. 



The advent of the lipid hypothesis severely altered the way we thought about what to eat and how to eat it. These behaviors diminished the culture surrounding food and the overall health of the population.

#### The Evidence, or A Lack Thereof

The research used to support the bye-in of the lipid hypothesis was small to none. In fact, **only a few studies ever found a positive correlation between saturated fats and cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD)**. A number of recent efforts have attempted to debunk the low-fat movement by questioning the validity of the research that led to the hypothesis.

**During the period in question, the trend in eating habits was moving toward healthier food choices, but health was trending toward increased CHD**. Consumers were actually eating fewer sources of animal fats, such as lard and tallow. Instead, margarine had grown in popularity, outselling butter for the first time in 1957. In general, consumption of animal proteins decreased after the war, from 84 pounds per person to 71 pounds between 1946 and 1976. In this same time period, the use of seed oils doubled.

One explanation for these confounding results may be an oversimplification of the relationship between CHD and meat and dairy during the war. Sugar and gas were also rationed, and eating habits were different. People ate less, in general, and fewer refined carbohydrates during the war. People ate more fish and got more exercise from walking due to a lack of gasoline. Finally, regarding the lower CHD rates in other cultures, it was entirely likely that those cultures had different customs surrounding food, ate fewer calories, and led different lifestyles that included more exercise.

Despite these variables, the finger staunchly pointed at fat as the culprit. A shift in perspective about food swept through the entire population. **People turned away from decades of traditional eating habits and toward science-guided standards.** **What followed was a diminished state of health for the American public.**

#### Fats and Health

The war waged against saturated fats dismissed some key aspects of the role of fat in the body. The brain is mostly fat, which is needed to protect the delicate cells and neurons. Fats are also the foundation of the body’s cellular walls. Different amounts of various fats help the body absorb vitamins and minerals on a cellular level.

But these concerns were not important to the booming food industry, who had much to gain from the lipid hypothesis. Once the hypothesis was embraced, all movement in the food industry became geared toward removing fats from food. Whatever nutrients or ingredients remained, such as refined sugar or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), were of little consequence.

What’s interesting is that **although Americans reduced their total calories from fat from 42% in 1977 to 34% in 1995, fats were still a major part of the American diet**. Saturated fats were removed, and polyunsaturated fat and trans fat took their place. Meat remained a strong staple in the diet. Now, the chunk of beef on the plate was replaced by a chunk of chicken breast with a hefty side of carbohydrates. These actions were justified by the guidelines to “eat more low-fat food.”

With free license to eat as much low-fat food as they wanted, people didn’t change the amount of food they consumed. They ate massive amounts of foods deemed “good” because of the nutrient value. You could now eat a whole box of low-fat cookies and call it healthy eating. Unfortunately, this thinking was based on a lie.

**As opposed to the lack of evidence linking saturated fat to heart disease, the evidence linking trans fat to heart disease is vast.** Trans fats were the alternative fat used in most low-fat foods. It’s hard to know how much trans fat was consumed before the 1990s, when scientists learned that the product they’d been pushing was almost twice as likely as saturated fat to cause heart disease. (Shortform example: If saturated fat is the equivalent of the common cold, trans fat is the bubonic plague.)

Trans fat negatively affects the body in the following ways:

  * It raises bad cholesterol and reduces good cholesterol.
  * It increases triglycerides, a risk factor for coronary heart disease.
  * It promotes inflammation and blood clotting.
  * It can lead to insulin resistance. 



Yet, no one in the health or science community has acknowledged or expressed regret for the error. If they did, the American public would know how wrong they were, and people would never trust their guidelines again.

### The Low-Fat Fiasco

All of the negative aspects of nutritionism might be worth it if people were actually getting healthier. **But all the focus on low-fat foods led to a fatter America.** Many believe that the current obesity and diabetes epidemics began in the 1970s with the rise of low-fat foods.

The promotion of carbs over fats muddied the important differences between complex and refined carbs. Refined carbs are believed to require more insulin to break down, which leads to a false sensation of hunger and overeating. The process also doesn’t allow fats to be broken down properly.

Also, the biggest point of justification for the low-fat diet—the decreased heart disease mortality rate since the 1960s—is misleading. The _New England Journal of Medicine_ conducted a 10-year study on coronary heart disease and found that rates were not actually reduced. The smaller number of people dying from this disease has more to do with advances in medicine than diet. In fact, the number of CHD-related hospital admissions has not decreased at all.
