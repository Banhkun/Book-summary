## Exercise: What Is Your Food Culture?

Food culture is about more than just what you eat, and understanding what makes up a food culture might provide a new perspective of your own habits.

* * *

Do you mostly eat three conventional meals a day, or do you eat more snacks and convenience meals? Why?

When you eat at home, do you cook or eat packaged meal replacements? Why is this your chosen behavior?

What is one thing you would like to change about your current eating habits?

What sort of benefit would eating meals with others add to your life?

If you had a garden, what would you grow? Why?
