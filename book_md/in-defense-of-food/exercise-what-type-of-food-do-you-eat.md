## Exercise: What Type of Food Do You Eat?

It can be hard to know what you’re eating simply by looking at the food. Distinguishing between real food and food-like substances requires knowledge and intention.

* * *

In your refrigerator, do you have at least two real food items? How do you know they’re real? What are they made of?

Name two food-like substances you currently own. What ingredients are you surprised to find listed?

What would your great-grandma say about the majority of the food you own?

What sections of the grocery store do you most gravitate toward? Why?
