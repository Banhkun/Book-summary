## 1-Page Summary

In _The Daily Laws_ , Robert Greene argues that we lead our lives guided by false beliefs: We believe that chasing money will make us happy, that others always have our best interests at heart, and that our flaws are smaller than other peoples’, among other things. However, because these beliefs _aren’t based in reality_ , they leave us miserable and unfulfilled. We one day discover that money hasn’t made us happy, that our colleague has swiped the promotion from us, and that our flaws are more significant than we thought.

Greene elaborates that in the past, humans needed to be acutely attuned to their surroundings—in other words, to their _reality_ —to survive. Lose yourself in a daydream for a moment, and you could be a bear’s lunch. However, since we’ve conquered our environment and eliminated immediate threats to our well-being, so, too, have we eliminated our attunement to reality. This has made us prone to delusions and fantasies and susceptible to the false beliefs outlined above. Greene’s message is that **to lead a meaningful and fulfilled life, we must reconnect with reality** , and he provides advice on how to do so.

Robert Greene is the author of six internationally best-selling books such as _The 48 Laws of Power_ , _The Laws of Human Nature_ , and _Mastery_. Although Greene has no formal education in psychology, _The Daily Laws_ is based on 25 years of research on power, mastery, and human nature and compiles core maxims from five of his other books.

In _The Daily Laws_ , Greene provides a lesson for each day of the year on how to be more in tune with reality. In this guide, we’ll first describe how and why many of us develop incorrect perceptions of reality. Then, we’ll explore Greene’s lessons on how to see and live with clarity in three parts:

  * In Part 1, we’ll discuss how you can break free from false notions of success and happiness by identifying your unique life purpose and pursuing mastery in your field.
  * In Part 2, we’ll explore truths about human nature and how you can take control of your life by applying Greene’s strategies of power, seduction, and persuasion.
  * In Part 3, we’ll show how you can live a fulfilling life anchored in reality by learning to manage your emotions and developing rationality.



We’ll compare Greene’s insights with those found in other books, such as Scott Young’s _Ultralearning_ and Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations_ , and we’ll provide actionable suggestions on how you can apply his lessons to your life.

### Drop False Beliefs and Reengage With Reality

According to Greene, **you can live a happier and more successful life by developing an honest and realistic perspective on the world.** He argues that many of us are disconnected from reality—we're guided by false assumptions of what's important. Society floods us with ideas of how to achieve happiness, such as by earning money or becoming socially popular. Additionally, we might believe that most people share our values and aren’t self-centered. These beliefs, Greene argues, aren’t realistic and often lead us to pursue things that don’t make us happy in the long term.

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson echoes Greene’s argument that we care too much about the wrong things, calling these false assumptions about what’s important _destructive values_. He says misplaced values are a major source of our unhappiness: Our cultural norms lead us to believe that happiness comes from avoiding problems, having a lot of material wealth, and being positive all the time. Manson argues that real happiness, however, is derived from overcoming challenges.)

### Part 1: Reconnect With Reality by Pursuing Your Unique Purpose

Greene writes that you can **reconnect with reality and live with more clarity by dedicating yourself to your unique purpose**. Your purpose is a task or skill that you’re _naturally_ drawn to do. When you dedicate yourself to your unique purpose, you’ll free yourself from unimportant distractions and find a direction in life that will bring you true happiness.

(Shortform note: In _Flow_ , Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that there are four stages to developing your life’s purpose. The first step in pursuing your unique purpose is to meet your basic needs of survival. Second, Csikszentmihalyi encourages you to seek communities, whether it’s making meaningful connections with your family or a local club. In the third stage, you can begin to differentiate yourself and focus on identifying your personal values and strengths. Finally, Csikszentmihalyi suggests you return your focus to your communities and how you can contribute value with your unique abilities.)

#### Discover Your Unique Purpose

So what is your life purpose? Greene says that **chances are, you already know it—deep down you’ve always liked certain things more than others.** Some of us devote ourselves to art while others tinker with mathematical puzzles because these activities naturally energize and excite us. Greene argues that when you learn to shape your unique interests into a life purpose, you can make your greatest personal impact in the world.

(Shortform note: In _Minimalism, _Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus argue that there are four main obstacles that prevent us from discovering and pursuing our life’s purpose: our sense of identity, status, money, and need for certainty. You might value one of these so much that it gets in the way of pursuing your true calling. For example, you might associate your identity with your current job or fear losing the status of your current position. You might struggle with these obstacles because of the false beliefs about success and happiness, which Greene describes.)

To develop your unique purpose, Greene offers three suggestions:

**1\. Reflect on your childhood passions.** As children, we weren’t driven by external concerns such as reputation or financial status. Consider asking your parents, grandparents, or former neighbors about what you loved to do as a kid. Likely, you’ll realize that some of your childhood passions still resonate with you today.

(Shortform note: In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield explains why we pursue our authentic desires as children: Our wants were simpler and easier to get. For example, we might want to play with a toy or eat our favorite snack. However, as adults, we want more complex things, so, for simplicity’s sake, we sometimes default to saying that we don’t have a preference when we really do. To rediscover your genuine wants, Canfield suggests you practice recognizing your personal preferences in every situation, no matter how inconsequential it seems. For instance, when deciding whether to meet a friend for lunch or dinner, you might be tempted to say that you don’t have a preference. However, force yourself to determine which one you prefer and state it.)

**2\. Identify what makes you different.** Beyond your childhood passions, consider all of the ways you’re unique—your personality, experiences, desires, and tastes. According to Greene, these traits are valuable simply because no one else has them.

(Shortform note: While it’s important to discover your unique interests and strengths, other experts point out that it’s more valuable to choose a path and take action. In _The Defining Decade_ , Meg Jay says focusing too much on being unique can hold you back if you try to do everything unconventionally and refuse to try things that don’t align with your personal interests. Instead, she suggests you prioritize taking action and committing to a path, trusting that you’ll find ways to express your individuality no matter what you do.)

**3\. Develop your unique beliefs**. Greene urges you to form values and opinions that aren’t influenced by others. When you’re clear on what you care about, you won’t confuse the pursuits _you’re_ passionate about with those society deems valuable. To commit to your beliefs, Greene advises you to deliberately rebel against any _false_ beliefs that hold you back. For example, if you have a strong desire to be liked, take pride in defying that desire and embracing your individuality.

(Shortform note: When you identify your _true_ beliefs, you can reach what Gay Hendricks calls the _zone of genius_ —the highest level of happiness and achievement. In _The Big Leap_ , Hendricks explains that chasing society’s standards of success can make you _look_ successful and trick you into feeling comfortable. However, you’ll end up feeling unfulfilled. Hendricks writes that when you get a clear idea of your truly unique values, as Greene suggests, you can enter your genius zone, reach your fullest potential, and achieve maximum happiness. Rebelling against false beliefs might be a way to gain such a clear idea of what you truly value.)

#### Pursue Mastery

With your purpose to guide you, Greene says that to make a successful impact in your field and produce innovative and quality work, you must **pursue mastery—a process of learning and exploration to deeply understand your field.** The path doesn’t have an end but instead requires a lifelong commitment to expanding your knowledge and skills. Throughout history, many famous innovators, whether they engineered scientific breakthroughs or composed revolutionary musical pieces, went through the same process.

(Shortform note: To progress toward mastery and achievement, other experts argue that you must develop a growth mindset. In _Mindset_ , Carol S. Dweck says there are two types of mindsets—fixed and growth. If you have a fixed mindset, you believe your abilities are determined at birth and you can’t improve them. Conversely, if you have a growth mindset, you believe you’re able to improve with hard work and effort, which can help you succeed on your journey to mastery. To develop a growth mindset, Dweck advises that you practice viewing achievements as products of effort and hard work rather than natural talent.)

##### Phase 1: Devote Yourself to Learning

Greene explains that **the journey to mastery begins with a fundamental phase of intense and self-directed learning**. Whether you’re an aspiring novelist or dressmaker, you must first devote yourself to learning the practical skills and knowledge necessary to become proficient in your work. According to Greene, this learning stage often takes five to 10 years.

Greene offers four suggestions on how to approach your learning:

**1\. Make learning your primary goal.** Since the learning phase is fundamental to mastery, Greene recommends you prioritize learning above other concerns like money, prestige, or pride. To do this, be curious about the journey itself and not just the destination.

**2\. Find a mentor.** According to Greene, training under a mentor is the most effective way to develop your skills. A good mentor can provide you with the right challenges, strategies, and feedback for rapid improvement. Since mentors are often busy, Greene suggests you think of how you can offer value to them in return. When you train under a mentor, however, be careful not to limit yourself to their methods or ideas, but rather, adapt them to your own learning style and taste.

**3\. Practice by doing.** Greene explains that people learn best through hands-on learning techniques and repetition rather than through books or courses. This is because the more you practice a skill, the less brain power it takes to perform it—the skill becomes more automatic. Greene says that everything has a learning curve, and the more you practice a skill, the more effortless and enjoyable it becomes.

**4\. Expand your skills.** Greene recommends embracing every opportunity to add skills, tackle new challenges, and work on your weaknesses. To reach a level of mastery, explore not just the necessary information to reach your life purpose, but as many related skills and knowledge as you can. This approach allows you to view your work from new angles.

> **The Fundamentals of Mastery and the Ultralearning Model**
> 
> In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young builds on Greene’s suggestions with additional practical advice. Young defines _ultralearning_ as self-directed study that involves strategic skill-building and intense focus. He provides additional suggestions on how you can effectively build the skills needed to achieve mastery.
> 
> **Learn to learn:** Like Greene, Young advises being curious about the journey of learning itself: To do so, consider your motivation for learning and the information or skills you’ll need before you start the process. Both Greene and Young argue that when you prioritize learning over other things, you’ll gain and improve your knowledge and skills most effectively. Young also echoes Greene’s suggestion of learning from others, since modeling your own strategies on their methods can help you make fast progress.
> 
> **Focus:** Greene doesn’t directly address how to focus and deal with distractions, but Young argues that effective learning requires deep focus. He advises you to combat procrastination and distractions by setting timers and doing work in environments that improve your focus.
> 
> **Practice direct learning:** Young also echoes Greene’s argument that hands-on practice is an important part of the learning process, referring to it as _directness_. He writes that you can practice your skills directly by creating projects, putting yourself in simulated or real-life scenarios, and setting ambitious goals that put your skills to the test.
> 
> **Diversify skills:** Like Greene, Young suggests you continue building skills, adding that you should work on your weaknesses—skills you’re not naturally good at. He also recommends practicing unrelated skills to improve your efficiency and creativity. Mastering diverse skills gives you an advantage over your competition since you’ll be able to come up with unique ideas.

##### Phase 2: Experiment and Apply Your Personal Style

After your learning phase, you have the foundational skills and knowledge necessary to **experiment with techniques and apply your personal style to create valuable and unique work.** Greene says you’ll know you’ve reached this stage when the basics of your craft feel intuitive—you’ve internalized the ins and outs of your field. Rather than stumbling over technical mistakes and beginner struggles, your mind is free to experiment and innovate. He offers two suggestions to help you create a masterful work.

(Shortform note: In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young argues that experimentation is crucial to moving beyond basic proficiency and creating original, masterful work. When you’re a beginner, you learn through the examples of others. Experts, however, have their personal styles and techniques that can only be formed by experimentation. According to Young, you can experiment by copying the approaches of other experts, comparing two different approaches, practicing an unrelated skill, and trying things outside your comfort zone.)

**1\. Develop a flexible mind.** When you’ve become comfortable with your skill, it’s easy to grow complacent and get stuck in a traditional way of viewing things. This limits your creative ability, however. To avoid this, seek uncertainty, challenge your instinctive beliefs, and explore all angles of an idea or situation—consider not just what’s there but what’s missing.

(Shortform note: Another way to develop flexibility is by being _playful._ In _Big Magic_ , Elizabeth Gilbert writes that you should approach your creative work and process with a playful attitude. Like Greene, she warns against adhering too strictly to rules and principles, which blocks your receptivity to creative ideas. Instead, view obstacles with a light and fun attitude, which makes you more open to innovative solutions and makes the experience more enjoyable.)

**2\. Hone your concentration.** According to Greene, focus and patience allow you to produce quality work. If you rush the process, you detract from the potential of your work. Greene suggests you instead seek pleasure in the creation process itself—not in the completion of the project. When you feel frustrated or distracted, try meditating or taking a break to gain the necessary distance to refocus yourself.

(Shortform note: Focus is an integral part of what Cal Newport calls "deep work,” which is important, difficult, and fulfilling work that helps you learn new skills and create quality output. In _Deep Work_ , he explains that when you multitask, other tasks still linger in your mind, which prevents you from fully focusing on the one at hand. Newport recommends making deep work a habit by scheduling a regular time for it and setting up a space where you only engage in focused work.)

### Part 2: Control Your Reality Through Power, Persuasion, and Seduction

In addition to reconnecting with reality by pursuing your unique purpose, Greene contends you must adapt to the reality of power dynamics. According to Greene, **power dynamics play a role in all areas of life.** You must learn how to navigate them to get what you want and achieve success in both your personal and professional life.

Greene says we falsely believe others are kind-hearted and generally won’t deceive us for personal gain. However, the reality is that everyone seeks power to some degree, and people often resort to dishonest or manipulative tactics to get it. Greene advises you to accept that the “game” of power can’t be avoided and learn how to play it to your advantage. If you refuse to accept this reality, you risk being manipulated or sidelined.

(Shortform note: Psychologists define power as having more control over valuable resources—such as money, information, or status—than others, which allows you to be less dependent on them. How much power you have affects many aspects of your life: Studies have shown that people who feel powerful are more likely to experience positive moods, focus more on rewards (rather than threats), make quicker decisions, and act or express themselves more freely than people who feel powerless. The reason for this, psychologists explain, is that powerful people tend to view the world as less threatening and feel more comfortable presenting their authentic selves.)

#### Power Dynamics and Human Nature

To use power dynamics to your advantage, Greene says you must first **develop a realistic understanding of human nature: People are irrational and driven by emotions, including greed and envy.**

(Shortform note: In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss also notes the importance of understanding human irrationality, adding that people have two main emotional needs that guide many decisions: the need to feel secure and to feel in control. In line with Greene’s advice to be aware of what drives people, Voss recommends addressing emotions when negotiating with others rather than appealing to logic or rationality.)

In public, everyone wears a mask that hides unpleasant emotions and socially unacceptable behaviors like hatred to avoid disagreement or rejection. To gain power, use these truths about human nature to help you read the true emotions behind people’s masks and guide you in your social interactions.

(Shortform note: Malcolm Gladwell explains why we tend to naturally assume that people present themselves truthfully. In _Talking to Strangers_ , he argues that this assumption of _transparency_ is a social adaptation that allows people to communicate quickly with one another. Like Greene, Gladwell points out that always assuming transparency in others can be problematic, yet he asserts it’s a necessary approach when interacting with strangers. He argues that if we all distrusted every interaction, our social lives would be difficult to navigate.)

##### How to Read People

Greene writes that to read people’s true emotions,**you must develop empathy—the ability to see from another person’s perspective**. This allows you to view people more rationally, rather than through the filter of your own emotions, and to distinguish allies from rivals. To develop empathy, refrain from judging others immediately based on how they look or behave. Instead, accumulate concrete evidence to better understand people’s true feelings and intentions.

(Shortform note: Greene focuses on empathy as a tool for reading people, but empathizing with others is also key to building trust, which Evy Poumpouras argues is necessary if you want to influence others. In _Becoming Bulletproof_ , Poumpouras writes that interacting with others without empathy might lead them to be suspicious and defensive, which can make it harder to influence them.)

Greene offers three tips on how to read people:

**Tip 1: Past behaviors.** Greene says you should judge people based on their past actions rather than on their words or reputation because their words and reputation might make someone _appear_ kind or generous when they’re actually not. Past patterns of behavior, however, reflect the truth. For example, someone might say that they value generosity, but in the past, you’ve seen that they never tip at restaurants.

**Tip 2: Extreme behaviors.** People who are suppressing negative emotions or intentions often compensate by exaggerating the opposite behavior. For example, someone may appear overly friendly to mask their irritation. Greene says you can judge whether these behaviors are genuine by looking for subtle signals betraying their true feelings, such as an eye roll.

**Tip 3: Self-interest.** According to Greene, you can often judge a person’s real motives by reflecting on who benefits from a situation or event. To varying degrees, everyone is occupied with their own wants and needs, and if you detect that someone will benefit more than you will from an interaction, this might clue you in to possible underhanded intentions, which can help you avoid deception. For example, a common way people promote their own interests is by giving gifts to lower other people’s defenses and make them feel indebted to them.

> **Detecting Deception Through Verbal Cues**
> 
> Greene's strategies on what to look for to uncover people's hidden emotions and intentions focus on extreme behaviors and past situations. In _Becoming Bulletproof_ , Evy Poumpouras points out additional suggestions on how to understand others through the way they speak, as well as more evidence you can look for in the moment.
> 
> First, she recommends establishing a baseline of their behavior, or how they normally act. Then, when you interact with them, note unusual changes in their behavior or words. Look for multiple “red flags,” and keep these verbal cues in mind:
> 
> **Present tense** —While Greene advises relying on past behaviors rather than people’s words, Poumpouras points out that the way people _tell_ stories can be just as revealing. Since stories happened in the past, people should use the past tense when telling them. When people use the present tense, it might be a clue that they’re making up the story as they go.
> 
> **Overdramatic answers** —Greene contends that people exaggerate behaviors to cover up their true emotions. Similarly, Poumpouras says that deceptive people often exaggerate through their words as well, such as swearing on the life of a family member.
> 
> **Minimizing the importance of an issue or acting as if they’re in a hurry** —Poumpouras explains that people who are lying might brush off a subject or act as if you’re wasting their time. This might indicate they’re trying to end the conversation and avoid further questions. This cue might help you determine whether someone’s masking their self-interest, as Greene suggests, by omitting or brushing off any discussion about personal benefits.

##### How to Interact With People

To gain power, you must learn how to behave around people with different degrees of power. In many social situations, you’ll encounter people with more power than you and people who want to take power from you. Greene writes that you must **curry favor with your superiors and outwit your rivals to put yourself in good social standing.**

Praise and honor people who have higher authority than you. When you make them feel superior or subtly compliment them on what they care most about (such as their charitability or intelligence), they’ll naturally want to reward you. Greene cautions you never to overshadow your superiors or you’ll become a threat they’ll want to get rid of.

Greene suggests you convert your rivals into potential allies, if possible, so that they become useful to you. If you can’t do this, he says you must defeat enemies by studying them, targeting their core weaknesses, and undermining their reputations. However, since power dynamics are ever-changing, Greene cautions against ever letting your guard down, since your rivals might become more powerful in the future.

> **Additional Tips on How to Interact With Others**
> 
> In _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ , Dale Carnegie agrees with Greene’s advice to make people feel more important, elaborating on why this approach makes you more likable: You’re validating how important they already feel about themselves. To further boost other people’s feelings of superiority, give praise without asking for anything in return, publicly support their work, and listen to their unique struggles.
> 
> While Greene advises you turn rivals into allies when possible, he doesn’t provide deeper insights into how you can achieve this. Carnegie offers advice on how to communicate with people who disagree with you, which may help you get your rival on your side. He suggests you start the conversation by talking about something you both agree on before voicing your differing opinions, but let them speak first. Avoid directly refuting them or forcing your ideas upon them as you’ll only insult their pride and cause them to dislike you more.

#### Appearance and Power

In addition to paying attention to others, be mindful of how _you_ appear in social settings. To gain power, you must **adopt a suitable appearance based on the expectations of your current situation.** Greene explains that people make decisions about you based on how you present yourself, and learning to change how you behave, dress, and speak allows you to leave good impressions and achieve social success. For example, it’s more appropriate to wear a suit at an orchestral audition than a rock band audition. At the former, you’d want to act courteously. At the latter, you’d want to act more expressively.

(Shortform note: In _The Magic of Thinking Big_ , David J. Schwartz says that dressing your best not only commands more respect from others but also increases your own self-respect. He argues that before you can be powerful in the eyes of others, you must have high self-confidence. What you wear, Schwartz explains, affects how you view yourself. In each environment, he suggests you ask yourself whether you _look_ like someone important.)

While you’ll want to adjust your appearance depending on the situation, here are three of Greene’s strategies that will increase your control over _any_ situation:

##### Element 1: Reputation

According to Greene, you can control how others perceive you by**developing a strong** **reputation—a public image that people associate you with.** A strong reputation gives people the impression that you’re powerful, allowing you to influence and intimidate others. Greene suggests you base your reputation on a unique quality that you have, such as a quirky personality trait or style of dress. Then, build your reputation further by adopting universally positive traits such as humility, open-mindedness, and generosity. While appearing ordinary may be relatable, it won’t make you seem alluring or valuable. When you act special, people treat you as such.

(Shortform note: A different way to think about your reputation is as establishing a personal brand—the skills, images, and values that you want people to associate with you. Having a personal brand allows people to recognize your unique value, which helps you not only influence others, as Greene points out, but also attract more career opportunities. You can strengthen your personal brand by getting involved with projects that reflect your brand, finding like-minded people who can share your message, and creating or reposting content.)

##### Element 2: Independence

Greene argues that the more control you have over your emotions and choices, the more power you have. To maintain control, you must**stay independent and detached in your social interactions**. When you take things personally, you lose the ability to approach situations rationally and with control. Avoid taking sides, making commitments, and getting dragged into unnecessary conflicts—if someone you know is angry at someone else, stay calm and objective. Similarly, be careful when accepting gifts because they make you feel obligated to give something in return.

(Shortform note: One way you can stay out of other people’s drama is by setting boundaries, which involves clearly voicing your limits. In _Essentialism, _Greg McKeown writes that setting boundaries helps you gain respect in the long run and allows you to focus your energy on what truly matters to you.)

##### Element 3: Mystery

According to Greene, **a person of power maintains an element of mystery and unpredictability**. If you’re an open book, people can easily tell what you want and what your next move will be, which leaves you vulnerable and not in control. Greene suggests three methods to appear mysterious and unpredictable:

**Method 1: Say less and keep the meaning of your words as open to interpretation as possible.** This makes it harder for people to figure you out, which makes you both interesting and intimidating. If you talk too much, you risk revealing vulnerabilities or sounding foolish. In particular, avoid over-explaining your mistakes—by doing this, you only draw attention to them and make them seem more glaring. Instead, address them simply or ignore them completely.

(Shortform note: While being ambiguous with your language can lend you an air of mystery, be careful not to take it so far that you become irritating or come off as passive-aggressive. Experts argue that people often use indirect communication during conflicts to hint at their point without offending the other person. Instead, especially during conflicts, experts recommend you communicate your feelings clearly, as this gives others the chance to express their own perspectives and allows for productive solutions rather than repressed bitterness.)

**Method 2:** **Be absent from time to time.** When you’re always around, people start to take you for granted. Instead, take advantage of the law of scarcity: The less of something there is, the more coveted it becomes. Greene advises withdrawing occasionally to increase people’s desire to see you.

(Shortform note: In _Influence_ , Robert Cialdini explains that we value things with limited availability because scarcity often accurately reflects how valuable something is. When there’s less of something, we often assume it’s because there’s great demand for it. If you give people the impression that your time and company are in short supply, people will value your presence and prioritize you more. You can enhance this effect, Cialdini explains, by adding an element of competition: If you hint that another person is demanding your time, you’ll make others more eager to capture some of your time or attention.)

**Method 3: Be unpredictable.** Prevent people from understanding you by constantly shifting your behaviors, entertaining new perspectives, and acting against expectations. This way, people won’t be able to read your intentions and manipulate you. For instance, Greene says you should talk excessively about your secondary goals to distract people from your true goals.

(Shortform note: Although being unpredictable might throw off your opponents when making power plays, many relationship experts contend that being predictable helps form stronger and long-lasting relationships because it makes you seem more trustworthy. Acting unpredictably makes it harder to form intimate connections as people feel insecure and view you as unreliable.)

#### Seduction and Persuasion

According to Greene, the ability to seduce and persuade others is a crucial form of power that allows you to control people and get what you want out of your interactions. Rather than use intimidation or force, you can take advantage of their natural desires and charm them into falling under your influence. Three ways to seduce and persuade others are to make them lower their guard, play into their fantasies, and appeal to their emotions.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with Greene on the power of persuasion, elaborating that effective persuasion uses emotions rather than logic. Persuasion that targets emotions is so powerful because we tend to more readily agree with people who make us feel good or who present proposals that align with our values and opinions. For example, someone might be staunchly opposed to trying a popular drink just because a celebrity they dislike endorses it.)

##### Lower Their Guard

According to Greene, **to influence others, you must lower their guard by making yourself seem similar to them.** Try to mirror their values, tastes, and beliefs in your words and behaviors. This makes them feel validated and increases their sense of security, which helps them feel more comfortable and open to your ideas and suggestions.

To figure out what others like and value, encourage them to talk for most of your interaction. Greene explains that people are driven most by self-interest, so you won’t be persuasive if you focus on what _you_ personally value or need. Rather, frame the conversation around _their_ needs and interests _._

(Shortform note: In _How to Talk to Anyone_ , Leil Lowndes agrees with Greene on the importance of validating people, adding that people only want to engage with you if they think that you like them. To build trust and convey interest, Lowndes suggests using the pronouns “we,” “us,” and “our” to encourage a feeling of friendship.)

##### Cultivate Fantasy and Desire

**To persuade others, play to their fantasies** , Greene says**.** This makes you so likable and charming that people fall under your influence. He explains that everyone has an idea of how they’d like the world to be. When you present that fantasy to them, people are more likely to agree with what you say or do what you want.

(Shortform note: While, according to Greene, you must be a source of desire and fantasy in order to influence people, some experts argue that desire alone isn’t enough. In _Pitch Anything_ , Oren Klaff says that to capture someone’s attention, you must add an element of tension by creating stakes and consequences. He explains that desire causes a person’s brain to release a chemical that piques their interest, but tension generates another chemical that _maintains_ their interest. To generate tension, alternate between rejecting them and accepting them. However, Klaff cautions you not to overdo it as you’ll risk turning desire and tension into fear and anxiety.)

When appealing to other people’s fantasies, present yourself as the only person who can satisfy those fantasies. Identify something they're lacking in their life and show them how only you can fill that void. For example, if they want to feel capable, make it seem as though you’re the only person in their life who views them that way.

(Shortform note: In addition to appealing to someone’s fantasies, you can consider, more broadly, their worldview and create a narrative that matches that worldview. In _All Marketers Are Liars_ , Seth Godin defines a worldview as the beliefs, biases, and values that affect how someone sees themselves and the world and determines what will satisfy their needs. Similar to Greene’s strategy, Godin advises that you tell a story that fits their worldview. For example, if you know the other person is passionate about exercise, and you’re promoting a book you’ve written, you could emphasize how your appreciation of exercise inspired you to write it, which might subconsciously make you and your book seem more appealing to them.)

Another way to generate desire is to associate yourself with something forbidden or unfamiliar. Greene says that people want what they can’t have and secretly long to transgress barriers. Tempt your target with alluring words, but wait to deliver on them. Don’t make it seem like you’re trying to get something out of them—focus on cultivating desire through suspense.

(Shortform note: Psychologists refer to the tendency to desire things that are forbidden as the forbidden fruit effect. They offer several explanations for this effect: People are naturally motivated to reduce uncertainty, and they tend to assume that things are forbidden because they have a hidden value. Another reason, researchers argue, is that forbidden things linger in our memories longer—the more we try not to think about them, the harder it is _not_ to.)

##### Use Visuals and Appeal to Emotions

According to Greene,**you can persuade others more effectively by using images to create lasting emotional impressions.** Surround yourself with symbols and imagery that evoke positive feelings, whether you wear a bright piece of clothing or post exciting pictures on social media. When you associate yourself with positive visuals, people will view you more positively, allowing you to control what sort of impression they have of you. Greene explains that visuals are more powerful than words because people’s brains retain them longer. Similarly, people pay more attention to the emotions they feel when you talk than to the words you say.

(Shortform note: There’s scientific reasoning behind why emotions and visual images have a lasting impact on people. In _Brain Rules_ , John Medina explains that sight is our most dominant sense, with over half of our brain dedicated to understanding what we see. Not only do we pay more attention to visual information, but it also alters information perceived by our other senses. For example, you might think different-colored candies have different flavors when, in reality, they all have the same taste. According to Medina, we also pay attention to emotions more than to words for evolutionary reasons: Being alert to feelings like fear or attraction is crucial to survival because it helps us avoid danger and reproduce.)

You can further leave a positive impression by displaying positive emotions yourself. According to Greene, we’re highly sensitive to other people’s body language and are easily influenced by other people’s moods. If you treat the conversation as enjoyable and engage with your target deeply, they may naturally feel and do the same.

(Shortform note: You can influence other people’s emotions with your own because of the mirror neurons in our brains. In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor explains that these neurons detect the emotions and behaviors of others and activate as though you were feeling or behaving the same way. Additionally, some people’s emotions are more infectious than others’. According to Achor, if you’re more expressive or have stronger social connections with others, you can have an even stronger influence on the emotions of those you’re interacting with.)

### Part 3: Live Fully in Reality With a Rational Perspective

At this point, you’ve learned to clarify what truly matters to your life and navigate power dynamics. However, to live a happier and more fulfilling life, you must anchor yourself in the real world in the long term by developing your rationality—the ability to think clearly, see things as they are, and make decisions based on reality rather than emotions. Greene recommends three ways to be more rational.

#### Behave More Rationally

To view and approach your life more rationally, first **learn to control your emotions**. Greene explains that it takes more effort to think rationally than emotionally—emotions are strong and cause us to react quickly, preventing us from making rational decisions. The first step in controlling your emotions is to accept this truth of human nature. Because we are human, we all have flaws, inaccurate beliefs, and emotional compulsions, such as the desire to be liked or gain approval. When you acknowledge these tendencies, you gain the awareness and distance to better manage them.

(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins says that you can better control your emotions in the future by learning from them when they arise. To do this, put a name to your emotion but don’t judge it as good or bad. Instead, approach a negative emotion as if you’re investigating it—ask yourself whether you can learn anything from your experience, what beliefs might have caused you to feel that way, and what actions you can take to resolve your negative feelings. Robbins says that when you reflect on your emotions, you have a reference for how to handle similar situations in the future.)

Second, Greene recommends developing a stronger sense of self so that you’ll care less about what others think.**** Since we’re social creatures, we value the approval of others, which may cause us to feel insecure or anxious at work or around our friends. However, when you build your own standards of success instead of seeking approval, you’ll feel less emotionally attached to the opinions and expectations of others. Practice feeling genuine joy for the successes of others while building the discipline to work on and feel proud of your own skills.

Third, Greene advises learning to view situations as neither positive nor negative.**** He adds that situations are _naturally_ neutral—it’s your emotions that make them good or bad. With this in mind, don’t take things personally but instead treat difficult people or situations as curious puzzles to unravel or a learning experience. Try viewing them neutrally as you would a neutral object, such as a plant or building.

> **Your Self-Image Affects How You Interpret Situations**
> 
> In _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz refers to your sense of self as your _self-image_ and defines it as your thoughts about yourself and your past experiences. He explains that these thoughts don’t have to be true for them to affect you—you only need to _believe_ that they’re true, which is why you can fall prey to the false beliefs that Greene discusses. For example, you might think having a lot of friends reflects how likable you are, and this belief affects how you act and interpret other people’s words or actions. Like Greene, Maltz encourages you to develop a stronger sense of self (a positive self-image), and he suggests you do so by visualizing the person you want to be and recalling memories of your past successes.
> 
> Maltz also agrees with Greene’s suggestion to view situations neutrally, and he explains why it’s important to do so: Regularly thinking negative thoughts can become a harmful habit that causes you to misinterpret more and more situations negatively. Negative thoughts can become habits because the way you interpret situations affects how you act, which, in turn, _reinforces_ your preexisting interpretation. For example, if you think your colleagues dislike you, you might be distant and aloof, which makes it harder for them to connect with you and reinforces your belief that they dislike you. To combat this habit, Maltz suggests you question negative thoughts or feelings that pop up by considering whether there’s a more rational explanation or whether you might have misinterpreted the situation.

#### Elevate Your Perspective

According to Greene, to develop your rationality, you should **look at your life from a bird’s-eye view** —rise beyond the immediate present and consider things from a distance. Often, we get stuck in whatever’s happening and feel overwhelmed with emotions, choices, and false impressions that lead us to react irrationally and make bad decisions. When you elevate your perspective, you can more realistically assess your situation and better predict the consequences of your actions. To do this, Greene suggests you:

**Take a step back.** When we’re caught up in the moment, we tend to respond to things automatically and rigidly. Greene suggests you back away either physically or mentally—you could leave the room or pause before reacting.

**Embrace adaptability and opportunity.** To have an elevated perspective, you must acknowledge that nothing is stable or constant. When you’re aware of this, you’ll be able to plan ahead, be prepared for unexpected consequences, and make better decisions.

> **Elevate Your Perspective With Stoicism**
> 
> In many ways, Greene's suggestions to develop an elevated perspective go hand-in-hand with the ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism, which revolves around thinking and living rationally. In _Meditations_ , Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius defines what a healthy mind is according to Stoic philosophy: one that looks neither inward nor outward but merely observes the present moment. Let’s compare Greene’s advice with Stoic ideas on how to cultivate a healthy, rational mind:
> 
>   * **Disinterest** : Aurelius says that you should stop acting in your own self-interest and, instead, follow reason and intellect. Stoics emphasize that since every individual dies, the most reasonable way to live is for the good of _others_. To do this, always pause to observe your thoughts before expressing them. You can take this approach when stepping back from the moment, as Greene advises, and re-evaluate whether you’re approaching things rationally or through the lenses of your fears and desires.
> 
>   * **Cooperation** : The Stoics argue that you must embrace your fate and accept whatever comes your way. Aurelius’s arguments mirror Greene’s suggestions to remain flexible: A healthy mind is always calm and prepared. By being more accepting of whatever comes, you’ll find it easier to be calm when confronting challenges.

#### Embrace the Wonder of Reality

According to Greene, **when you recognize and appreciate how amazing life is, you gain a focused and rational outlook on the world.** In the modern world, distractions are everywhere, and it’s easy to worry about things that don’t really matter. Sometimes, eliminating these distractions is as simple as reminding yourself of the wonders that exist in your present reality.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle explains why it’s easy to lose ourselves in worry over pointless issues: We all have a voice inside our heads that’s constantly analyzing and commenting on our lives and the world around us. This voice, which Tolle refers to as _the ego_ , prevents us from seeing the world as it is and causes us to dwell on the past and the future. To reground yourself in the present reality, Tolle says you can practice focusing all of your attention on a mindless task, such as chopping carrots or folding your clothes.)

First, reconnect with your childhood sense of wonder. The world is full of wonder, such as nature or art. When we were children, we noticed this because we were small and vulnerable. As adults, we become preoccupied with distractions and responsibilities like social media and work deadlines. To reconnect with your sense of wonder, Greene recommends becoming an explorer: Visit childhood places, travel to natural places without technology, and study different cultures. When you reopen your eyes to the grand scale of life, you’ll renew your interest in life and experience more joy.

(Shortform note: Psychologists agree with Greene on the power of wonder and awe, adding that when you embrace awe, you can view the world more positively. They provide additional suggestions on how to pursue awe: Tune into your senses, take a break from technology, and spend time in nature. While seeking awe can help you reconnect with reality, research has shown that experiencing awe has additional benefits, such as reducing stress, encouraging generosity, and improving your overall well-being.)

Second, Greene argues that by becoming more aware of our mortality, we can live a life that is richer and more focused. He explains that many societies ignore the idea of death. This only makes us more anxious, however, as we’re left with a subconscious sense of time slipping away yet lose ourselves in daily distractions. Instead, Greene writes that you should accept that human life is impermanent. This awareness helps you focus on the present reality and what’s most important to you, allowing you to better appreciate your life, love the people around you, and feel motivated to achieve your life’s purpose.

(Shortform note: Reflecting on your mortality is a core element of Stoicism. In _Meditations_ , Marcus Aurelius says you should approach everything in your life with the awareness of death: Carry out every task as though it’s the last you’ll ever do. By approaching everything with this perspective, you’ll be more appreciative, focused, and deliberate in your actions than if you take it for granted. Additionally, being aware of your mortality gives you a sense of urgency that helps clarify what matters to you and allows you to live a focused and fulfilling life.)
