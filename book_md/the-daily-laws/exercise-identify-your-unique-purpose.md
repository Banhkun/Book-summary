## Exercise: Identify Your Unique Purpose

According to Greene, having a unique purpose allows you to reconnect with reality by directing you toward what truly matters. Reflect on your passions and interests to find your purpose.

* * *

Think back to your childhood. What natural interests did you have? Are you interested in the same things now?

Reflect on your personality traits, background, experiences, and personal tastes. How does the unique combination of these make you different from other people?

According to Greene, you should form and stick to your own values and beliefs to help clarify your life's purpose. List three to five beliefs you have that others might find unusual or even disagree with.

Based on your answers, what do you think your unique purpose is? How can you prioritize or pursue this purpose in your daily life?
