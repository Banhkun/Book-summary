## Part Four: Reflections

**O’Brien now reveals to us that much of the narrative we have been following is invented**. He did _not_ , for example, actually kill the young North Vietnamese soldier with the grenade. But he _did_ witness the young man’s death, and for O’Brien, **his presence, his witnessing, has been enough to trigger a lifetime of guilt and trauma.**

He reminds us that the narrative that makes up a story is often more true than a literal recounting of the events that _actually_ transpired. **He defines this as story-truth vs. happening-truth.** He notes that the story-truth (like the biography of the young Vietnamese soldier and how O’Brien lobbed the grenade at him as he passed by) brings the emotions of the war into the present in a way that happening-truth never could. _He might as well_ have killed the young man, because that is how he’s experienced the event for all these years—this is why he chooses to tell the story this way.

### Seeking Closure

**At the age of 43, O’Brien returns to Vietnam with his ten-year-old daughter, Kathleen**. He wishes to bring his war experience alive for his daughter by bringing her to the country that has defined so much of his life. While in Vietnam, Kathleen struggles to understand why the war happened and how her father came to be a part of it. He is unable to coherently explain to her either the political and ideological conflicts that created the conflict or the sequence of events that led to his personal decision to fight in it.

Eventually, O’Brien takes her to the setting of his most harrowing war experience—the field where Kiowa died.**** Both his daughter and the Vietnamese government interpreter who accompanies them are perplexed as to why he would choose to visit such a place. Kathleen almost immediately notices the stench of the field.

O’Brien notes how ordinary and mundane the field looks today, nothing like the filthy hellscape it was the night Kiowa died. It is hard to imagine that this place has loomed so large in his mind for all these years—**this field, after all, had killed his close friend, while transforming O’Brien himself into a different person than who he’d been before**. This field was the cornerstone of his Vietnam trauma, the place that embodied all the filth and terror of the war. Now, however, he sees it for what it really is: just a drab and unremarkable patch of dirt in a far-flung corner of rural Vietnam, obscure and unremarkable.

In what he hopes is a final act of closure, **O’Brien returns Kiowa’s moccasins to the field, letting them sink into the mud**. Although a gifted writer, words fail him in this instant. He is unable to come up with anything poignant or meaningful to say during this moment of remembrance. He simply says, “Well, there it is,” as he looks back at the field one last time. He feels that **he has been buried in that field ever since that terrible night, but that now, perhaps, he has finally found his way out.**

### Three Shots

O’Brien reflects on two separate occasions in which he was hit by gunfire in Vietnam. The first time was when Rat Kiley was still with the company. As a skilled medic, Kiley had been able to successfully apply a compress, stop the bleeding, and get O’Brien to an emergency evacuation helicopter. O’Brien even recalls Rat Kiley almost hugging him as he was being helped into the chopper. After a short hospital stay, O’Brien returned to the company in the field.

When he returned, however, he discovered that Kiley was no longer with the unit, having suffered his own gunshot wound and transferred to a hospital in Japan. What really happened, however, was much more disturbing. **Kiley had, in fact, suffered a mental breakdown, believing that the insects in the jungle were personally out to get him**. He had begun compulsively scratching himself, eventually covering himself in scabs and open sores. The strain of his job as a medic, having to constantly attend to the dead and dying, had finally pushed him past his limits. **In desperation, Kiley shot himself in the foot to get out of active combat duty** , although Cross told Kiley that he would present it as an accident to the military authorities.

He was replaced by a new medic named Bobby Jorgenson, who was young, inexperienced, and badly unprepared for when O’Brien was shot on a second occasion, this time in the buttocks. Jorgenson failed to treat for shock and did a shoddy job stitching the wound. As a result, O’Brien became infected and nearly succumbed to gangrene.

O’Brien recovered following a painful hospital stay, after which he was transferred out of active combat into a Headquarters Company battalion supply base. While still in a war zone, he was relatively safe from the day-to-day perils of warfare (although the compound still came under the occasional mortar fire). He recalls his old Alpha Company comrades coming in one week when they were on stand-down (a period of time when they were temporarily out of the field). O’Brien remembers how different he had already become from the rest of them. They were still combat soldiers, while he now felt like a civilian. He was no longer part of the blood fraternity.

### Revenge

In his new assignment, O’Brien had time to reflect on his experience of getting shot and came to hate Bobby Jorgenson for the incompetence which nearly led to his death. **He brooded over this and yearned to exact revenge on Jorgenson**. While Alpha Company was at the base, Jorgenson and O’Brien accidentally ran into one another. Jorgenson was embarrassed and tried to apologize to O’Brien, explaining that he had been paralyzed by fear when he saw that his fellow soldier had been shot and that it was up to _him_ to save his life. Jorgenson told O’Brien that he had been suffering from recurring nightmares and trauma thinking about what happened to O’Brien. But O’Brien was unable to move on—**his experience in the war and the things he’d seen had turned him into a crueler, meaner version of his former self. He was now capable of evil.**

O’Brien decided to psychologically torment Jorgenson and turned to the darkly cruel Azar for help. They chose a night when they knew Jorgenson had been selected to pull night guard duty as their moment to strike, **knowing how ghostly and terrifying nights in Vietnam could be, when one’s mind tended to run wild with the worst fears imaginable**. All of the potential horrors of war could be projected onto the blackness of the night. O’Brien and Azar knew that Jorgenson would be at his most psychologically vulnerable when he was alone in the dark.

They hid in the bushes outside the perimeter around the base and set up a series of homemade booby traps and noisemakers designed to make Jorgenson think that the Vietcong was attacking. They filled cans with ammunition and attached them to pulley ropes. When Azar and O’Brien tugged on the ropes, the cans would rattle in a way that completely unnerved Jorgenson. They did this on-and-off at irregular intervals, ratcheting up the psychological tension. Next, they set off trip flares to mimic the visual of an impending enemy attack.

While he was doing this, O’Brien imagined himself floating above Jorgenson, seeing the young man’s abject terror. In this moment, **O’Brien saw himself as the horror of the war embodied**. But at this point during the elaborate revenge scheme, O’Brien tells us that he began to feel some kinship with his victim. Jorgenson finally understood what it meant to be scared in war, how the fear robbed you of your humanity and sanity.

O’Brien asked Azar to stop, feeling that his need to psychologically balance the equation with Jorgenson had been met. But Azar was unable to stop, instead carrying the “prank” to more and more extreme lengths, firing off more flares and even tear gas grenades at Jorgenson. O’Brien himself was cowering in fear and shock and pleading with the sadistic Azar to stop. Jorgenson eventually fired back at the “enemy,” impressing O’Brien with how cool and collected he was. It is only at this moment that Jorgenson realized the whole ordeal was a prank. Azar left, disgusted with O’Brien, labelling him the “sorriest fuckin’ specimen I ever seen.”

### Linda

The last story O’Brien shares with us is one that predates his Vietnam experience. But he sees it as of a piece with what happened to him later in life, because like the stories of Ted Lavender, Curt Lemon, Kiowa, and the young Vietnamese soldier, it is a tale of loss. It is the story of his childhood girlfriend Linda, who died of a brain tumor when they were both nine years old.

**O’Brien describes his love for Linda as being as deep and rich as any love he later experienced as an adult**. He even took her out on a “double date” in 1956 with his parents. He remembers that evening, because she wore a bright red cap, which he’d never seen her wear before.

In the weeks after, he noticed that Linda was wearing the cap to school every day. She was bullied over it by some of her classmates, who thought it was funny to try and snatch it off her head while she wasn’t looking. O’Brien was dismayed to see this happening, but felt himself **unable to act on his convictions because of his pride and his wish to maintain his reputation** (just as he would years later when he ultimately decided to fight in Vietnam). He didn’t want to be seen as less tough or masculine because he was defending a _girl_. Looking back, O’Brien laments not having stepped in to do the right thing, and rejects his youth as an excuse. He notes that displaying moral courage in the fourth grade **would have made him better prepared to face the far harder moral choices in Vietnam.**

One day, a bully managed to knock Linda’s cap off during class, revealing her bald scalp beneath. Linda was sick with a brain tumor and had lost all her hair—she had been wearing the cap to cover it up. Later, O’Brien’s mother explained to him that Linda was terminally ill and would soon pass away from the tumor. Linda survived the school year and summer, but died during the September when O’Brien was entering the fifth grade. Foreshadowing **the callous and cold way death would be treated on the fields of Vietnam** , the same bully who humiliated Linda in class told O’Brien of her death by coming up to him during recess and telling him that Linda had “kicked the bucket.”

His experience with Linda was O’Brien’s first glimpse into the power of storytelling. After her death, he began to invent elaborate stories in which Linda was still alive. His dreams and his stories became his secret meeting place with his lost friend. He could bring Linda to life again by telling her story. He could make her real, make her smile and speak. In one of his dreams, the dead Linda likened herself to an old book on a library shelf that hadn’t been checked out for a long time. **All she could do was wait for someone to check her out—for someone to tell her story and bring her to life again.**

Even amid the brutality of the war, the men were always telling stories about the dead to make them seem more vivid and present. This was how the line between story-truth and happening-truth became blurred. **The more vivid the stories were, the more alive and of this world the dead seemed to be**. If they could tell stories about Curt Lemon trick-or-treating through a rural Vietnamese village or Ted Lavender being sedated on tranquilizers, it was almost as if they weren’t gone. **Like with Linda, storytelling brought the body and soul together.**
