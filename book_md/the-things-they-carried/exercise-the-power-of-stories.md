## Exercise: The Power of Stories

Think about why storytelling is so powerful.

* * *

O’Brien talks about the difference between story-truth and happening-truth. In a few sentences, explain what this means to you.

Why do you think that, for the war stories O’Brien and the others share, literal truth is less important than the emotional reaction it provokes in the listener?

The men in _The Things They Carried_ often behave and speak in shockingly brutal ways. Why do you think they do this and what does this say about the effects of combat on human beings?
