## Exercise: Consider Your Coping Mechanisms

Think about the tools and methods you use to handle stress in your life.

* * *

Have you ever been in a situation that caused high levels of emotional or physical distress? Describe it in a few sentences.

Did this stress or burden ever cause you to lash out at others or behave in other ways that you normally wouldnâ€™t? Describe this experience.

In the future, how can you develop better coping mechanisms to avoid behaving this way?
