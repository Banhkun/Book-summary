## Chapter 2: Myths About Vulnerability and Emotional Armor

There are many myths about vulnerability that lead people to put on “emotional armor” that prevents them from living authentically. **There are three primary myths that distort people’s perception of vulnerability:**

### Myth #1: “Vulnerability is a weakness, and I can’t show weakness because I’m a **____**.”

**Because vulnerability requires sharing shame and emotion, many associate it with weakness.** As a result, many believe that because they’re a certain gender or work a certain job, they can’t show vulnerability:

  * From a gender perspective, this is usually said by men because they believe that masculinity doesn’t align with vulnerability.
  * From a career perspective, this is usually said by people in high-stress or high-power positions such as lawyers, executives, or engineers.



Despite this popular belief, **vulnerability is _actually_ a sign of strength.** It requires more courage to share something intimate with someone not knowing how they’ll perceive you than staying silent and isolated because you’re afraid of what they may think of you.

### Myth #2: “I don’t need vulnerability because I can handle my shame in private.”

**Shame uses isolation to develop, making it nearly impossible to handle shame without vulnerability.** People often use this excuse because they’re afraid of rejection and believe this is the “safer” option. However, isolation is almost always more suffocating than sharing your emotional state with people that you trust.

For example, if you silently believe that you’re less intelligent than everyone around you, that will quickly put you into an unhealthy emotional place. However, if you share your insecurity with a close friend, they may find that your insecurity about your intelligence is all in your head.

### Myth #3: “I can build trust without vulnerability.”

**Trust requires vulnerability between two parties.** It is nearly impossible to trust another person if you have no concept of their motives, personality, or feelings. To develop trust, you have to be willing to be vulnerable. Sharing small moments of love, affection, or empathy will help develop a stronger bond with the people around you over time.

Note: Trust takes a long time to build, but only an instant to destroy. In terms of vulnerability, there are two primary causes of the destruction of trust:

  * Betrayal, or using someone’s vulnerability against them. 
  * Disengagement, or no longer showing interest in someone’s vulnerability.



### Emotional Armor

**With common misconceptions about vulnerability in mind, we often rely on “emotional armor,” or mental states that prevent vulnerability.** From childhood, most of us are taught that these behaviors will “protect” us from being emotionally damaged by other people. However, they only serve as barriers to wholehearted living. There are three major pieces of “emotional armor”: perfectionism, numbing through addiction, and foreboding joy. (We’ll cover “foreboding joy” in Chapter 3.)

#### Perfectionism

**Perfectionism is the belief that if you do everything perfectly, you can avoid shame.** It comes from the desire to be _perceived_ as perfect because, in a perfectionist’s mind, perfection prevents criticism, which leads to a lower sense of self-worth.

For example, if a perfectionist made a batch of cookies, and someone says, “Oh, these are a bit dry,” the perfectionist may feel as though they “failed,” leading to shame. This may lead them to spend more time on their next batch to avoid feeling shame.

**Authenticity can’t exist at the same time as perfectionism because “appearing perfect” requires that you mask your true emotions and feelings.** For example, a perfectionist would likely care more about _appearing_ calm and collected rather than actually _being_ calm and collected.

Perfectionism prevents vulnerability by forcing people to stay inside of their carefully constructed world out of fear of judgment. Ironically, this often makes perfectionists more judgmental towards other people. For example, if a perfectionist worked for 12 hours on outdoor Christmas decorations, they may scoff at the neighbor’s single inflatable Santa Claus in their front yard.

**Ultimately, perfectionism is a useless exercise because even the most “perfect” people are judged and criticized.** For example, beautiful celebrities have their appearances berated in tabloids and on social media regularly. Even if they’re as close to “perfect” as one can get, they’re still judged on a daily basis.

#### Numbing Through Addiction

**Addiction is compulsive and chronic behaviors used to numb emotions associated with shame.** While we often think of addiction in terms of alcohol and drug abuse, it can take many forms. It allows us to ignore our shame and keeps us disengaged from the people around us. For example, if you were addicted to social media, you might find yourself scrolling through Instagram instead of hanging out with your friends and family.

**These addictive tendencies occur because we regularly cross the line between “comforting” and “numbing” behaviors:**

  * Comforting behaviors are actions or activities that bring us joy in times of stress or hardship. 
  * Numbing behaviors are actions or activities that we rely on to ignore our problems. These behaviors are used to ignore hardship, allowing it to silently develop into shame. 



**Without careful moderation, comforting behaviors can morph into numbing behaviors.** For example, a piece of chocolate during a hard day can provide a moment of comfort while you try to turn your day around. However, if having a _single_ piece of chocolate becomes binge-eating a _bag_ of chocolates every night, it’s become a numbing behavior.

Unfortunately, there aren’t many resources available for “non-emergency” addictions outside of seeing a therapist. While you could go to rehab or AA for a drinking problem, where would you go if you were addicted to video games? While this may sound ridiculous, a man was once fired from his job because his video game addiction got out of hand.

#### Other Forms of Emotional Armor

##### “Kill or Be Killed” Mentality

**The “kill or be killed” mentality is the belief that you’re either fighting to be dominant or succumbing to someone else.** Trauma survivors and soldiers often fall into this binary way of seeing the world. While this mentality can be essential in survival situations, it is dangerous to utilize in everyday life as it prevents empathy.

For example, if someone bumps into you on the subway, this mentality may cause you to “assert your dominance” by screaming at the person. While the bump may have been accidental, the need to appear strong and dominating may cloud your judgment.

##### Avoiding Challenging or Confrontational Situations

**Often, people will invest time and energy in avoiding challenging or confrontational situations instead of dealing with them head-on.** This can lead to people-pleasing or suppressing emotion to avoid conflict. While it may be more comfortable in the moment, it doesn’t address the issues that led to the uncomfortable situation.

For example, if your boss is giving you feedback in a disrespectful manner, you may not say anything because you want to avoid getting into an argument. However, if you allow them to demean or diminish you, your silence may lead to shame.

##### Oversharing or Inappropriately Sharing

**Oversharing is _not_ vulnerability:**

  * Vulnerability consists of special moments of compassion connected by trust and relationships.
  * Oversharing consists of sharing copious amounts of information with people you haven’t built relationships with. 



**Oversharing causes people to become overwhelmed and push away from the oversharer.** For example, if someone you just met begins telling you about all of their childhood trauma, you may become uncomfortable and try to leave the conversation. Often, oversharers then use this rejection to validate a “no one cares” mentality.

##### Emotional Bombs

**Emotional bombs are unexpected, sudden drops of emotional information that are used in an effort to acquire validation or compassion while invalidating other people’s experiences.** These bombs are often accompanied by the belief, “You just don’t understand how bad things are for me.” They don’t factor in boundaries and are often used to test the “strength” of a relationship.

For example, you’re out with a group of friends when one of your friends mentions that her dog is sick and may pass away. You respond with, “Yeah? Well, my dad died a few months ago, so that’s nothing,” effectively silencing and invalidating your friend in the process. When people try to comfort you, you respond by saying, “You just don’t understand what I’m going through.”
