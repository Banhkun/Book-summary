## Introduction

**Many of us don’t want to discuss shame or vulnerability.** To deal with our problems, we want positive, straightforward “how-to” explanations that offer happiness, beauty, or joy that don’t require vulnerability. However, “how-to” explanations don’t work because they don’t address the causes of negative emotions.

**In fact, today, people are lonelier, more obese, and more addicted than ever before because they opt to distract or numb themselves rather than address their insecurities or shame.** For example, rather than dealing with the cause of their depression, many develop addictions to prescription drugs to “escape” their emotional trauma.

(Shortform note: _The Power of Vulnerability_ is presented over the course of six, hour-long lectures given by Brené Brown. For this summary, “Part 1” covers information from the first four lectures, while “Part 2” covers information from the final two lectures.)

Our tendency toward numbing behaviors is the result of scarcity culture. **Scarcity culture operates under the belief that we’re never “enough.”** For example, when things go wrong, we often tell ourselves we’re not wealthy enough, strong enough, or happy enough. This belief stems from three qualities:

  1. **Shame, or the internal belief that you are a bad or unexceptional person.** This destroys self-worth and leads to resentment. (We’ll take a closer look at shame in the next chapter.)
  2. **Comparison, or the devaluation of your life based upon the accomplishments or status of others.** This destroys genuine fulfillment and focuses your attention on what you _lack_ rather than what you _have_.
  3. **Disengagement, or the unwillingness to take risks or put yourself “out there” out of fear of judgment or failure.** This destroys ambition and prevents people from sharing their perspectives.



For example, if you were recently promoted, you may feel joy and satisfaction surrounding your accomplishment. However, if a good friend gets promoted to a higher position than yours or starts making more money than you do, your promotion may seem less valid (comparison), leading you to believe that you’re not good enough (shame). If this feeling continues for long enough, you may give up altogether, as you believe you’re never going to be as successful as you want to be (disengagement).

Scarcity culture rose to prominence after 9/11 and developed because of recurring societal trauma in the form of war, political dissonance, and economic hardship. These events led many to dissociate from their emotions and develop a need to be constantly exceptional to prove their worth, especially as the idea that everything could end or go wrong in an instant loomed over their heads.

**Fear drives modern culture, infecting everything from political campaigns to the college admission process.** For example, political candidates often offer dystopian views of the future under their opponent, stoking the fears of their base. Similarly, high school counselors often offer dystopian views of the future if students don’t get into the “best” college, stoking the fears of teenagers and their parents.

**Scarcity culture can be subverted by wholehearted living.** Wholehearted living is achieved by embracing vulnerability and accepting that you are worthy of love and belonging. Most people aren’t raised in a wholehearted way, leaving most to work toward the lifestyle on their own.

Because shame and scarcity culture have many ways of developing, wholehearted living requires constant reflection and self-care. Knowing yourself gives you insight, but taking care of yourself builds your self-worth.

### The Three Aspects of Wholehearted Living

There are three aspects to wholehearted living: love, belonging, and vulnerability.

#### Love

**Love is a deep connection that operates on respect, affection, and kindness.** It isn’t something that you can simply offer or receive, but it requires cultivation and growth over time. It occurs when you allow your most vulnerable self to be seen, developing a truthful relationship in the process.

You can only love someone else as much as you love yourself. If you don’t believe that you’re loveable, you will put up walls that will prevent others from developing sincere relationships with you. The root of self-loathing is shame, and, if you allow it to dictate your life, you won’t have the capacity to love or be loved.

**Love removes the pressure of adhering to cultural and societal demands.** It allows you to live your most authentic life with someone who values you for who you are, not who they expect you to be, removing shame in the process. With shame out of the equation, scarcity culture can’t survive because it no longer has a method of controlling your behavior.

> **Parenting and Self-Love**
> 
> Many parents argue that they don’t need to love themselves to love their children. **However, without self-love, it’s nearly impossible to interact with your children without passing your negative emotions on to them, especially during triggering events.**
> 
> For example, if you were bullied in school because you couldn’t afford designer clothes, you may tell your child to wear nicer clothing to “protect” them from the bullying you experienced. Instead of teaching them to have self-worth, you’re effectively telling them that people will only like them if they dress and act a certain way, paving the way for the development of shame.

#### Belonging

**Belonging is our intrinsic desire to be a part of something larger than ourselves.** Often, we try to change our behavior to fit in based on other people’s expectations. However, this behavior is unfulfilling and creates more barriers to _true_ belonging. It’s the result of fear and ties self-worth to acceptance by others, which can lead to shame.

For example, if you go to a party with the goal of “fitting in,” the success of your evening relies on the opinion of other people. If people don’t accept you, you may question what’s “wrong” with you, developing shame in the process.

**True belonging requires that you share your authentic self with the world to connect with other people, linking your sense of belonging to self-acceptance.** With self-acceptance, belonging comes from an authentic place and doesn’t tie your self-worth to the opinions of others.

For example, if you go to a party with the goal of “being authentic,” the success of your evening relies solely on your willingness to be vulnerable and honest. If people don’t accept you, you can still take pride in the fact that you accomplished your goal. Also, it may lead to the realization that these people aren’t the people for you.

#### Vulnerability

**Vulnerability is the willingness to show up and share your authentic self while knowing that you have no control over the outcome of your interactions.** Vulnerability removes defensiveness, promotes empathy, and bolsters creativity.

Both love and belonging require vulnerability because connection requires that you share your authentic self with others. Many associate vulnerability with weakness and push people away out of fear of rejection or ridicule. However, you can’t experience wholeheartedness without it.
