## Exercise: Embrace Calm and Stillness

In times of stress or crisis, embracing calm and stillness will help you find clarity and prevent anxiety from controlling your life.

* * *

Think of a time when a stressful incident or crisis caused your anxiety to take over. Describe the experience and how you reacted. (Think about tendencies toward over-functioning and under-functioning.)

With this experience in mind, how could you have introduced calm and stillness to prevent spiraling into your anxiety? (Think about breathing and asking questions.)

What mindfulness practices could you introduce into your routine? List several. (These could be daily, weekly, or monthly practices, from meditation to a self-care day.)
