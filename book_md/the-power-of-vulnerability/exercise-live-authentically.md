## Exercise: Live Authentically

Authentic living leads to better decision-making and a healthier lifestyle. To begin living authentically, let go of external expectations, and make choices based on what’s best for _you_.

Think of a time you agreed to do something that you didn’t want to do, only to regret the decision later. Describe the experience.

How could saying “no” have helped you in that situation?

Think of a time you wanted to do something but allowed shame to get in the way. Describe the experience.

With this in mind, what similar opportunities are coming up in the near future? How can you prevent shame from holding you back next time?
