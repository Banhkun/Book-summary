## 1-Page Summary

**Many of us don’t want to discuss shame or vulnerability.** To deal with our problems, we want positive, straightforward “how-to” explanations that allow us to avoid vulnerability and that offer happiness, beauty, or joy. However, “how-to” explanations don’t work because they don’t address the causes of negative emotions.

In fact, today, people are lonelier, more obese, and more addicted than ever before because **they opt to distract or numb themselves rather than address their insecurities or shame.** For example, rather than dealing with the cause of their depression, many develop addictions to prescription drugs to “escape” their emotional trauma.

### What Is Scarcity Culture?

Our tendency toward numbing behaviors is the result of scarcity culture. **Scarcity culture operates under the belief that we’re never “enough.”** For example, when things go wrong, we often tell ourselves we’re not wealthy enough, strong enough, or happy enough.

This fear drives modern culture, infecting everything from political campaigns to the college admission process. For example, political candidates often offer dystopian views of the future under their opponent, stoking the fears of their base. Similarly, high school counselors often offer dystopian views of the future if students don’t get into the “best” college, stoking the fears of teenagers and their parents.

### Wholehearted Living

**Scarcity culture can be subverted by wholehearted living.** You can achieve wholehearted living by embracing vulnerability and accepting that you are worthy of love and belonging. Most people aren’t raised in a wholehearted way, leaving most to work toward the lifestyle on their own.

Because shame and scarcity culture have many ways of developing, **wholehearted living requires constant reflection and self-care.** Knowing yourself gives you insight, but actively taking care of yourself builds your self-worth. There are three aspects to wholehearted living: love, belonging, and vulnerability.

#### Love

**Love is a deep connection that operates on respect, affection, and kindness.** It isn’t something that you can simply offer or receive, but requires cultivation and growth over time. You can only love someone else as much as you love yourself. If you don’t believe that you’re loveable, you will put up walls that will prevent others from developing sincere relationships with you.

#### Belonging

**Belonging is our intrinsic desire to be a part of something larger than ourselves.** Often, we try to change our behavior to fit in based on other people’s expectations. However, this behavior is unfulfilling and creates more barriers to _true_ belonging. True belonging requires that you share your authentic self with the world to connect with other people, linking your sense of belonging to self-acceptance.

#### Vulnerability

**Vulnerability is the willingness to show up and share your authentic self while knowing that you have no control over the outcome of your interactions.** Vulnerability removes defensiveness, promotes empathy, and bolsters creativity. Many associate vulnerability with weakness and push people away out of fear of rejection or ridicule. However, you can’t experience wholeheartedness without it.

### Shame and Empathy

**Shame is insecurity that attaches to self-identity and gets in the way of action or vulnerability.** It causes people to believe that they’re unworthy or unloveable. For example, if you feel shame about the way you look, and someone rejects you romantically, you may believe that you’re not “attractive enough,” diminishing your self-worth in the process.

Shame relies on people believing that their experience with insecurity is unrelatable, creating a sense of loneliness. **Though shame feels isolating, everyone experiences it** (with the exception of severe psychopaths). While no one _wants_ to share their insecurities, talking about shame is the only way to diminish its power because, once you know that you’re not alone, shame loses its leverage.

#### Common Sources of Shame

**Shame often develops in childhood and lingers throughout adulthood.** The roots of shame are often built at home or at school and are frequently a result of interactions with authority figures such as teachers or parents. For example, if a teacher calls a student “stupid” in front of the class for forgetting to put their name on their paper, that student may develop shame around their intelligence.

In addition to teachers and parents, negative interactions with siblings often cause shame. Siblings know each other’s triggers and often abuse that knowledge through name-calling, physical abuse, and other cruel practices. These may occur during fights and are usually outlets for unrelated anger.

##### Shame Triggers

**Shame triggers are topics that evoke emotional responses based on your insecurities.** These triggers are often developed in childhood but carry on into adulthood. For example, if you were raised to believe that laziness is unacceptable, you may view taking breaks or getting sick as unacceptable because they keep you from working. This may cause you to make unhealthy decisions and overwork yourself to avoid your shame.

#### Handling Shame

Unfortunately, shame is a part of life. There isn’t a way to eradicate it, but you can deal with it healthily:

**First, understand that self-worth has no prerequisites.** You don’t have to do anything to be “worthy” of love and belonging. If you feel you have to prove yourself, you’re allowing your shame to dictate your behavior.

**Second, when bad things happen, don’t allow them to dictate your self-worth.** Don’t allow your guilt or humiliation to turn into shame. Instead of saying, “I’m a bad person,” tell yourself, “I made a bad decision, and I’m working to fix it.”

**Third, accountability is important, but never at the cost of shaming.** This applies to how you treat yourself as well as how you treat others.

**Fourth, practice shame resilience.** Shame resilience is the ability to recognize and discuss shame. There are four keys to shame resilience:

  * **You’re willing to call shame, “shame.”** Don’t try to bury or brush off your feelings as that will only lead to them coming back stronger due to repression.
  * **You know what you're feeling ashamed about and you know what triggered it.** For example, you may feel insecure about your intelligence after someone gives you feedback on your work. 
  * **You can separate your reality from other people’s expectations.** For example, if you struggle with being perceived as weak, embrace that you can’t realistically live a healthy life while repressing your emotions to appear “strong.”
  * **You can reach out to people you trust and talk about your shame.** These should be people who have earned your trust and who can bear the weight of your story.



##### Empathy: The Antidote to Shame

**Empathy is the ability to see the world as others see it and understand another person’s feelings.** Shame can’t grow in an environment of empathy because understanding eradicates insecurity.

Empathy isn’t the default for most people because it can be challenging or uncomfortable. It requires setting your personal perspective or problems aside and meeting someone at their current emotional level. There are two key elements to empathy: perspective-taking and nonjudgmental understanding.

  * **Perspective-taking:** Perspective-taking is the ability to look at a situation from another person’s perspective instead of your own. Everyone has a “lens” through which they experience the world. To be empathetic, separate yourself from your personal “lens” and accept that someone else’s lens is just as important. 
  * **Nonjudgmental understanding:** Nonjudgmental understanding requires the setting aside of personal shame to prevent judgmental feelings or actions. To practice nonjudgmental understanding, share your vulnerability, give others your full attention, and be willing to meet people where they _are_ , not where you want __ them to _be_. 



### 10 Practices for Wholehearted Living

Wholehearted living requires active engagement and constant reflection. **There are 10 practices that you can use to begin living wholeheartedly.**

#### Practice #1: Live authentically by letting go of other people’s expectations.

**Authenticity is the process of accepting ourselves for who we _really_ are and abandoning the idea of who we think we’re _supposed_ to be. **By placing value on your _own_ needs and identity, authenticity helps develop your sense of self-worth.

To begin living authentically, consider the following tips:

  * **Be willing to say “no.”** If someone asks you to do something that you don’t want to do or don’t feel you can do without overwhelming yourself, say “no.” You may frustrate some people when you begin to do this, but agreeing to do something you don’t want to do builds the foundation for resentment. 
  * **Be willing to say “yes.”** Conversely, if you find a project or venture that you’re genuinely excited about, say “yes.” Often, the prospect of imperfection or ineptitude may keep you from diving in. However, if you allow fear to dictate your behavior, you’ll never be willing to try new things or engage with projects that excite you. 
  * **Develop a mantra.** Create a simple mantra based on an authenticity goal. Repeat this phrase to yourself before entering high-stress situations to remind you to practice authenticity. For example, if your goal is to accept that your needs are important enough to say “no” to things, you could say to yourself, “My needs outweigh others’ expectations.” 



#### Practice #2: Use self-compassion to combat perfectionism.

Perfectionism, or the overwhelming need to be “perfect” in everything, is a key cause of shame.**Self-compassion is the antidote to perfectionism because it allows you to learn from your mistakes without connecting them to your self-worth.** There are three aspects of self-compassion:

  1. **Self-kindness** , or the willingness to be kind to yourself when you make a mistake. For example, if you burn a plate of cookies that you were meaning to use for the PTA meeting, forgive yourself for the error instead of falling into shame. 
  2. **Critical awareness** , or the understanding that you are not the only person experiencing your struggle. For example, if you struggle with addiction, embrace the knowledge that others struggle with the same thing. This will prevent you from associating your addiction with your self-worth. 
  3. **Mindfulness** , or the practices that help you work through what you’re feeling and provide comfort. These practices could include meditation, self-care, or activities. For example, if you’ve had a hard day at work, a warm bath can help you calm down and give you a relaxed environment to feel your emotions without spiraling into shame.



#### Practice #3: Generate resilience through spirituality and congruent living.

**Resilience is your ability to recover from stress or trauma.** A high level of resilience means that you can recover quickly from trauma and move forward, while a low level of resilience means that you recover slowly or shut down in moments of extreme stress.

To develop high levels of resilience, practice the following:

**1\. Congruent living:** Take the time to relax and replenish your energy by practicing congruent living, or living life based on how you’re naturally built. Know what your body needs to recover, and find the time to engage with those practices. For example, if you know you need to take 45 minutes of alone time before bed to wind down, schedule that time into your day.

**2\. Spirituality:** Spirituality is the belief that all people are connected by something greater than themselves. This allows people to lift some of the burdens of life from their own shoulders, and give them to a higher power. This also creates purpose and perspective, generating empathy and drive in the process. (Note: Spirituality isn’t inherently linked to organized religion. Though some people may find their spirituality through religions such as Islam, Christianity, or Judaism, spirituality can also be a personal perspective.)

**3\. Healthy venting:** Venting is important. It lets you feel your emotions and allows you to express the severity of your current situation. When venting, you don’t have to lie about your feelings, even if they’re unpopular or uncomfortable. However, be sure to maintain some perspective when venting. Don’t compare your feelings or situation to others’ because you don’t know what other people are going through.

#### Practice #4: Avoid foreboding joy by practicing gratitude.

**Foreboding joy is the feeling of apprehension that develops when things are going well.** For example, if you have kids, and you go out with your significant other for the night, foreboding joy would be spending the entire date night worrying about your children with the babysitter instead of enjoying your time with your partner.

However, foreboding joy doesn’t accomplish anything. No amount of preparation can lessen the impact of tragedy or disappointment, meaning that apprehension squanders positive emotions without providing any benefit. Don’t sacrifice your joy in the moment to fear for an unknown eventuality you have no control over.

With this in mind, how do the most joyful people avoid succumbing to fear? **They practice gratitude.** Gratitude doesn’t happen on its own. It requires attention and engagement. A few methods to practice gratitude include keeping a gratitude journal, talking about your gratitude with others, and finding joy in the “mundane.”

#### Practice #5: Listen to your intuition by embracing uncertainty.

**Intuition is personal insight commonly described as a “gut instinct.”** This feeling develops through experience and helps shape your perspective on the world. Intuition is directly tied to authenticity as it represents your subconscious response to the world around you.

To start listening to your intuition, **you must first accept that certainty isn’t real.** The world is constantly changing, and no one can predict the future. Learning to sit with the uncertainty and allowing your instincts to guide your decision-making process often leads to clarity and fulfillment.

**Faith is an important aspect of embracing uncertainty.** It gives you the courage to walk into the unknown while believing in something greater than yourself. Similar to spirituality, faith _doesn’t_ have to be associated with religion. While it may be the source of faith for others, you can have faith without having to subscribe to organized religion.

#### Practice #6: Rediscover creativity and abandon comparison.

**Creativity is essential to wholehearted living, acting as an outlet for emotional expression and a generator for innovation.** Many scoff at art, calling it self-indulgent or childish. However, unused creativity often transforms into pent-up, negative emotions such as guilt, rage, or judgment.

Everyone has the capacity to be creative. However, many people experience shame surrounding art at a young age, leading them to abandon their creative pursuits early on. In fact, because art requires immense vulnerability—often in a public setting—creativity is one of the most common shame triggers.

If you’ve lost touch with your creativity, consider the following:

  * **Experiment with artistic ventures.** There are many ways to do this, including taking a painting class, starting voice lessons, or dancing with your significant other. There is no right or wrong way to be creative. It’s about playing with different mediums and finding what works best for you. 
  * **Practice overcoming the fear of comparison.** Comparison leads to the question, “What’s the point if I’m never going to be ‘good enough’?” To combat this feeling, remember that creativity isn’t about being “better” than someone else. It’s about a willingness to be vulnerable and expressive. The more you engage with your own creativity, the easier it will be to abandon comparison. 



#### Practice #7: Be willing to play and rest, and stop using exhaustion as a status symbol.

**Most adults struggle with the concepts of play and rest because of the stigma of “laziness.”** Particularly in American culture (where work and identity are often linked), exhaustion in the name of productivity has become a “badge of honor” for many. For example, if you worked until midnight on a project and only slept for three hours, you may share that information with your colleagues as a point of pride.

However, research has shown that play and rest are essential parts of wholehearted living and lead to _higher_ rates of productivity than overworking:

**Play:** Play helps alleviate stress and generate joy as you allow yourself to get lost in an activity without stakes. Few adults willingly engage in play out of fear of being viewed as “childish.” However, a lack of play is directly related to increased levels of depression and aggression. There are three properties of play:

  * It’s time spent without purpose.
  * It’s something you don’t want to end.
  * It leads to a loss of self-consciousness.



**Rest:** Many adults are in “sleep debt,” meaning they’ve gone more than two consecutive nights with less than seven hours of sleep. This can lead to a series of issues, putting you at risk for human-error tragedies, cancer, and diabetes. To embrace rest, accept that you are allowed to pause and relax for your well-being. Your value as a human being isn’t attached to exhaustion or productivity.

#### Practice #8: Embrace calm and stillness by releasing anxiety.

**Anxiety can quickly take over your life if you don’t actively fight against it, especially when it’s caused by a shame trigger.** In addition to the personal stress anxiety can cause, it quickly spreads to the people around you, causing tension to quickly rise. For example, if someone walks into a meeting carrying anxious energy, that energy can easily spread to the rest of the room, making the meeting less effective and more stressful.

Address your anxiety by finding the source of your stress. This will lead to one of two realizations:

  1. **You have control over the source of your anxiety.** In this situation, work to solve any problems associated with the anxiety you’re feeling, being kind to yourself in the process.
  2. **You have no control over the source of your anxiety.** In this situation, you can’t do anything to change your circumstances. While this may seem like a stressor, it takes the burden off of your shoulders and can help you let go of your anxiety. 



#### Practice #9: Find meaningful work and detach yourself from expectation and self-doubt.

**Meaningful work is any work that you’re passionate about.** While some people have the privilege of making money doing the thing they love, most people have to find this work _outside_ of their careers. This could be through volunteering, finding a hobby, or joining local organizations. For example, if you love performing, you could participate in a local choir or community theater.

**The first step to engaging in meaningful work is to let go of expectations, especially around money.** If something is meaningful to you, then it’s important. You don’t have to make money doing it. While financial factors may keep you from investing _all_ of your time into your passions, finding some time for meaningful work will provide fulfillment and purpose.

#### Practice #10: Release your inhibitions by engaging in laughter, singing, and dancing.

**Laughing, singing, or dancing around other people requires immense vulnerability but also breaks down barriers, creates belonging, and offers a sense of freedom.** Unfortunately, shame around these activities often leads people to silence themselves as they try to fit into a mold that others have built for them—a restrictive and unhealthy behavior.

For example, if someone’s at a concert and wants to sing along with the artist, but someone told them that they should never sing, they’ll likely stay silent, falling victim to their inhibitions and shame.

**To release yourself from your inhibitions, embrace “goofiness.”** Sing with your loved ones. Dance in your living room. Laugh with your friends. Don’t allow societal demands to limit your joy.

#### Using the Practices for Wholehearted Living

**Wholeheartedness is something you will always work on.** As you begin to implement these practices into your life, keep the following in mind:

  * **Accept that you will never be perfect.** You will make mistakes. When you do, admit that you were wrong and move on. Don’t attach stumbles to your self-worth. 
  * **Living your best life is more important than fearing judgment.** Living wholeheartedly may cause some friction with people who don’t understand, but their personal shame shouldn’t limit you from living wholeheartedly. 
  * **Be bold.** Wholehearted living can be scary, and it won’t always work out. However, pursuing fulfillment and joy is why we exist, and the reward is worth the risk.
