## Exercise: Write Your Own Script

Practice writing and delivering a script.

* * *

Think of a product and write a short script for selling it by phone (for example, a pet-sitting or window replacement service). Introduce yourself and your topic and explain why you’re calling.

Next, think of a few qualifying questions such as, “Do you have pets?” or “Do you own your home?” To gather information. frame a few big-picture questions, like “What’s your biggest frustration about X?” or “What would make your life easier?”

Then, transition to the body of the script. Remember that you should begin with the _name_ of your product or service, move on to benefits for the prospect, check in with the prospect, and add one or two more benefits.

Create a sense of urgency by emphasizing scarcity (for instance, your schedule is filling up rapidly and you can only take a few more customers).

Finally, write a close in which you emphasize the benefits of the product or service, how easy it is to buy, ask for the order, and end with a friendly phrase, such as “Does that sound fair?”
