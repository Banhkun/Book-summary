## Chapters 4, 7-8: Techniques—Tone and Body Language

After outlining his system in the opening chapters, Belfort discusses tools and techniques to move a sales conversation through the four Straight Line steps (control, rapport, information gathering, presentation) mentioned at the start of Chapter 2. The first tools are tone of voice and body language.

By some estimates, tone and body language comprise more than 90% of communication while the words you use make up only around 10%. (Shortform note: There’s no scientific evidence supporting the exact percentage breakdown—and many authors and speakers quoting numbers have mischaracterized mid-1960s research by Albert Mehrabian.) In any case, communicating nonverbally via tone and body language is a critical element of selling, affecting the customer whether you’re trying to or not. Belfort advocates using nonverbal communication to create trust and increase certainty.

**Both tone and body language influence the client _unconsciously_** ; in contrast, words (apart from tone) influence the _conscious_ brain. To understand how this works, you must first understand the brain’s conscious and unconscious functions.

### The Conscious vs. Unconscious Mind

The brain’s conscious and unconscious functions work together in guiding decision-making. Remember from Chapter 1, you need to create two levels of certainty in a sale: logical and emotional. They correspond with the brain’s conscious and unconscious sides respectively.

You devote only 5-10% of your brainpower to conscious or logical thought, while the other 90+% works in your unconscious mind to keep your body systems operating and process environmental information. Your unconscious side records everything to create a mental map to use for comparison and context in making conscious or unconscious judgments and decisions. It helps you form quick first impressions, and it enables you to respond to patterns you’ve encountered before, such as how to drive a car regardless of type. Once you’ve formed an impression, you rationalize it (hence, the sales adage that people buy on emotion and justify with logic).

Belfort argues a seller must appeal to _both_ sides of the customer’s brain, although salespeople typically appeal more to logic by focusing on product facts. (Shortform note: Along that line, one author and sales expert argues in the _Harvard Business Review_ that, to close more sales, salespeople should put greater emphasis on appealing to emotion, given the lopsided role the unconscious mind plays in our decision-making.)

Belfort says that to make both the logical and emotional case for a sale,**you must use words to influence the conscious mind, and tonality and body language to influence the unconscious.** For instance, in the opening seconds of a sale, you connect with the unconscious (emotional) side to establish authority and take control. At the end, you appeal to both emotion and logic to close the sale by reiterating the key benefits and reminding the prospect of how great using the product will feel.

> **How We Make Buying Decisions**
> 
> Harvard Business Professor Gerald Zaltman confirms in _How Customers Think_ that 95% of our decision-making about purchases takes place in the subconscious mind, which analyzes millions of bits of data. The conscious mind, which can process only three or four pieces of information at a time, then develops reasons to validate the unconscious decision. However, experts disagree on what this means for sales.
> 
> Author and CEO Michael Harris suggests that logical arguments may work best in simple B2C sales where facts are easy to grasp; however, he says you should use emotional appeals in complex B2B sales because of the conscious mind’s limited processing ability (too much information is overwhelming). Others argue the reverse—that you should appeal to emotion in B2C sales and logic in B2B sales; however, Zaltman says that B2B customers actually decide emotionally but _think_ they’re deciding rationally.
> 
> Either way, sellers should start by creating an emotional connection to the product—for instance, by offering a test drive in a car, appealing to emotions by painting a picture, or using testimonials of happy people enjoying the product. Another way to connect is by telling a “story.” After connecting emotionally, help the customer validate the emotional decision with facts and logic. (For more on how to create an effective story or marketing message, see our guide to _Building a StoryBrand_.)

### Techniques for Using Tone

Belfort recommends changing up both your tone and body language (as teachers or speakers do) to hold a prospect’s attention. To borrow a term from music, _modulate_ your tone by raising or lowering your voice to punctuate a point or draw someone closer. You can move a client toward certainty by using your tone to convey enthusiasm for the product.

Chapter 11 explains how to combine words, tonality, and body language into an effective sales script. But first, in this chapter, Belfort presents a set of selling principles (he calls them tonalities) intended to incorporate the most influential tones in the human repertoire. Again borrowing terminology from music, your tonality is your arrangement of vocal tones and pitches.

Befort claims that applying his tonalities with even minimal competency will generate significant results—most people who use them see at least a 50% increase in sales.

#### Tonalities

Belfort’s tonalities actually use _both_ tone and questioning techniques. We’ve extracted the main themes and synthesized the concepts into seven principles below. Tonalities don’t guarantee a sale, but by connecting emotionally, they help you move the prospect toward certainty.

(Shortform note: Belfort argues that connecting emotionally via tonality allows the seller to control or redirect the prospect’s thought processes or internal monologue. He doesn’t explain how this works, but as a possible example, if you connect with empathy, it might eliminate the prospect’s suspicions that you’re trying to trick her, which relates to the first tonality below.)

**1) Sound like you care** : Convey that you care by using a tone that’s both upbeat and sympathetic, so that the prospect feels as if you know him and have his best interests at heart. Adopt this tone at the beginning of the call to create familiarity. Greet the prospect pleasantly—don’t overdo it but sound as though you really want to speak to him and truly care about how he’s doing. Later in the conversation, when the client raises concerns or a problem, return to your caring tone. Emphasize it while asking questions to determine what might keep him from committing to your product or solution. You’ll learn his certainty level as well as his action and pain thresholds so you can move him efficiently toward a sale.

> **How to Develop Empathy**
> 
> Like salespeople, those whose jobs require interacting with others—for example, medical professionals, therapists, managers, politicians, and coaches—are more effective if they convey _genuine_ warmth and empathy. While empathy is difficult and risky to fake (most people can detect insincerity), empathy is a fundamental social skill that you need and can develop.
> 
> In Emotional Intelligence, Daniel Goleman defines empathy as recognizing emotions in others—one of five skills comprising emotional intelligence. To develop empathy, therapists recommend strategies including: being curious about other people, stepping out of your comfort zone to interact with others, getting feedback from family and friends on improving your listening skills, examining your biases, and putting yourself in others’ shoes.

**2)** **Phrase statements as questions:** Belfort says this makes you sound agreeable and familiar. It can be as simple as saying your name or company name with an inflection: “I’m Roger Ward? From Adonis Autos? In Detroit?” You’re really asking for a _micro-agreement_ (which leads to further agreement): “You’ve heard of me, right?” People tend to say yes because they don’t want to sound out of the loop or as though they’ve forgotten something.

(Shortform note: Communication experts refer to this inflection style as upspeak, and they note that it can make the speaker, particularly a woman, sound tentative or uncertain in some circumstances.)

**3) Create a sense of mystery:** When you introduce your product, create a sense of mystery and anticipation**.** Lower your voice to sound as though you’re letting the prospect in on a secret. Then introduce an appealing new deal—for example, “I have something amazing for you today. I haven’t seen a deal like this since ...”

**4) Speak with certainty:** While this point might seem to contradict the inflection speaking style advised in point 2, you must sound certain about your product or service in order to sell it. Speak firmly and confidently, to convey your belief in your product or brand: “Besides all these great features, you’re getting a _Honda_. You can’t do better than that for reliability.”

**5) Convey sincerity:** Adopt a calm, sincere tone that lets the prospect know she can trust you. You’re on her side: “I want to put you in a vehicle that makes you happy and that has everything you need for your family.”

**6) Create a feeling or sense of scarcity:** Lowering your voice, tell the prospect in an urgent tone that they need to act now. This gets the prospect thinking about making an immediate decision. You can create a sense of scarcity with:

  * **Words** : “We only have one of this model left!” 
  * **Tone:** Lower your voice and add intensity. Layer this tone with the above verbal statement to increase the prospect’s urgency to act.
  * **Information:** Give the impression that the information you’re sharing is scarce, as if _no one else knows****_ that there’s only one of this model left.



(Shortform note: Creating an urgency to “act now” due to scarcity is a common closing technique—it appears on numerous “top closing techniques” lists—but in B2B sales, many experts believe such tactics are ineffective.)

**7) Seem eminently reasonable:** Say something like, “Got a minute?” to start your pitch, or “How’s that sound?” to wrap it up, using inflection at the end of the sentence. These statements convey that you’re not asking for much, you’re reasonable __ and the client can work with you.

(Shortform note: Mike Weinberg also mentions this idea in his book on prospecting, _New Sales. Simplified._ As an introductory phrase conveying reasonableness, he likes to say, “Let me steal a minute,” which acknowledges that you’re interrupting without apologizing.)

> **Lessons From Customer Service**
> 
> Another way to think about connecting emotionally with tone comes from the world of “inside” sales or customer service. A communication systems provider suggests starting with a big-picture view of tone: Create a consistent tone of voice for your organization based on your brand personality: How do you want to come across as a company—sincere, energized, competent, sophisticated?
> 
> To help establish this tone, answer questions such as:
> 
>   * What attitude do we want to convey to customers?
> 
>   * How do we want them to feel when speaking with us?
> 
>   * What specific language or phrases will we use with customers?
> 
> 

> 
> Establishing a consistent overall tone is useful for “outside” salespeople as well.

### Techniques for Using Body Language

Body language accounts for at least half of the 90% of communication that’s nonverbal, according to Belfort. As noted earlier, it works hand in hand with tone (the other half) in subconsciously increasing a prospect’s certainty.

Effective body language won’t necessarily close the deal, but _ineffective_ body language can ruin the _possibility_ of a deal—because it prevents you from developing rapport or increasing a prospect’s certainty.

This section discusses body language techniques, but first let’s clarify the term. Body language encompasses:

  * Appearance (clothing, hair, jewelry, grooming, cologne, and so on) 
  * Facial expressions, eye contact, and gestures such as your handshake
  * The way you move, including stance and positioning
  * The way you use time and space



As noted in the discussion of first impressions, people determine in seconds whether you’re someone they want to do business with. Your body language—the way you package and present yourself—is a key influence. Think about someone who instantly “rubbed you the wrong way”—it’s likely that something in the way they looked or moved unconsciously offended you.

The rest of this section discusses ways to make body language work _for_ rather than against you.

#### Appearance

The first thing people notice about you is your appearance, beginning with dress and grooming; you want to come across as professional and therefore credible.

Belfort recommends that salespeople (both men and women) wear suits, minimize cologne or perfume, and carry a leather briefcase to convey confidence, care, and quality. For men, he advises that any beard or mustache be close-cropped (unless facial hair is part of the culture) so you don’t come across as careless or sloppy; women should avoid extreme hairstyles or too much jewelry as these are distracting.

> **Research: Why You Should Dress for Success**
> 
> Research shows that people who dress well are more confident, feel more powerful, and are more focused. In studies, people who dressed better made fewer mistakes, did better at abstract thinking, and negotiated better deals than those who dressed casually.
> 
> Defining professional dress is somewhat subjective and depends on circumstances. People prefer that others’ clothing match their expectations—for example, doctors should wear scrubs, plumbers should wear appropriate uniforms, and business people should wear suits.
> 
> Most important from a selling perspective, people perceive those who dress professionally as leaders and seek support from them more often.

#### Eye Contact and Active Listening

Another key aspect of body language is eye contact. Make eye contact to show interest, but not to the point of seeming aggressive or dominating. Belfort contends you should make eye contact 72% of the time—if it’s less, people won’t trust you.

(Shortform note: Some communication experts recommend the 50/70 rule: Maintain eye contact 50% of the time while speaking and 70% while listening. Further, only maintain eye contact for four or five seconds at a time, then look to the side slowly, before making eye contact again—if you do this too fast, you’ll look shifty or nervous.)

The point of eye contact is to project confidence and strong engagement, and to be and show that you’re a good listener. Eye contact is an important element of active listening.

> **The Two Parts of Active Listening**
> 
> Active listening is generally defined as:
> 
>   * Giving your full attention to the speaker—so that you concentrate on, understand, respond, and remember what the speaker says
> 
>   * Showing that you’re listening through verbal cues and body language such as eye contact and nodding
> 
> 

> 
> Belfort’s sales system focuses primarily on the second part: creating the appearance of listening. He defines active listening as simply showing that you’re paying attention by using body language and tonality.
> 
> However, in 12 Rules for Life, Jordan Peterson writes that _fully_ engaging in active listening has many benefits, including learning how another person thinks, helping them think, learning from their experiences, and developing a trusting relationship.

#### 

Stance and Positioning

The next key aspects of body language are how you use space and movement. First, be aware of others’ personal space and don’t violate it. Different cultures have different standards for how closely you should approach or stand near someone, so know and respect the preferences of the culture or country you’re operating in. Belfort says Westerners prefer a space buffer of two-and-a-half to three feet, while Asians are comfortable less than a foot from another person.

(Shortform note: Other sources claim that Americans like a 12- to 15-inch buffer, while Asians prefer _more_ than that and Middle Eastern cultures less. A 2017 Washington Post article graphically depicts research also showing that Asians prefer _more_ personal space than Americans do.)

As part of spatial awareness, pay attention to your stance and positioning. Belfort contends that men and women prefer different stances, depending on whether they’re dealing with someone of the same or opposite sex. Two people of the same sex are more comfortable and relaxed when standing or sitting at an angle rather than directly in front of each other. For men in particular, facing each other directly promotes a sense of competition and conflict; the same is somewhat true for women.

In contrast, according to Belfort, a man selling to a woman _should_ stand in front of her and keep his hands visible to her. Similarly, a woman seeking to influence a man should stand facing him.

(Shortform note: Other writers agree that standing at an angle to someone comes across as more comfortable or less confrontational for many people; and also that men prefer an angle to a face-to-face stance unless they’re trying to express dominance.

Belfort doesn’t address posture—however, Jordan Peterson argues in _12 Rules for Life_ that your posture reflects your self-respect and affects others’ respect for you. If you stand straight with your shoulders back, people will treat you as capable, and you’ll act with greater confidence.)

#### Gestures

From a Western standpoint, a handshake is one of the most important gestures in creating an impression. There are different types of handshakes, ranging from too firm to too limp. Those at either end of the spectrum leave a poor impression.

Handshakes that are too hard or last too long come across as attempts to intimidate or dominate. Counterintuitively, Belfort notes that a limp handshake also can be a power play, conveying that the person doesn’t care how they come across.

He says a handshake should be “neutral,” neither too hard nor too soft. You should meet the other person’s hand straight on, not from above or below, and use the same amount of pressure as they do. This approach signals cooperation, indicating you’re a good person to do business with—according to Belfort, people want to do business with others who are like them or with whom they can relate. Shaking hands this way is part of an overall rapport building technique called matching, which is a means of relating to someone on their level. We’ll discuss matching in the next section.

(Shortform note: Some etiquette writers recommend that you limit a handshake to two-to-five seconds. Former President Trump’s handshake technique of gripping the other person’s hand tightly and yanking them toward him was dissected in the media as a power play. Other world leaders reportedly practiced how to counter it.)

Another common gesture is crossing your arms, which Belfort says may indicate that you’re closed to new ideas. Some behavioral experts say it makes you seem anxious, defensive, or insecure. In any case, as the seller, you want to appear as relaxed and open to the client as possible, so it’s usually better to avoid crossed arms.

### Related Techniques: Matching, Pacing, Leading

Belfort recommends a technique called _matching_ for building rapport and influence with body language. It works best as part of active listening, where you’re closely observing the other person. The technique consists of using body language to **match the prospect’s body language, for instance her body position, blinking rate, and breathing.** If you’re talking on the phone rather than in person, you would match her tonality and rate of speech.

Belfort says matching is different from mirroring, which is doing the exact same thing as the other person—for example, scratching your head— _while_ they’re doing it. Matching is a little more subtle: You copy their gestures casually and slowly with a lag of five to 10 seconds and vary them a little. (Shortform note: Studies of mirroring, also called the chameleon effect, show that it causes others to like and trust you more.)

Matching and mirroring are both two-way interactions. You can move from matching a person’s behavior yourself to _pacing and leading_ them to adopt (match) _your_ position—for example, to get someone to uncross their arms, fold yours similarly, then pace and lead them by slowly adopting an open, relaxed arm position. It works because people unconsciously copy others.

You’ll not only create rapport, but also begin moving their emotional state from negative to positive and from uncertainty to greater certainty.

(Shortform note: Pacing and leading are neuro-linguistic programming techniques advocated by some marketers. We’ll discuss the general concept of neuro-linguistic programming in the final chapter.)

> **Ways to Use Matching, Pacing, and Leading**
> 
> _Win Bigly_ author Scott Adams, who writes about persuasion, suggests several matching, pacing, and leading scenarios:
> 
>   * **Sales** : Pace a potential customer verbally by showing you have similar interests and values; also discuss how they’re like your other clients. Then explain why your product or service makes logical sense for people sharing these interests.
> 
>   * **Hiring situations** : Build familiarity with a hiring manager by matching their behavior (posture, speaking, and email style). Then verbally paint a picture (future pacing) that helps them visualize you working for them—for example, your contacts can get them better prices—prompting them to think beyond the hiring decision.
> 
>   * **Negotiation** : Besides matching the other party’s body language, match their argument by agreeing with it: “That’s a very reasonable approach...but I wonder if it covers all the bases—for instance…”
