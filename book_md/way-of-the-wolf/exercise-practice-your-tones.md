## Exercise: Practice Your Tones

In this exercise, practice using different tones in several hypothetical (but common) sales situations.

* * *

Imagine you’re calling a new prospect. Start by saying, “Hi Sophie! I hope you’re doing well today.” What tone(s) are you using and why? What should be your next statement and tone?

Try repeating your practice conversation out loud while recording yourself with your cell phone. Play it back and critique your tone, adjust it, and try again. How did the second try compare to the first?

Here’s another scenario: A prospect tells you he needs more time to make a decision. What’s your response? What tone should you use to respond and why?

Finally, imagine that your prospect likes your product or service, but tells you she can’t afford it right now. What response and tone will you use?
