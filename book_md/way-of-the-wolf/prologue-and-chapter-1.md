## Prologue and Chapter 1: The Key to Selling Is Certainty

Jordan Belfort created the Straight Line sales system following the Black Monday stock market crash in 1987, when he took over a small brokerage firm, Stratton Oakmont, in New York.

The idea of efficiently moving customers in a straight line from uncertainty to certainty about buying came to him as he analyzed why he was far more successful at selling than his brokers were. He realized that he succeeded by staying focused on the single objective of closing while his brokers were distracted by customer objections and tangents.

As Belfort describes it, he sketched out and taught the Straight Line system to his 12 inexperienced salespeople by inventing it as he went along. Once they applied the system, they became hugely successful—the firm ultimately grew to around 1,000 brokers doing business worth $1 billion.

Belfort believes that with his system and his extraordinary teaching talent, he can turn anyone into an exceptional closer. He acknowledges that he initially used the system unethically and illegally (he urged his brokers to pressure clients to buy). But after getting out of prison, he says he overhauled it to teach people to sell successfully—and ethically—in a wide range of industries.

He says he eliminated pressure tactics and also refined the system after consulting with experts in content creation, education, neuro-linguistics, and psychology. He calls his refined techniques ethical persuasion.

> **Five Principles of Ethical Persuasion**
> 
> Belfort suggests that ethical persuasion is using your powers of persuasion to serve both your interests _and_ the client’s—that is, selling him a product only if you truly believe it will help him. In contrast, _un_ ethical persuasion is pursuing personal gain at others’ expense.
> 
> Belfort’s definition focuses on the _end_ , or purpose,__ of the interaction. In addition to the end, ethicists Sherry Baker and David L. Martinson focus on the _means_ of persuasion, and they’ve created a five-point “TARES test” for assessing those means. To be ethical, persuasion requires:
> 
>   * Truthfulness
> 
>   * Authenticity (of the persuader)
> 
>   * Respect
> 
>   * Equity (both parties benefit)
> 
>   * Social Responsibility (there’s a common good)
> 
> 

> 
> In unethical persuasion, the end would be the seller’s gain, and the means would be lying. In contrast, ethical persuasion has a moral end or purpose, pursued by ethical means—for example, journalism’s end might be truth and empowerment, pursued by investigative reporting.

Like many sales trainers, Belfort says that everyone needs to know how to sell, whether they make a living in sales or just need to sell themselves to employers, negotiate for a pay increase or the sale of a home, or even to get a date. He says Straight Line persuasion is a key communication skill enabling you to live an empowered and successful life—as long as you use it responsibly.

The rest of Chapter 1, as well as Chapters 2-3, gives an overview of Belfort’s sales philosophy and of the Straight Line system; in later chapters, we’ll explore in detail topics that are only touched on here as part of the big picture.

### Create Certainty

Belfort introduces his system by explaining that every prospect (potential customer) falls somewhere on a certainty scale of 1 to 10 when it comes to their feelings about three key things: the product you’re selling, you as the salesperson, and your company. He calls these the three tens. Your goal as a seller is to efficiently move the prospect on a straight path toward certainty on all three and a sale.

Belfort contends that **all sales are alike in that the seller’s objective is always to move the prospect from uncertainty to certainty about buying, regardless of product** , price, or differences in the prospect’s needs, problems to be solved, values, or objections.

> **Complex Sales Are Different**
> 
> In the broadest sense, it’s true that sellers have the same objective in all sales: selling something. But complex B2B sales are much different in structure from B2C or one-on-one sales and may require a different approach.
> 
> In a B2B sale:
> 
>   * The stakes are much higher—when you’re selling a product or service that’s huge and complex such as an enterprise information system, customers are ultra-sensitive to the cost of a mistake and are therefore highly deliberative and resistant to pressure (you can’t rush them).
> 
>   * You need to convince more than one person to buy—multiple people have a stake in or must sign off on the purchase, so you must take time to understand the dynamics and build wide support within a company. Each person has their own interests and differing levels of certainty.
> 
>   * Just determining who the key decision-maker is and gaining access to that person can be difficult.
> 
> 

> 
> Selling methods such as The Challenger Sale and SPIN Selling aim to address these challenges.

Following is a breakdown of the three certainties you must establish in the prospect’s mind to make a Straight Line sale.

#### The First Certainty: The Product

  * The first certainty is that your prospect love the product or be at a 10 on the certainty scale, believing it fully meets her needs and is worth the price.
  * At the opposite end of the scale—a 1—she’ll feel the product is inferior and overpriced. If so, you won’t be able to change her mind. 
  * However, at a 5 on the certainty scale, she’ll be ambivalent and therefore can be moved toward a 10. (Belfort says she _wants_ the salesperson to influence her or tell her what to do.)
  * If your prospect is below a 5, you can’t close a sale immediately, but you have an opportunity to increase her certainty score by persuading her that your product will improve her life. Belfort contends that people buy products only if they _think_ the products will help them or improve their lives. They may be wrong—but it’s _thinking_ they’ll benefit that moves them toward a sale.



#### The Second Certainty: You as the Seller

  * The second certainty or requirement for a successful close is that your prospect find you totally likable, trustworthy, and acting in her best interests. If she views you as unlikable, incompetent, or acting from self-interest, she’ll be at a 1 and uncloseable.
  * A prospect will fall near the middle of the scale and can be moved if: she finds you reasonably trustworthy although she dislikes you, or she likes you but doesn’t trust you. Belfort’s prescription for building trust, which he discusses in more detail in Chapters 4 and 7-8, emphasizes using tone and body language to appeal on an emotional level.



> **How to Be Likable and Trustworthy**
> 
> Like Belfort, many sales trainers emphasize the need for the seller to be likable and trustworthy. For instance, in _News Sales. Simplified._ , Mike Weinberg says that being likable requires being aware of others’ emotions and of how you come across. For example, to be likeable, you need to be able to understand and adapt to the customer’s communication style (if they’re not chatty, drop the small talk and get to the point).
> 
> To build trust, Grant Cardone recommends the following in _Sell or Be Sold_ :
> 
>   * Assume the customer doesn’t trust you, and you’ll need to prove yourself.
> 
>   * Help the customer research the product by providing as much information as possible.
> 
>   * Support what you say with documentation that she can see for herself.
> 
>   * Put promises in writing as part of the customer’s order.
> 
>   * Be honest when you don't know the answer.
> 
> 


#### The Third Certainty: Your Company or Brand

  * The third certainty and final requirement for a successful close is that your prospect feel positively about your company or brand. If she believes something negative, for instance that your company doesn’t stand behind its products, you’ll need to increase her confidence.
  * It’s typically easier to sell to an existing customer because if she already has a positive relationship with the company, you only need to work on increasing her certainty about you and the product.
  * In addition, if a prospect already feels positively about your company, she’s also _likely_ to feel good about you and your product. Of course, the reverse is also true—if she _doesn’t_ like your company or brand, she’s less likely to like you and your product. 



Belfort argues that with even a basic understanding of the Straight Line system, you can take control of the sales conversation and move most prospects toward increased certainty until you close the sale. (Shortform note: In contrast to Belfort’s seller-focused method of making a sale as expeditiously as possible, customer-centric methods like the _SPIN Selling_ and the Sandler method spend significant time building a relationship, “discovering” and analyzing customer needs, and pitching a custom solution.)

> **Customer Certainties Overlap**
> 
> Although Belfort refers to the three certainties in the same order throughout the book (product, seller, company), he doesn’t say whether the seller _must_ address them in that order during every sales conversation.
> 
> It seems likely that you’d often work toward certainty on all three aspects simultaneously—for instance, your compelling pitch for the product would help create client certainty, not only about the product, but also about you as an expert and about the company as the producer of a great product.
> 
> Or, you might vary your emphasis depending on the circumstances and customer. For example, if the customer has already made up her mind to buy a laptop computer, and she’s comparison shopping, you’d focus on establishing certainty that your brand and company offer superior quality and service rather than on the general benefits of owning a laptop.

#### Two Types of Certainty

Before explaining the Straight Line path further, Belfort makes one more point about certainty. A seller must create certainty in the prospect’s mind on two levels: logical and emotional.

  * **Logical certainty** : To reach logical certainty, a prospect asks whether things add up intellectually. (Does the product meet my needs? Is the price fair? Is it backed by a guarantee and service?)
  * **Emotional certainty:** The prospect is emotionally certain when he has a gut feeling the product will improve his life. You can create emotional certainty by _future pacing_ —helping the client envision how much better life will be with the product. (Shortform note: It could be as simple as saying, “I know you’re really going to like how much bigger and brighter this window treatment will make your rooms feel.” This is a common sales technique. On a more complex level, future pacing is a neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) technique in which creating thoughts about something (in your own mind or someone else’s) is intended to help bring about the reality. We’ll discuss NLP in more detail in the final chapters of this guide, which focus on the seller’s mindset.)



The seller must create _both_ emotional and logical certainty to close a sale because buyers draw on both—Belfort quotes the sales adage that **people buy based on emotion, then rationalize the purchase with logic.** (Shortform note: The research around emotion/logic in buying decisions is complicated, and sales experts interpret it in different ways. But many agree with Belfort on the need for a balanced approach. Chapters 4, 7-8 specifically explore how to connect with a customer emotionally.)

### If the Three Certainties Don’t Align

If you fall short on one or more of the three certainties, you probably won’t get a straightforward “no”—more likely, Belfort says, the customer will raise a hurdle or objection as a cover for their uncertainty about the product, you, or the company.

You’ll encounter your first objections in the initial third of the sales conversation, the first time you ask for an order. Examples of objections are: “I’ll think about it and get back to you” and “I need time to talk it over with (my boss, colleagues, or spouse).” Objections are an opportunity to go back and address the real issue, then move the customer more firmly toward certainty (a process called _looping_). Belfort discusses looping in Chapters 2-3 and 12. If you instead hope or believe that the prospect actually _will_ get back to you, you’ve lost the sale, because they won’t.

(Shortform note: In _Sell or Be Sold_ , sales trainer Grant Cardone similarly says that objections are an excuse for a customer’s lack of confidence that the product will truly meet his needs. He recommends preparing responses to common objections. We’ll compare how various sales methods address objections in more detail in Chapter 11.)

On the other hand, if you _do_ get a rare, flat-out “no,” move on. Belfort says that people who simply aren’t interested can’t be convinced to buy, and you shouldn’t waste time on them. Weed out uninterested people early in the process by asking targeted questions (part of information gathering), which we’ll discuss in the next chapter and in Chapters 9-10.
