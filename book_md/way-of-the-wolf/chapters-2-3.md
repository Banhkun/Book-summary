## Chapters 2-3: Build a Straight Line and Stay on Track

In these chapters, Belfort gives an overview of _how to build a straight line_ and keep the prospect moving toward a close rather than getting sidetracked. He goes into the steps in more detail and provides tools in later chapters.

### Straight Line Steps

Building the Straight Line or creating a framework for the sales conversation involves four steps or basic principles:

  1. Take control of the sale immediately.
  2. Build rapport by asking questions and using a friendly, interested tone and body language (more on this in Chapters 4 and 7-8).
  3. Gather relevant information.
  4. Transition into making your sales presentation, in which you move the prospect toward all three certainties and a close, using the looping technique.



#### Step 1. Taking Control in the First Four Seconds

Belfort says that the first step—establishing your authority and taking control of the sale—must happen in the first four seconds of the sales conversation—or you’ll fail to close. (Shortform note: Taking immediate control may be more important in B2C than in B2B sales, where business customers tend to resist pressure.)

According to Belfort, you must **establish three things about yourself in the _first four seconds_ of a Straight Line sales conversation **(typically, through your tone, appearance, and body language):

  1. **Competence:** You must come across to the prospect as smart and capable of solving problems, or talking to you will seem like a waste of time.
  2. **Expertise:** You must not only sound like an expert but also work until you become one. We’ve been conditioned from childhood to turn to experts, such as doctors, teachers, and advisors for help—so convey in-depth knowledge of your product and industry and how it can benefit your customer.
  3. **Enthusiasm for your product:** Make it clear that you believe in your product and company. Don’t try to sell something unless you feel it’s truly valuable, or your insincerity will come through and undercut your efforts.



(Shortform note: Researchers differ on exactly how many seconds you have to make a first impression—estimates range from a fraction of a second to half a minute. Further, Belfort repeats a widely quoted assertion that when someone develops a negative first impression of you, it takes _eight_ positive impressions to overcome it. While there’s little research to support this, it’s true that salespeople who make a poor first impression won’t likely get additional chances, so it’s vital to get it right the first time.)

In later chapters, Belfort provides techniques for establishing your credibility or authority in four seconds using tone and body language and by developing an effective script.

#### Steps 2-4. Questioning and Presenting

**Once you’ve established control of the Straight Line sales conversation, the next steps, which go hand in hand, are building rapport and gathering information** for your presentation. (Without rapport, prospects won’t answer your questions.) These must be purposeful activities designed to advance your goal of closing a sale. Unskilled salespeople often get sidetracked instead—they end up following the client off on tangents in an effort to be friendly, or waste time trying to answer dead-end objections.

For example, when Belfort hired his first brokers, they had constant trouble closing, even when they had good (qualified) leads. When he questioned them about the lack of sales, they complained that the clients raised too many objections to buying, which the brokers struggled to counter.

However, to succeed, Belfort’s brokers needed to steer the conversation. Belfort explained that to have a two-way conversation, you need to deviate from the Straight Line a little, and let the prospect talk. However, you should use the _small_ deviations from the Straight Line to build rapport and gain information by asking purposeful questions that will help you target your presentation.

For example, to sell stocks, Belfort recommends discussing these areas with the customer to determine what doubts or limitations hold her back, so you can address them:

  1. What worries might make the prospect hesitant to buy?
  2. What beliefs could hinder the sale—for instance, a distrust of brokers or a prior bad experience.
  3. Does she have the money and willingness to invest it?



Similarly, if you were selling a car under this system, you’d want to identify potential hurdles such as bad credit or inability to make a down payment. With this information, you’d know to feature your company’s easy credit plan in your presentation.

In the process, you should be careful not to undermine rapport by saying the wrong thing, using the wrong tone or body language, or asking a question at the wrong time. Belfort stresses in later chapters that **you have to constantly maintain and strengthen rapport—if you lose it at any point and can’t restore it, you’ll lose the sale.**

> **How to Build Rapport**
> 
> Belfort’s prescription for building rapport, as explained in later chapters, is to use focused questions, tone, and body language to come across as caring, sincere, and interested (but to avoid BS’ing).
> 
> However, other sales training emphasizes specific rapport-building steps and questions:
> 
>   * Be yourself, be friendly, show real interest, find common ground, give genuine compliments, be sensitive to the client’s time, and adapt to the business culture (such as by dressing appropriately).
> 
>   * Show sincere interest with comments such as: “I really like your lobby, artwork, how friendly your staff is (or something else you actually liked).” Follow up with open-ended questions about the feature you cited.
> 
> 

> 
> In _New Sales. Simplified_ , Weinberg cites building rapport as the first stage in making a face-to-face sales presentation. To build rapport, he recommends starting your meeting with a genuine conversation about news, sports, or something you saw on their LinkedIn profile; then using the answers to assess the client’s personality and conversational style to which you adapt. Finally, share your agenda for the meeting, then tell your sales story.

#### Looping

After establishing rapport and gathering information, Belfort recommends asking for the sale so that you surface the objections early in the process. Remember, objections are generally a cover for uncertainty about the product, you, or your company. Then use _looping_ : Backtrack to determine what the prospect is uncertain about, re-present your product’s benefits, and start moving the client forward again.

(Shortform note: In the _Little Red Book of Selling_ , Jeffrey Gitomer argues that uncertainty/objections stem from perceived risk. The biggest hurdle to a sale is the risk the customer believes he’d take in buying your product. You must eliminate the risk to get the customer to buy. Risks include: Will I get into trouble if the purchase doesn't pan out, and is it worth the money? He says the seller can prepare for this by identifying the customer's potential risks and preparing responses that eliminate them. We’ll discuss the looping process in detail and how other sales methods address objections in Chapter 12.)

> **How Other Methods Compare**
> 
> Many sales methods follow some version of Belfort’s four steps—the seven typical sales steps are: prospecting and qualifying, preparation, approach (questioning), presentation, objection handling, closing, and follow-up. But customer-focused methods differ from the Straight Line system in emphasis and goal. For example:
> 
> **Control:** While**** the Straight Line method asserts control to push the client toward a sale, the Challenger sale method uses control differently. It asserts control in the sense of challenging or pushing the client to think differently about his industry and his needs and solutions.
> 
> **Asking questions** : While both Straight Line and customer-focused methods ask questions to build rapport and gather information, customer-focused methods prepare questions in advance and go deeper in an effort, not just to sell, but to customize a solution.
> 
> **Presenting** : Though he lists presenting as the fourth step, Belfort doesn’t explain how to create a sales presentation—that is, how to compellingly describe your product and its benefits. He appears to assume you’ll know your product and how to pitch it before trying to sell it; instead, his system focuses on using tone and body language—as well as repeating your pitch through looping—to persuade.
> 
> In contrast, in _New Sales. Simplified._ , Mike Weinberg advocates crafting a compelling sales story about your offering, which becomes the centerpiece of your sales presentation. A sales story explains the customer issues you solve, the solutions and services you offer, and how they’re different from and better than anyone else’s. (Weinberg provides a story template.) Further, he explains how a presentation follows eight choreographed stages, such as: get buy-in, clear the air, and tell your story.

### Completing the Straight Line

In total, there are five key essentials to the Straight Line System and sales success. The first three are the certainties: total client confidence in your product, you, and your company. In the process of reaching 10s in these three areas, you’ve made the bulk of your sales pitch or presentation and even repeated it through looping.

But the client _still_ may not be ready to say “yes,” which is where the fourth and fifth elements of the Straight Line System come in: the action and pain thresholds. **Your goal is to lower the action threshold and increase the pain threshold**. Chapter 12 explains how in detail, but here are the basics.

#### Action and Pain Thresholds

Each person has an individual _action threshold_ at which they feel comfortable enough to buy, based on their personal way of decision-making. For instance, before buying a specific car, a buyer might want to feel they’ve left no stone unturned in researching every viable option. The higher someone’s action threshold, the harder it is to get a “yes” from them; however, this threshold isn’t firm. You can work to lower it by increasing another threshold.

Every prospect also has a _pain threshold_ , a point at which they’re driven to take action to alleviate a problem or pain. For instance, they finally get fed up with the lawnmower not starting right away, and they buy a new one. If you’ve asked the right questions during your information gathering, you’ll understand their pain and you can create an urgency to act by emphasizing it. For example, if you’re a building contractor, you might remind the prospect of the high risk that they’ll have an expensive emergency if they don’t replace a failing roof right now—or you could tell a story about a customer who waited too long and suffered a disaster.

> **Ask Implication Questions**
> 
> Sales trainer Michael Nick recommends three steps to determine a client’s pain threshold: identify the pains and issues, calculate the current cost of the pains, and extrapolate the cost by five years.
> 
> Similarly, the SPIN Selling method asks specifically designed implication questions that make the pain more explicit. These questions explore the larger implications, ripple effects, or consequences in order to make a seemingly small problem big enough to require action. For example:
> 
>   * Could the limitations of your equipment be costing you new business?
> 
>   * What effect does that have on quality?
> 
>   * Do your equipment problems increase turnover or make it more difficult to hire operators?
> 
>   * Is this leading to increased costs or liability?
> 
> 

> 
> The authors’ research indicates implication questions contribute strongly to success in large sales, and they increase the customer’s perception of the value of your product.

#### Break the Code

Belfort recommends approaching a sales conversation as though you’re a safecracker spinning through each of five numbers (the five essentials of a Straight Line sale) to find the combination that cracks the code and gets the prospect to buy. The rest of this book provides additional tools and techniques, but you now understand the trajectory for closing any prospect who’s closable.

Befort says that within 90 days of learning the basics of the Straight Line System, his brokers gained confidence and became million-dollar sales producers.**** The company expanded rapidly as Belfort emphasized the Straight Line System daily. This system can empower any salesperson and, Belfort argues, it’s your most important asset for achieving success and wealth.

(Shortform note: Belfort doesn’t discuss or acknowledge the role that initially pushing his salespeople to pressure customers might have played in his company’s growth and profit. And although he says he subsequently removed pressure tactics from his selling system, he also boasts in the opening of the book that he can sell anything to anyone, including ice to an Eskimo.)
