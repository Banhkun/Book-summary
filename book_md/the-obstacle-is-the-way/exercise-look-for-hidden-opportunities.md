## Exercise: Look for Hidden Opportunities

In every situation or obstacle, there are hidden opportunities that you can turn to your own benefit. Finding them is a matter of viewing the obstacle neutrally (seeing it as it is, without judgment), then reorienting your thinking to see it as a gift rather than a problem.

* * *

Describe a problem or challenge that frustrated you this week. Why was it frustrating?

Try describing it again, this time as objectively as possible. Remove all emotion and judgment—merely state the facts as if reading a news article. (For example, you might reframe “My friend is giving me the cold shoulder for no reason” as “Three of my texts were left unanswered, and I feel offended.”) How does this differ from your first description?

What potential benefits can you see in the situation? How can you take advantage of them? (In our example, you could use these unanswered texts as an opportunity to discuss and resolve long-standing issues with your friend.)
