## Exercise: Practice Acceptance

When you’re facing a situation you can’t change, the only thing you can do is accept it. Once you do so, you can very likely find some benefit. Though you don’t get what you wanted, you gain something else worth celebrating.

* * *

Describe a negative situation in your life that you can’t change (for example, being required to share a small workspace with a coworker you dislike).

What benefits can you gain from this situation? Name as many as you can think of. (For example, you might get more work done next to a coworker you dislike since you won’t want to socialize with them, and you’ll get many chances to practice dealing patiently with someone who aggravates you.)

Remember: Feeling bad about something you can’t change is pointless while appreciating benefits and opportunities feels good and motivates you to act. What steps can you take to accept this situation and remind yourself of its benefits? (For example, you could start keeping a covert list of these benefits on your desk to read whenever you feel frustrated with your coworker.)
