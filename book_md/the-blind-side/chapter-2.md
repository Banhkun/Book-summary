## Chapter 2: Discovering Michael Oher

**In 1978, a 23-year-old football fan named Tom Lemming decided he would travel to all the high schools in America in search of the best football prospects.** He’d interview the players, watch them play, and find out which colleges they were interested in attending. Then, he’d put his discoveries in a book that college coaches could use to recruit young talent.

With no real money or job, Lemming drove as many miles as he could afford across the country, sleeping in his car to save money. He drove close to 60,000 miles in one year and visited up to 2,000 players. He whittled the list down to the top 150 players and designated 25 as the best in the country.

His newsletters were distributed through subscription to collegiate programs. After a few years, **when his picks for top prospects had enough time to prove the keenness of his judgment, colleges started to trust him**. More than that, high schools and parents started reaching out to him on behalf of players to try to make this list. It took seven years for Lemming’s business to be profitable, but he was already respected and heralded as the godfather of high school football.

What made Lemming’s work so valuable was that no one else was doing it. Unlike baseball, where high school players could go straight to the MLB, football players were required to play in college if they wanted to advance their careers. Colleges mostly looked at players in their region of the country because the prototypes for each position were fairly general. But with Lemming’s help, coaches in the South could now find out about players in the Midwest or West. And once the focus on positions changed and prototypes became more distinguished, this wider scope became more necessary.

By the beginning of 1990, Lemming was sorting through close to 3 million players. He was dedicated and had strict criteria for the type of player he chose to highlight as the best. **The players had to be talented, productive on the field, recipients of special honors or awards, good students, and of good character.** Trouble-makers, poor students, and criminals were not healthy prospects for teams, as their behavior was likely to ruin their eligibility.

These parameters had served Lemming well. In 1995, 14 of his top-25 picks became number one picks during the NFL draft. Sports broadcasting stations and polling organizations started using Lemming’s lists to guide their own top picks. And in 2000, Lemming was asked to select the inaugural team for the U.S. Army High School All-American game, a task he was given each year following.

#### The New Recruit

The demand for a certain type of left tackle in the wake of Taylor added a new dimension to Lemming’s standards. Before, a high school lineman who came in at 250 pounds was considered good-sized. But **with the rise of massive and fast pass rushers, linemen were now required to be monstrous, and the type of person who could play left tackle was even more defined**.

Recruits for left tackle now had to be at least 300 pounds, have long arms and large hands, and be fast like a sprinter and light on their feet like a ballerina. But finding this type of player in the high school ranks was like finding a silver dollar in a heap of quarters.

It was for this reason, and this reason alone, that Lemming took notice when he received a grainy, barely viewable video in Spring 2004. He couldn’t make out much, but what he did see was a large tackle coming off the line like a wall and chasing down linemen half his size and with what should have been twice his speed. Lemming couldn’t believe what he was seeing. He was sure that it was the grainy footage or a trick of the camera. **No person of that size should move as quickly as that boy did. That boy was a young black student named Michael Oher, and Lemming had to meet him.**

### A Player Like No Other

From the start, Michael Oher was a mystery to Lemming. He wasn’t mysterious simply because of his seemingly impossible skills on the field. Lemming also couldn’t find any information on him. In all his years of scouting, any player that sparked his interest could always be researched. There would usually be national stories or local news articles highlighting a player’s accomplishments.

Stranger still was the school Michael attended. Michael went to Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, a small private school not known for football or black students. **When Lemming called the school to ask for Michael’s contact information, he learned Michael didn’t have a phone number or home address, and no one seemed to be representing this kid.** This was odd because top players always had a team of handlers, from parents to coaches to informal agents. Lemming knew the only way he was going to learn about Michael Oher was if he drove to Memphis to meet him.

Briarcrest agreed to set up a meeting between Lemming and Michael at the University of Memphis. When Michael walked into the conference room, Lemming was taken aback by his size. He was so big, he almost didn’t fit through the door. But Michael wasn’t a soft 300 pounds. He was solid, built sturdy in all the right ways. He also had long arms and giant hands.

Lemming started the interview, asking the same series of questions about college, the future, and Michael’s goals in life. Michael sat silent. So Lemming decided to have him fill out a questionnaire. Michael took the piece of paper and set it off to the side. Lemming tried again, this time handing Michael what was essentially the golden ticket of high school football—the Army all-star game registration form. Again, Michael took it and set it to the side.

Lemming realized this visit was going nowhere and excused Michael. Never before had he encountered this situation in his life, and he didn’t know how to explain it. He assumed that Michael’s reticence was a sign of a bad attitude or trouble. But he didn’t write Michael completely off because, although quiet, he’d been polite. **He also knew that if this kid played left tackle, he’d be a number one pick for the NFL without question.**

What Lemming didn’t realize was that Michael had no idea who Lemming was or what he did. He didn’t consider himself a football player, and he’d certainly never played left tackle before. The mystery of Michael Oher continued.

### The Kindness of Strangers

**The path that eventually led to Michael’s acceptance on the Briarcrest football team and on Lemming’s radar was paved by the fortitude and kindness of several individuals,** the first of whom was Tony Henderson, the closest person to an official guardian for Michael.

Big Tony, as he was called, was from an impoverished, gang-ridden community in Memphis called Hurt Village. The village was once housing for working-class white families, but after desegregation of public schools, white flight took hold. The black community took over Hurt Village and most of the west side of Memphis, and born-again white Christians developed their own communities on the east side. Christian schools sprouted up everywhere, the largest of which was the Briarcrest system.

Briarcrest Christian School was as far east as you could get and still be in Memphis. There were a handful of black students in the school’s history, but most of them were not Memphis natives and were from upper-class families. Never had a poor black child attended the heralded Christian school, but that was about to change in 2002 when Big Tony walked in.

Big Tony was at Briarcrest because of his son, Steven, a highly intelligent black teenager. Big Tony had made a promise to his dying mother to take Steven out of public school and enroll him in a Christian school on the east side so he could become a preacher. But the two weren’t alone as they drove to Briarcrest that first day. Michael was with them.

Big Tony coached youth football and basketball and often recruited young players from Hurt Village. On one of these visits, he saw 15-year-old Michael on the basketball court. Michael’s size and skill level caught Tony’s attention. **Big Tony could see that Michael was headed down a bad road and decided to help him channel his energy into sports.** Michael had been sleeping on Big Tony’s floor for several months by the time they made the initial visit to Briarcrest.

The decision to enroll in Briarcrest was due to the new head basketball coach, a man named John Harrington, whom Big Tony had known when John coached in the public schools. Big Tony told John about the two boys, and John referred them to the football coach, Hugh Freeze, who’d had an 8-year storied career with both the football team and girls basketball team.

Although Hugh was impressed with Big Tony’s desire to get Steven a better education, he doubted whether the boy’s grades were actually good enough to get into Briarcrest. He also doubted whether Big Tony would be able to afford the tuition. He also didn’t think much when Big Tony told him about Michael, a large kid who played basketball but might be of benefit on a football team. It wasn’t until the boys walked into the office that Hugh had a change of heart.

After shyly peeking around the corner, **Michael walked in and filled the room like a house. He was close to 6’5” and around 330 pounds at 16**. Hugh told Big Tony to bring him the boys’ transcripts, and he’d see what he could do.

### A Boy With No Future

Steven was a shoo-in for Briarcrest because of his excellent transcript, but Michael’s was the antithesis. He’d attended 11 schools in 9 years, was truant often, and had repeated both the first and second grades. Michael tested at an IQ of 80 and had no discernable learning skills. He’d been moved up the chain of the public school system, which tended to give every student the minimum grade required to graduate to become someone else’s problem. **Michael’s transcript showed the consequence of this educational history: a 0.6 overall GPA. There was no way this kid was getting into this school.**

Yet, Hugh still sent the transcript to Principal Steve Simpson, also new to Briarcrest, who was kind-hearted despite his cool demeanor. Simpson understood what had happened to Michael in the public school system, having come from that system himself, but there was nothing he could do. He told the large mute boy and Big Tony that he couldn’t recommend entry at this time. But if Michael did well in a home-study program for the Fall semester, he could enroll in Briarcrest.

What Principal Simpson failed to realize was that Michael had no understanding of how to study and no support system to help him. Big Tony was too busy with work to help him, and Michael was struggling. Big Tony didn’t know what to do now that it was too late to enroll in regular public school. **When Simpson realized that the false hope he’d given them had hurt the boy’s education, he felt compelled to make it up to him. He convinced the school’s president to give Michael a chance**. In the middle of the first semester, Michael became a student at Briarcrest on the condition that he couldn’t play sports unless he maintained good grades.

This task was harder than anyone imagined. Michael had been given every test possible growing up to determine why he struggled so much in school. All the tests concluded that he did not have a learning disability and was just stupid. This was the information Jennifer Graves, the special needs program director, was given on Michael’s first day. The fact that Michael didn’t speak or look up from the ground didn’t help matters. She had no idea why Michael was let into the school or how she was supposed to help him, but the task had fallen to her.

Jennifer learned how much Michael didn’t know about everything, not just school. **He didn’t know the basic mechanics of the English language, what the ocean was, who the tooth fairy was, or how to interact with others.** But he was kind. After she scolded him for scaring a young child who’d tried to talk to him, she saw Michael smiling and engaging with a group of children the next day.

But kindness didn’t pass tests, and Michael rarely even started them. The other teachers were becoming resentful of this large black child incapable of learning, so Jennifer and another teacher decided to administer his next test verbally one-on-one. They quickly saw that Michael was overwhelmed by the complicated questions on the test, but he did better if they broke them down into simple phrases and walked him through them word for word. After an hour, they realized Michael wasn’t stupid. He was absorbing information but didn’t know what to do with it.

Michael scored a C on the test, which brought his semester grade up from an F to a D. He still couldn’t play sports, but he could stay at the school.

### The Tuohy Family

Michael had hoped to try out for the basketball team when his grades were good enough, and **he spent his free time watching the team practice from the gym bleachers. This was where Sean Tuohy first spoke to Michael**. He’d heard of him before from his daughter, Collins, who was a student at Briarcrest, and he’d seen him in the hallways several times. But that day, he decided to approach Michael.

Sean was very familiar with the black students at Briarcrest. Many of them ran track with Collins, and over the years, he’d taken on the role as a sort of life coach and guardian angel for many of them. He’d donated money to the school to be used for scholarships for students who couldn’t afford the tuition and paid for many of the black students to eat lunch daily.

Not having lunch at school was something Sean was familiar with. **Sean grew up poor in New Orleans and had attended a private school where his father coached basketball. He received a full-ride scholarship to Ole Miss and was later drafted into the NBA.** But his basketball career ended shortly after, and with his college sweetheart, Leigh Anne, he moved back to Memphis and became a self-made man. He owned 85 chain restaurants and a private jet. He was a born-again Christian and started one of the most popular evangelical churches in Memphis. He was also the voice of the Memphis Grizzlies.

Sean was a man of action and was interested in helping others achieve their potential. He often helped the basketball coaches at Briarcrest as a consultant, which was why he was there the day he met Michael. He recognized that Michael always wore the same clothes—cutoff jeans and a large t-shirt—and figured he probably didn’t have money for lunch. **After offering Michael money for food and being turned down, he put money in Michael’s school account to pay for lunch for the rest of the year.**

Shortly after this first encounter, Sean and Leigh Anne saw Michael getting off a bus on Thanksgiving day wearing the same old clothes. It was freezing out, and they pulled over to ask him what he was doing. Micheal was headed to the school gymnasium to see if he could get in and stay warm. When the Tuohys drove off, Leigh Anne was crying.

#### The Lord’s Work

Leigh Anne was born and raised in Memphis and was part of the first Briarcrest graduating class. She owned an interior decorating business and often did philanthropic work. **When she decided to help Michael the next day, she saw it simply as God’s work.** She and her family had plenty of money, and it was their duty to God to use it well.

Helping a young black kid was not what Leigh Anne was raised to do. Her father was a strict racist who taught her to fear black people. But after meeting Sean, she saw how accepting he was and followed suit. She was known for having a big heart and a tough-as-nails personality. When she set her mind to something, there was nothing that could stop her from succeeding. And that Thanksgiving day, Leigh Anne set her mind to helping Michael.

Leigh Anne picked Michael up from school not long after the Thanksgiving encounter. She asked him about his life, but he was silent, like always. **She looked at Michael with compassion and said they could do it the easy way or the hard way, but she was going to learn about his home life one way or another.** Michael finally opened up and told her he hadn’t seen his father or sisters in years and didn’t know where they were. His grandmother was dead, and his mother was, from what Leigh Anne could surmise, an alcoholic. Leigh Anne wanted to keep digging into Michael’s past, but she was satisfied for now.

Leigh Anne didn’t want to make Michael feel bad or awkward by taking him to high-end stores like Ralph Lauren or Brooks Brothers, so she asked him where he wanted to go. He told her there was a store for big and tall men in his neighborhood, but he thought it was too dangerous for her to go. She said she wasn’t worried. She knew he’d take care of her.

After a day of shopping and finding only a few items that would fit him, including a striped rugby shirt, Leigh Anne drove him home to the west side. When she tried to get out to help with the bags, he told her to stay inside the car and lock the doors.

**Something about Michael stayed with Leigh Anne after that experience. She saw that he was kind, sweet, and gentle, and she’d felt safe with him around.** She wanted to do more and asked a high-profile NFL client to help gather some clothes from his teammates for Michael. Both were surprised when the client, a Redskins’ quarterback, said no one on the team was as big as Michael. They were dumbfounded and wondered who this kid was.
