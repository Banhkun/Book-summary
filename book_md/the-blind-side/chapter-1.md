## Chapter 1: A New Era for the NFL

#### Shortform Note

Michael Lewis's _The Blind Side_ is mainly a biography of a young man’s journey to beat the odds and become successful. But within the book’s pages is another story, one regarding the history of the NFL that created a path for Michael Oher’s success. Only a portion of the book’s football history is included in the summary to provide an understanding of the diverging factors that helped Michael succeed. For football fans who want to learn more, there are other examples of games and players affected by the changes in the NFL in the book that don’t pertain to the main story.

We’ve organized the information into seven chapters to keep the summary focused on Michael’s journey.

### The NFL’s Evolution

There’s a moment in the National Football League’s long history that many will never forget. The day was November 18, 1985, and the New York Giants were playing the Washington Redskins. The second quarter was just underway. The score was 7-7, and the Redskins had the ball.

Thirty-six-year-old Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann was a veteran with 163 games under his belt, including two Super Bowl appearances and one championship. He received the snap and looked downfield for a play. He saw no threats in front of him and dodged the few Giant defenders who came at him. But there was activity on another part of the field he couldn’t see, and that activity centered around the Giants’ right-side pass rusher, Lawrence Taylor. Taylor had broken free of the Redskins’ offensive linemen and was coming in hot on Theismann’s left side.

What happened next was memorable for two reasons: 1) The play ended in such a catastrophic way that the images replayed over and over again on ABC would never be erased from memory, and 2) **The play was a significant reminder of how the game was changing and the necessity of all teams to adapt because of the work of two men.**

### A Changing of the Guards

**Lawrence Taylor changed the game of professional football upon his arrival in 1981.** He introduced the element of fear in both the players and coaches that created a shift in priorities.

Fear is not a word often used when describing professional football players. By the time a player has reached the NFL, he’s played in enough games and taken enough hits that fear seems like it should be a distant memory. But when the Giants drafted Taylor and subsequently hired defensive coach Bill Parcells the same year, the combination created fear in the hearts of all coaches, offensive linemen, and quarterbacks across the league.

Parcells understood that fear was a beneficial aspect of the game. His goal was not only to stop the offensive line of scrimmage but also mess with the heads of the opposing quarterbacks. He wanted to instill a sense of panic, a lack of confidence, and an equilibrium disruption that would cause the quarterback to make rushed and misguided plays. And he had the perfect player in Taylor to carry out this plan.

**Taylor was not your typical left tackle. He was large, tall, and fast, a combination not often seen.** He was driven and believed he was the greatest player to enter the NFL. Where other players saw winning as a way to keep their jobs, Taylor saw it as his way of life. He wanted to win at any cost, and his sole mission was to destroy the opposing quarterback.

Taylor was out for blood and pursued his mission with zeal. He was like a freight train coming full speed down the field, and most offensive linemen couldn’t handle him. The threat of the violent encounters with Taylor created anxiety in them. One lineman who’d played for 11 years actually retired three years after Taylor entered the league. His fear of Taylor had become so great, he became ineffective.

Today, the quarterback sack is a popular play in the NFL, but before 1982, there was no statistic for it. **Taylor wasn’t the first player to lock his crosshairs on the quarterback, but he was so good at it during his first season, the league decided to create an official stat for it.** A sack is technically when the quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage. But for Taylor, a sack was when the quarterback was hit so hard, he saw triple and forgot where he was.

But more than intimidating the offensive linemen, Taylor’s fury was felt deep in the hearts of the quarterbacks. Quarterbacks became so scared of being hit by Taylor, it messed up their games. They would lose track of plays or snap counts after seeing Taylor line up on the field. One even called a time-out before the play began because he couldn’t see where Taylor was. **Taylor was so effective coming from the quarterback’s left side for a surprise sack that players and coaches started referring to it as _the blind side_**. Most quarterbacks were right-handed.

Entire plays were designed simply to stop Taylor. Coaches lined up two or three men to handle him, which often did the job but created other gaps that left the quarterback vulnerable. Everything coaches knew about how to approach the defensive line went out the window because of the freak of nature that was Taylor. A new type of player would be needed to stop that kind of killing machine.

### The Wake-Up Call

The Redskins’ coach had done everything possible to prepare his team for Taylor. On the whiteboard during practices leading up to the November game, all other players were indicated with either an X for defensive or O for offensive except Taylor. His number “56” was written in red and circled to burn his position into the players’ heads. But it didn’t matter.

During that fateful play in November, Taylor got away from two offensive linemen on Theismann’s blind side, and the quarterback never saw him coming. Taylor jackknifed Theismann from behind, folding him in half, and landed on his leg. The break sounded like a gunshot to the players watching on the sidelines. When the dust had settled, Theismann lay on the ground with a broken tibia and fibula, and the bone was sticking out of his leg. He was carried out on a stretcher and would never play another minute of football again.

**This wasn’t the first player’s career Taylor had ended, and everyone knew it wouldn’t be the last if they didn’t do something.**

### The Road Less Traveled: Passing in the NFL

The relationship between Taylor and the need for a congruent left tackle position is clear. But the explanation for why this need was allowed to happen is another story. Conceivably, to thwart the efforts of Lawrence Taylor, NFL coaches could have simply turned to the running game. This strategy would eliminate the need for the quarterback to be open and in danger.

In fact, **the running game was the more popular option in the 1960s and 1970s. The passing game was a costly enterprise during those decades**. Where a run could yield between 3 and 4 yards on average, the passing game was only providing slightly more yardage at just over 4. And with a league-wide interception rate of more than 6%, running the ball was the safest option. In 1975, most teams threw the ball only 24 times during a game. And if you didn’t have a great quarterback, the rate was lower. So it would seem that the entry of Taylor into the NFL should have made little difference to the way the game was played.

But something else had happened in the ’70s to change how the passing game was played—Bill Walsh introduced the “West Coast Offense” and changed the NFL forever.

#### A Man on a Mission

Bill Walsh was the assistant coach of the Cincinnati Bengals in 1975. High in a press box during that year’s playoffs, he called plays down to the head coach, Paul Brown, during a game against the Oakland Raiders. In the last few minutes of the game, the Bengals were down by 3 points. Their only hope was to pass the ball downfield, something Walsh had been dreading. The Bengals quarterback pulled back and looked for the open man, which gave the Raiders’ pass rusher enough time to slip his defender and tackle the quarterback. Game over. Season over.

In that moment, Walsh knew he needed to design offensive plays that accounted for the blind side rushers. Where Bill Parcells saw defense as the key to winning, **Walsh saw a strategic offense as a dire necessity to the success of any team**. He didn’t see the quarterback as the star playmaker. Rather, the quarterback was the King in chess, whose movements were only possible because of the strategic moves made with the other pieces.

In 1968, when Walsh joined the Bengals, his quarterback, Virgil Carter, was anything but a king. He was incapable of throwing the ball longer than 20 yards at a time, but those short passes were always dead on. Coupled with an inadequate offensive line, the running game was also useless. Walsh had to find a way to get the most out of a terrible situation.

Walsh developed a specific passing system to account for Carter’s ineptitudes, one in which he made short, quick passes to locations already determined beforehand. The receivers had specific locations where they were meant to be, timed perfectly with Carter’s steps. After the snap, Carter took either 3 or 5 steps backward, and depending on how many steps he took, a certain number of receivers reacted in kind.

**There was no longer the need to scan the field and wait for a receiver to get open.** Carter had already decided which side of the field the play would happen on before entering the line of scrimmage. Based on the way the defense lined up, he cut his choices from three to two, and a quick look when play went into motion told him which of the two was the most advantageous. He didn’t have to pay attention to anything else. He took his steps and threw to a spot on the field. The receiver would be there to meet the ball.

The timing for this type of pass game had to be meticulous and automatic. It was tedious work to practice and took most of the spontaneity out of the game. But the advantages were great. First, the short passes were just on the other side of the line of scrimmage, so yards were open to the receiver after the catch, rather than the receiver trying to gain yards before the pass. Second, the quick and short passes lowered the chances for interceptions and incompletions. Third, **the less time the quarterback held the ball, the less time the pass rusher had to sack him**.

In 1971, under this new system, Carter went from completing less than half his pass attempts to completing 62% of them, leading the league. His yardage also went up by almost two full yards. The next year, a new quarterback took over for the Bengals, and the same thing happened. After Walsh was passed up for the head coaching job when Brown retired, he went to San Diego and helped their quarterback lead the league in passing percentage. This trend followed him through two years as head coach at Stanford, and finally, in 1979, Walsh took over as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, who had a 2-14 record the year before and one of the worst quarterbacks in the league.

### Innovation and Success

Despite helping the 49ers quarterback go from a 45% completion rate on 302 passes to a 60% rate on 578 passes and increasing his yardage by a full yard, no one noticed Walsh’s genius. Enter Joe Montana, arguably considered one of the greatest QBs to play the game. Montana was small and weak, and no one thought he’d amount to much, but his first two years with Walsh delivered completion percentages in the mid-60s. Of course, Montana received all the credit. But when he became sloppy a few years later and was replaced by future hall-of-famer Steve Young, who performed at the same high level, people started to wonder.

But **many in the league were not on board with Walsh’s perspective that the system was greater than the individual. It was methodical and dull, and it dampened the ideal of the quarterback god**. But over time, with a Super Bowl under his belt with Young, the trend started to catch on. By the mid-90s, the ratio of passing to running shifted toward the former, and teams passed the ball nearly 60% of the time. Along with that increased pass percentage came a decrease in interceptions, which fell from 6% to 3%.

Almost every team in the NFL after 1995 ran the West Coast Offense. But before any of that happened, Walsh almost retired from coaching in 1980. For 15 years, he’d turned feeble and ineffective quarterbacks into passing geniuses with his system, and no one cared. If he’d left the game at that point, things likely wouldn’t have changed. But he decided to stay in the game, and this decision helped Walsh change the NFL forever for a second time.

### The Intersection of Bill Walsh and Lawrence Taylor

**Walsh had lowered the risk of passing and threat to the quarterback with his system, but that all changed once Taylor stepped on the field.** His freakish body type of brawn and speed had never been seen before, and despite the quicker release of the quarterback, Taylor was fast enough to make it basically obsolete.

Walsh realized he had to find a way to stop Taylor from throwing the rhythm of the West Coast Offense out of whack with his speed. He needed someone who could stop him. Before Taylor, a reasonably sized linebacker was enough to create space for the quarterback. Now, he needed someone much bigger and stronger to stop the blind side pass rush. Enter John Ayers, a ranch cowboy from Texas.

Ayers was 6’5” and 270 pounds and fast on his feet. In the off-season, he wrangled bulls and pulled tractor trailers attached to his body around miles of open field. He was used to rooting his feet and dealing with giant creatures, which meant he was perfect to go up against Taylor. In January 1982, the Giants and 49ers competed in the playoffs. Walsh planned to run 17 of the first 22 plays as passes. He told the broadcasters as much, which meant Parcells knew it, too. And **everyone knew that Joe Montana would be squarely in the crosshairs of Lawrence Taylor**.

The first play of the game, Montana stepped back to throw and Taylor charged on his blind side. Then, suddenly, he ran into the brick wall of Ayers. The pass was completed, and Montana was able to complete 15 of the first 22 passes, which led to two touchdowns and a score of 24-10 at halftime. Taylor became so frustrated, he essentially gave up during the rest of the game. The 49ers went on to win the game 38-24, the most points the Giants had given that season. They followed that success all the way to the Super Bowl Championship.

The two coaches came away from that game with new but different perspectives. Parcells realized that moving Ayers over to left tackle to deal with Taylor created holes for other linemen to rush through, which he started to exploit. Walsh also saw these holes and realized he couldn’t borrow from the offensive line. **He needed a dedicated player at left tackle whose sole mission was to stop the blind side rusher.**

Walsh not only made the passing game the new successful way to gain yardage and win games, thereby increasing the value of the quarterback position. He added value to the need for another equally important position, the left tackle. And although it would take more years and more convincing for other teams to see the light, the light eventually did shine down on this new way of play.

### The Aftermath

By the early 1990s, the blind side became the biggest concern for all NFL coaches, and that concern was expressed with money. The legacies of Lawrence Taylor and Bill Walsh boiled down to a need for offensive left tackles that could stop a massive pass rusher like Taylor. **Taylor had created a prototype of pass rushers, and more and more defensive linemen with size, speed, and agility were recruited.** As a result, a prototype of the left tackle position was also created, one who was just as big, fast, and agile. And since this type of combination in a football player was rare, this type of player carried great value.

Where once running backs and receivers were the highest-paid positions just below quarterbacks, the left tackle now held that status. They were paid millions of dollars a year more than those two positions and their right tackle counterparts, which had been unheard of before. Football was a team sport in the purest sense of the word. Every player was important for a play to proceed successfully, and players in the same positions on opposite sides of the field were treated equally. But Taylor’s influence made the left tackle the superstar of the game.

Much of this push in status came as a result of high demand for exceptional quarterbacks. Quarterback contracts skyrocketed in the mid- to late-90s and often included a guarantee. A quarterback might be signed to a $56 million seven-year contract, but even if they experienced a career-ending injury, they would still receive close to half of that salary. **Paying an injured quarterback millions of dollars to do nothing was a terrible investment for teams, so protecting the quarterback became more vital than ever.**

The need for this special type of left tackle trickled down into the NCAA college ranks. College football once centered around a running game, which required certain types of players that were of no use to the growing popularity of the passing game in the NFL. But as passing became more important in the NFL, colleges started mimicking this strategy, and their teams became essentially farm teams for future NFL players. And because of Taylor, the type of player desired most was the freakish prototype of either the pass rusher or the left tackle.

This change in play in college also meant a change in play for high school football, as colleges started recruiting players that had NFL-level talent. The search for star left tackles ramped up, and one man was the go-to for coaches to find those players.
