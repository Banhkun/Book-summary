## Chapter 3: The All-American

**Everybody knew that Michael was big, but no one was aware of his other talents at first.** John Harrington was the first to notice that Michael was more than just a giant. The first time Michael walked into the basketball gym to observe practice, John did what he always did when a new kid entered his practices—threw Michael the ball. John didn’t expect to see this 300-pound kid dribble between his legs, spin, and sink a three-pointer from the deep corner like he was a 6-foot point guard.

The track coach, Mark Boggess, wandered onto the football field one day, where Michael was by himself with a bag of footballs. One after the other, Michael stood at the 50-yard line and threw the balls between the endzone goalposts. Each throw was perfect and traveled around 70 yards, which was 10 yards farther than the average quarterback could throw.

Then, it was Coach Hugh Freeze’s turn to see Michael in action. During football practice, Michael wandered onto the field and picked up a 50-pound tackle dummy and ran with it at high speed like it was no more than a child’s doll. Hugh also couldn’t believe how fast Michael was for his size and had him weighed. After finding a scale that could hold Michael (a cattle scale), they learned Michael weighed a whopping 344 pounds, or the equivalent of a slim cow.

**All of these coaches could tell that Michael had a raw physical talent. The only problem—the giant sophomore was still ineligible for sports.**

### A Slow Start

After discovering that Michael could learn and pass his classes if the lessons were developed properly for him, Principal Simpson determined that Michael could stay at Briarcrest. He took him off of probation after the first semester and allowed him to play sports. **Michael joined the basketball team toward the latter part of his sophomore year and moved to track and field afterward.** At the beginning of his junior year, he was finally able to play football.

Michael excelled at track and field but struggled on both the basketball and football teams at first. Part of the issue was his lack of aggression, which made him weak defensively in both sports. Neither coach could figure out why this huge kid was so docile. Most kids who come from traumatic backgrounds have an inherent aggression that gets channeled through sports. Football, especially, provides these kids opportunities to express their rage in a productive way, but Michael never did. He lacked that aggressive fire, and his teams suffered for it.

In track and field, Michael participated in field events, like discus and shot put. Michael had no training in either event when he competed in the first meet, but his strength and ability to mimic others’ physical movement helped him come in first. That was the moment **Coach Boggess realized Michael learned by watching movement.** He started showing him performance videos of high-quality field athletes, and by the end of Michael’s track career at the school, he broke the West Tennessee sectional record in the discus and almost broke it for the shot put.

His success as a basketball player would come a different way. Skills and talent weren’t enough to keep Michael in the games his sophomore or first half of his junior year. His lack of defense and inability to play the post position hindered his contributions to the team. Michael thought he was a guard and kept shooting from the outside, instead of posting below the basket.

Then, the team took a trip to Myrtle Beach for a holiday tournament during his junior year, and Michael found his fire. The opposing team’s fans harassed Michael and yelled racial slurs at him. Michael grew angry and didn’t handle it well. He became overly aggressive and, at one point, turned and flipped off the fans. And then something changed. **Michael channeled his aggression into action and stayed in his post position. He ended up pulling down 15 rebounds and scored 27 points.**

It would take longer for Michael to find his niche in football. The first several games of his junior season were poor. He played defensive tackle because of his speed, but his inability to hit anyone made him virtually invisible on the field. His best contribution was to intimidate the other teams with his size, but that faded when they saw Michael play. In fact, Michael was so docile on the field that he had a meltdown when he cut his hand on another player’s face mask. The mask had sliced the webbing between his fingers down to the bone.

Michael ran off the field screaming like a small child, and he wouldn’t let anyone look at his hand. Leigh Anne was in the stands and watched the coaches fail to calm Michael down and attend to his hand. She walked down to the field, marched over to Michael, and ordered him to show the coaches his hand. He slowly opened his bloody fist and exposed the wound. There was no doubt about it: Michael would have to go to the hospital for stitches.

The athletic trainer took an anxious Michael to the hospital. He was taken to the back to get stitched up, practically having to be dragged there by the nurses. Then, a scream that shook the walls was heard. When the trainer reached the room, Michael was dodging and weaving away from the nurses and doctor trying to give him a local anesthetic shot. That’s when the trainer realized Michael had never been in a hospital or seen a needle in his life. Once again, the trainer called Leigh Anne, and once again, she ordered Michael to let the doctors fix his hand.

### What to Do With Michael?

Leigh Anne’s success in getting Michael to accept treatment for his hand all stemmed from that first shopping excursion. After that day, whenever Michael saw her at the school, he sought her out. Leigh Anne didn’t know why he trusted her more than anyone else, but he did. She quickly became his person, and the teachers and coaches noticed.

**By Michael’s junior year, the Tuohys had started indirectly paying for Michael’s tuition along with his lunches.** They were also still procuring clothing for him. Michael knew about the clothes, but he wasn’t aware of the other expenses. Sean was now working with Michael on his basketball game in the few spare moments he had between classes, tutors, and athletic activities. They also covered his medical bills for his hand. The Tuohys believed they were doing everything possible to help this boy, but they found out they were wrong.

Michael didn’t have a stable place to live. He seemed to bounce between Big Tony’s floor and his mother’s rundown apartment most nights. But both were far from the school, and Michael had no reliable transportation. He sometimes took the bus, but he didn’t always have money, so that was not always an option.

**Michael often showed up at school not knowing how he would get home or where he would sleep.** Sometimes, he asked around for a ride or place to stay, and if he couldn’t find one, he’d figure out how to get across town back to Tony’s. Other nights, he stayed on the Tuohys’ couch. But this situation wasn’t stable, and it became less so after the Myrtle Beach basketball game.

Whatever injustice Michael had felt during the game that brought about his fire changed something in him permanently. When the team landed at the Memphis airport, Big Tony’s girlfriend was there to pick up Steven and Michael, but Michael wouldn’t go with her. He’d overheard her talking about him recently, calling him a freeloader, stupid, and a failure. He refused to spend one more night in her house.

Harrington didn’t know what to do with Michael for the night, so he called the Tuohys. Sean decided it was time to do something about Michael’s situation. **Over the next several months, Michael was put up by at least seven families around East Memphis to keep him close to the school.** Then, Leigh Anne offered to drive Michael home after a track meet and found herself crossing the border to Mississippi and pulling up to a dilapidated trailer. Inside was a single air mattress deflated on the ground. Leigh Anne took one look at the mattress and made a decision. Michael was coming home with her.

### A New Life

Michael still slept on the couch but was becoming part of the Tuohy family. He and the nine-year-old son, Sean Jr., became good friends. Finally, **after several weeks of staying at the Tuohys’ house, Leigh Anne asked Michael if he’d like to stay permanently**. She bought a dresser and a futon and showed Michael to his new room. When he saw the bed, he asked if it was _his_ bed. When he learned it was, he told Leigh Anne he’d never had his own bed before.

Leigh Anne set some rules for Michael now that he was staying with them. He could bring friends over if he wanted, even friends from West Memphis, and he was required to visit his mother, even if he didn’t want to. She also tried to get Michael to open up more about his past, but he wouldn’t. Eventually, Sean realized that the past was not important for Michael. He didn’t wallow in what had happened to him, but rather focused on today and making it to tomorrow. He lived in survival mode, and they agreed to let him be.

Still, the Tuohys were able to glean information about Michael’s history from his behavior. For instance, as part of the Tuohy household, Michael could now eat at any of Sean’s restaurants for free. But he always ordered extra food that he brought home for later. After seeing this food sitting in the refrigerator for days, Sean told him he didn’t need to store extra food. He could have fresh food whenever he wanted. Michael said he understood, but he still did it out of habit.

**Hoarding stuff was second nature for Michael. He hid clothes, money, and food for safekeeping, as though he didn’t trust that there would be more later.** He also still had the habit of wearing the same clothes every day despite having several options. Leigh Anne eventually threatened to rip the striped rugby shirt she’d bought him off his body after he wore it for several weeks straight.

Other things gave the Tuohys insight into Michael. He was a neat freak and kept his room and the rest of the house spotless, which was wonderful for the tight ship Leigh Anne ran. But this neatness went beyond the home. He wouldn’t wear mismatched or unpressed clothes or clothes with the slightest spot of dirt on them. He was also particular about his shoes, refusing to buy a pair of basketball shoes until they could find one with a blue stripe. And he also preferred to wear his shoes a size too small.

But the Tuohys saw that these particularities were just part of who Michael was, not an attitude problem. He was still a sweet kid and had become like their third child. In fact, **Michael was such a fixture in the family now, Sean started thinking about what would happen to Michael after graduation and how he could help.**

### The Freak of Nature

Sean and Leigh Anne knew that Michael’s grades would not be enough to get him into college, but maybe sports could. Sean had some contacts at Division II schools and wrote letters on Michael’s behalf regarding his abilities as a basketball player. They also signed him up for summer basketball camps to improve his skills. What they didn’t know was that Hugh Freeze had sent Tom Lemming a video of Michael playing football.

The day of Lemming’s visit, Michael met with him out of obligation to Coach Freeze, but he had no interest in pursuing football and just wanted to leave. Yet despite how that meeting went, **Lemming still wrote in his scouting report that a large junior in Memphis was the most promising left tackle he’d seen since Orlando Pace**. Pace had been chosen by Lemming as an All-American pick years before and was now making $10 million a year in the NFL.

A week later, the Briarcrest football team held two weeks of spring training practice. At the first practice, the Briarcrest coaches and players noticed a group of similarly dressed men huddled in a corner of the field. They were assistant coaches at top Division I college programs, an unfamiliar sight for the likes of Briarcrest. No one really knew why they were there, but it became clear after they saw Michael in action.

The first drill they did was called the board drill, where an offensive lineman and defensive lineman face off on a wooden board to see who can push the other off. Michael was chosen as the offensive lineman, and a 270-pound star in his own right, Joseph Crone, faced off with him. The whole drill was over in a matter of seconds. Michael picked Joseph up like he weighed 10 pounds and carried him down the field.

The phones opened with a flurry that day in 2004, and the assistant coaches scrambled to explain what they’d just seen to their head coaches. **The assistant coach from Clemson actually handed Hugh Freeze his card and indicated that Michael could have whatever he wanted to come play for Clemson.** The Briarcrest coaches were baffled. They’d never seen this type of performance from Michael before. Even Sean was impressed. He didn’t know Michael was any good at football.

After that day, coaches from all over the country, as far away as Oregon, started showing up at practices. Some knew they had no shot at recruiting Michael, but they wanted to see this freak of nature with their own eyes. Shortly after, Lemming wrote that Michael was a pre-season First Team High School All-American candidate, and the vultures began to circle even more.

No one could explain why such a big deal was being made over a player who hadn’t yet proven he was any good in a game and had an unclear history. Not even Coach Freeze understood until the college coaches started talking about the left tackle. **With his size, speed, and agility, Michael was the perfect body type for the position that had gradually grown to the second-most important and highest paid in the NFL.** After he discovered this, Freeze moved Michael from right tackle to left to cover the quarterback’s blind side.

### Dealing With the Past

During one of these spring practices, Michael finished a drill and took a knee in the middle of the field. He stayed there for a long time without saying anything. Sean asked him what was wrong and learned that Big Tony had informed Michael that his father was dead. Michael’s father had been murdered three months before after being thrown off an overpass in West Memphis.

Sean was surprised. He didn’t know that Michael had a father that he was aware of. He asked Michael if he wanted to go home, but Michael said no. Michael was confused about why no one told him sooner, but that was all he said about it. He shoved whatever he was feeling down into the same space where the rest of his past trauma lived.**** After a few more moments on his knee, Michael stood up and continued practice.

That night, Leigh Anne tried to help Michael deal with this loss. She reminded him that he didn’t know his father. She said it might be cold to say, but he might be better off. Michael was going to make a lot of money in the future through football, and his dad would likely try to claim rights to it. Michael understood and agreed with her. **But he also realized something else that night. He was likely to have a future, something that seemed unthinkable before.**
