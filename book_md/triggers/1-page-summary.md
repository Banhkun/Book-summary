## 1-Page Summary

We have a hard time changing our behavior, especially in interactions with other people. We often encounter situations the writers call “triggers” that can sabotage even our best efforts at behaving more positively and productively in our relationships with others. For example, a trigger like an interruption to your work might make you speak curtly to your colleagues for the rest of the afternoon. Or a disagreement with a friend might put you in a bad mood that colors how you talk to your spouse when you get home.

In _Triggers_ , published in 2015, executive coach Marshall Goldsmith and coauthor Mark Reiter assert that **you don’t have to let these triggers control you**. Instead, by understanding how you’re affected by your environment and how you naturally react to it, you can change your behavior and become the more understanding spouse, calmer parent, more patient colleague, or more engaged friend you’d like to be.

Goldsmith and Reiter have collaborated on books such as _The Earned Life _(2022), _What Got You Here Won’t Get You There _(2007), and _Mojo _(2010). Goldsmith has worked with more than 200 CEOs in his career as an executive coach, and the lessons he shares often come from his observations of how even highly successful people struggle to change their interpersonal behavior.

In this guide, we’ll first focus on what triggers are and how to recognize them. Then we’ll examine why triggers are so effective at affecting your behavior. Finally, we’ll look at how you can **become aware of your triggers, define the goals that will best serve you, and do the hard work of changing your behavior**. The guide will also examine how the writers’ insights align with (or occasionally depart from) our scientific understanding of thinking and behavior and explain how you can apply recent discoveries from psychology and cognitive science in your own life.

### Why Triggers Are Problematic

Our environment (and our reactions to it) shapes our actions. We encounter environmental triggers everywhere, and even when they’re minor or short-lived, these incidents and situations bait us into acting in ways we know we shouldn’t.

**Triggers can cause us to lose sight of the goals we’ve set for ourselves**. When reacting to triggers, we might compromise on our plans, behave in ways that harm us or those around us, and generally fail to live up to our standards for the kind of person we’d like to be.

In this section, we’ll look at how the authors define triggers, examine how these stimuli affect our behavior, and explain how to spot them in your own life.

(Shortform note: **A mismatch between your goals and the triggers you encounter in your environment makes it difficult to change your behavior**. _Atomic Habits_ author James Clear, in his guide to goal setting, proposes that many of your decisions are shaped not just by your environment but by the options you see as available to you. The easy decision becomes the default decision. While Goldsmith and Reiter focus on changing how you respond to your environment, Clear recommends aligning your environment with your goals. He says you can do that by eliminating options, creating visual cues to nudge your behavior, and opting into future habits.)

#### What Are Triggers?

Goldsmith and Reiter define a behavioral trigger as **any stimulus you might encounter during your day and react to in that moment,** such as a traffic jam, a string of notifications on your phone**,** or a demanding colleague.****

A trigger can be positive or negative. Some triggers are pleasant to experience, and some are unpleasant. Similarly, some push us toward our goals while others pull us away from them. It’s how we respond to a trigger that determines its effect. Any stimulus in your environment can prompt you to behave in ways you'll later regret.

For example, spending your lunch hour with a chronically pessimistic friend might trigger you to shoot down your colleague’s new ideas without considering them, or getting stuck in traffic might trigger you to snap at your spouse when you get home.

> **How We Perceive and React to Stimuli**
> 
> **Our brains constantly perceive and react to our environments** , which helps explain why we respond so readily to stimuli like triggers. The world is full of things that might attract our attention. But cognitive psychologists say that much of the process of perception happens before we’re even consciously aware of it.
> 
> A lot of this activity seems initiated by the internal processes of the brain rather than triggered by external stimuli. In other words, those processes don’t wait to kick in until there’s a stimulus to perceive: They’re already running.
> 
> This constant processing helps explain why you can react so quickly to triggers. Contrary to the popular belief that we only use about 10% of our brains, researchers have found that most of the brain is active all the time. It appears that our brains even decide how to react to stimuli as many as seven seconds before we’re consciously aware of the decision.

#### How Do Triggers Affect Our Behavior?

**When you encounter a trigger, you experience an automatic impulse to react in a specific way** , and those automatic reactions can damage your relationships. For example, if you snap at your spouse for misplacing some important paperwork, their hurt feelings will last much longer than your frustration at searching for the form.

Goldsmith and Reiter report that many people overcome triggers in high-stakes situations—where we know what others expect of us—but react to triggers in low-stakes situations—where the consequences of falling short feel more abstract. For example, you might remain present and attentive when your partner wants to talk about moving to a different city—a major change for both of you—but zone out as the conversation turns to plans for the weekend. (In your defense, you’re hungry and thinking about dinner!)

> **How Impulses Compare to Habits and Routines**
> 
> If **responding automatically to a trigger sounds like a habit** , that’s not a coincidence. Goldsmith and Reiter cite Charles Duhigg’s habit loop—detailed in _The Power of Habit_ —as an influence on their thinking about how we react out of habit when we encounter triggers. But what they leave out is Duhigg’s idea that cravings power many of our habits, an insight borne out by what we know about the brain and how it responds to rewards.
> 
> Duhigg explains that each time you indulge in a habit in response to a trigger, your brain receives a reward in the form of dopamine. It wants that reward and eventually learns to anticipate the reward when it perceives the trigger. Nir Eyal, author of _Indistractable_ , elsewhere makes a helpful distinction between habit and routine. Eyal characterizes a routine as behavior you perform intentionally (and repeatedly). If you repeat a routine enough times, it becomes a habit: a behavior you engage in with little to no thought.
> 
> We often don’t indulge our habits in high-stakes situations, where we feel stress and want to perform well. In _The Upside of Stress_ , Kelly McGonigal proposes that you have a variety of stress responses, including the challenge response. This response increases your levels of adrenaline and dopamine, which energize and motivate you. Then you feel confident and ready to face the challenge of overcoming a trigger—a boost you don’t get in lower-stakes, lower-stress situations.

#### What Types of Triggers Might You Encounter?

When you want to change how you behave toward others, you first need to identify the **triggers that affect how you treat those people**. You can think of the kinds of triggers you might encounter in two ways: by their nature or by their origin.

##### Types of Triggers

First, Goldsmith and Reiter explain that **triggers can be helpful versus unhelpful and pleasant versus unpleasant in _nature_**.

A helpful trigger pushes you toward your goals, while an unhelpful trigger pulls you away from your goals. Pleasant triggers feel rewarding, and unpleasant triggers feel punishing. For example, your spouse’s exasperated reminder about the errands you need to run is helpful but unpleasant. Conversely, the dopamine surge you get from browsing social media during your colleague’s presentation is pleasant but unhelpful—and hazardous because it makes it feel rewarding to take a step away from your goal.

> **Reinforcement, Punishment, and How We Learn From Our Choices**
> 
> The pleasantness and helpfulness of triggers can influence your choices, but **the consequences that follow your behavior can reinforce or punish those choices after you make them**. Psychologist B.F. Skinner investigated how these consequences influence our behavior and outlined four mechanisms to explain how this happens:
> 
>   * Positive reinforcement provides a favorable outcome and incentivizes a behavior.
> 
>   * Negative reinforcement removes an unfavorable outcome and incentivizes a behavior.
> 
>   * Positive punishment provides an unfavorable outcome and disincentivizes behavior.
> 
>   * Negative punishment removes a favorable outcome and disincentivizes a behavior.
> 
> 

> 
> Skinner’s classic framework can help us understand why some triggers help us move toward our goals, and others undermine our pursuit of those goals. For example, a pleasant but unhelpful trigger might provide positive reinforcement for a behavior that will be unproductive in the long run. Conversely, an unpleasant but helpful trigger might punish us for a behavior that’s hurting us and disincentivize us from continuing that behavior in the future.

Second, Goldsmith and Reiter explain that another way to understand triggers is to**think of them as either environmental or internal in _origin_.** Environmental triggers are external, like a person who brings out the worst in you. Internal triggers are thoughts that keep you from trying to change in the first place or else sabotage your efforts as soon as they’ve begun.

(Shortform note: **Environmental triggers can feel like a big deal, but research shows that we tend to get over them quickly**. A psychology model called the hedonic treadmill suggests that no matter what good things or bad things we experience, we tend to return rapidly to a baseline level of happiness. One psychologist estimates that just 10% of our happiness comes from our circumstances—though knowing that doesn’t make it easier to resist reacting in the moment.)

The authors provide many examples of internal beliefs and assumptions that trip us up. For example, we might feel overconfident about our ability to resist temptation. It’s common to indulge in inconsistency and think that it’s OK to give in to our triggers sometimes, as long as we don’t do it all the time. We also lack objectivity and want to take credit for our successes but blame others for our failures.

> **Internal Triggers as Cognitive Biases**
> 
> Many of Goldsmith and Reiter's "internal triggers" sound similar to the **cognitive biases and tendencies that influence our thinking and decision-making**.
> 
> The authors’ description of overconfidence coincides with what psychologists call the restraint bias. This bias causes us to overestimate the degree of self-control we’ll be able to exercise in a tempting situation.
> 
> When they point out the inconsistency with which we apply our rules, they describe our bias toward instant gratification. Because of this bias, we might put off a necessary but challenging change because we prefer a different, more immediately rewarding, behavior instead.
> 
> Their account of how we lose objectivity, taking credit for our successes and blaming outside factors for our failures sounds like the self-serving bias. In this bias, we attribute positive events to our internal character and blame negative events on external factors.

### Falling Prey to Triggers

The authors argue that, in some ways, giving in to triggers is human nature. In this section, we’ll look at some of the primary reasons why we succumb to the temptation of triggers, even when we know better and want to avoid them and their effects on our behavior.

#### We Don’t Do What We Planned to Do

No matter how realistic we think we’re being, **we’re often overambitious when setting goals**. As a result, we make plans that our environment—or our response to it—quickly derails. And no matter how often we’ve seen it happen, we don’t see it coming. For example, you might resolve to stay calmer with your children as you wake up in a quiet house but find yourself yelling when the morning chaos reaches a fever pitch.

Goldsmith and Reiter contend that this happens because each of us is part planner and part doer. The planner decides to change our behavior. But the doer has to enact that change. Often, the connection between the two breaks down, and **we make plans that completely discount how we’ve behaved in the past,** like putting a task on our to-do list and thinking we’ll get it done even though it’s been on every to-do list we’ve made for the last week.

(Shortform note: We encounter the disconnect between “doer” and “planner” because **we tend to think in two different ways**. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls these “system 1” and “system 2” in _Thinking Fast and Slow_. System 1 is fast and intuitive, and it tends to make decisions that we perceive as automatic or effortless. System 2 is slow and effortful, and it yields decisions that draw on logic and calculation.)

#### We React Negatively When We Could React Positively

Most of us **tend to react in negative and unproductive ways** to unexpected events, another reason that triggers throw us off track. It feels easy and natural to respond this way when you encounter an unexpected provocation. **It feels more challenging to take actions that make a positive and productive contribution to the situation.**

This tendency may play a role in the behaviors that you’d like to change in your relationships, where you’d probably like to be a more positive person. For example, when a colleague annoys you, your partner asks you the same question for the 20th time, or your neighbor makes an obnoxious demand, making a cutting remark feels easier (and more rewarding) than being patient and empathetic.

(Shortform note: A fundamental reason why we often react negatively rather than positively might be that **our negativity bias causes us to devote more attention to the negative** (and to remember it more vividly). Studies have shown that we focus on adverse outcomes and experiences, which can impact the choices we make and the risks we’re willing to take. To counter this bias, psychologists suggest curbing negative thoughts, reframing events more positively, redirecting your attention to an activity that makes you happy, and consciously focusing on positive moments.)

#### We Have a Finite Capacity for Self-Regulation

Another reason we struggle with triggers is that **we can practice only so much self-control in regulating our emotions and curbing our impulses**. Goldsmith and Reiter explain that we gradually exhaust our capacity for self-regulation as we suppress our opinions, watch our behavior, and handle unexpected challenges. At each turn, we become more vulnerable to our triggers.

No matter how committed we feel to changing our behavior, we tend to make worse decisions after running down this gauntlet of tasks. That means **we typically find it more difficult to be decisive or disciplined—and to avoid reacting to our triggers—at the end of the day**.

The authors attribute this to a phenomenon called “ego depletion.” When we’ve used up our self-control, decisions become progressively more difficult to the point that we become reckless with them (or just decide to avoid them by sticking with the status quo).

> **Why Our Experience With Self-Control Goes Beyond “Ego Depletion”**
> 
> To explain the common experience of a sense of finite self-control, Goldsmith and Reiter draw on the theory of “ego depletion,” which suggests that willpower is a limited resource that can be depleted. However, some researchers disagree with the model. Psychologists across 36 laboratories recently tested the theory and found no evidence that the “ego depletion” effect really exists.
> 
> We still experience something like ego depletion subjectively. But researchers think that instead of being a fixed and limited resource, motivation to curb our impulses might be subjective—and we might experience ego depletion because we expect to experience it. The theory is that motivation is elastic, and our expectations determine the amount of self-control we can exercise.

#### We Don’t Push Ourselves Hard Enough Toward Our Goals

**When we encounter a trigger, it can feel tempting to settle for “good enough” and let ourselves give in to our impulses.** But we end up hurting or disappointing people when we decide that we can be on our best behavior later and go with “good enough” right now.

Goldsmith and Reiter use the term “satisficing” to describe how we’re often inclined to go with the good-enough option rather than put in the extra time, effort, or resources to get the best. But they note that we can’t (or shouldn’t) satisfice with our behavior toward other people.

The authors posit that we often satisfice in situations where we have marginal motivation, where we’re volunteering our time, where we consider ourselves amateurs, or where we want to opt out of other people’s rules. We might justify our actions to ourselves, but settling for good enough still means falling short of the goals we’ve set for ourselves.

(Shortform note: **The way we behave every day has long-lasting consequences**. Psychologist Jonathan Baron wrote in _Thinking and Deciding _that every decision we make sets a precedent for future decisions. The plans we make and the precedents we set gradually become our goals. Our goals then determine who we are as people. We often don’t think about the cumulative effect of the choices we make every day, but according to Baron, these seemingly small choices form a substantial part of who we are.)

### Resisting Triggers

Understanding why we fall prey to triggers is the first step; the next step is actively resisting them. The writers argue that **we can stop triggers from controlling our behavior. We’re not helpless against them**. The authors offer many tools you can use to keep your environment from throwing you off course from the goals that you’ve set for yourself.

In this section of the guide, we’ve divided these strategies into two groups. The first group consists of plans or structures you can build ahead of time (or otherwise outside of the time when you’re in a triggering situation). The second group comprises strategies you can implement in the moment to stay focused on changing your behavior.

#### Before or Beyond the Triggering Situation

First, let’s look at some strategies that can help you get ahead of your triggers, either **when you’re planning ahead and anticipating** what your day might throw at you or **when you’re recalibrating after a difficult day** and trying to refocus on what matters most to you.

##### Ask for Help

The writers suggest that you **ask the people around you to share their observations about the behavior you’re trying to change**. You might not know why you’re acting in a way that’s inconsistent with your goals or values in a specific situation. And you might struggle to identify the trigger, like when you end up in a bad mood after a family dinner without realizing that your brother’s remarks about politics make you feel irritable.

Your family, friends, or colleagues can likely point out your triggers. Then, you can come up with a plan to change your reaction. Feedback from other people can also help you see how strongly the environment influences your behavior, which can motivate you to change.

(Shortform note: **Goldsmith has long preached accountability as a powerful tool for changing your behavior**. In a 2002 interview, Goldsmith said that his clients learn more from their friends, family, and colleagues than they learn from him. He believes that anybody in your life can help you change your behavior because they can offer you specific, concrete suggestions. This squares with Gretchen Rubin’s advice on accountability in _Better Than Before_ , where she writes that you’re much more likely to change your behavior if you have others to check in with about your progress on specific goals.)

##### Decide What to Keep and What to Change

Another way to get ahead of your triggers is to **think about what you want to keep and what you want to change**. Even in an area where you have room for improvement, you probably don’t need to change _everything_ you’re doing. Instead, as you identify what you’re doing well and what you’d like to do better, you’ll find that you’ll want to build positive new behaviors (and continue existing ones) while stopping behaviors that don’t serve you. The writers note that that may even include realizing that some things are beyond your control and can’t be changed.

For example, if you want to connect with your partner, you could change your habit of going straight to the TV after dinner by sharing a cup of coffee instead. On the other hand, you could keep your habit of checking in with short texts throughout the day.

(Shortform note: **Committing to changing in the future feels easier** than making a change right now. That’s because the future feels more abstract. Psychologists explain that the farther away something feels—temporally, spatially, socially, or hypothetically—the more abstractly we think about it. This theory, called construal level theory, suggests that when we think about changing our behavior in the future, we don’t think about the practical inconveniences. So we’re more willing to commit to changing our behavior in the future than to changing it right now.)

##### Test Yourself Every Day

Once you know what’s important to you and what you want to change, **you can ask yourself a set of “daily questions” to track your progress.** Goldsmith and Reiter explain that when you know you’re going to test yourself, **you’ll feel more motivated to make productive choices during the day**. In this way, the daily questions can help you stay engaged with the changes you want to make.

These are the steps involved:

**1\. Ask yourself, “Did I do my best?” about each important area of your life.**

Each evening, **measure your efforts toward your goals by asking whether you did your best to meet them.**(This wording helps you reflect on effort, not performance.) Each question you ask yourself should assess a goal that’s important to you—a goal that, when you work toward achieving it, will help you become the person you want to be. For example, if you want to be a more engaged parent, you might ask yourself, “Did I do my best to give my child one-on-one attention today?”

(Shortform note: **Asking yourself whether you did your best helps you focus on actions you can take each day**.**** In _The Bullet Journal Method_ , Ryder Carroll recommends breaking large goals down into smaller, more concrete projects. He suggests asking yourself questions like, “What small step can I take to move forward right now?” Like Goldsmith and Reiter, his advice is aimed at finding realistic steps that, when taken every day, can help you make significant changes.)

**2\. Score your effort on a scale of 1 to 10.**

**Score your effort toward each goal on a scale from 1 to 10**. Think about the actions you did or didn’t take. A score of 1 indicates minimal effort, while a score of 10 indicates maximum effort. You don’t necessarily have to have succeeded to earn a 10. You just need to have made a substantial and honest effort to work toward your goal.

You can even ask someone you trust to help you with this process. The writers recommend reporting your scores to someone else each day. Having someone to hold you accountable can give you more structure to push yourself to change.

(Shortform note: **Scoring yourself on effort rather than performance can solve some common problems with tracking progress**. In _Measure What Matters_ , John Doerr recommends using subjective self-assessment to look at what you did in light of the circumstances. If you only look at objective scores based on results, a low score might fail to capture extraordinary but unsuccessful effort. Similarly, a high score could obscure lackluster effort that, through luck or coincidence, happened to yield a good result.)

**3\. Track your progress over time.**

**Track your answers to the daily questions over time**. The daily questions have their utility in the moment. But if you collect your scores, patterns will likely emerge. For example, if you look at your data and see 9s and 10s for one goal but 1s and 2s for another, you can assess whether the latter goal really matters to you. If it does, you can change something to make a more substantial effort toward achieving it.

(Shortform note: **Paying attention to your progress can help you stay on track**. It’s not enough to score your efforts each day and then forget about it. In _Goals_ , Brian Tracy explains that reaching your goals requires monitoring your progress over time. Tracy suggests setting daily, weekly, and monthly benchmarks that will help you quantify whether you’re moving toward your goals. That way, you’ll be able to make changes if you see that you aren’t making the steady progress you expected.)

> **Criticism of the Daily Questions**
> 
> The idea of committing to **the routine of the daily questions has drawn some skepticism and some criticism** —in part because it’s challenging. Several writers have shared their struggles with Goldsmith and Reiter’s ideas.
> 
> Journalist John Dickerson reports that he tried the daily questions after interviewing Goldsmith and initially didn’t stick with it. Goldsmith told Dickerson that keeping up the daily routine is the hard part—and most people drop it after just two weeks. Dickerson writes that making his list felt like a chore and failing felt unpleasant. But the questions he asked himself in the evening began to insinuate themselves into his days, and he returned to the routine after dropping it.
> 
> Reviewing _Triggers_ , author Art Kleiner gets a little more colorful when expressing his skepticism about the daily questions, particularly Goldsmith’s personal practice, which involves 22 questions. Kleiner characterizes Goldsmith’s dedication to the routine as “a neo-Calvinist 21st-century form of mental self-flagellation,” referring to a branch of Protestantism that emphasizes the independence of individuals. But Kleiner notes that he does want the results that Goldsmith and Reiter promise are possible—and he believes the writers when they say that self-discipline is necessary to make lasting behavior change.

##### Think Ahead

To put yourself in the best position to resist your triggers before they happen, **you can recognize ahead of time when a situation might trigger you**. Goldsmith and Reiter clarify that when you know a particular environment is likely to influence you, you can choose not to engage with it. If you must spend time in that environment, you can alter your behavior to avoid reacting to the trigger.

For example, you might predict that a long conversation with a coworker who disagrees with everything you say might wear your patience thin. You might skip that conversation by taking an alternate route through the office. Or, you might change your behavior by not taking the bait.

(Shortform note: Though it makes sense to prepare for your triggers, **experts recommend against starting your day by focusing on the stressful events to come**. A study found that anticipating a stressful event reduces your working memory’s capacity. By fixating on a stressful event, you feel its impacts before it even happens—and whether or not it happens.)

#### In the Moment

Finally, let’s outline some strategies you can use**as triggers arise** to resist temptation, keep your behavior in check, and stay on track toward your most important goals.

##### Cultivate Awareness

Focus on **cultivating awareness and practicing engagement.** These are two tools**** that the authors assert will help you to notice the triggers in your environment and become more capable of responding to them in positive and productive ways. Think of a trigger as a catalyst: Normally, the catalyst sets off a chemical reaction. But you can add that moment of awareness as an inhibitor to stop the reaction.

We tend to think of many of our reactions as automatic, but they aren’t. If you train yourself to become aware of the impulse, then you can interrupt the progression from experiencing a trigger to reacting to that trigger. And when you engage, then you can choose how to act.

> **Why Engaging With the Present Is Essential**
> 
> The book’s lessons on awareness take on additional nuance when you learn that **Goldsmith has been a “philosophical Buddhist” for decades**. He points out that one of the core tenets of Buddhism is that everything we are and have is impermanent. Your thoughts, emotions, achievements, and possessions are fleeting, and the person you are one moment is not the same as the person you will be in the next. Therefore it makes a lot of sense to engage with the present moment.
> 
> Psychiatrist Mark Epstein, a practicing Buddhist, takes this a step further. Epstein believes that many of us cling too tightly to stories and feelings that have a hold over us and our happiness. So, just as Goldsmith describes paying attention to your triggers but not acting on your natural impulses to respond to them, Epstein recommends simply observing those persistent thoughts or feelings and letting them be what they are.

##### Remember to React Positively

You can’t become the person you want to be without **learning to react in positive ways to unexpected triggers**. It might help you just to remember this focus on positivity. Or, you can use structure to limit your options and attenuate your focus, which leads to better decisions that align with your long-term goals.

For those inclined to use a mantra, Goldsmith and Reiter recommend asking yourself: “Am I willing, at this time, to make the investment required to make a positive difference on this topic?” They shorten it to the acronym “AIWATT.”

(Shortform note: Acronyms like “AIWATT” can aid memory or learning and **help you remember abstract concepts—as long as you make them work for you**. Joshua Spodek tweaked Goldsmith and Reiter’s acronym to make it easier to remember and apply. “AIWATT” becomes “WINDETIT,” which stands for “Will I now do enough to improve this?” Spodek’s version still reminds you to focus on positive actions in a more self-contained form than Goldsmith and Reiter’s.)

Whether or not you use the acronym, you can focus on responding in positive and productive ways. Remind yourself of what you need to do in the present moment and consider whether the action you want to take would make the best use of your time, energy, and resources.

(Shortform note: Staying in the present moment and making thoughtful decisions is a form of mindfulness. Though people use the term in a few different ways, mindfulness is technically a meditation practice that involves focusing your awareness on what you’re currently experiencing without judging it or trying to interpret it. By focusing on the present moment and paying attention to what’s happening around you, you can break out of negative patterns and take a more balanced view of the situations that might typically throw you off track during your day.)

##### Compensate for Flagging Self-Discipline

When you know that a situation will test your ability to resist your triggers, you can **add even more structure to keep your behavior in line**. The writers recommend adapting the salient “daily questions” to check in with yourself more frequently during a challenging situation, as often as every hour. By continually restating your goal (and holding yourself accountable), you create a structure that helps you to practice self-discipline.

Questioning yourself each hour of a demanding workday or a weekend with your in-laws can help you stay aware of your behavior. So even if you don’t score perfect 10s, you’ve still gained the advantage of awareness.

(Shortform note: An additional benefit of checking in with yourself frequently in stressful situations is that **you’ll have more opportunities to label your emotions**. Scientists say that labeling difficult emotions can make them feel less urgent and distracting. Similar to Goldsmith and Reiter, some experts recommend checking in with yourself hourly on challenging days so that you can notice and label your emotions and thereby reduce their power over you.)

> **What Scientists Do and Don’t Know About Behavior Change**
> 
> **Does behavior change work the way Goldsmith and Reiter think it does? It’s hard to know.** However, researchers at the NIH’s Science of Behavior Change (SOBC) program are studying the underlying processes that determine why people fail or succeed at changing their behavior.
> 
> Scientists don’t yet fully understand the mechanisms of behavior change, and research often focuses on the changes that help people live healthier lives. But this work might also help us map what happens in your brain when you implement an intervention (like Goldsmith and Reiter’s daily questions) and see a change in your behavior.
> 
> Even though there’s still a lot that scientists don’t know, the researchers make a few recommendations for strategies you can use to change your behavior, such as:
> 
>   * Thinking about your decisions instead of making them on “autopilot”
> 
>   * Considering the future benefits of changing your behavior now
> 
>   * Identifying stress triggers to anticipate when you might be in a situation that could derail your behavior
> 
>   * Finding people who can support you through the changes you want to make
