## Exercise: Set a Concrete Goal

One of the core tools of _Triggers_ is the set of daily questions that you can ask yourself each night to assess the effort you made toward your most important goals. First, you’ll need to choose a concrete goal to pursue.

* * *

Think about one way that you’d like to change your behavior in your relationships with other people. (Maybe you’d like to be a more present partner, a calmer parent, or a more generous friend.) Write that goal down here.

What concrete action could you take each day to move you toward that goal? (For example, you could take time to listen to your partner, to slow down with your children, or to have a conversation with a friend.)

Phrase that goal as a question that you could ask yourself each night, beginning with the words, “Did I do my best to. . .?”
