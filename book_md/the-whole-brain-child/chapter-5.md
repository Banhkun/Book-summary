## Chapter 5: Integrating All the Parts of Yourself

In addition to integrating _memories_ and different _regions of your brain_ , integrating the various parts of _who you are_ helps you remain calm and in control of your thoughts and emotions. There are many parts of you—including parent, employee, and mentor. There are probably parts of you that are insecure, and other parts that are self-assured.

Think of all your parts as spokes on a wheel, and your self-awareness of your various parts is the hub in the center. On the rim of this _wheel of awareness_ are all the things that can grab your attention—such as feelings, thoughts, memories, physical sensations, goals, dreams, and perceptions of the world around you.

**When you’re in your hub, you can acknowledge all the different aspects of yourself and all the various things that you can give your attention to in any given moment** —such as the mild ache in your back, your lunch options, the memory of last weekend’s camping trip, and anxiety about your upcoming work presentation. If you put all of your attention on one thing, you can become stuck on that rim point, and that one thing determines your state of mind until you change your focus. For example, if you focus entirely on your work presentation, anxiety will consume you.

If you’re stuck on the rim, you may begin to neglect your other rim points and think that just one rim point defines you; in other words, **when you’re stuck on a rim point, you confuse how you _feel_ with who you _are_. **For example, if you focus on your presentation and _feeling_ anxious, then you begin to think that you _are_ an anxious person.

By contrast, from your hub, you clearly see that each rim point is just a part of your experience—meaning that your anxiety can coexist with your hunger and the ache in your back. **Self-integration entails recognizing all of your spokes and rim points and putting them into perspective as parts of a whole.** This helps you to see yourself as a multifaceted person, and it prevents one rim point from feeling all-consuming.

### Choose Where You Focus Your Attention

**The wheel of awareness gives you the power to choose where to put your attention, thus determining your mood and state of mind.** Understanding how and why you feel the way you do is half of “mindsight,” which is the foundation of good mental health. (The other half of mindsight how someone else feels and why, which we’ll talk about in the next chapter.)

**Improving your mindsight requires you to frequently pause and reflect on how you’re feeling, what you’re focusing on, and which rim points deserve your attention.** The more you practice, the more adept you’ll become at focusing your attention, which allows you to choose how you experience things. Rather than being subject to external forces, you become an active participant.

For example, Josh was a high-achieving child who focused on anxiety-inducing rim points, including his fear of getting a B on a test and his worry that he’d botch his solo in the upcoming music performance. When Josh identified other rim points—such as his confidence as a baseball player—it reminded him that there was more to him than his grades and his music performance. With this perspective, he still felt some anxiety about his grade and his solo, but it only represented _part_ of his experience.

Let’s explore some strategies to help your child stay centered in her hub, where she can see and integrate the various parts of herself.

### Self-Integration Strategy #1: Explain That Feelings Are Temporary

The strategies we’ve discussed so far have reinforced how important it is that your child acknowledges and embraces her feelings, rather than denying and suppressing them. While embracing her feelings, **your child also needs to understand that emotions are temporary, and that they don’t define who she is—feelings are states, not traits.** When your child understands that an emotion is temporary and doesn’t define her, she can recognize and integrate her other rim points. Explain to your child that emotions are like the weather: There’s no doubt that the clouds and the rain are real, but you also know that they won’t last forever.

**When your child is consumed by difficult emotions, it can be hard for her to imagine ever feeling better.** If she can’t visualize it in the future, remind her of a recent time—maybe earlier that day—when she was happy or felt differently about the very thing that has upset her now. This will help her to gain a bigger-picture perspective of her spectrum of emotions.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : Help your child begin to understand the difference between “feel” and “am.” Validate how she’s feeling and comfort her if she needs it, but also help her to understand that she will feel differently in a little while.

**Ages 3-6** : The emotional right brain still dominates at this age, so it may be hard for your child to grasp that she won’t always feel the way she feels now. Comfort her and let her know she’ll feel better soon—you may even ask her when she thinks she’ll feel happier.

**Ages 6-9** : Reinforce the distinction between “feel” and “am.” When your child is having a hard time seeing past her current emotion, ask her how she thinks she’ll feel in five minutes, five hours, five days, five months, and five years.

**Ages 9-12** : At this age, your child has the mental maturity to understand that emotions are temporary—however, it can still be difficult to internalize that fact. When she’s upset, first connect with her emotionally so that she feels understood, and then remind her that these feelings will pass.

### Self-Integration Strategy #2: Help Your Child Recognize Her Rim Points

The first step to using the wheel of awareness and successfully self-integrating is recognizing your various rim points in a given moment. **Introduce your child to the idea that she can feel many things at once, and then help her to notice what she’s feeling.**

Use everyday opportunities to illustrate how different feelings can coexist. If she’s upset that her friend cancelled a playdate for this weekend, acknowledge that she’s feeling disappointed, and help her to recognize that another part of her probably feels excited about their plans to reschedule the following weekend, and still another part of her is probably thinking about what she’s going to play during recess today.

Try using the acronym SIFT to orient your child to her many rim points:

**1)** **Sensations** include hunger and tiredness as well as the many ways that emotions affect the body. For example, your child can learn that butterflies in her stomach mean that she’s nervous. **When your child understands that emotions and physical sensations are tied together, she can also learn to relax her muscles and take deep breaths in order to calm herself down.**

**2)** **Images** include images from memories and from your child’s imagination and dreams, all of which can affect how she’s interpreting and reacting to the present. For example, if your child remembers the image of her being picked last for teams during recess, she’s inclined to feel left out among her peers. **When she understands the power these images have on her, she can put them in perspective by integrating the other parts of herself** , such as her role as the confident team leader on a class project.

**3) Feelings** and emotions can be _symptomatic of an experience_ , but they can also _influence your experience_. For example, if you hit traffic on the way to your picnic and it puts you in a sour mood, you're more likely to get annoyed at the noise from the children playing nearby. **If your child can recognize how she’s feeling and how it’s affecting her outlook, she has more power to choose to feel differently.**

Avoid generalizing all emotions into broad categories—such as sad, angry, and happy—and, instead, teach your child about the nuances of emotions. Before your child is old enough to talk, name her disappointments, frustrations, and other complex emotions. As she gets older, acknowledge that, sometimes, she may feel a mix of emotions all at once. Exposing your child to a broad spectrum of emotions will give her the tools to experience and identify complex emotions.

**4) Thoughts** include the things you think about, your self-talk, and how you narrate your experiences. **When your child becomes more aware of her thoughts, she doesn’t have to remain a victim of them—instead, she can direct them in a positive direction and reject negativity.**

When your child practices using SIFT to check in with herself, she can begin to see how all of her thoughts and feelings are interconnected and collectively determine her state of mind. Your child will begin to understand her power to alter any aspect of SIFT, which creates a domino effect to change her state of mind.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : Start to build your child’s awareness of her mind and body. Ask her questions that lead her through SIFT, but offer some specifics to help her along. For example, “Are you tired?” for sensations; “What picture do you see in your head when you think of your cousin’s house?” for images; “It’s frustrating when your sister knocks down your toys, isn’t it?” for feelings; and “What do you think will happen at your friend’s birthday party this weekend?” for thoughts.

**Ages 3-6** : Continue to develop your child’s awareness of her mind and body through questions that hit upon each aspect of SIFT.

**Ages 6-9** : At this age, explain the wheel of awareness and SIFT to your child. Do frequent SIFT check-ins with your child, which will help her develop the habit of noticing how she’s feeling.

**Ages 9-12** : Regularly remind your child of the wheel of awareness, and help her to SIFT through her feelings. The more this becomes a habit, the more control she will feel as she enters adolescence, which can feel chaotic and out-of-control.

### Self-Integration Strategy #3: Guide Your Child to Her Hub

When your child gets stuck on a rim point, use calming techniques that help your child zoom out and shift her attention to other rim points. **As your child notices other rim points, she gets back to her hub, where she can choose where to direct her attention.**

One technique is to bring her attention to her physical sensation by focusing on her breath. Beginning when your child is four or five, guide her through this exercise:

  1. **Instruct her to lie still and quietly.** Tell her to look around the room by moving only her eyes. 
  2. **Point out that there are many things she can look at** —the books on the shelf, the toys on the floor, the TV in the corner—**but she has the power to choose what she focuses on.** Similarly, she can choose what to focus on inside her body and mind.
  3. **Ask your child to close her eyes and notice any sounds she can hear.** Explain that she wouldn’t have been able to hear those sounds if she’d been focused on something else, but she chose to pause and listen. 
  4. **Tell your child to switch her attention to her breathing.** Direct her to focus on the air flowing in and out of her mouth and nose, then on her chest moving up and down, and, finally, on her stomach moving with each breath. 
  5. Instruct your child to continue focusing on her breath. **Tell her that if she starts thinking about something else, to simply refocus on her breath.**
  6. Stop talking and **give your child a couple minutes to quietly focus** on her breathing. 



As an alternative, guide your child to think of a place where she feels calm, and to visualize herself in that place—for example, rocking in her grandparents’ hammock or floating on a pool raft.

**With practice, your child will develop a lifelong habit of using these tools** , which will keep her in the hub and strengthen the neural connections in her brain between this quiet focus and a feeling of calm.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : Use a prop to help your child notice her breathing: Put a toy boat on her stomach while she lies on her back, and tell her to notice how it goes up and down as she takes big breaths in and out. Although you’ll need to keep the exercise brief before she loses interest, she’ll benefit from feeling calm and connecting with her body in this way.

**Ages 3-6** : This is still a great age to use a prop for breathing exercises, and your child may be able to practice mindful breathing for a bit longer than before. Additionally, take advantage of your child’s active imagination by guiding her through a visualization to help her relax.

**Ages 6-9** : Children at this age can have more appreciation for the feelings of calm and focus that they get from breathing exercises and visualizations. Guide your child through these kinds of exercises, and let her know that she can use the same techniques whenever she needs to calm herself down.

**Ages 9-12** : Help your child understand and feel the benefits of connecting with her body to calm her mind. Guide her through breathing and visualization exercises, or look up other calming techniques online. Encourage her to use these tools whenever she needs to, which will give her some feeling of control during adolescence (and for the rest of her life).

### Tips for Parents to Get Back to Their Hubs

**When you get stuck on the rim point of anger and frustration that inevitably comes with parenting, you lose sight of the joy of parenting, and resentment can seep in.**

When you notice yourself getting stuck on one thought or feeling, pause and cool off. You can:

  * Check in with yourself with SIFT. What sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts are on the rim of your wheel of awareness?
  * Be still and quiet for a moment
  * Focus on your breathing
  * Get a drink of water
  * Stretch



Additionally, you can ask yourself these questions:

  * What’s your child’s favorite item of clothing right now? 
  * What was your child’s first pair of shoes?
  * What is one thing your child did recently that made you smile or laugh?
  * Can you imagine what your child will look like when she’s older, on the day she moves out of your family home?
  * Despite the challenges, how do you feel about being a parent? How would you feel if you couldn’t be a parent?



After thinking about those questions, how do you feel? Is your state of mind different than it was a few minutes ago? **These questions distance you from the rim point you’re stuck on, so that you can get back to your hub, see the bigger picture, and direct your attention elsewhere.**

As a parent, the mindsight you gain from being in your hub allows you to:

  * Model the self-awareness and behavior that you’re teaching your child to practice.
  * Keep your cool and show understanding when your child frustrates you.
  * Keep your upstairs brain engaged to avoid flipping your lid.
  * Enforce rules and discipline in a thoughtful, deliberate way instead of an upset, reactive way.
