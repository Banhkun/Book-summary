## Exercise: Develop Your Child’s Empathy

Empathy is a skill, not a trait. Brainstorm how to help your child develop it.

* * *

Describe one or two ways that you could have fun as a family.

Describe how you could improve your child’s ability to interpret nonverbal cues.

Describe one recent conflict your child had in which you had the opportunity to help her see the other person’s perspective.

How could you return to this incident with your child to discuss whether she needs to make amends? Which form of making amends would you recommend to her, and why?
