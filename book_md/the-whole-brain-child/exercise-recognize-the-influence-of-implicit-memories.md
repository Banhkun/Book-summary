## Exercise: Recognize the Influence of Implicit Memories

Your childâ€™s implicit memories may be impacting her behavior more often than you realize.

* * *

Describe one recent incident in which your child acted irrationally, and which you suspect could be due to an unintegrated implicit memory.

When you realized that a past experience was influencing her behavior, what did you do to prevent it from happening again (for example, remind her of the memory)?

Do you think your approach was successful? Why or why not?

Describe one or two ways you could encourage your child to integrate similar experiences in the future.
