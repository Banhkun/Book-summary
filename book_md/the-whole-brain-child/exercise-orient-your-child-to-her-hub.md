## Exercise: Orient Your Child to Her Hub

Your child’s age and developmental level will affect how well she grasps the concept of a wheel of awareness. Brainstorm ways to introduce your child to the principles of self-integration and to direct her to the hub.

* * *

Describe one recent incident in which your child got stuck on a rim point.

What did you do to help her get back to her hub, and how effective was it?

Given your child’s age and maturity level, how could you effectively guide her through a SIFT (sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts) check-in?

Given your child’s age and maturity level, how could you guide her through a breathing or visualization exercise?
