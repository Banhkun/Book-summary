## Chapter 1: The Importance of Integration

The different parts of your brain work individually and in collaboration, similarly to employees within a company. Each job is distinctly different, but they all work together in order to make the company successful; if the company were missing any one of these employees, the organization would either be extremely dysfunctional or fail altogether.

The same is true for your brain. Each region of your brain is responsible for a distinct set of tasks, which we’ll explore in the coming chapters. **You function optimally** —socially, mentally, and emotionally—**when the different parts of your brain are integrated.** Maintaining integration is the basis of the whole-brain child parenting method.

Think of integration like navigating a boat down a river: The ride is smoothest when you’re floating right down the middle, in a balanced, integrated way. If you become dis-integrated and veer too much to one side, you risk getting tangled in the chaos of one riverbank—where you feel like you don’t have control—or stuck in the obstacles on the opposite riverbank—where you become too rigid and attempt to control everything. Dis-integration leads to behaviors such as aggression and emotional withdrawal.

People of any age can have moments of dis-integration, but children face the added challenge of having a brain that isn’t fully developed. Since various regions of the brain mature at different paces, a preschooler is ruled by emotions because her sense of logic is still developing. **You’ll be teaching your child to integrate her mind while parts of her brain are not yet fully operational** , so the strategies we’ll explore have two functions:

  1. Exercise different regions of her brain, which will aid the development of those regions
  2. Integrate the different regions as they develop



### Integration Rewires the Brain

Research shows that experiences shape your brain throughout life. This happens through a multistep process:

  1. **When you experience something, certain neurons** —or brain cells—**fire a charge** through their attached circuits. Which neurons fire depends on what you experience; the smell of pancakes activates certain neurons, while a feeling of happiness makes different neurons fire.
  2. **When neurons fire together, they create a connection** —for example, linking the smell of pancakes with the feeling of happiness.
  3. **Repeated experiences strengthen this association** , rewiring the brain to trigger happiness when you smell pancakes.



As a parent, you shape most of your child’s early experiences—from the way you discipline to the music you play—meaning that you have the power to mold your child’s brain through those experiences. **When you help your child integrate the various regions of her brain, her brain creates these neural connections between those regions.** The more you help her practice integration, the more it strengthens those connections, so that her brain physically becomes more integrated. And, since rewiring continues throughout life, it’s never too late to integrate your own brain using the whole-brain approach.
