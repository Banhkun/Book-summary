## Chapter 3: Integrating the Upstairs and Downstairs Brains

In addition to _horizontal_ integration between your child’s left and right brains, it’s important to facilitate _vertical_ integration between the lower and upper regions of the brain—we’ll call them the downstairs and upstairs brains.

The downstairs brain encompasses the brainstem and limbic region, which are located between the top of your neck and the bridge of your nose. **The downstairs brain controls basic functions, as well as knee-jerk reactions, enabling you to act before you think** , which can be crucial for survival and safety. These functions include:

  * Automatic actions, such as breathing and blinking
  * Strong emotions, such as fear and anger
  * Impulses, such as fight or flight



The upstairs brain comprises the various parts of the cerebral cortex, which sits behind your forehead and right under the top of your head. **The upstairs brain is responsible for high-level thinking, allowing you to think through context, consequences, and the impact your actions may have on others**. These processes include:

  * Analytical thinking
  * Planning and decision-making
  * Emotional and physical control
  * Self-understanding
  * Morality 
  * Empathy 



A mind that’s vertically integrated between the downstairs and upstairs brains is like a house with an easily accessible stairway connecting the upstairs and downstairs. **The upstairs brain tempers the impulses and strong emotions of the downstairs brain, while the downstairs brain contributes emotions and gut instincts to upstairs decision-making.** However, when you experience intense fear or anger, your downstairs brain takes over and blocks the stairway to your upstairs brain.

Children have an added challenge to vertical integration, because their upstairs brains don’t fully mature until they’re in their mid-20s. This makes it even more important that you:

  1. Use the following strategies to help your child develop her upstairs brain
  2. Manage your expectations of your child’s ability to use her upstairs brain



### Downstairs-Upstairs Strategy #1: Engage the Upstairs Brain

When your child’s downstairs brain is on the verge of taking over—whether she’s upset about chores or refusing to finish dinner—you have two choices:

  1. **Use your authority to command your child to obey** , which may get results but will antagonize her downstairs brain in the process.
  2. **Engage the upstairs brain to reach a resolution** , which empowers your child to be part of the solution.



If your child is upset and experiencing a downstairs-brain takeover, start by taking the connect-and-redirect strategy. Connect emotionally by using soft touch and voice to try to identify how your child is feeling and why. When your child begins to calm down and open up emotionally, it’s a signal that the stairway connecting her downstairs and upstairs brains is becoming unblocked.

At this point, engage your child’s upstairs brain by inviting her to help you brainstorm a solution, or to offer a suggestion for negotiation. Encouraging your child to participate in the problem solving has several benefits:

  * **She practices analytical thinking** and decision-making.
  * **She feels self-efficacy** , which lays the foundation for a strong sense of agency.
  * **She reflects on the way she handled the situation** and how she can act more effectively and appropriately next time. 
  * **She has to consider other people’s needs** and feelings in trying to come up with a solution that works for everyone. 



Once you’ve worked together to reach a resolution, address misbehavior, if necessary, and talk about appropriate ways of handling similar situations and big emotions in the future.

#### Upstairs and Downstairs Tantrums

Sometimes your child’s downstairs-brain takeover can lead to a tantrum. Although conventional wisdom tells parents to ignore tantrums to avoid encouraging the bad behavior, that approach doesn’t facilitate integration—instead, use the strategy we just discussed to help your child calm down and engage her upstairs brain.

In contrast to emotion-driven _downstairs_ tantrums, **_upstairs_ tantrums are strategic, manipulative tantrums that a child intentionally throws, in hopes of getting her parents to give in to her demands. **This tantrum requires analytical thinking and decision-making—thus, it’s a product of the upstairs brain. With the upstairs brain already engaged, you can use reasoning to explain to your child why the tantrum is inappropriate and what the consequences will be if she continues to act out. Stand firm and carry through with consequences, if necessary.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : “No” tends to trigger toddlers’ downstairs brains. Avoid using “no” unless you really need to, and try to stay calm and redirect. For example, instead of simply telling your toddler to stop banging the mirror with her stick, engage her problem-solving upstairs brain by suggesting that you go outside together to find another use for the stick.

**Ages 3-6** : When your child misbehaves, instead of responding with a statement (such as, “That’s not a nice thing to say”), respond with a question that requires her to use her upstairs brain. For example, rather than merely telling her that her behavior is inappropriate, ask her to brainstorm a more acceptable way of acting. Give her positive reinforcement when she thinks of a better alternative.

**Ages 6-9** : Do as much as you can to engage your child’s upstairs brain, which is going through significant growth at this age. If she’s upset about a decision you’ve made, explain your thought process, ask her if she has a different suggestion, and negotiate (within parameters that are acceptable to you).

**Ages 9-12** : Your child’s upstairs brain is still undergoing tremendous growth—so use it (and avoid saying, “Because I said so,” which will likely enrage her downstairs brain). Whenever possible, ask your child to help you in decision-making and problem-solving.

### Downstairs-Upstairs Strategy #2: Give Your Child Upstairs-Brain Workouts

The more your child practices using her upstairs brain, the stronger it becomes. If she doesn’t use her upstairs brain enough, it could lose some of its functional capacity, which is especially concerning because **the upstairs brain plays a major role in mental health and social and emotional intelligence.**

In addition to _talking_ about and _teaching_ these skills, it’s essential that you _model_ these behaviors for your children. Since your child learns how to navigate the world by watching your example, **modeling thoughtful decision-making, self-control, self-understanding, empathy, and morality is the best way to instill these values.**

Now, let’s look at the upstairs brain’s key functions, and how to help your child work those mental muscles.

#### Decision-Making

**Decision-making requires evaluating multiple options, projecting what the outcome of each option would be, and then weighing the pros and cons of those outcomes.** When your child is young, give her simple decisions to make, such as choosing which shirt to wear. As she gets older, her decisions should be increasingly complicated and have increasingly substantial consequences.

As long as your child’s decision doesn’t cause significant harm, **refrain from stepping in and steering her to another option or rescuing her from the consequences of her decision.** Struggling through the decision-making process and dealing with its outcomes are both critical aspects of learning, practicing, and building decision-making skills.

#### Emotional and Physical Control

**Teach your child to recognize when her downstairs brain is taking over, and how to regain control with her upstairs brain.** These skills will help her prevent downstairs-brain takeovers, so that she can make good decisions when she’s upset.

Teach your child common calming techniques, such as:

  * Punching a pillow
  * Stomping her feet
  * Counting to 10
  * Taking a deep breath



#### Self-Understanding

**If your child examines how she feels and why, she’ll improve her self-understanding, which gives her the insight to make well-informed decisions, manage her emotions, and understand the world and people around her.** Ask your child questions that look beyond the surface level—not just the “ _what_ ,” but the “ _why_.” For example, “Why did your brother’s comment make you upset?” or “Why did you feel homesick at sleepaway camp?” You can also encourage her to practice self-reflection by regularly writing or drawing in a journal.

#### Empathy

As your child improves her self-understanding, she’ll be able to apply those skills to understanding others, as well. **If your child gets into the habit of thinking about how other people feel, it will lead her to developing empathy and compassion.** Point out people you and your child encounter throughout the day—people at school, strangers you see in public, or characters in a book. Ask your child to surmise how someone feels and why.

In addition to simple observations, show your child how empathy factors into the decisions you make. For example, if she finds a toy at the park and wants to bring it home, instead of simply saying “no,” ask her to consider how the lost toy’s owner might feel if he looks for his toy and finds that it’s gone.

#### Morality

Each skill we’ve discussed builds off of the previous ones—and morality is the culmination of all of them. **Morality involves controlling your emotions, accessing self-understanding and empathy and, ultimately, reaching a decision about what serves everyone’s best interests.**

Ask your child questions that challenge her to consider the morals and ethics of day-to-day and hypothetical situations. For example, ask your child what she’d do if she saw someone being bullied and there was no adult around to help.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : Give your child age-appropriate decisions to make herself, such as which shirt to wear. You may want to offer options instead of making the choice open-ended. Additionally, when you read with your child, ask questions to push her to go beyond the surface. For example, ask how a character is feeling and why, or how she thinks an issue in the story will be resolved.

**Ages 3-6** : As your child matures, give her increasingly difficult decisions to make. At this age, your child can also handle hypothetical questions, so play “What would you do?” games that challenge her to solve a dilemma. For example, ask what she’d do if she found a toy at the park that she wanted, but she knew it must belong to another child.

**Ages 6-9** : Give your child increasingly difficult decisions to make. As much as possible without putting her in danger, let her struggle with the decision and live with the consequences. It’s more important that she learns _how_ to make a decision—even if she has to learn from her mistakes—than it is that she makes the _right_ decision every time. Additionally, talk to your child about her beliefs, desires, and intentions, and speculate with her about how other people feel in various situations.

**Ages 9-12** : Continue giving your child decisions to make, having reflective conversations, and posing hypothetical dilemmas. As she gets older and more mature, increase the difficulty of her decisions and the depth of your conversations.

### Downstairs-Upstairs Strategy #3: Move Your Body to Calm Your Mind

When your child’s downstairs-brain is blocking the staircase to her upstairs brain, physical movement can clear the passage. Not only does your physical state _reflect_ your emotions—for example, causing your muscles to tense when you’re anxious—but research shows that **physical actions can also _influence_ your emotional state, which means that you can counteract intense emotions with deliberate physical movements. **

When you recognize that your child is upset and needs to get moving, always empathize and connect with her emotionally first. Then, there are two ways to introduce movement:

  1. **Get her to physically relax** by instructing her to breathe deeply or relax her muscles.
  2. **Get her moving in a more active way** , in order to get the anxious energy out. Explain that moving around will help her brain calm down and suggest that she does some jumping jacks, play a game like tag, or go on a bike ride together. 



#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : Once you’ve connected emotionally, find a playful way to get her to move—for example, suggest you race to the other side of the house, tickle her, or play follow the leader.

**Ages 3-6** : You’ll probably have no trouble getting a child this age to move around. You may even find it helpful to discuss her emotions while moving—for example, play catch while you talk about what made her feel angry.

**Ages 6-9** : As your child gets older, there are more ways you can get her moving, such as going for a bike ride or doing yoga. Explain to your child how her upstairs and downstairs brains work, and why moving will help her to calm down and give her the power to have more control of her feelings.

**Ages 9-12** : Clearly explain this strategy to your child, so that she can not only practice it with you, but also get into the habit of using it on her own.

### Tips for Parents to Avoid Flipping Their Lids

People of all ages flip their lids every now and then. When you feel like you’re about to flip your lid at your child, follow these steps:

  1. **Keep your mouth physically closed** to ensure you don’t say something you shouldn’t.
  2. **Keep your hands behind your back** to ensure you don’t touch anyone more forcefully than you should.
  3. **Give yourself a short break to calm down.** Tell your child that you need to get yourself calm—this way your child won’t feel personally rejected—and then step away for a moment. 
  4. **Use the physical movement strategy** we discussed to re-engage your upstairs brain: Breathe deeply, stretch, jump up and down, or run around for a minute.
  5. **Once you’re calm, reconnect with your child.** If you lashed out while you were upset, apologize and take responsibility. Do this all as soon as possible in order to repair and maintain a strong relationship with your child.
