## Chapter 2: Integrating the Left and Right Brains

The first two complementary regions of the brain we’ll talk about are the left and right hemispheres—or, as they’re commonly referred to, the left brain and right brain.

The left brain:

  * Operates in **logic**
  * Manages **language**
  * Interprets things **literally**
  * Sorts things into a **linear** order or sequence



The right brain:

  * Operates in **emotions and intuition**
  * Manages **physical sensations** and **nonverbal communication** (such as eye contact, gestures, tone of voice, and facial expressions)
  * Interprets things in the context of the **big picture**
  * Processes **autobiographical memories**(Shortform note: Autobiographical memories are memories of personal experiences, as opposed to memories of information, such as a grocery list.)



**If you rely too heavily on your left brain, you end up in an emotional desert.** You operate only with cold, calculating logic, neglecting your and others’ emotions. In an emotional desert, you lose compassion, empathy, and big-picture perspective. Teens often retreat to emotional deserts, because it gives them a feeling of control when they become overwhelmed by the emotional overload of adolescence.

In contrast, **if you rely too heavily on your right brain, you face an emotional flood.** You’re bombarded with feelings and physical sensations, unable to make sense of it all. Babies and toddlers are ruled by their right brains, because they don’t start developing command of logic until around age 3—however, parents can still effectively guide them to age-appropriate reasoning.

**When you’re horizontally integrated between the left and right brains, you use both your logic and your emotions to understand your experiences, your thoughts, your behaviors, and those of the people around you.** Let’s explore two strategies for helping children integrate their left and right brains.

### Horizontal Integration Strategy #1: Connect With Emotions, Redirect to Logic

**When your child is in the midst of an emotional flood of pent-up frustrations or irrational fears, her right brain has taken over and created a barrier to her logical left brain.** If you try to cut through her flood of emotions with logic, she won’t be able to process your reasoning. Instead, connect with her first on an emotional level, so that she feels understood. Then, as she calms down, integrate her left brain by redirecting her attention to reasoning.

Here’s how the strategy played out in one instance between one of the authors and her 7-year-old son: Not long after bedtime, Tina’s son got out of bed and told her that he felt that she never did anything nice for him, he hated homework, and he was mad that his birthday was still 10 months away.

Instead of scolding him for getting out of bed or dismissing his grievances, Tina applied this strategy:

**1) Connect with the right brain** : Tina recognized that her son was simply overwhelmed with feelings. **She needed to let her son know that she understood and cared about his concerns.** Even when your child’s concerns seem trivial or bizarre, they matter to him, and your response should respect that.

**Tina connected with her son through right-brain nonverbal communication: She embraced him, rubbed his back, and spoke to him in a nurturing voice.** This response gave her son the emotional space to explain that he felt that his brother got more of Tina’s attention, and that homework ate up too much of his leisure time. As he spoke, his emotional flood ebbed.

**2) Redirect to the left brain** : At this point, Tina’s son was calm enough that he could be receptive to some logic. **Tina addressed each of his concerns with explanations and plans, which helped her son connect the emotions he was feeling with logical resolutions**. For example, she suggested that they brainstorm how to make homework more pleasant.

Even if Tina had suspected her son’s complaints were a ploy to delay going to sleep, the connect-and-redirect strategy was the most efficient and effective way of getting him back to bed quickly. If she had simply scolded him, the situation may have escalated into a struggle that would have upset them both and taken more time to resolve.

Keep in mind that **while a right-brain takeover may _explain_ your child’s emotional behavior, it doesn’t _excuse_ your child for breaking rules.** If your child is acting inappropriately, stop the bad behavior, connect with her emotionally, give her time to calm down, and then engage her left brain while talking about why her behavior was unacceptable and what the consequences will be.

#### Applying This Strategy to Left-Brain Takeovers

Paradoxically, **the same approach applies not just to right-brain takeovers, but also to left-brain takeovers, when your child denies her emotions and retreats to her left brain.** The reason is that emotions are still at the root of the problem—your child is simply reacting to them differently.

Use nonverbal cues to show interest in how your child is feeling. Help her identify her physical sensations, so that she can recognize the emotions behind them (for example, you physically tense up when you’re stressed or upset). Once your child reconnects with her right brain, connect with her emotionally, and then integrate the left brain.

#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

Tailor this strategy to your child’s age and developmental maturity with these tips.

**Ages 0-3** : Begin teaching your child about emotions from a young age. When your child acts out, first, identify your child’s emotion, tell her that you recognize that she’s feeling that way, and use nonverbal communication to reinforce your understanding and empathy. Second, after your child feels seen and understood, make it clear why her behavior was inappropriate. Third, suggest an acceptable, alternative behavior, or simply shift to another activity.

**Ages 3-9** : Since your child is old enough to verbalize how she’s feeling, hear her out. Then, reiterate what you’ve heard from her, in order to show her that you hear her and you understand. Finally, talk to her about a more appropriate way to behave, and work with her to problem solve. For example, if she lashed out because she’s frustrated and disappointed that her friend canceled their playdate today, brainstorm another activity she can do today, or another day they can reschedule the playdate.

**Ages 9-12** : As you listen to your child and mirror back her feelings, be cautious to avoid sounding patronizing. Since your child is beginning to grapple with new aspects of maturity and independence, show her respect by clearly explaining the natural consequences of her actions or your reasoning in doling out discipline, if necessary.

### Horizontal Integration Strategy #2: Help Your Child Recount Difficult Memories

Painful and scary experiences can cause a right-brain takeover, even long after the experience ends. Using the same principles as the connect-and-redirect strategy, help your child tell the story of the experience and how it made her feel. This approach applies left-brain language and order—naming the child’s emotions and telling the story in sequence—to the right-brain emotional reactions, which consequently become more manageable.

**While the right brain _processes_ your personal memories and emotions, the left brain _makes sense_ of them, which is what allows you to attain closure so that the memory doesn’t haunt you.** When children learn to organize memories into stories and then share those stories, they can use those skills to work through difficult experiences for the rest of their lives. Research shows that storytelling—either verbally or through journaling—calms emotion-driven activity in the right brain.

For example, after 9-year-old Bella watched the toilet overflow after she flushed it, she developed anxiety about flushing. Bella’s father prompted her to retell what had happened the day the toilet overflowed. He began to outline the sequence of events, and he asked her to fill in details about what happened and how she had reacted. Every time Bella’s anxiety resurfaced, her father went through the story with her. Over time, this exercise helped Bella process what had happened, and her anxiety waned.

This strategy is especially important when your child has been through a traumatic event, like a car accident. Although you may want to steer your child away from the subject in an effort to avoid upsetting her, she needs the opportunity to process the event and her emotions so that she can move forward, instead of fixating on an unresolved traumatic experience.

When you help your child tell her story:

  * **Emphasize how the situation was resolved** , which reassures your child that there’s a solution if the situation were to come up again.
  * **Talk about strategies to avoid a similar incident** in the future (if applicable). 
  * **Help your child create more positive associations** with the thing or the place that has become scary; for example, if your child got sick at school and now is afraid to go back, remind her of everything she loves about school, such as her friends and favorite activities. 
  * **Don’t force your child to retell the story if she’s not ready** or not in the mood. Be aware of the time and place when you initiate the conversation. Children often find it easier to talk while doing some other activity, such as playing a game, building something, or driving in the car. 
  * **Be creative about how you apply this strategy.** If your child resists talking, encourage her to write about the memory, draw a picture of it, or talk to a friend or trusted adult. You can even work with your child to write and illustrate a book that tells the story. 



#### Tips for Using This Strategy at Different Ages

**Ages 0-3** : Even before your child can talk, name emotions as often as possible. When you’re telling a story, you’ll need to do most of the narrating, and you may want to act out certain events. Children as young as 10 to 12 months can benefit from a parent retelling the story of a painful experience.

**Ages 3-6** : Although your child’s verbal skills are well-developed, she may still need to lean on you to lead the storytelling when she’s upset. Start the story, and pause to give her an opportunity to pick it up from there. If she doesn’t, continue to narrate while offering her the chance to jump in at any point.

**Ages 6-9** : At this age, your child can take the reins on storytelling, but she might still need you to nudge her along. As she narrates, ask questions to encourage her to fill in details.

**Ages 9-12** : Acknowledge how your child is feeling, then let her take the lead on the storytelling; your primary role is to ask questions to prompt the story, and to be patient and present as she tells it in her own way and her own time. If your child is reluctant to talk about a particularly difficult memory, encourage her to journal or help her brainstorm another person she can talk to.
