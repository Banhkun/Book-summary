## Exercise: What Style Are You?

Reflect on your reciprocity style.

* * *

Of the three reciprocity styles (giver, taker, matcher), which do you most strongly identify with? Do you feel you give more than you expect to receive?

What style do you think most other people fit into? Do other people tend to give more than they receive, or do they take more?
