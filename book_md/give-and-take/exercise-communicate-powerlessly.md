## Exercise: Communicate Powerlessly

Try to communicate powerlessly to get more of what you want.

* * *

Think of an upcoming situation where you’ll need to impress someone. How are you naturally thinking of making your first impression?

Now try to communicate powerlessly. How can you admit your shortcomings, vulnerabilities in a way that lowers the other person’s defenses?

Think about an upcoming situation where you’ll need to negotiate. Now approach it from the perspective of seeking advice. What advice would you ask of the other person? (For example, if you’re looking to get a raise, you can ask for advice on how to demonstrate the value that would warrant a raise.)
