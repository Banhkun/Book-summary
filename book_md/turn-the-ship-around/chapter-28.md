## Chapter 28: Nurture Innovation

#### Summer 2001: Strait of Hormuz

Eighteen months after Covey’s visit, _Santa Fe_ was on deployment again, operating in the Strait of Hormuz at periscope depth, when the submarine developed a problem. There was an oil leak the crew couldn’t fix at sea and the submarine was running out of oil. However, _Santa Fe_ ’s empowerment culture saved the day.

They spotted a navy resupply (combat support) ship, USS _Rainier_ , several miles away and decided to ask for oil. Protocol required making a supply request 36 hours in advance. However, the crew ignored the bureaucratic process, which was unheard of, and simply contacted the ship and asked for oil.

_Rainier_ ’s captain agreed to provide oil and also to assist in several other ways as well. He invited _Santa Fe_ to send over its outgoing mail plus any crew members needing dental checkups. When the crew members returned from their checkups, they brought fresh fruits and vegetables and newspapers. Because the crew came up with an innovative resupply solution and capably pulled it off, _Santa Fe_ was able to continue its defense mission rather than diverting to port for an oil fill-up.

**The crew was not only _empowered_ to make decisions, but it was also _emancipated_ to make unconventional ones.**

### Mechanism: Don’t Just Empower, Emancipate

It’s necessary to empower people under the leader-leader model because people have been disempowered in the past. But empowerment alone isn’t enough to change the way things work because it’s a variant of the top-down approach (someone does the empowering).

**Along with empowering employees, leaders need to release or free them to apply their talents, energy, and creativity, by getting out of the way**. Teams are emancipated when they have decision-making authority supported by competence and clarity. You no longer _need_ to empower them, nor can you, because their sense of power comes from within.
