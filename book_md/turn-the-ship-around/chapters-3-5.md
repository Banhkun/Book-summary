## Chapters 3-5: A New Command

#### December 1998: Pearl Harbor

Marquet was assigned to command USS _Santa Fe_. His new boss, Commodore Mark Kenny, had pushed for him to get the job of turning around _Santa Fe_ because of Marquet’s hunger for learning during commanding officer training.

Yet _Santa Fe_ was the ship the PCOs (prospective commanding officers) had joked about in training. A photo of the control room crew carrying on instead of paying attention had gone viral the previous year.

Marquet needed to get _Santa Fe_ ready for deployment in six months; it was to join a battle group for a torpedo exercise in the Arabian Gulf, demonstrating combat effectiveness. He decided not to replace anyone on the crew, to send the message that he believed _Santa Fe_ had a leadership problem, not an incompetent crew. But Marquet needed to quickly change the way they operated.

The key personnel on the 135-person crew were:

  * An executive officer (XO) or second in command
  * Four department heads, or officers overseeing weapons, engineering, navigation/operations, and supply
  * Junior officers
  * 12 chiefs—senior enlisted men, the equivalent of middle management; their technical expertise and leadership were critical to getting things done right



Marquet had a chance to try a leader-leader approach, but if _Santa Fe_ wasn’t ready for deployment, he’d be solely responsible.

### Getting Up to Speed

On his first visit to _Santa Fe_ , when Marquet greeted crew members, they didn’t make eye contact. They seemed defeated, having been told repeatedly that their submarine was the worst.

The equipment around the ship was different from any he’d worked with before. So instead of relying on his technical expertise, as he had in the past, Marquet had to rely on and learn from the crew.

**On past assignments, he’d asked questions, to which he knew the answers, in order to test the crew. This time, he was asking out of curiosity and in order to learn.** This unusual position also allowed him to focus on the people and interaction rather than the equipment.

In interviews, he asked the officers and chiefs questions such as:

  * What should I _not_ change?
  * What do you hope I _will_ change?
  * What good things should we build on?
  * What gets in the way of doing your job?



In reviewing what he’d heard, Marquet realized there were a lot of problems with how _Santa Fe_ operated—for instance, delays; screw-ups; careless handling of evaluations, transfers, and requests for leave; and failure to review reports and records.

### A Call to Action

Initially, Marquet spent his time walking around and talking to people. He attended a department heads meeting—everyone was late and the meeting started late because they waited for the CO. Marquet talked afterward to Lieutenant Dave Adams, the weapons officer, who was frustrated because he wanted to improve his department but his ideas were being shot down by superiors. The chiefs working for him weren’t eager to change either.

Adams was running into the problem with the leader-follower model: inertia. However, Marquet was encouraged by the officer’s attitude and desire to improve things.

As another example, Marquet found a junior sailor upset because his request for Christmas leave had received no response, though he submitted it many weeks ago. Procedures called for this kind of request to go through seven people. Marquet tracked it down and took care of it—in this case, the system rather than the people failed.

He also spent time observing the ship’s routines, many of which were pointless or demoralizing.

Despite the many issues, he sensed that the crew still wanted to do well and wanted things to improve. He felt he could tap into the desire for change. For him, the crew’s frustration was a call to action. He decided to go ahead with a leader-leader model.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * Do people in your organization want change or to keep the status quo?
  * Are they frustrated by inefficient systems and red tape that makes their jobs harder?
  * Are managers complacent?
  * Do people focus on covering their butts or on making the organization better?
  * Are you maintaining control or giving control?
