## Introduction

**When L. David Marquet became captain of USS _Santa Fe_ in 1999, it was the worst-performing nuclear-powered attack submarine and crew by Naval standards.** In a year, he turned the crew into one of the best by replacing the military’s traditional “leader-follower” or command-and-control structure with a “leader-leader” organizational model. _Turn the Ship Around!_ is the story of how he did it.

Marquet used the leader-leader model to empower the demoralized crew he inherited. He believed that if they took responsibility for problems and solutions rather than waiting to be told what to do, they’d see themselves as leaders instead of followers. This book describes the specific methods Marquet used on _Santa Fe_ to transform the organization. Leaders in any organization—business, nonprofit, or government—can apply them as well.

### Unhappy Leaders and Workers

**Most people are enthusiastic when they start new jobs—they have energy and ideas, but their initiative is quickly squelched** **by bosses and coworkers** who tell them, “We tried that before” and “Just do what you’re told.” Consequently, they fall in line and do the minimum required.

As a result of this demotivating environment, American workers’ job satisfaction and commitment are at all-time lows. This costs companies billions of dollars in lost productivity. (Shortform note: Gallup estimated in 2013 that “actively disengaged” employees cost U.S. companies $450 billion to $550 billion a year in lost productivity.) Bosses are equally frustrated with employees’ lack of initiative and sense of ownership; they complain about having to babysit workers.

**The unhappiness of employees and leaders stems from the same thing: a leadership model that no longer works.**

### The Leader-Follower Model

The traditional leader-follower model practiced in the U.S. Navy and most organizations assumes there are two types of people: leaders who make decisions and followers who implement them.

The leader-follower model is revered because it has worked. It’s responsible for successes ranging from the construction of the pyramids in ancient Egypt to the factories of the Industrial Revolution.

However, **the leader-follower structure is designed to coordinate physical labor** for various purposes, whether building pyramids and roads, or mining coal. In contrast, many of today’s employees are knowledge workers who work independently to develop and apply information. **The leader-follower model doesn’t manage cognitive work effectively.**

People who are treated as followers become passive. With scant decision-making ability, they have little motivation to contribute their ingenuity and energy.

**Another factor limiting the leader-follower structure is that the organization’s success depends solely on the leader’s ability.** This results in an overemphasis on the leader’s personality and on short-term results. When such a leader leaves an organization or company, performance often plummets because followers are dependent on the leader and can’t carry on without him.

### The Leader-Leader Model

The leader-leader structure is based on a different assumption about people: **everyone can be a leader, and an organization is most effective when everyone thinks and acts like a leader**.

The leader-leader model increases individual motivation and organizational success by treating employees as valued assets with unique talents. Also, the improvements that come with the leader-leader model are lasting because they’re not dependent on a single leader’s skill, personality, or decisions.

#### Trial and Error

Marquet started his naval career as a junior officer on USS _Sunfish_ , an attack submarine where the captain practiced empowerment. One day while Marquet and his team were on “watch,” the captain overheard Marquet comment to his sonar chief that he wished they could practice by bouncing active signals off a passing merchant vessel (usually submarines remain in a passive listening mode). The captain suggested that Marquet simply announce, “Sir, I intend to activate sonar for training.” Marquet did, and the captain replied, “Very well.”

It was Marquet’s first experience initiating and directing an activity—and he and his team were energized and motivated. That feeling stuck with him and he later incorporated it into his own leadership philosophy and practice.

In 1989-91, after further training, Marquet was assigned as an engineer on a ballistic-missile submarine, USS _Will Rogers_ , which was run by a strict top-down commander. He tried to decentralize decision-making among his crew members, but it failed because it didn’t fit within the traditional structure.

Eight years later, Marquet took command of _Santa Fe_ , a nuclear-powered attack submarine. The crew and atmosphere were as dispirited as they had been on _Will Rogers_. This time, however, he resolved to go all the way with a decentralized decision-making approach.

### A Leadership Revolution

With little room for error, a nuclear submarine is an unlikely setting for trying out a new leadership model. But to turn around the beleaguered _Santa Fe,_ Marquet felt he had no other option.

_Santa Fe’s_ crew was the worst in the fleet at meeting Navy performance standards, and its morale was among the worst. But within a year, under Marquet’s leadership, the crew jumped from last place to first by multiple Navy performance measures, including combat effectiveness and retention of officers and sailors. Because _Santa Fe’s_ transformation wasn’t driven by its leader’s personality—but by developing leadership at all levels—its _crew_ maintained the same top performance 10 years later.

Marquet’s effort to transform the operation involved these phases:

  1. Letting go of old ideas to make way for new ones
  2. Decentralizing decision-making while remaining responsible and accountable as the commander.
  3. Increasing the crew’s technical competence and knowledge to enable good decisions.
  4. Increasing everyone’s clarity on _Santa Fe’s_ mission and purpose so individual decisions aligned with organizational goals.
