## Chapter 15: Welcome Outside Oversight

#### January 29, 1999

##### In Port, Pearl Harbor (151 Days to Deployment)

When _Santa Fe_ arrived in port, the crew needed to hook up four shore power cables so it could shut down its reactor. During this process, a petty officer violated a critical rule. He activated breakers on the pier when he knew it was safe to do so, but without getting clearance to do it. No harm was done but he'd violated a “red tag.” Red tags are attached to critical controls on a submarine so that they can’t be removed to activate the controls without going through clearance procedures.

Marquet was tempted to handle the violation in house because reporting it up the chain of command would result in additional monitoring and scrutiny. However, he decided to treat it as a learning opportunity and reported it to Squadron Seven as well as the Naval Reactors unit, which ensured the nuclear reactors were operated safely.

Marquet scheduled a critique of the incident for the next day and invited both oversight groups to attend. **He referred to this approach as “embracing the inspectors.”**

### Mechanism: ‘Embrace the Inspectors’

**Rather than fearing inspectors, Marquet and his staff viewed them as a resource**. The inspectors could spread news of _Santa Fe_ ’s successes throughout the squadron, share the good ideas of other crews, and identify ways to improve the ship.

Welcoming inspectors sent a message that _Santa Fe_ was responsible and in control of its destiny. In this sense, **_embracing inspectors is a mechanism for organizational control._**

In contrast, most organizations aim to reveal as little as possible to outsiders or auditors, especially when there are problems.

_Santa Fe’s_ crew members approached inspections with questions and curiosity. They acknowledged problems and asked for help solving them, an attitude that inspectors found surprising. As a result, _Santa Fe_ typically got high grades and crew members became exceptionally skilled at their jobs.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * How do you use outsiders—for instance, social media commenters and auditors—to improve your organization?
  * How do the costs of being transparent compare to the benefits?
  * How can you encourage your team to view inspectors as resources?
