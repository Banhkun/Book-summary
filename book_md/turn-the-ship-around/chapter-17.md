## Chapter 17: A Learning Culture

#### February 13, 1999

##### Makalapa Housing Area, Pearl Harbor (136 Days to Deployment)

While deliberate action reduces errors, it's not enough, by itself, to build competence. For instance, a sailor made a mistake in the torpedo room that deliberate action didn’t prevent—the problem occurred because he didn’t understand the effects of what he was doing and how certain systems worked together.

If crews only have to do what they’re told, they don’t need a deep understanding of how things work—they just follow procedures. But as their ability to make decisions increases, they need greater knowledge on which to base those decisions.

To create an atmosphere that encouraged learning, officers and chiefs came up with a program they called “we learn,” which established learning as a unifying theme for everything crew members did. **No matter what they were doing, they should strive to learn as much as possible from it.** While life on a submarine didn’t allow time for lectures, it offered numerous learning opportunities, which seemed to pop up everywhere when the officers and crew started looking for them.

### Mechanism: Learn Constantly

_Santa Fe_ ’s learning mentality was critical to implementing leader-leader by passing decision-making authority to lower levels. It created a chain of positive effects:

  * Learning and training increased competence.
  * Greater competence allowed officers to delegate more decision-making.
  * Increased decision-making led to greater employee engagement and initiative.
  * Productivity, morale, and effectiveness grew.



**_Learning constantly is a mechanism for creating competence_**. Inspection teams often commented on the _Santa Fe_ crew’s eagerness to learn.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * What areas of your business are prone to mistakes because employees don’t have the competence to make good decisions?
  * How would you create a learning mentality among your staff?
