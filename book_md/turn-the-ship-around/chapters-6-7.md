## Chapters 6-7: Just Following Orders

#### December 1998

##### On Board the Santa Fe, Pearl Harbor

During Christmas break, Marquet wandered around the ship, where a skeleton watch crew was performing routine duties. **He asked the petty officer on watch, “What do you do on the ship?” The answer was a cynical “Whatever they tell me to do.”**

The petty officer’s reply revealed he was an unhappy follower who wasn’t taking any responsibility for his unhappiness. It was an insulting comment to a commander (implying that the leadership was incompetent). But it also encapsulated the problem and the attitude pervasive among the crew.

### The Wrong Kind of Leadership

The executive officer (XO) on _Santa Fe_ required department heads to check out with him before leaving for the day, so he could go over tasks he had given them to do and ensure they weren’t leaving with something major undone.

But this made the XO, not the department head, responsible for each department head’s work; the XO thus “owned” the task. Marquet believed that the department heads should use check-out to report what they’d accomplished and planned to do, thereby taking ownership.

While it would be risky for the leader to have accountability but give up decision-making authority, this would be better than the passivity of the “whatever they tell me to do” approach, where brains were shut off.

The XO’s check-out procedure was another example of the pervasiveness of the leader-follower mentality. The result was that **out of 135 men on board, only a handful were engaged in problem-solving**. A whole range of procedures like this reinforced leader-follower. _Santa Fe’s_ problem wasn’t a leadership vacuum, but too much of the wrong kind of leadership. The cost was passivity and paralysis.

### Taking Command

As Marquet sat on the stage awaiting his part in the official change-of-command ceremony, he thought of the positives he’d uncovered on his visits to _Santa Fe_ :

  * The crew wanted change.
  * He had a supportive chain of command.
  * His lack of technical knowledge about this submarine meant he had to rely on the crew’s knowledge and ability. This would keep him from succumbing to the leader-follower mentality.
  * **His task was clear: Radically shift the crew’s focus from doing the minimum and avoiding errors to striving for and achieving excellence.**



When the outgoing CO had finished his speech, Marquet stood and with the traditional response, “I relieve you,” he became the commander of _Santa Fe_.

### Focus on Excellence, Not on Avoiding Errors

The Navy’s submarine force was obsessed with reporting, tracking, and analyzing errors, which created a strong incentive to focus exclusively on avoiding them. When Marquet took command of _Santa Fe_ , the crew focused on rotely following myriad procedures intended to minimize errors**.**

While this might have prevented some problems, it was paralyzing and left no room for achieving excellence, which Marquet defined as “exceptional operational effectiveness.” **While understanding and minimizing mistakes is valuable, it should be primarily a side benefit of excellence.**

Marquet decided to introduce change in the middle of the operation, with the chiefs (the senior enlisted personnel equivalent to middle managers). They were often motivated by things like following checklists, passing inspections, looking good, and avoiding mistakes. However, Marquet wanted to motivate them by connecting their daily activities to a larger sense of purpose.
