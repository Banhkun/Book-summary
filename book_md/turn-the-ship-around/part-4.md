## Part 4: Clarity | Chapter 21: Support Your Team

**Along with competence, a leader-leader model that decentralizes control also requires clarity**. Everyone needs to understand the organization’s goals so that the decisions they make align with what the organization is trying to accomplish. If the purpose isn’t clear, the criteria on which decisions are made may be off base, leading to bad decisions.

Here are the mechanisms _Santa Fe_ adopted to ensure clarity:

  * Focus on achieving excellent results, not on rotely following procedures in order to avoid errors.
  * Take care of your team. Supervisors should build trust and motivation by putting the team’s interests first.
  * Be inspired by your organization’s legacy. Create a sense of mission by connecting present efforts with the past accomplishments.
  * Create guiding principles to aid decision-making.
  * Immediately recognize excellent performance.
  * Begin with the end in mind: Set long-term goals.
  * Encourage questions, not blind obedience.



#### June 18, 1999

##### Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (Deployed)

_Santa Fe_ was ready to deploy, two weeks early. They would head west and make a stop in Japan, then operate in the western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Arabian Sea before returning to Pearl Harbor six months later. Besides delivering an outstanding performance, Marquet wanted to focus during the deployment on addressing some needs of the crew.

The officers and chiefs decided to encourage each crew member to set personal development goals during the deployment, such as studying or exercising. In addition, the senior staff set ship-wide goals.

For continuous improvement during the deployment, they set goals for the ship in three areas: empowerment, efficiency, and tactical excellence:

  * **Empowerment** : Senior staff planned to empower crew members to achieve their personal and professional goals through education initiatives, such as helping them to improve their advancement exam scores or take college courses. 
  * **Efficiency** : While the crew gained more control, they would strive for greater efficiency in everything they did, ranging from more effective drills to better meal service.
  * **Tactical excellence** : _Santa Fe_ would pursue tactical excellence, including battle group support, effective missile strikes, and special operations.



### Mechanism: Take Care of Your Team

In the most recent round of advancement exams, Santa Fe crew members hadn’t done well. While Marquet and the officers focused on preparing the submarine for deployment, they hadn’t helped the crew prepare for the exams—exam scores were a major factor in promotions. Marquet felt they’d let the crew down.

Besides increasing training in areas of the test where the crew had done poorly, they decided to create a practice exam for petty officers. They asked petty officers to write multiple choice questions as they studied to encourage active learning. Senior staff incorporated the questions into the practice exam as well as into ongoing training.

The efforts to improve exam performance paid off months later. One of the petty officers advanced, as did 40 percent of the enlisted crew (48 men). Results were even better in the next two years. By giving the crew members tools to improve on the exams, senior staff empowered them to achieve their goals.

**_Taking care of your people is a mechanism for clarity._** Marquet found that when officers and chiefs supported their teams, they developed trust. When crew members believed officers had their best interests at heart, they took critical feedback better and improved, which advanced the ship’s goals.
