## Chapter 27: Assessing the Leader-Leader Model

#### January 2000

##### At Anchor off Lahaina, Maui

Marquet and his officers had read and discussed Stephen Covey’s book, _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , so he was pleased when Covey, who had sought Navy permission to ride a submarine, was assigned to _Santa Fe_.

Covey’s visit, during a short proficiency training run in the Hawaiian Islands, offered Marquet an opportunity to reflect on what his team had accomplished under the leader-leader empowerment model.

This list included:

  * Traveling 40,000 miles safely
  * Making port calls in six countries without any behavior problems
  * Maintaining the sub at total operational readiness, unhindered by any repair, maintenance, or personnel issue
  * Reenlisting 19 crew members while on deployment, setting the bonus award record
  * Awarding 22 submarine qualifications and qualifying 290 individual watch stations
  * Demonstrating key capabilities in the torpedo exercise, transiting straits safely multiple times, and picking up the SEALS.
  * Most importantly, increasing retention from three reenlistments in 1998 to 36 in 1999; officer retention went from 0 to 100%



_Santa Fe’s_ retention numbers increased primarily because of the “Chiefs in Charge” program—junior enlisted men aspired to become chiefs, because those jobs were now central to the submarine’s operation. Prior to leader-leader, the chiefs enjoyed certain privileges but weren’t seen as particularly relevant.

In addition:

  * _Santa Fe_ was awarded the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy for the submarine, ship or aircraft squadron that improved in battle efficiency the most in a year.
  * In 2001, _Santa Fe_ received a record-high grade on its reactor operations exam. 



#### A Different Kind of Leadership

Marquet deviated from the traditional leadership model by:

  * Reviewing people rather than reviewing the work.
  * Requiring fewer reports and checkpoints.
  * Giving fewer orders and making fewer decisions than a traditional leader would, thus developing leadership at all levels.
