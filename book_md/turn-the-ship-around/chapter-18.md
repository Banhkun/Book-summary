## Chapter 18: Ready or Not?

#### February 22, 1999

##### Pearl Harbor (127 Days to Deployment)

As _Santa Fe_ left the harbor and headed for San Diego for a series of exercises with the USS _Constellation_ Battle Group, Marquet discovered another weakness they could turn into a mechanism for improving competence.

As the crew got ready to submerge the ship, it seemed to be taking a long time—they were out of practice on submerging rapidly, which was a key combat skill. The diving officer of the watch conducted a briefing (read the procedures out loud), but no one paid attention to this formality. Marquet ran some unexpected drills simulating malfunctioning gauges, which didn’t go well.

When they discussed how things went, one sailor remarked that no one listened to briefings because they felt they already knew the steps to take.

### Mechanism: Certify or Demonstrate Readiness

Briefings, or reading procedures out loud before an activity, were a common feature in the Navy. However, they were passive—everyone listened; they had no responsibility to prepare in advance, and it was easy to assent without engaging mentally.

**Marquet decided to replace briefings with certifications, in which participants demonstrate readiness and are “certified” to proceed with the task.** During certification, a team leader asked the members questions, then decided whether the team was ready to perform the task. It was postponed if the team hadn’t demonstrated the required knowledge.

Everyone was an active participant. **The certification process required people to actively review or prepare for their duties**. It also placed more responsibility on team leaders, who had to identify the steps needed for the operation and the role of each team member, and determine the level of competency.

The shift from passive briefings to active certifications changed the crew’s behavior. Knowing they’d get questions, crew members prepared ahead of time; the process increased everyone’s intellectual involvement in operations.

**_Certifying, or demonstrating readiness, is a mechanism for achieving competence_. **It’s also a checkpoint—the task will either proceed if people are ready, or it won’t if they reveal they aren’t ready because of something they don’t know. Anything less is just a briefing.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * How can you make team members responsible for knowing their job?
  * How much do your employees prepare before an event or task?
  * Describe your last briefing on a project—how did listeners react?
  * How could you certify that your project teams know their responsibilities and the goals of an operation?
  * How can you take more responsibility as a leader to ensure teams are ready?
