## Part 3: Competence | Chapter 16: ‘Mistakes Happen’

**Decentralizing control under a leader-leader system only works when the people receiving increased control have the technical competence or knowledge to make decisions.** Marquet and his officers used the following mechanisms to strengthen the crew’s technical competence:

  * Take “deliberate action”: Officers and crew pause before acting and state their intentions to prevent acting without thinking.
  * Learn constantly: Officers and crew approached every activity as a chance to learn and improve. 
  * Demonstrate readiness: Instead of listening to a briefing or review of instructions, crew members demonstrate they’re prepared to proceed.
  * Repeat the message of change until it fully sinks in. Old habits die hard.
  * Specify goals, but let crew members decide the best methods for reaching them. 



#### January 30, 1999

##### In Port, Pearl Harbor (150 Days to Deployment)

On Saturday morning, _Santa Fe_ officers and observers from Squadron Seven and Naval Reactors gathered to critique the petty officer’s “red tag” mistake.

The incident underscored to Marquet that it wasn’t enough for people to be empowered—they also needed to be competent to perform better. To improve competence, he needed to understand what had happened.

Others, however, were focused on accountability. The typical response to a “red tag” violation was a procedure known as a “captain’s mast.” Instead of a trial by court-martial, the captain could impose a nonjudicial administrative punishment, such as forfeiture of pay. While it was important to hold people accountable, Marquet viewed the incident as a symptom of a larger problem.

When he opened the meeting, the first to speak was the petty officer. He said he knew conditions for shutting the breaker had been met, and he moved the red tag aside to do it. He was contrite and candid, admitting to an unexplainable mental lapse when he moved the tag without proper clearance.

Maquet thanked him for his candor and sent him away without a reprimand. He felt the petty officer’s honesty, despite expecting punishment, should earn a reprieve. The bigger issue was how to prevent it from happening again.

### Mechanism: Take ‘Deliberate Action’

They discussed refresher training, but they decided it wouldn’t help since there hadn’t been a lack of knowledge about what to do. They considered adding a layer of supervision, but there was substantial supervision already and it hadn’t stopped the error.

Someone argued that sometimes mistakes just happened. Others said the problem was a lack of attention to detail—but telling people to pay closer attention doesn’t work. The key to coming up with a solution was realizing that the petty officer had been operating on autopilot without engaging his brain.

**They came up with a mechanism aimed at getting people to act thoughtfully and deliberately—they called it “take deliberate action.”** The way it would work was:

Before taking any operational action, a crew member would pause, verbally state what he intended to do, and gesture toward the controls. The purpose was to engage the operator’s mind and eliminate acting automatically.

**_Taking deliberate action is a mechanism for competence._** It was the most powerful step the officers and crew implemented for reducing mistakes and improving operational excellence.

Deliberate action had other benefits in addition to reducing errors. In team activities, the pause and verbal statement allowed others to step in when they saw a problem and prevent it. Similarly, it gave monitors, who were assigned during drills to watch procedures to prevent mistakes, more time to intervene.
