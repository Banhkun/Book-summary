## Chapter 24: Recognize Achievement

#### July 10, 1999: The Strait of Malacca

_Santa Fe_ moved on the surface through the crowded Strait of Malacca, between Singapore and Indonesia, because it was shallow. Numerous large vessels, as well as ferries and fishing boats, used it daily, which made the three-day passage tricky.

The submarine’s crew decided it would be safest to follow closely behind an empty tanker, which other vessels would avoid. Marquet was driving the submarine from the bridge at night, when he suddenly saw a dimly lit tugboat that was pulling a barge cross in front of them. _Santa Fe_ had to reverse its engines and managed to stop just before hitting the tow line.

Marquet immediately went below and commended the engineering team for avoiding an accident. The man who saved the ship was the petty officer who had previously violated a red tag. Later, at the crew’s mess, Marquet praised the petty officer for his professionalism and pinned a Navy achievement medal on him. He would later file a report, but used immediate recognition to reward and reinforce outstanding performance.

### Mechanism: Immediately Recognize Top Performance

Typically, the Navy is slow to provide recognition and awards, letting administrative processes get in the way. Yet immediate recognition is a powerful motivator and reinforcer of desired behaviors. **_Immediately recognizing top performance is a mechanism for clarity._**
