## Exercise: Implement “I Intend to…”

To get _Santa Fe_ officers and crew members thinking proactively rather than seeking permission or orders, Marquet required everyone to state their intended actions, beginning with the phrase, “I intend to…”

* * *

How proactive are senior managers and employees in your organization? Do they use follower language such as, “May I have permission to,” “I’d like to,” “Could we,” “What should I do about,” “Do you think…”?

How can you encourage everyone to become actors instead of followers by using phrases like: “I intend to,” “I will,” “I plan to,” “We are…”?

What steps would it take to implement an “I intend to…” procedure at your workplace? How do you think your employees would respond?
