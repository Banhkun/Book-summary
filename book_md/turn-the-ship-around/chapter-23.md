## Chapter 23: Create Leaders

#### July 1999

##### Western Pacific Ocean (in Command)

Being on deployment gave _Santa Fe’s_ officers the opportunity to finalize a set of guiding principles. They wanted the principles to help crew members use the right criteria when making decisions. The theme they came up with was “Leadership at every level” and the principles included:

  * **Initiative** : Take action without direction from above to increase your knowledge, improve submarine operations, and solve problems.
  * **Innovation** : Look for new ways to do things. Have the courage to change and to fail.
  * **Technical knowledge** : Take responsibility for learning your job. Know the details of your watch stations and how systems work. 
  * **Courage** : Choose to do the right thing, even if it’s uncomfortable. Admit mistakes.
  * **Commitment** : Be mentally engaged when you’re working, and give it your best.
  * **Empowerment** : Encourage those below you to make decisions and support them if they make mistakes. Specify goals but not methods.
  * **Openness** : Speak your mind with others and also be open to new thinking.



### Mechanism: Create Guiding Principles

To reinforce the principles, officers used the language of the principles in award citations and evaluations.

**_Guiding principles are a mechanism for clarity._** It’s important that your guiding principles represent the real, not idealized principles of the organization. Since the principles are to be used for decision-making, they need to be aligned with the organization’s real goals.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * What are your organization's guiding principles?
  * How do you communicate them? Are they cited in evaluations and awards?
  * Are they useful to employees as decision-making criteria? Are they used as such?
