## Chapter 19: Don’t Assume They Got the Message

#### March 5, 1999

##### San Diego, California (116 Days to Deployment)

On the way to San Diego, Marquet learned that when you give middle managers control over their teams, you can’t assume they’ll act in the team’s interest. This nearly cost _Santa Fe_ a key crew member.

When they reached the port, a junior quartermaster, nicknamed “Sled Dog” for his work ethic, went AWOL (left the boat without permission), after saying he couldn’t take things anymore. A quartermaster is a naval petty officer with responsibility for steering the submarine and charting its course.

Marquet discovered that the underlying problem was that Sled Dog and the other quartermasters were being overworked. Instead of helping to fill in on watch shifts, the chiefs were choosing the shortest shifts for themselves or not filling in at all.

Marquet was sympathetic to the crew and granted Sled Dog amnesty. Meanwhile, he told the chiefs he was upset that some had used their increased authority to make things easier for themselves instead of looking out for their men. They weren’t “walking the walk” and had demoralized the crew. He imposed an equitable scheduling rule to ensure that supervisors shared in rotations rather than taking better shifts than their crews.

### Mechanism: Repeat the Message

The chiefs’ behavior bothered Marquet—after two months, he thought they were on board with leader-leader, but **they’d fallen into old thinking. He decided they needed continuous repetition of the message.**

When you launch a new initiative, some people will “get it” immediately; others will be skeptical or need more time to absorb it. The key to breaking through is repeating the message day after day. **_Repeating the message is a mechanism for building competence._** Even people who are on board emotionally with a change can fall into old habits.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * What messages do you need to keep repeating to make sure your managers take care of their teams?
  * Have you ever thought that people understood what you were talking about only to find out later that they didn’t get it?
