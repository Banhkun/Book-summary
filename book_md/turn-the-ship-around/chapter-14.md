## Chapter 14: ‘Think Out Loud’

#### January 29, 1999

##### En Route to Pearl Harbor (151 Days to Deployment)

Marquet thought the inspection had gone well, but he was still concerned about how involved he had to be in suggesting solutions to problems. While waiting for the final inspection report, he discussed his concerns with department heads.

They identified several possible reasons for the insufficient initiative. The primary one was a lack of informal verbal communication—for instance, no one gave a heads up that the time to download the radio broadcast was approaching.

**The department heads decided to actively encourage greater communication and call it “thinking out loud.”** When the captain made a decision, he’d go through his thought processes and reasons out loud. Officers would think out loud about concerns. While this might seem like indecisiveness, it would create a more resilient (less error-prone) system. The practice enhanced teamwork and smooth operations.

### Above-Average Results

Commodore Kenny returned to the submarine and reported that the crew had earned an above-average rating. Further, he pronounced _Santa Fe_ “a new ship,” thanks to the leader-leader model of decentralizing control.

_Santa Fe’s_ above-average rating exceeded the mathematical average for the fleet. Marquet broadcast the news to the crew and could hear cheering in response. He cited specific examples of crew initiative and competence, and cited officers for their initiative as well.

While everyone wasn’t on board with the leader-leader model yet, enough people were using the three-name rule and “I intend to” statements to create a new impression of _Santa Fe_.

The success lent credibility to the leader-leader model and laid a foundation they could build on.

### Mechanism: Think Out Loud

**_Thinking out loud is a mechanism for decentralizing control_** because when Marquet knew what his officers were thinking, it was easier for him to keep quiet and let them do their jobs.

Thinking out loud goes against Navy training and culture, which says that when reporting something up the chain of command, you should say as little as possible. But thinking out loud is critical to making the leader-leader model work.

**_Thinking out loud also is a mechanism for creating organizational clarity._ **If leaders just issue orders, people don’t need to understand your objectives. But in complicated environments like those in which submarines operate, it’s critical for leaders to share their experience and background information.
