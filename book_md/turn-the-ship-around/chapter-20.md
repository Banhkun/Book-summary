## Chapter 20: Achieve Results

#### May 1999

##### Under Way from Pearl Harbor to San Diego (28 Days to Deployment)

At sea again, _Santa Fe_ was heading back to San Diego. On the way, they would be practicing drills and operational skills. Final certification for deployment would happen when they reached San Diego. Things were going well, but a fire drill revealed yet another area where following procedure still took precedence over achieving results.

Fire is potentially catastrophic on a submarine. To prevent disaster, crews needed to have hoses on a fire within two minutes. Marquet called a surprise drill and it went poorly. The crew focused on following procedure (in this case, performing assigned duties) rather than putting the fire out. Some ran past a fire hose instead of grabbing it because others were assigned to handle hoses.

Further, typical fire drills were aimed at practicing techniques, which made crews focus on process. They had no incentive to put the simulated fire out as quickly as possible. Marquet decided they needed to refocus fire drills on one objective: getting the fire out the fastest way possible. **The results, not the method or process, would be what counted—just as they would in a real-life situation**.

### Mechanism: Specify Goals, Not Methods for Reaching Them

To motivate the crew to attack the fire, they adapted drills to the crew’s response. If crews moved quickly to douse the fire in 45 seconds, the drill was over. If they got a hose on the fire in two minutes, the drill ended.

Marquet explained to the crew that the objective was to put the fire out, regardless of who had been assigned to handle the hose. Thereafter, when a fire alarm sounded, the men closest to the simulated fire organized themselves and put it out. The new approach reduced the response time significantly. _Santa Fe_ ’s crew became so proficient that they later received awards for their damage control response capability.

**_Specifying goals, not methods, is a mechanism for creating competence_. **The crew was given a clear goal—put the fire out as quickly as possible. During a drill or crisis, it was up to the crew members to devise the most effective method.

#### Ready for Deployment

When _Sania Fe_ picked up the inspectors at San Diego, Marquet felt confident the crew was ready—and he was right. Their performance was outstanding, and Commodore Kenny certified the ship as ready for deployment.

They needed only to return to Pearl Harbor for final preparations and be underway for deployment on June 18—two weeks early.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * Are your people focused on process rather than results?
  * When you set goals for your organization, do you also specify the methods for achieving them, or do you leave the methods up to staff?
  * How can you refocus your staff on results?
