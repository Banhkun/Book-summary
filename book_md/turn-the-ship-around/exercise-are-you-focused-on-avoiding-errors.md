## Exercise: Are You Focused on Avoiding Errors?

In many organizations, managers and employees are focused on avoiding errors rather than on achieving excellence. This drains energy and initiative and results in mediocre performance.

* * *

Are your employees striving for excellence or just trying to avoid mistakes? How can you tell?

How do you as a leader reinforce a focus on error avoidance? For instance, do you spend more time critiquing errors than celebrating successes?

How can you make excellence your focus, while still minimizing errors?
