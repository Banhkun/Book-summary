## Chapter 13: Create a Sense of Ownership

#### January 28, 1999

##### On Board Santa Fe (152 Days to Deployment)

While observing the torpedo exercise, the inspection team also reviewed _Santa Fe’s_ administrative procedures and found that officers hadn’t responded to several messages and requests from higher authorities.

They had been tracking the messages and filing them in a three-ring binder. The officers reviewed the binder once a week to forward requests and keep track of the work, but sometimes they dropped the ball. Besides being ineffective, the system meant that the officers were taking responsibility for the work of others below them.

Marquet attended the officers’ next meeting, where they discussed how to turn the system around to ensure that department heads were responsible for the work of their departments.

### Mechanism: Eliminate Top-Down Monitoring of Work

To replace the old tracking system, they decided to use a model similar to the daily check-out system where department heads reported to the XO for a bottom-up dialogue. They put each department head in charge of keeping track of messages relevant to his department and getting the work done.

**_Eliminating top-down monitoring is a mechanism for decentralizing control._** The system of pushing responsibility down worked, and while they still occasionally missed something they were supposed to report on, the system of pushing responsibility downward created a greater sense of ownership among department heads.

#### How Organizations Undermine Ownership

**In many organizations, supervisors are frustrated that employees don’t take ownership of their work, but company procedures work against ownership.** Instead of _talking_ about ownership, it’s important to establish procedures that _give_ people responsibility and ownership.

The first thing to do is eliminate top-down systems for monitoring people’s work. You still need systems that track data and measure what’s important, but you don’t need senior managers determining what middle managers and others should be doing.

**When organizations are process-focused, they can get into an unproductive cycle**. First, following processes takes precedence over achieving the objective the process is supposed to ensure. Then the goal becomes avoiding process errors. When errors happen, companies add supervisors, whose presence does nothing to achieve the original objective. All they do is point to process errors after the fact.

In the book _Out of Crisis_ , W. Edward Deming presented leadership principles for Total Quality Leadership. He explained there’s a difference between improving and monitoring: **_improving_ processes makes an organization more efficient, while _monitoring_ processes makes it _less_ efficient.** Having leaders constantly checking up on people undermines their responsibility and initiative.
