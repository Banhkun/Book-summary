## Chapter 11: Use Proactive Language

#### January 21, 1999

##### Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (159 Days to Deployment)

During an engineering propulsion drill, Marquet learned how a passive leader-follower mindset on _Santa Fe_ could lead everyone off course. So he instituted a change in the crew’s language to create a proactive mindset.

The engineering drill involved a simulated problem that shut down the submarine’s reactor. The crew had to locate and fix the problem, then restart the reactor. While it was shut down they would use a small electric engine for propulsion at a very slow speed.

Marquet ordered an engine speedup to make the exercise more challenging. However, he didn’t realize that _Santa Fe’s_ backup engine differed from those of other submarines in his experience and lacked a speed-up function. The officer on deck knew this, but he passively passed Marquet’s order to the crew, who couldn’t implement it and so, just sat there.

To create a more proactive mindset among the officers and crew in the future, Marquet decided to require them to actively state what they were going to do in a given situation, rather than ask for permission or wait for an order. They would announce, “I intend to…” spelling out their intentions and he or their superior would respond, “Very well.” Then they‘d proceed with their plans.

### Mechanism: Turn Followers into Actors by Changing the Language

Requiring crew members to announce their proposed actions by stating, “I intend to ... “ pushed decision-making downward. It required officers and crew to take ownership of a situation and decide what to do.

Everyone became actors; they stopped using “follower” phrases such as: “May I have permission to,” “I’d like to,” “Could we,” “What should I do about,” and “Do you think…”

Marquet further extended this concept. He’d found that instead of just saying “very well,” he had a tendency to revert to top-down management by asking a lot of questions. So to counter this, he asked officers and crew to elaborate on their reasoning when stating their intent, so he wouldn’t need to ask questions, just concur.

Requiring a fuller explanation had the added benefit of pushing them to think at a higher level. This was, in effect, a leadership development program. The “I intend to” procedure was a significant factor contributing to an unusually large number of promotions among _Santa Fe_ officers and crew over a decade.

Rather than one person handing down orders to 134 followers, _Santa Fe_ had 135 motivated and engaged crew members thinking about what to do and how to do it. Followers became leaders.
