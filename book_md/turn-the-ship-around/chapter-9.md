## Chapter 9: The Three-Name Rule

#### January 11, 1999

##### Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (169 Days to Deployment)

The chiefs’ new authority generated excitement and strengthened their connection with the sailors responsible for day-to-day maintenance and operation of the submarine. **Both chiefs and crew became more engaged in their work and the overall mood was more upbeat.**

There was also a lot of work ahead. In the months before deployment, there would be an escalating series of inspections, starting in eight days when Commodore Kenny and squadron staff would ride on the submarine and observe. Marquet needed a success to convince skeptics that his leader-leader model would work.

### Mechanism: Change Behavior, Then Thinking

Marquet decided to involve the entire crew by instituting a behavior change that he hoped would lead to changed thinking and morale. His idea emerged from a discussion with his officers about morale. Marquet asked them how they’d know if the crew were proud of _Santa Fe_. The answers included:

  * They’d brag to family and friends, including friends on other submarines.
  * They’d look visitors in the eye and greet them.



Marquet essentially decided to institute that behavior in hopes that a different way of acting would lead to a way of thinking. He established **a “three-name rule.” This required that when any crew member saw a visitor, he would greet the person using three names: the visitor’s name, his name, and the ship’s name.** It would go like this: “Good morning Commodore Kenny, my name is Petty Officer Smith. Welcome aboard _Santa Fe_.”

#### From Victims to Actors

**The three-name rule helped crew members feel proactive rather than like victims or passive reactors**. By taking the initiative to greet visitors, each sailor was taking charge of the moment.

Marquet believed that feeling victimized rather than taking responsibility had contributed to the low morale. For instance—the crew felt deadlines couldn’t be met, parts would always arrive too late, they wouldn’t get jobs they requested, and so on. Practicing the three-name rule helped to break that cycle and introduce new thinking.

**_Changing behavior is a mechanism for decentralizing control._**

#### Questions for Leaders

  * What do you do when your employees don’t want to change the way they’ve always done things?
  * What are the costs and benefits of doing things differently in your company and industry?
  * Which do you do first: change behavior or change thinking?
