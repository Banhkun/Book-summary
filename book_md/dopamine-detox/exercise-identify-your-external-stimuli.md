## Exercise: Identify Your External Stimuli

The key to a successful dopamine detox is recognizing the external stimuli in your life that lead to sensory overload.

* * *

Brainstorm three dopamine-producing behaviors or activities that you canâ€™t imagine going a day without. Examples might include reading your email, checking social media, over-exercising, or eating sweet or fatty foods.

Choose one of those behaviors or activities that distracts you most from meaningful work. Now design your own version of a dopamine detox: Outline an amount of time or time period during which you'll choose to abstain from this behavior or activity. This might be for an hour every day, or one day a week. Choose an option that feels manageable and works with your schedule.

How do you hope this detox will impact your life?
