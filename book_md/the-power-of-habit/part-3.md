## Part 3: How Habits Influence Individuals, Businesses, and Communities

So far in this guide, we’ve discussed how our habits form and the specific elements that fuel them. In this third part of the guide, we’ll explore the multiple ways that habits influence you. We’ll first reveal how advertisers play on your habits to sway your buying decisions. Then, we’ll explain how collective habits determine how a business operates. Finally, we’ll look at how successful social movements in any society rely on the convergence of social habits across various communities and social groups.

### How Advertisers Exploit Your Habits

According to Duhigg, **advertisers deliberately play on your brain’s reliance on automatic routines to influence your shopping decisions**. They know that you’re more likely to buy things that you’re familiar with to avoid making conscious decisions every time you go shopping (because your brain wants to conserve energy.) This is why they try so hard to figure out your preferences—for example, by tracking website cookies when you shop online or your reward cards when you shop offline. These methods allow them to send you customized deals that appeal to your predictable nature and get you back in their stores.

> **Retailers Trick You Into Buying More Than You Need**
> 
> Psychologists warn that your brain’s tendency to operate in autopilot mode when shopping may save you time but it _doesn’t_ save you money. Retailers manipulate their environments to accommodate your habitual purchases and trick you into making impulsive and unnecessary buying decisions.
> 
> For example, a shop may encourage you to add the same brand of toothpaste to your basket every week—without considering the 10 tubes you already have in your cupboard—by placing a large sale sign for the toothpaste right by the payment area. Seeing that your favorite toothpaste is on sale, you excitedly add it to your cart and pay for it before you can consider the wisdom of the purchase.
> 
> Research indicates that you’re more likely to make impulsive purchases when you shop without a list, walk through more aisles, feel hungry, or when your store rearranges its layout. Therefore, many retailers rearrange their layouts periodically, and some shops are designed in such a way that you _must_ walk through every section to exit. Psychologists recommend that you write a shopping list and go straight for the listed items to avoid falling into the trap of making impulsive purchases.

Further, Duhigg argues that advertisers use the information they gather about you to influence you to buy products you wouldn’t normally consider. They know that seeing familiar items (cue) encourages you to go into automatic shopping mode (routine). So, they deliberately sandwich new and unfamiliar products in between your usual items. The more you see the new product amidst your usual items, the more familiar and, therefore, appealing, it seems. Eventually, your brain learns to associate this new product as part of your automatic shopping routine and encourages you to buy it.

(Shortform note: This advertising tactic relies on what psychologists refer to as **the mere exposure effect** —the premise that the more often you’re exposed to something, consciously or unconsciously, the more you like it. Researchers suggest that increased exposure makes things easier to interpret and, consequently, reduces the uncertainty you feel about them. However, the mere exposure effect doesn’t work for something you initially dislike—it tends to only work if your initial reaction to something is neutral or positive. For example, if you dislike K-pop, repeated exposure is unlikely to convert you into a fan.)

#### Advertisers Align Cues and Rewards to Make You Crave What They’re Selling

In addition to playing on your habitual nature, Duhigg argues that advertisers also deliberately align the three elements of a habit (cue, routine, and reward) to fuel your cravings and convince you to buy their products. They achieve this by attaching a particular sensation to their products such as a unique smell or taste to inspire a craving. Examples of sensations that encourage cravings include the tingling sensation from your mouthwash, the satisfying crunch of your favorite brand of chips, or the relaxing scent of your bath foam.

(Shortform note: In _Hyperfocus_ , Chis Bailey further clarifies that the sensations that advertisers use to fuel your cravings are designed to be strong enough to break through your brain’s autopilot mode. He explains that on autopilot, your brain only notices things that are new, potentially dangerous, or gratifying. Since advertisers are aware that you prefer to buy familiar things to save mental energy, and that you’re more likely to avoid danger than seek it out, they frame their products in a way that appeals to your innate tendency to seek gratification. Consequently, they spend millions of dollars on research so that they can create the perfect sensations to make their products _feel_ irresistible.)

### The Influence of Collective Habits

According to Duhigg, businesses and communities rely on automatic routines just as much as you do to save time and energy. However, by their nature, **these entities rely on the collective habits of multiple people to determine how they operate**. We’ll explore this further throughout the rest of this part.

#### How Habits Impact Businesses

Many people assume that business operations—the routines and processes that allow a company to function—rely on a continuous sequence of rational and deliberate choices. According to Duhigg, this is not the case. He argues that **businesses rely on automatic routines to save energy**. Automatic routines help managers and employees get things done without having to question every action they take.

(Shortform note: In _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Clayton M. Christensen clarifies how businesses rely on automatic routines. He explains that a business needs established processes and procedures to ensure consistent operations across the entire organization. Whether these processes are explicitly defined protocols or implicitly understood, they allow both veteran employees and new employees to fall in line with the company’s habitual routines without having to question every decision they make.)

However, Duhigg continues, many of these _collective_ habits grow organically from an accumulation of _individual_ decisions taken by different managers and employees. Over time, the company loses track of the individual decisions that initiated the habits that are now deeply ingrained in the company’s culture. As a result, they end up acting out these automatic routines without an awareness of why they’re engaging in these behavioral patterns. New employees quickly adopt these habits to fit in, and the cycle of automatic routines perpetuates.

Duhigg argues that, when a company is unaware of the automatic routines that underpin its organization, it can easily fall into the trap of adopting deconstructive habits that undermine its operations.

For example, one manager’s habit of missing important deadlines may encourage her entire department to develop a relaxed attitude toward meeting target dates, and this has a domino effect on the rest of the company. To avoid failing company-wide deadlines and undermining their reputation, other employees and managers may develop the habit of compensating for this department’s inefficiencies. However, this habit encourages them to feel overworked and resentful and ultimately leads to further inefficiencies.

> **Businesses Fail to Align Collective Habits With Their Overall Goals**
> 
> Management experts explain that many organizations fail to take control of their collective habits because they assume that what worked historically to bring them success will continue to work in the future. However, this strategy falls short because business priorities—the goals that determine what types of customers the business serves and how it intends to provide value—evolve over time, and the processes (collective habits) they rely on must adapt, too.
> 
> Experts argue that businesses must continually assess whether the processes they have in place support their overall priorities and take the necessary steps to align employee behaviors with the organization’s goals. However, as Christensen points out in _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , company processes are designed to _prevent_ change by ensuring that everyone sticks to the established rules. Consequently, processes, and the habits that underpin them, are very difficult to change.
> 
> What makes these collective habits even more difficult to change is the fact that managers and employees tend to resist change for the same reasons that they develop habits in the first place: to save mental energy. Learning to do things differently increases the amount of effort that they need to apply to carry out their daily tasks. This creates resentment, especially when employees don’t feel like there is a good enough reason to change.
> 
> For example, the manager in the example above doesn’t recognize the consequences of her relaxed attitude since other colleagues always compensate for her inefficiencies. As far as she’s concerned, the system is working. So, when asked to change her approach, she doesn’t feel motivated to change her habitual behavior.

To resolve these types of situations, Duhigg suggests that companies _deliberately_ cultivate habits that support every practice in the company such as communication, collaboration, and morale.

(Shortform note: Duhigg doesn’t offer advice on how companies should deliberately cultivate collective habits. Management experts suggest that businesses begin the process of change by examining all aspects of their current structure and processes—specifically, the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations that prevent change from occurring. Next, define the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations that would support the organization’s priorities and ongoing success. This process encourages businesses to become conscious of the automatic routines that they’re engaged in and allows them to disrupt and improve the attitudes, beliefs, and expectations that hinder their success.)

#### How Habits Impact Communities and Societies

By their nature, Duhigg explains, communities and societies are composed of hundreds or thousands of people who engage in a wide variety of different individual habits. When social movements rock the ideologies that form the foundation of these entities, it’s difficult to see how collective habits play a significant role in these movements.

However, Duhigg argues that every major movement that has impacted communities and societies has been fueled by a particular type of habit: **social habits**. These habits define how you relate to and behave around other people. According to Duhigg, social habits influence the way you identify with and act on the information you’re exposed to.

(Shortform note: Research backs up Duhigg’s claim that the choices you make about the movements you support are influenced by social habits. While you may think that your opinions about all of the issues you hear about are solely your own, social psychologists confirm that your perceptions and behaviors are heavily influenced by other people. You think a lot about other people, allow them to impact your emotions, and feel motivated to adapt your behaviors to please others. Consequently, the movements you choose to follow are an extension of this social influence.)

Duhigg explains that successful social movements rely on social habits in three ways:

**1) The movement begins with the social habits of close friends** : Someone is afflicted, and the people close to them immediately help.

(Shortform note: While taking action to help a friend in need feels like a natural and selfless response, James Clear (_Atomic Habits_) argues that your _underlying motivation to belong_ affects all of your behaviors, including this one. He claims that there are three groups of people that greatly influence how you respond to situations: the close (family and friends), the many (the general public), and the powerful (the people you perceive as successful).)

**2) The movement grows from the habits of a community** : The social ties that combine loosely affiliated people create social pressure to join the cause.

(Shortform note: In _How Behavior Spreads_ , behavioral expert Damon Centola explains that you’re more influenced by the _percentage_ of people that are doing something rather than the total number. If a high percentage of people in your community support a cause, you’ll naturally _feel_ like it’s the right thing to do.)

**3) The movement endures because the participants engage in new social habits** : The participants identify with the movement and take on habits that reflect their belief in the cause.

(Shortform note: While Duhigg focuses on the endurance of movements due to participants engaging in new social habits, he doesn’t mention another vital factor: Eventually, **collective individual habits influence business habits** , making these new habits even more visible and accessible to _potential_ participants. For example, when animal rights activists decided to become vegetarians, stores and restaurants changed their offerings to cater to this demand. Similarly, when environmentalists chose to only buy products with recyclable packaging, many stores banned plastic bags. These visible changes brought these causes to the attention of shoppers, some of whom then adopted the causes in turn.)

##### An Example of How Successful Social Movements Rely on Social Habits

Let’s explore how your social habits change how you relate to what you see on the evening news. There are various reports about what’s occurring around the world. **Much of this news doesn’t directly concern you** so, while you may feel interested and even empathize with the plight of others, your brain doesn’t want to process all of the information that’s being thrown at you.

Now imagine that you see one of your close friends on the news because she’s suffered an injustice. Your brain wakes up and you pay attention because you care about this friend. **You feel compelled to act** and help, so you call on others in your social circle to lend support. For various reasons—they care about what’s important to you or they care about how you’ll perceive them if they don’t help—these people agree to help and **spread the word to their social circles**.

News about the injustice spreads and people rally to take up the cause and provide support. Many of these people also have friends or acquaintances who have suffered the same injustice as your friend. As a result, **the movement naturally evolves** to address how this injustice has impacted thousands of people beyond your own community. Over time and with increased participation, the movement achieves critical mass: The participants form **a collective identity with habits that continue to influence others to participate and pursue the same goal**.

> **Social Biases: You’re Either With Us or Against Us**
> 
> In the book, Duhigg uses the Rosa Parks bus boycott to argue that social movements rely on the three social habits mentioned above. He explains that Rosa Parks was the catalyst for the movement because she had many close social ties and had powerful connections in the community. Furthermore, the incident incited a _specific_ habit: Don’t take the bus to show your support. While the example he uses does back up his argument, it’s difficult to determine how these three social habits apply to _all_ successful movements.
> 
> By their nature, social movements require us to change how we think or behave in response to others. Even though the focus of these movements tends to be positive—promoting equality and inclusion for all—there are always going to be those who resist these changes. However, Duhigg’s case study of Rosa Parks focuses solely on the habits of the people that supported the cause. We’ll therefore explore why people _don’t_ join progressive movements by explaining how social biases prevent us from feeling compassion for the plight of people outside of our social groups.
> 
> Researchers confirm that we unconsciously internalize the unspoken rules and biases of our social groups so that we can instinctively cooperate with others. They found that we’re socially reinforced to follow these rules through the use of rewards (social approval and advantages) and punishments (social disapproval and sanctions). Our inherent need to feel connected to others and to avoid punishment motivates us to adopt these rules. In addition, **this need for connection encourages us to spend time with people who are similar to us** —the feeling of sameness enhances our sense of belonging.
> 
> However, researchers warn that our innate preference for people who are like us can contribute to the prejudices we feel for those who are not like us—because we don’t _feel_ connected to them. In other words, we unconsciously judge other people as good or bad depending on whether we view them as part of the social group that we’re connected to.
> 
> The research confirms that we’re more likely to give preferential treatment to those we judge as part of our social group than those we consider outsiders. What’s more concerning is that **we’re also more likely to give _unfair_ treatment to outsiders**—this includes ignoring any injustices that we’d react to if they happened to someone within our social group. According to this research, the reason why people refuse to join progressive causes isn’t that they’re unaware of the social injustices in the world, but that their social biases discourage them from feeling any concern for those that live outside of their social group.
> 
> While this research raises a number of concerns about how we unconsciously judge and choose to respond to the many injustices in the world, it does clarify how social habits determine the success or failure of all social movements.
