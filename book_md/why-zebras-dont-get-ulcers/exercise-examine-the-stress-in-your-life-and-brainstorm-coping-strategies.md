## Exercise: Examine the Stress in Your Life and Brainstorm Coping Strategies

We all feel stress, and we all deal with stress differently. Let’s look at some stressors in your life and identify why they’re stressful and what you can do about them.

* * *

Think of a psychological or social stressor that’s affected you in the past week. This can be a mild or severe stressor, like a major disagreement with a friend or just a tough day at work. Describe the stressful event or situation below.

Consider _why_ this situation or event was psychologically stressful for you. Did you feel stressed because of a lack of predictability or control over the situation? For example, an argument with a loved one might have felt stressful because you didn’t expect it or you weren’t sure how to handle it appropriately. Write down why you think your particular situation is stressful below.

Write down how you coped with this stressful event. Did you displace your frustration on someone else? Did you try to drive it out of your mind with an activity you enjoy? Did you reach out to a friend or family member to talk about it? Or did you dwell on the situation and make it even more stressful for yourself?

Consider how you might have handled the situation better. Applying some of the insight you’ve gained on stress and coping mechanisms, what do you think is the healthiest way you could have dealt with this particular stressor? How might you try to use this coping mechanism in the future? Write your answer below.
