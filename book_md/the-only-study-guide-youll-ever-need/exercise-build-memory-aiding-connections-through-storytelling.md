## Exercise: Build Memory-Aiding Connections Through Storytelling

Bowler explains that one of the best methods to memorize important concepts is to build connections by telling a story and connecting information to things you already know. To practice this method, we’ll walk through the process of creating your own story.

* * *

First, consider a topic you’re currently studying and write down all the components of that topic that you need to memorize. (For example, for your history class, you might need to memorize the major events leading up to the fall of the Ottoman Empire—write those events down here.)

Now, sort these concepts into groups based on a common theme. (For example, you might organize the major events into groups by years: 1550 to 1650, 1650 to 1700, 1700 to 1750, and 1750 to 1807.)

Finally, create a story that connects these themes or components somehow. This should be a colorful story written in your own words—one that will intrigue you and help you remember the themes and concepts. (For example, you can retell the history of the Ottoman Empire’s fall as a fairy tale, with each group as a “chapter”—“It all started when Süleyman I chose women over power and the power-hungry grand vizier took his place, igniting separation among the nobles and people of the land…”)
