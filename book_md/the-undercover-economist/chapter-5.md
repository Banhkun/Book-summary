## Chapter 5: Missing Information

**When one party doing a business deal has more information than the other party, the market is not running efficiently.** This chapter explains the information gap, discusses how to close it, and examines how to solve broken health care systems using these economic principles.

### Used Car Salesmen

We’ll use the example of used cars to explain the economic problems inherent in an information gap. Let’s say half the cars on the used car lot are “peaches”—they run well—and the other half are “lemons”—there’s something wrong with them. The car salesman knows which are which, and the buyer does not. The peaches are worth an average of $6,000 to buyers. The buyer offers $3,000, which she thinks is a fair gamble for a car that could be a peach or could be a lemon.

  * If the car is a lemon, the seller will jump at the chance to sell a car he knows is worth less than $3,000.
  * If the car is a peach, the seller will refuse to sell a car he knows is worth more than $3,000. 



Consequently, buyers offering $3,000 will only ever get lemons. If the buyer offers closer to $6,000 the salesman might give up a peach, but the buyer wouldn’t be willing to put up something like $5,500 for a 50% chance she’s getting a lemon.

In this extreme example, there is literally no market. Buyers who have even an ounce of common sense just won’t shop for a used car. Consequently, sellers won’t sell many used cars. Insider information helps no one. This only occurs when one group is ignorant and the other has knowledge. If both the buyer and the seller are ignorant, the market would resolve itself. The problem is the knowledge _gap._

(Shortform note: Read our summary of Freakonomics to learn how unequal access to information affects you when you’re buying a house, and how the Internet is closing the information gap.)

### Signaling Quality

So, how can we solve the knowledge gap? The first way is for **vendors to _signal quality_ , or to show customers that they are reliable. **There are lots of ways for vendors to do this. In the car salesman example, trustworthy salespeople often have a showroom that’s a lot fancier than a used car lot on the side of a highway. These showrooms are fairly expensive and require long leases. If a salesperson has roots in the community thanks to their lease, they can’t just pick up and leave if they start selling lemons and word gets around that they are not to be trusted. If they can’t quickly leave and move on to a new group of suckers, they’re disincentivized to withhold important information from customers. Thus, customers trust salespeople with showrooms because the quality of the showroom signals that the seller can’t rip the buyer off.

This is also why old banks often found fancy buildings to conduct their business out of. If you’re giving your money over to an organization to hold, you want to make sure that it’s trustworthy. Signposts of trust like a stately building aren’t just nice frills: The expensive lease in the fancy building makes sure that vendors will be honest with customers.

There are many signals of quality that don’t involve real estate as well. For example, people like to poke fun at students getting their degree in a subject like philosophy. The popular argument is that philosophy doesn’t give students any marketable skills that will help them make money. But finishing a philosophy degree is another signal of quality. Philosophical arguments are dense. While reading and writing about them might not be directly related to whatever job a philosophy student has after graduation, it shows a level of commitment that employers pick up on. If someone is excited to study philosophy, they likely have a good work ethic.

Remember, though, that all of these examples are trade-offs. It might not be worth the money to pursue a philosophy degree, even if it does make it marginally easier to secure a job because you can better signal quality.

### Finding Quality

**While vendors can _signal quality_ if they choose, it is often up to customers to _find quality._**

Let’s use renting an apartment as an example. When landlords show off an apartment to potential tenants, they are _signaling quality_ by allowing customers to test that everything works in the apartment or look around the place and the neighborhood. But potential tenants and landlords can both _find quality_ in one another to **close the information gap.** There are all kinds of forums where tenants can share positive or negative experiences about landlords: Potential tenants can seek out this information online, or ask other tenants in the building directly about whether the landlord is responsive. Landlords, though, need information about tenants as well before they agree to rent out their place. They don’t want tenants who can’t pay their rent. So they _find quality_ :__ They regularly ask for bank statements, proof of employment, and tax returns. When each party has enough information about the other, they can comfortably complete the transaction.

### Insurance

The knowledge gap is a big problem in the health insurance industry, especially in nations with broadly private health insurance systems like the United States. Let’s say that people who are prone to sickness are lemons and people prone to good health are peaches. If peaches—young people without health problems—don’t buy insurance, the market starts to disappear. Without their money paying into the system, insurance gets more expensive for those between a lemon and a peach, and their plans become too expensive to be worth the expenditure.

In turn, insurance becomes unreasonably expensive for the lemons who need it. In practice, the system doesn’t collapse like this, because people are often willing to pay more than a fair price for health insurance as essentially a bulwark against a giant, unexpected medical bill. In some senses, insurance in general, including health insurance, is able to **depend on mutual ignorance.** Without knowing what will happen in the future, it’s safer to pay into the system. But health insurance is particularly plagued with high costs.

#### Insurers Finding Quality

Often, people know more about whether they’re likely to get sick than health insurance companies. So insurers attempt to _find quality_ from their customers. They do so by offering different kinds of plans. A plan with a higher deductible and a lower premium is attractive to people who are generally healthy because these plans cost less money each month. But for people who do have health problems, a low deductible, high premium plan is more attractive because if they _do_ get sick, their insurance will cover more of their bills. The large insurance company Aetna has deductibles that range from $500 all the way to $5,000 per month.

When insurance companies know _too_ much about a potential customer, though, they can deny coverage. If they know that you’re likely to get sick frequently, they’ll be more likely to deny coverage entirely, because even if you pay high premiums, you’ll likely cost them money.

(Shortform note: In the United States, the Affordable Care Act, passed after this book was written, attempted to prevent health insurance companies from denying coverage to potential customers with pre-existing conditions.)

#### Health Care in the United States

The United States has a large health insurance problem. Only 17% of Americans are happy with the healthcare system and believe it requires no changes. In many other countries, buying healthcare is compulsory, and how much you pay for your healthcare depends on how much money you make, not how risky of an investment you are. In the United States, buying healthcare is not compulsory, and when you decide to do so, you pay based on how risky your insurance company thinks it will be to cover you.

The system in the U.S. has three major issues. It’s **expensive, bureaucratic, and patchy.**

  1. **Expensive:** Based on some measures, the United States has the most expensive healthcare system on earth. The English _government_ pays less than the United States government per person in healthcare costs, and they cover _everyone_ for free, while the U.S. only covers seniors through Medicare and those who are disadvantaged through Medicaid. 
  2. **Bureaucratic:** Because the system is so disorganized, a lot of the costs that Americans incur are bureaucratic. Administration costs are about $1000 per person per year in the United States. This is more than the Czech Republic and Singapore spend in _total,_ and they have similar health outcomes to the United States (Singapore is a bit better, the Czech Republic is a bit worse). In Canada, administrative costs are only $307 per person per year, and their health outcomes are _much better._ A lot of bureaucracy comes from health insurance companies trying to find out how risky their potential customers are. 
  3. **Patchy:** In the U.S., health insurance is regularly tied to employment. Employers provide a list of potential plans from which employees must choose. This does make people with a job more likely to buy into the healthcare system. But asking Human Resources managers to narrow down healthcare options for their employees makes no sense. Lazy HR managers often choose bad packages, which results in more spending at a lower quality. And for people without a job, they’re essentially on their own. 15 percent of Americans don’t have health insurance, which should be a shocking number. In Germany, only 0.2 percent of citizens are uninsured, and in Canada and Britain, everyone is insured through the government. On top of all of this, people are less likely to leave their jobs unless they can line up other health coverage. This slows down innovation and economic growth. 



#### Government Failures

While the United States has a poor, market-based health insurance system, those run by governments have their own issues. Take England as an example. The system is often overcrowded, there are long lines for resources, and there isn’t much patient choice. The survey that found that only 17% of Americans are pleased with the healthcare system found that only 25% of people in England are happy with their system, which is run by the National Health Service (NHS).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, makes a lot of decisions within the NHS. And they are not always popular ones. The Royal National Institute of the Blind, for example, is angry with NICE for being unwilling to approve photodynamic therapy, a treatment that can make eye problems much better. NICE has agreed only to allow for photodynamic therapy to be covered by the NHS in extreme cases, and even in those cases, only in one eye.

The challenge for NICE is that the NHS has limited resources. It’s difficult to determine how to allocate those resources, and from there how to decide which procedures or treatments to allow for. NICE calculates what is “worth it” through a system called Quality-Adjusted Life Years, or QUALYs. A procedure will have a better QUALY score if it solves a medical problem for 10 years rather than one, for example. The National Institute for the Blind might argue that being blind is a debilitating condition to get NICE to approve photodynamic therapy. But if it’s so bad already to be blind, then the National Institute for the Blind is arguing that blind people’s lives matter less than the lives of people with vision. In this scenario, if a blind person develops a heart condition, they’ll be lower on the priority list than people with vision who have heart conditions. The National Institute for the Blind can’t argue that being blind is debilitating without driving the QUALY score for non-vision-related operations for blind people way down. It’s a classic Catch-22.

#### Fixing Healthcare Systems

To solve the problems with healthcare in market-based and government-based systems, we need to target problems directly and precisely. There are four potential failures in the healthcare system that we have discussed in this summary so far: **scarcity power, externalities, fairness, and imperfect information.**

**1\. Scarcity Power:** The healthcare industry doesn’t have a big scarcity issue. Mostly, especially in the developed nations we are discussing, there are enough doctors and treatment options.

**2\. Externalities:** Externalities are only a problem in specific cases, like the transmission of a disease like HIV/AIDS. The solution is simple—introduce some regulatory oversight and subsidies to boost inoculation rates.

**3\. Fairness:** Fairness is not a specific _market_ issue, but it’s still something to be concerned with because we don’t want to deprive the poor of health coverage. We can solve the fairness issue in healthcare by using the “head start” strategy and redistributive taxes discussed in previous chapters. If we can solve poverty issues, we can solve healthcare issues.

**4\. Imperfect Information:** This is the biggest market problem. While a government takeover of the industry might seem appealing, as the issues in England show, this won’t solve the problem according to Harford. For this issue, a two-part treatment is necessary.

First, make healthcare information widely available. It should be easy to get second opinions, call helplines, find verified information online, and we should be providing informational services in places like grocery and drug stores.

Second, let patients use the new information that they have. Currently, either an insurance company or the government is making a lot of choices on a patient’s behalf. The best system would have patients pay for most of their choices, but leave the big bills to the government or private insurance. Rather than having health insurance for everything, we should have only _catastrophic_ health insurance, which would cover large procedures or accidents. Data shows this type of insurance is about $1500 per year per person cheaper for the government or insurance companies. Citizens should be mandated to put this extra $1500/year in a savings account that can cover smaller health costs. If they don’t incur a lot of health costs, their money in the account will grow, and if they die with money in that account, they can pass it off to their children. Singapore uses this system and has been successful with it.

### Moral Hazard

One final problem with insurance in general is how it changes people’s behavior. If your car is insured against theft, you’ll be more likely to park it on the street, whereas if it isn’t, you might be willing to pay for a car lot. This is called a _moral hazard._

For example, moral hazards are inherent in public __ unemployment insurance. When people have unemployment insurance, they’re less motivated to find a new job. But as a society, we don’t want people to starve. So we’re left, once again, with a trade-off—incurring some moral hazard is necessary in a benevolent society. The government tries to solve this problem by only giving unemployment insurance to people who are actively looking for a job. But it’s impossible to monitor _exactly_ how motivated someone is in their search, so we’re left with imperfect information.

Imperfect information also affects how people are paid. There is a reason year-end bonuses are generally only a small part of someone’s overall salary. If a boss could tell exactly how hard everyone was working at all times, he could pay people only based on their performance. But once again, this is impossible, so people are paid a base salary and then sometimes receive a bonus for exemplary performance.
