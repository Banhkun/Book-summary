## Exercise: Reflect On Your Mistakes

Endure the pain of reflecting on your mistakes to improve for the future. Remember Dalio’s formula: Pain + _Reflection_ = Progress.

* * *

Write down some of the most salient mistakes you’ve made in the past 12 months.

Connect the dots between these mistakes. What patterns do you see? What weaknesses were common between these mistakes?

Write down your one “big challenge”—the weakness that most blocks you from getting what you want.

Why does this weakness exist? What specifically are you going to do to get over this weakness?

Think about this reflection as a puzzle that, when solved, will make you strong and help you level up. How do you feel emotionally about the mistake now?
