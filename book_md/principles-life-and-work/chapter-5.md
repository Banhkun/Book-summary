## Chapter 5: Total Receptivity

Dalio says that to overcome your ego and blind-spot hurdles and make the best decisions, you must be open-minded. This means accepting that you might be wrong and relentlessly seeking out ways to increase your chances of being right.

### How to Become More Receptive

One of the methods Dalio suggests to increase your chances of being right is to be totally receptive to information from others, especially highly credible people. Here’s how you can become more receptive to others’ input:

#### 1) Look for the Best Possible Answer

Dalio says you should accept the possibility that others might see something better than you and point out threats and opportunities you don’t see. **You’re looking for the best answer that exists, not the best answer that you can come up with yourself.** Keep in mind that the probability of always having the best answer is very small.

(Shortform note: Psychologist and author Jordan Peterson has a similar view. In _12 Rules for Life_ , he writes that you should go into a conversation genuinely believing that you have something to learn from the other person. Otherwise, you’ll end up trying to convince each other of your respective positions and find it difficult to have a fulfilling conversation.)

Dalio suggests two reasons you might hesitate to get other opinions:

  * **You want to make up your own mind.** Dalio says this is foolhardy. Opposing views shouldn’t threaten your ability to decide independently. They can only make you more accurate because they broaden your perspective and give you more options. (Shortform note: It may help lower your defenses to think that just because other people give you advice, it doesn’t mean you have to take it. The advice is just there for you to consider.)
  * **You worry that seeking ideas from others means losing assertiveness.** This is also false. Getting ideas from others will actually make you right more often, which in turn will make you more confident. (Shortform note: Experts say that people become confident when they’re both independent and dependent. While it’s important to become strong and capable of overcoming challenges, it’s equally important to know how to be vulnerable and comfortable enough to ask for help.)



When accepting viewpoints from others, suspend your judgment and empathize with their viewpoint. Dalio says you shouldn’t punish others for speaking their mind by criticizing or mocking them. Make clear you want to understand their perspective and aren’t trying to prove them wrong. After all, they have their own ego hurdles to contend with and may not be receptive to your ideas.

(Shortform note: It may be difficult for you to overcome your ego hurdle and get ideas from others, but in the long run, listening to others without judgment or criticism allows you to learn from their mistakes and avoid them yourself. To become a better listener, Jordan Peterson advises summarizing what the other person is saying to make sure that you understand them and that you find the most valuable insights.)

##### Weigh a Person’s Input by Their Credibility

While getting other opinions is crucial, you can’t put your full trust in every opinion you get. Weigh a person’s opinions by how knowledgeable they are about the subject in a process of _credibility-centered decision making_ —the opinions of people who are more credible weigh more heavily than those who are less credible. (At Bridgewater, this procedure is called **“** believability-weighted decision-making.**”**) This is distinctly different from weighing everyone’s votes equally, as in a democracy.

Credible people are those who have repeatedly succeeded at the situation in question and can logically explain their process. It makes sense that you’ll most often value the opinions of successful people more than those with little experience. However, Dalio says you should recognize that great ideas can come from inexperienced people, since they are not set in their ways as much as veterans are.

If you lack credibility in any area, Dalio says you should spend more time asking questions and trying to understand other people’s logic than pushing your own ideas. Stress-test your ideas with other credible people and with real data. Learn to articulate clear logic behind each idea rather than just basing input on hunches.

> **But What About Introverts?**
> 
> Introverts might have a hard time speaking up to expand on their reasoning, so they might find it challenging to increase their credibility in a system like Bridgewater’s. The book _Quiet_ gives tips to help introverts thrive in an environment that requires assertiveness:
> 
>   * **Be assertive on your own terms. **You don’t have to mimic extroverts’ tone and forcefulness. Instead, express yourself using words that feel comfortable to you.
> 
>   * **Be prepared. **Going over the meeting agenda and jotting down your thoughts beforehand can make you feel more confident about speaking up.
> 
>   * **Use your strengths. **Introverts tend to be great listeners. Focus on what the speaker is saying, process information that others might have missed, and contribute when you’re ready—don’t just talk for the sake of talking.
>

#### 2) Recognize That You’re Blind

As mentioned in the previous chapter, it’s important to recognize that you have blind spots and to ask others to help you see them. Review bad decisions that you made because you failed to see what others saw. Dalio says that if you _willingly_ blind yourself and keep doing something wrong, you will never maximize your potential.

Even if you believe your baseline probability of being right is already high, Dalio believes it’s always valuable to raise your probability of being right by being open-minded to other viewpoints.

> **How to Manage Blind Spots**
> 
> As a leader, you have to be especially mindful of blind spots. Ed Catmull gives the following tips for dealing with this hurdle in _Creativity, Inc._ :
> 
>   * **Make sure you’re getting accurate information.** Keep in mind that employees may just tell you what they think you _want_ to hear, so don’t take information at face value and dig deeper.
> 
>   * **Encourage people to be more vocal.** Communicate that you want them to speak up about issues so that they’ll be more comfortable about telling you the truth.
> 
>   * **Get closer to the issues.** If you’re in a big organization, get the input of those who are directly involved with or have a strong sense of the issues within their departments.
>

#### 3) Accept That the Best Answers Can Come From Others

Dalio notes that a common problem, especially among high achievers, is wanting to be the one to produce the correct answers. This desire can make you close-minded to other ideas and what other people have to offer. Often, you may _try_ to be open-minded, but, having already made up your mind, you ask for ideas simply to confirm your opinion, not to open your mind to change.

If you truly value being right and having the best ideas above all, you shouldn’t care if the right answer comes from you or from someone else. Focus on finding the truth and the best ideas.

(Shortform note: When searching for the right answer, you might have a tendency toward confirmation bias: choosing evidence, sometimes unconsciously, to support your ideas. In _The Black Swan_ , author Nassim Nicholas Taleb suggests getting past confirmation bias by using a technique called negative empiricism, or actively looking for evidence that _disconfirms_ your ideas.)

#### 4) Balance Humility With Self-Knowledge

To become more receptive to other people’s perspectives, Dalio says you need to be humble and open-minded, and you need to be aware of what you know and how you reason. One without the other is suboptimal: If you’re very open-minded but are weak when it comes to reasoning, you’ll have problems picking the right people and ideas. If you have good reasoning but aren’t humble, you miss out on better ideas. If you’re not humble _and_ you’re weak when it comes to reasoning—meaning you know little, yet you’re convinced you know everything—then you remain stagnant.

(Shortform note: This is similar to the Dunning-Kruger effect, a cognitive bias where people who are bad at something are incapable of recognizing how bad they are. In an interview, psychologist David Dunning explained that you can become more aware of your cognitive blind spots by thinking about what you _don’t_ know and exposing yourself to people with different perspectives.)
