## Exercise: Apply Dalio’s Process to Your Goals

Try working through Dalio’s tried-and-true process to create a smoother path to achieving your goals.

* * *

What goals are you aiming for? Be ambitious and don’t worry about whether you believe you can achieve them right now.

What problems are preventing you from reaching those goals?

Why do these problems exist? What is the primary source of these problems? (To figure out the primary source, try asking yourself “Why?” repeatedly until you can’t answer any more.)

How specifically will you get around these problems? What steps and tasks will you take?

What will it take for you to do the tasks required to completion? What do you anticipate will get in the way of executing your plan?
