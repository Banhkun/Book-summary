## Chapter 8: Plugging Into the Hidden Job Market

In Chapter 8, you learned about the problems with the conventional approach to job searching, and you learned some tips for increasing your chances if you do go that route. In this chapter, you’ll learn a far better approach: the approach of tapping into the hidden job market. This involves using the prototyping technique of life interviews combined with effective networking practices. You also may need to reframe your core idea of job seeking.

**Defective belief:** My dream job is “somewhere out there,” waiting for me in the world.

  * **Corrected belief:** I must _design my own dream job_ through a combination of active seeking and co-creation.



**Defective belief:** “Networking” is a synonym for “hustling people.” It’s a fundamentally slimy activity.

  * **Corrected belief:** Networking is just asking other people for help and direction.



**Defective belief:** I’m seeking a job.

  * **Corrected belief:** I’m pursuing several offers.



The first step in getting your dream job is to give up your idealized notion of a dream job. There’s no magically “perfect” job for anybody. What really exists are interesting jobs at worthy organizations with good people. At least a couple of these are ones that you could make close enough to “perfect” to love them for a long time. You just can’t see them right now because they belong to the hidden job market.

### Using Life Interviews to Plug Into the Hidden Job Market

Remember, the purpose of a life interview isn’t to find a job but to learn about some kind of work to understand whether you’d like to do it. The wonderful thing is that **job offers often occur as a side effect of these conversations, and many times they’re from the hidden market.** Often when an interviewee sees your genuine interest, they’ll let you know of available positions, whether published or not: “You seem interested in our work, and you seem qualified. Would you ever think of working at a company like this?” (You can also tilt the conversation in that direction yourself, using a strategically open-ended question: “I’m fascinated by your work and the people here. What steps would it take for somebody like me to become part of such an organization?”)

The story of Kurt illustrates the superiority of this approach over the traditional job hunting method. Kurt moved to a new town with his master’s in design from Stanford and began seeking work in the sustainable architecture field. He sent out applications to 38 jobs that he found on the Internet. From these, he received eight standardized rejections and 30 non-responses.

Then he applied design thinking and started conducting life interviews—56 in all—to prototype his possible futures. He focused on people and jobs that he found genuinely interesting. **This resulted in seven different job offers, six of which weren’t publicly posted, and one of which was an authentic dream job.** For six of these, he didn’t have to ask; his interviewees volunteered the information. In his final interview with the board of directors for the dream job, he had already established good relationships with three of five members through his life interviews.

### Effective Networking

Kurt was so successful in lining up life interviews because he used good networking techniques. To follow his example, you first have to let go of any negative emotional connotations that you may attach to the idea of networking. Think of networking simply as asking someone on the street for directions to an unfamiliar address. Most people want to help. They don’t feel used or annoyed.

To network effectively, first reach out to your first-tier contacts, the people you actually know and have in your address files, and ask them for leads. Use what you learn to reach out to your second-tier contacts—the contacts of your contacts. Also research people and organizations. Then request life interviews with interesting people in interesting positions.

Here’s how this kind of networking gives you access to valuable opportunities:

  * Every field constitutes its own internal community and conversation, like a human “Internet.” Each city or region also constitutes its own sub-community (subnetwork).
  * Within these communities, there’s an organic division (with much overlap) between a professional network of colleagues and a personal network of friends and family.
  * Professional networks share their hidden job listings internally.
  * Referrals from personal networks are the most common way people are introduced across professional networks. Often this takes the form of simply allowing new people into the conversation.
  * Thus, **when you access a personal network by conducting life interviews, you increase your likelihood of gaining access to the hidden job market.**



When you use good networking skills, that’s when the Internet actually becomes valuable, because that’s when you can start putting resources like Google and LinkedIn to good use.

### Seeking Offers, Not Jobs

Finally, cap your exploration of the hidden job market by making a critical distinction in your job-searching activities: Since the defectiveness of job descriptions means you can’t really know what most jobs are about just from reading about them, **adopt the mindset that you’re not looking for a job but _looking for job offers_. **This will expand your horizons. It will shift you into a curiosity-based state of mind that leads you to investigate and evaluate opportunities with genuine interest. It will change the jobs you consider, how you write resumes and cover letters, and how you approach job interviews. It will motivate you to put life interviews and exploratory experiences to truly good use. All of this in turn will make you more attractive to potential employers who sense your interest in them.
