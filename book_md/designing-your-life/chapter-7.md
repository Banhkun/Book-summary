## Chapter 7: The Problem With Job Searching

In Chapter 6, you learned how to prototype your Adventure Plans to help you understand what they mean in the real world. In this chapter, you’ll learn why the best route to fulfilling work is not through the want ads—the route that most people take. But if you still want to try this route, you’ll learn how to recognize what’s wrong with most job ads, how to understand the mindset of hiring managers, and how to tailor your application materials for best effect.

**Defective belief:** My focus should be on _my need for a job_.

  * **Corrected belief:** My focus should be on _the hiring manager’s need for the right person for the job_.



### The Problem With Internet Job Listings

The Internet is the most popular source for job searches these days. It’s also a massive waste of time. Although thousands of jobs are posted each week, most of the really great jobs never show up. Instead, they’re filled internally without ever being publicly shown. Only about 20 percent of available jobs are posted on the Internet (or posted anywhere). So you’re not even seeing the dream jobs that you’d like to apply for.

Moreover, **a large number of published job ads are actually meaningless “phantom jobs.”** They’re only published to meet some company requirement for posting a job externally before it can be filled. In reality, the company has already selected someone, and they wrote the job description to that person’s qualifications.

This accounts for the fact that fewer than half the job applications submitted through the traditional route (revise your resume, write a cover letter, and apply) ever get a response.

### The Problem With Job Descriptions

Then there are the problems built into job descriptions themselves. Often, these descriptions are written by someone who doesn’t understand the job, which may be why such descriptions rarely describe what a job really requires to be successful.

Here’s the typical job description pattern:

  * **First section: Setup.** This is where you see that “Company X is seeking a candidate for Job Y with the following strengths and qualities,” followed by such things as “outstanding written and verbal communication skills” and “ability to manage competing priorities.” This section is filled with generic qualifications that describe any high-quality employee (and thus tell you nothing specific about the job) and that can’t be screened for with a resume.
  * **Second section: Skills**. This section often contains a preposterously detailed list of skills and educational requirements, such as a master’s or higher with a decade of experience doing the company’s exact work, or five years of experience doing some obscure task that only people at that company know how to do. The secret to understanding this section is that it’s _historical:_ It’s frozen in time, based on the previous jobholder.
  * **Third section: Candidate distinctives.** Many job descriptions use language that makes the successful candidate sound like a demigod: “You have a highly developed ability to craft elegant and ingenious solutions to pressing problems while analyzing strategies and providing inspiring leadership-by-example to colleagues at all levels of the organization. We’re looking for a rockstar superhero with a proven track record of awe-inspiring success.” Of course, _nobody meets these qualifications_. The few applicants who do get interviews are rejected because they’re mere mortals. Or, as stated above, the company may have already picked who they were going to hire beforehand.



### The Problem With Hot Companies

Another problem is introduced by the presence of hot (or cool, depending on your metaphor) companies such as Google and Apple—the places everybody wants to work. These companies distort the hiring arena because, with their immense popularity, they actually do have the ability to find those demigod candidates. This means good people frequently get rejected. The companies can afford to be cavalier about the common error of mistaking great candidates for lousy ones, since they always have an endless supply of new applicants.

### How to Stand Out

Having said all that, there are still things you can do to improve your chances of getting a job if you want to use the conventional approach.

  * **Write your resume to be amenable to keyword searches, focusing on the job as described.**
    * Use language from the job posting. If the posting says “good verbal and written communication skills,” describe your own skills in those exact words.
    * If you lack a required skill, find a way to describe your existing skills in ways that a keyword search will find.
  * **Fit in before you stand out.** Focus not on why you want the job but what you can do for the employer. In your resume and your first interview, show yourself as a specialist in what the job requires. After you’ve convinced them you have the skills, you can “stand out” by showing them your depth and breadth of other knowledge and skills.
  * **Always bring a fresh printed resume to an interview**. This may be the only time anybody on the committee sees the work you put into formatting the document.
  * **If applying to a “hot” company, be smart.** Use the life interview technique that you learned in Chapter 6 to start networking (something you’ll learn more about in Chapters 8 and 11). Strategize intelligently. And toe the line. Even the smallest misalignment with a desired employee profile at one of these companies will prevent you from getting hired. Recognize this as a non-problem as defined in Chapter 1: a fact of life that you can’t “solve.” You simply have to deal intelligently with it.



Using these tips, which clue you into the mindset of hiring managers and interview committees (and HR screening software), can increase your chances of job-hunting success if you choose to follow the traditional route. However, there’s a much better way: Gain access to the hidden job market. The next chapter will teach you how.
