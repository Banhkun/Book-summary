## Chapter 2: Your Life Compass

In Chapter 1, you learned how to understand where you currently are in your life journey. In Chapter 2, you’ll learn how to navigate your life by building a “compass” and discovering your “true north.”

**Defective belief:** “I should always know where I’m headed.”

  * **Corrected belief:** “I may not always know exactly where I’m headed, but I can always know if I’m heading the right way.”



### Creating Your Life Compass

To get where you want to go, it’s essential to know what you’re looking for. The practice of life design can help you answer these questions by teaching you to build a _life compass_. This consists of two components:

  * **Your work philosophy** includes everything you think and believe about work: what it’s for, why you do it, and what makes it good or bad. Your work philosophy is _what work means to you_. 
  * **Your life philosophy** includes everything you believe about the world and how it works: what it means, what gives it value, how your individual life relates to others, the place of money in a meaningful life, and the value you place on fulfillment, growth, and experience. Your life philosophy is _what life means to you_.



To create your life compass, write a statement of your work philosophy and a separate statement of your life philosophy. Then compare the two and examine how they relate to each other. The exercise at the end of this chapter will lead you through the process.

Your work and life philosophies will shift over time, so revisit and revise them occasionally to recalibrate your life compass.

### Living a Coherent Life

Creating your life compass provides a way to gauge your life’s _coherence_. Remember, life design is all about having a coherent life. This means a life in which you clearly understand the connections among three things:

  * Your identity
  * Your beliefs
  * Your actions



**Incoherence in your life is easy to spot once you’ve built your life compass** , which enfolds these three things. For example, if part of your life philosophy is the belief that it’s important to leave a better, cleaner planet for the next generation, but your actions include working for a large corporation that pollutes the skies and oceans, you’re living with incoherence.

Sometimes temporary incoherencies are okay, if you choose them consciously. For example, your life philosophy might value art above everything else, but your work philosophy might put art temporarily on hold so that you can make enough money to support your family while you’re raising your kids. In this case, your life is still coherent, because you’re consciously navigating temporary factors to maintain your overall life course, as opposed to being thrown off course by an unacknowledged conflict.

### True North

Once you’ve written down your work and life philosophies and considered their coherence, you’ll know your life’s “true north.” **At any given moment, you’ll be able to tell whether you’re heading in the right direction.** You’ll be able to use your work and life philosophies to reorient yourself whenever you feel briefly lost.
