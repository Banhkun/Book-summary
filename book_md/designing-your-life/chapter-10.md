## Chapter 10: Becoming Immune to Failure

In Chapter 9, you learned a model for making intelligent life design choices that generate happiness and eliminate regret. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to become immune to failure by reframing your belief about what failure means. You’ll also learn how to learn and grow from your failures. 

**Defective belief:** The success or failure of your life depends on its outcome. 

  * **Corrected belief:** Life isn’t an outcome. It’s a process. 



**Defective belief:** There are winners and losers in the finite game of life. 

  * **Corrected belief:** There are no winners or losers in the infinite game of life. 



###  The Value of Failure 

Becoming immune to failure doesn’t mean you’ll never fail again. It means you’re protected from the negative feelings of self-recrimination that usually accompany failure. 

You achieve this state by reframing your belief that failure is bad. You realize that when you’re a life designer, you _fail intentionally_ and _fail more often_ because you regularly employ the two life design attitudes of curiosity and experimentation. These lead you to generate ideas and build prototypes—which can fail. You also learn from the failures that arise from your personal weaknesses and screw-ups. 

**Failure is a necessary part of the design process.** It’s the raw material of success because it informs how you generate more ideas and build more prototypes. Productive failure contributes directly to who you become, both professionally and personally. 

###  The Nature of Failure and the Nature of Life 

Realize that there’s a distinction between the productive failures of the design process and the psychological identity of “being a failure.” The latter is flatly impossible when you realize that your whole life is actually a process of life design. Because you’re always growing and changing, life is an “infinite game,” to use the philosopher James Carse’s memorable term. An infinite game is one in which you don’t follow preset rules in an effort to win but _play with the rules themselves for the pure joy of the game_ . 

(Shortform note:  Learn more about finite and infinite games in our guide to The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek  .) 

####  Being, Doing, and Becoming 

Since life is an infinite game, there’s no such thing as an ultimate failure from which you can’t recover. Instead, there’s only the endlessly recursive process of life design. It’s recursive because it starts by taking stock of who and where you currently are (Chapters 1, 2, and 3). Then it moves on to trying things out (Chapters 4, 5, and 6) and making intelligent choices (Chapters 7, 8, and 9). These choices in turn change your circumstances and even yourself, thus starting the whole process over again. Stated in classical Western philosophical terms, your life is an endless loop of being, doing, and becoming. This means that **as a life designer, you’re always succeeding at the infinite game of finding who you are and meaningfully engaging with the world.**

And, to repeat, you’re immune to failure—it doesn’t crush your spirit. This is true even for surprise events that you can’t anticipate and that aren’t part of your life design plans, such as the onset of a major illness. These become enfolded within your infinite game as you incorporate them into your process of being, doing, and becoming. 

This means you’re free to do and pursue whatever you want because you’re no longer afraid of how you’ll feel if things don’t work out the way you expected. 

###  Reframing Failure 

Here’s a practical method of reframing specific failures to convert them into growth opportunities. 

**First, keep a failure log.** Write down your failures. Pick any time frame for them: yesterday, last week, this year. Where and how have you failed? 

**Second, organize your failures into categories.**

  * Screw-ups: These are just simple mistakes. Acknowledge them, apologize if necessary, and move on. 
  * Weaknesses: These are failures due to your long-term negative tendencies that you know all too well. Do you procrastinate? Are you forgetful? You’re unlikely to change such things, though you’re free to try. A better strategy is simply to: A) work intelligently to manage them, or B) avoid situations that trigger them. 
  * Growth opportunities: These are failures that don’t have to happen next time because they have an identifiable cause and solution. They lead to Step Three. 



**Third, recognize insights for growth.** Notice which failures offer opportunities to learn and improve. Identify what went wrong. Ask yourself what you could do better next time. 

For example, Dave (one of this book’s authors) kept a failure log and noted that he forgot his daughter’s birthday by a week because he was traveling (a screw-up), he scrambled to finish a required budget at the eleventh hour (a recurring procrastination-based weakness), and he angered a client during a phone meeting when he skipped preliminary conversation and dived right into the agenda. He categorized this last one as an improvement opportunity because he realized that his failure to “check in” with the client about news since their last meeting had led him to start with a now-irrelevant agenda item. 

Consider using the following template for reframing your failures: 

**FAILURE** |  **Screw-up** |  **Weakness** |  **Improvement Opportunity** |  **Insight**  
---|---|---|---|---  
Missed daughter’s birthday  |  X  |  |  |   
Last-minute budget  |  |  X  |  |   
Phone surprise  |  |  |  X  |  Start phone calls with a check-in
