## Chapter 11: Creating Your Team

In Chapter 10, you learned how to become immune to failure so that you can fearlessly pursue any goal you choose. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to build a team to help with your ongoing project of designing your life.

**Defective belief:** This is _my_ life, so I have to design it on my own.

  * **Corrected belief:** I live and design my life in collaboration with other people.



Recall the last of the five basic mental attitudes of design thinking: deep teamwork. This attitude says life design is a collaborative and communal process instead of a solitary, “heroic” artistic pursuit. Notice that many of the skills you’ve learned so far, such as wayfinding and prototyping, depend on participation by other people. In life design, you don’t create but _co-create_ ideas and opportunities. Your life design is “out there” in the world of people and relationships, not inside your head. You’ve already seen this as your wayfinding journal and prototyping efforts have led you to consider and become involved with various people.

Now you need to take the next step of consciously identifying your team, which includes two levels: general and specific.

### Establishing Your Team

#### Your General Team

Your general team consists of people who play three different roles:

  * **Allies** are friends and others who care about your life and willingly provide feedback on your plans. You can count on them to “be there” for you.
  * **Key players** are direct co-workers in your life design efforts.
  * **Intimates** are your family members and closest friends. They’re the most influential people in your life design project. It can be tricky to figure out what role they should play. At minimum, always be sure to keep them informed, so there won’t be any surprises.



#### Your Specific Team

Your specific team consists of three to six people whom you pick from your general team to share your life design project directly. Consider choosing people who are already involved, such as the ones who gave feedback on your alternative Adventure Plans.

When your team meets, make sure you all follow simple and clearly defined rules to maximize the benefits of their role as co-creators of your life design. For example, you might specify that everyone needs to be respectful at meetings, provide constructive advice instead of criticism, and keep all team business private. Each meeting needs a facilitator to ensure the conversation remains focused and flows productively. The most natural person for this role is you. As facilitator, make sure everyone gets to speak.

#### The Value of Mentors

If possible, include one or more mentors on your specific team. Or at least try to find one among your general team. **Mentors are people who don’t so much tell you what to think as help you think for yourself and sharpen your own insights and decision-making.** They listen closely to what you say and help you reframe defective beliefs. When you have to make decisions (see Chapter 9), they help with your discernment process. Some people may be lifelong mentors to you. Others may only mentor you through a specific life period or on a specific topic. Scan through your relationships right now and see if you can identify any potential mentors. Then approach them and ask for their advice.

### The Gift of Community

Beyond serving as a life design team, you may find that the group of people you gather turns into a genuine community, a group of individuals who are deeply invested in each other’s life. If this happens, be grateful for such a gift.

Communities are characterized by such things as a shared purpose, a habit of getting together regularly, and a core of shared values and attitudes. In a life design community, there’s also the added habit of talking together sincerely and openly about your lives, your dreams, and how you’re trying to unite these in a lifelong experience of happiness and success. Having such a community is one of the best ways to ensure that your life design efforts bear fruit and take you where you want to go.
