## Exercise: Identify Your Gap Between Who You Are and Who You Act Like

Dispenza says we present a self to the world that is not consistent with our authentic selves. Identify a part of yourself that isn’t true to you and consider what it would take to get rid of it.

* * *

What is something that you do, think, or say to others to gain their approval or meet their expectations? This may be as complex as pretending you are happy in your marriage because you don’t want to think about your dissatisfaction, or as simple as pretending to like a sports team just because your friend likes it. What emotion is underlying this pretense?

Next, identify the behaviors you engage in to keep up this pretense. Do you lie when people ask how things are going in your relationship? Do you watch games you have no interest in to appease your friend? How do these behaviors affect your sense of yourself?

Finally, consider what resistance you might meet from others if you try to change this behavior, and how you will respond to that resistance. Do you think your friends and family will be put off if you start being honest about your relationship issues? Will your friend be hurt if you reveal you’re not actually interested in sports? What will you do or say to let others know that you’re making a positive change for yourself that isn’t intended to harm them?
