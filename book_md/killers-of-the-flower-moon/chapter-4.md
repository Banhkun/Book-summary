## Chapter 4: The New Face of Law Enforcement

In the summer of 1925, Tom White was the special agent in charge of the Bureau’s Houston office. White straddled two worlds—on the one hand, he was an old-style lawman with no formal police training, a former Texas Ranger who had spent most of his career pursuing bandits on horseback throughout the Texas frontier, armed with a six-shooter. With his Stetson hat, he even looked like a caricature of the mythical Western lawman, still known to carry his trusty six-shooter when he was on dangerous assignments with the Bureau.

But on the other hand, despite his rough-and-tumble background,**Tom had a reputation as a restrained, methodical investigator.** Even during his days with the Rangers, a force well-known for its shoot-first methods, Tom had been different. He had discovered that careful observation and a methodical approach were more effective in catching criminals than running around the countryside, guns blazing. Tom recognized that many of his fellow Rangers were little more than violent criminals with badges and saw that it was a very fine distinction between a good man and a bad one. He knew that it was dangerous for one man to have the unrestrained ability to take a life, even if he was acting with the sanction of the law.

Tom’s father, Emmett, had been a sheriff in the wild land of Central Texas in the late 19th century. In those days, local sheriffs often were responsible for running the county jail and performing the executions of convicted criminals—Tom first saw his father hang a man from the gallows in 1894, when he was just an adolescent. The family lived next door to the jail, which held all manner of violent criminals, including murderers, rapists, arsonists, and robbers. Despite this harsh environment, Emmett did what he could to ensure relatively humane treatment of the prisoners in his custody and took a harsh stance toward anyone in the county who attempted to mete out vigilante justice—which, in Texas, often meant lynchings of black people.

**Tom’s career in law enforcement was relatively bloodless, and he prided himself on the fact that he had never killed anyone in the line of duty** , a rarity for an officer of his time and place. His approach to law enforcement was more modern and less bloodthirsty than his background would have suggested, and it earned him a strong reputation within the Bureau of Investigation.

### J. Edgar Hoover

Tom had joined the Bureau of Investigation in 1917, less than a decade after its creation. At the time, the Bureau’s jurisdiction was limited to a random assortment of crimes, including banking violations, interstate car theft, escapes by federal convicts, and, most importantly for the Osage case, crimes on Indian reservations.

**In its early years, the Bureau was beset by a reputation for corruption and was embroiled in the scandals that had rocked the administration of President Warren G. Harding**. With its propensity for accepting bribes and enabling all manner of corruption, it became known in the press of the early 1920s as “The Department of Easy Virtue.” In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge’s Attorney General, Harlan Fiske Stone, appointed the 29-year old J. Edgar Hoover to head up the Bureau. His post was _meant_ to be temporary, with a mandate to clean up the agency and restore its tarnished public reputation—but Hoover was to remain in his position until his death in 1972, nearly half a century later.

**Over the years, Hoover would amass enormous bureaucratic power, with his reign spanning eight presidencies.** The Bureau of Investigation, which, in 1935, was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), would eventually come to operate as a state-within-a-state, immune from scrutiny or accountability by elected officials of either major U.S. political party. With its unmatched intelligence-gathering capabilities, the FBI would blackmail politicians and harass and intimidate its perceived enemies—often including alleged Communist sympathizers and civil rights activists.

But all that lay in the future. In 1925, Hoover was a mid-level bureaucrat, in charge of an obscure federal agency that had earned a sordid reputation for corruption and incompetence. That summer, Hoover summoned Tom White to headquarters in Washington, D.C. to assign him to the Osage case. Hoover had initially been leery of taking on the case again, especially after the Blackie Thompson catastrophe. He had strived to keep the Bureau’s involvement in the Osage case out of the press, fearing it would only amplify public scorn. But the affair was a growing scandal, one which threatened to engulf the Bureau and taint Hoover’s career. He was under great political pressure to correct the situation.

**Hoover was a relentlessly ambitious figure, and he saw in the Osage case an opportunity to flex his agency’s muscle and impose _his_ modern vision of law enforcement**. He would use the Osage murders to build up the organization that would, in 1935, become the all-powerful FBI and change the image of American law enforcement, from one of rugged frontier lawmen to sober, rational, scientific, and _professional_ investigative agents.

A product of the reform-minded Progressive Era of American governance, Hoover was obsessed with rules, procedure, and efficiency, running his agency with an almost fanatical zeal and exercising exacting control over his agents’ behavior. He demanded precision and consistency and required all agents to file their typed reports within a standardized system—a culture shock to the many cowboys and frontiersmen whom the Bureau still employed at this time. He had a concrete idea of how an agent ought to look and behave—they should be white, clinical and lawyerly in demeanor, dressed in dark suits, neckties, and black polished shoes. His ideal was a far cry from the cowboy hat-wearing, six-gun-shooting county sheriff of popular imagination.

**Hoover now wanted Tom, an experienced agent and one of the last of the old-fashioned frontier lawmen, to head up the Osage investigation**. It was an assignment fraught with danger for both men: failure could cost Hoover his job; it could cost Tom his life.

### Separating Fact from Hearsay

Tom White headed to the Oklahoma City field office in 1925 to lead the Osage investigation. **Upon examining the case, he saw patterns in the killings: all were of wealthy Osage or their benefactors, and three (Anna Brown, Rita Smith, and, their mother, Lizzie) were direct blood relatives.**

Tom methodically ruled out many of the suspects up to that point, including Anna’s ex-husband, by corroborating their alibis. One witness, a young Kaw Indian woman, claimed that _another_ woman named Rose Osage had told her that she’d murdered Anna Brown as revenge for attempting to seduce her boyfriend, a man named Joe Allen. According to the Kaw Indian’s signed statement, Rose and Joe had shot Anna in the back of the head and then dragged the body to the ravine where it was discovered.

But this account failed to match the evidence at the crime scene—Anna’s body showed no signs of having been moved. The Kaw woman admitted that she was lying, and that she’d been coerced into signing her false statement by a strange white man who’d showed up at her house. **Whoever the conspirators were, they were manufacturing evidence to derail the investigation.**

The case was bewildering. The methods of killing were varied: some victims were poisoned, others were strangled, others shot. This strongly suggested that the murders were the work of more than one killer. And the unreliability of sources, reluctance of witnesses to come forward, and blatant corruption of local law enforcement officials made pursuing leads a bewildering exercise. It was near-impossible to separate fact from hearsay. One of the first red flags for Tom was the fact that the Shoun brothers had failed to locate the bullet that killed Anna Brown. **He began to suspect that the brothers (who were also caring for Anna’s sister, Mollie) had stolen the bullet during the course of the autopsy.**

To help him navigate this rough-and-tumble world, Tom recruited a team of agents who were well-versed in the frontier world and understood the dangers they would be facing. These men went undercover in Osage County, ingratiating themselves with local power brokers and figures of influence—including William Hale.

### Bryan Burkhart: Prime Suspect

**By July 1925, Tom began to think Bryan Burkhart, brother of Ernest Burkhart (Mollie’s husband) and brother-in-law to Mollie and Rita, was the most likely perpetrator of Anna’s murder**. He was the last person to have seen her alive when he dropped her off back home the evening she disappeared. Tom believed this, even though Bryan’s alibi was well-corroborated by people who claimed to have been in his company at the time of the killing, including his brother Ernest and his uncle, William Hale.

But Tom was undaunted, choosing to pursue a lead that had been buried by the original investigators. A group of men claimed to have seen Bryan driving a car with Anna later that evening in the nearby town of Ralston, _after_ the time when he’d testified that he dropped her off at home. Several of these men came forward on the record that they had seen the pair, even though they recognized that they were putting themselves in mortal danger by doing so.

**It appeared that Bryan had picked Anna up later,_after_ taking her home, and that he had committed perjury in his original testimony.** Pursuing the lead further, Tom spoke with multiple witnesses who now claimed to have seen Anna and Tom together at various times that evening, in the company of a mysterious “third man.” The pair were last seen at 3 a.m, during which Bryan brusquely ushered Anna out of a speakeasy and into his car. This new timeline shattered Bryan’s alibi.

Tom needed to identify who this unknown man was who had been with the couple the night Anna disappeared. Through his sources, he learned that Pike, the shadowy investigator originally engaged by William Hale back in 1921, claimed to know the identity of this third man. But Pike refused to come forward and was only located when he was arrested trying to commit a highway robbery.

**Under interrogation, Pike revealed that he had not been hired by WiIliam Hale and Bryan Burkhart to _help_ the original investigation—he had been hired to _destroy_ it **by manufacturing evidence and generating false leads. One of the tasks he undertook in his mission to subvert justice was to conceal Bryan’s true whereabouts on the night of Anna’s murder. He also added that Ernest Burkhart was sometimes present with his brother and uncle when these plans were discussed.

If what Pike was saying was true, then the supposedly benevolent William Hale was guilty of obstruction of justice in a murder case. The only question was whether Hale had been acting solely to protect his nephew Bryan from the law, or whether he had been involved in orchestrating Anna’s murder—and possibly dozens of others. It also implicated Ernest Burkhart. **Was Ernest guilty of conspiring to kill his wife’s sister, and possibly poisoning Mollie herself? And if so, what was the motive?**

### Digging Deeper Into the Conspiracy

In September 1925, Tom spoke to the nurse who had been on duty the night Bill Smith died, following the explosion at his house. She revealed that Bill had spoken with his lawyer and with the brothers (and doctors) David and James Shoun shortly before he died, and that they had commanded her to leave the room. White was already suspicious of the brothers, suspecting them of stealing the bullet that killed Anna White during her autopsy.

Although neither the Shoun brothers nor the lawyer gave up much when questioned, Smith’s lawyer _did_ reveal that Smith had told him that he considered Ernest Burkhart and William Hale to be enemies. **Tom also learned that James Shoun had been named the administrator of Rita Smith’s estate at this clandestine bedside meeting** , a position that would have put him in a lucrative position to pillage her wealth. Clearly, the Shoun brothers had summoned Smith’s attorney to this meeting to have Smith sign this paperwork surrendering his murdered wife’s estate into their hands, shortly before expiring himself. Given his state, there was no way Smith had done this of rational and sound mind.

**Tom was getting close to identifying William Hale as the mastermind.** After interviewing more witnesses, he learned that Hale was the beneficiary of the murdered Henry Roan’s $25,000 life insurance policy. Obviously, Hale had a clear-cut financial interest in Roan’s death. And after speaking with the insurance salesman who had sold Hale the policy, Tom learned that Hale had forged a creditor’s note to make it look like he had loaned Roan money, and that the policy was merely collateral for this debt. After Roan’s murder, Hale had even schemed to frame another man (who had been having an affair with Roan’s wife) for the killing.

### The Headright Plot

The Osage Tribal Council had decreed that each member of the tribe was to receive an equal share of the royalties from the oil money, known as headrights. Individuals were not permitted to buy or sell headrights—this was done in an attempt to keep the oil money in Osage hands. But they _could_ be inherited. An Osage who suffered many deaths in their family could find himself or herself the owner of multiple headrights.

As he studied the probate records, Tom discovered that **many headrights had come into the possession of Mollie Burkhart, married to Ernest Burkhart, nephew of William Hale**. Ernest was known to be highly influenced by his domineering uncle. When all of this money came to Mollie, it would be easy for Hale to exercise control of it through his nephew—though it would be even easier if Mollie were to be killed, too.

**This explained the precise pattern and order of deaths in Mollie’s family.** The divorced and childless Anna had been the first to be eliminated, with her headright going to her mother Lizzie. Killing Anna first ensured that her assets would not be divided up between multiple heirs. Lizzie herself was the next target, having willed her headrights to Mollie and Rita, her surviving daughters.

This also explained why the next victims, Bill and Rita Smith, had died in a bombing attack, which was an unusual method of killing. In fact, the Smith murders were done this way because it was critical that the two died at the same time. If _only_ Rita had died, her headrights would have gone to her husband Bill Smith. But because the couple died mere days apart, Rita’s headright reverted to her only surviving heir—Mollie. It all began to make sense as the outlines of the murderous plot became clear to Tom White. By conspiring to have all the members of Mollie’s family killed, Hale was maneuvering to have all their headrights bequeathed to her. Once Mollie _herself_ was murdered, the oil wealth would be his to exploit.
