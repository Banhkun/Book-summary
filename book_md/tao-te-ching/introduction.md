## Introduction: The Nature of the Tao

**Older than any deity, the Tao is the natural order of the universe.** It’s the guiding energy that lives within us and connects us to everything around us. Also known as the “Great Mother,” it paradoxically creates nothing while offering infinite energy to all beings, nurturing and caring for them.

As an omnipresent entity, the Tao is eternal and infinite. It was never born or created, and, therefore, it can never die or be destroyed. The Tao has no biases, being unconditionally available to all beings who want to live according to its teachings.

**The Tao exists as part of a universal hierarchy:**

  1. The Tao: The supreme entity of the universe, the Tao is the source of all life.
  2. The Universe: The workings of the universe adhere to the guidance of the Tao.
  3. The Earth: The workings of the earth adhere to the guidance of the universe.
  4. Humanity: Human beings should adhere to the guidance of the earth, though some fight against it out of selfishness, ego, or greed.



**Though the Tao is immensely powerful, it’s unaware and uninterested in its own strength, remaining humble and objective.** It is constantly at ease and at peace, never allowing its desires to impact its actions.

**In this section:**

  * You’ll learn about the nature of the Tao and how to engage with its workings.
  * You’ll see the ways in which masters of Taoist practices are able to implement the Supreme Virtues championed by the Tao to obtain peace and enlightenment. 



### Beyond Comprehension

**Because it's beyond the comprehension of human beings, the workings of the Tao can’t be described or understood, only experienced.** The more that you try to understand the workings of the Tao, the less you’ll be able to engage with it. In fact, the Tao may even seem paradoxical. For example, the Tao is empty because it holds onto nothing, yet it is infinite as it expands through the universe.

Before you begin your journey with the Tao, embrace your inability to comprehend its nature. Instead, look for the manifestations of the Tao, using them as a reminder of the Great Mother’s power. For example, if you feel a sense of peace while looking at a gorgeous sunset, recognize that the sensation of enjoying the sunset is a manifestation of the workings of the Tao.

### Engaging With the Tao

**The Tao (and the universe) works in inexplicable ways, and, while you’ll never completely understand it, you can engage with the energy it creates.** There are three major aspects to engaging with the Tao:

  * Simplicity: Keep your thoughts and actions simple. This lets you stay engaged with the universe.
  * Patience: Be patient with friends and foes alike. This lets you stay objective with your observations.
  * Compassion: Be compassionate to yourself and others. This lets you respect all beings regardless of your biases.



You’ll learn more about engaging with the Tao in sections one and two.

**Enlightened people embrace the teachings of the Tao, while foolish people laugh it off as nonsense.** The workings of the Tao aren’t readily apparent to most people, and those who aren’t willing to embrace the Tao would rather dismiss its existence.

The traits developed by listening to the guidance of the universe often seem mundane, preventing many from recognizing the significance of the Tao. **Stay firm in the face of ridicule or criticism.** Your inner peace isn’t linked to other people’s opinions.

### The Supreme Virtue

**A master of Taoist practices embodies the “Supreme Virtue.”** The Supreme Virtue requires:

  1. The ability to raise and care for others
  2. The ability to disengage from self-consciousness and live with the wonder of a child
  3. The ability to be at peace with the reality in which you are living
  4. The ability to keep your mind focused on engaging with the present 
  5. The ability to have something without possessing it
  6. The ability to act without expecting a particular outcome
  7. The ability to lead without controlling the actions of others
  8. The ability to handle important matters by letting things happen naturally
  9. The ability to understand the world around you by detaching from your own perspective



By embodying the Supreme Virtue, masters engage with the deepest of the four levels of faith:

**1) The deepest level of faith is the Tao.** If you engage with this level, your actions are dictated by the Tao. You aren’t concerned with your personal perspective or biases, making decisions based upon the flow and call of the universe only. For example, if you see a homeless man fall in the street in front of you, you may feel called by the moment to go and help him up, ignoring your personal biases about homeless people.

**2) If one isn’t in touch with the Tao, the next level is goodness, or the desire to make the world a better place.** If you engage with this level, your actions are dictated by your wish to change the “natural order” of things, causing you to ignore the energy of the Tao as you’re too involved with your own desires. For example, if a homeless man falls in front of you, you may consider if your energy is best spent helping this man or doing another form of charity, potentially causing you to miss the moment and ignore the person in need.

**3) If one isn’t in touch with goodness, the next level is morality, or the need to determine what is “right” and what is “wrong.”** If you engage with this level, your actions are dictated by your personal perspective on “good” and “evil,” causing you to ignore the Tao as you’re too involved with your perspective. For example, if a homeless man falls in front of you, you may consider the man’s background and character before helping them, potentially causing you to determine that they’re “bad” or not deserving of your assistance.

**4) If one isn’t in touch with morality, the next level is ritual, or surface-level shows of faith.** If you engage with this level, your actions are empty as they’re nothing more than repeating actions that have been dictated to you by others. These could range from “traditions” to meaningless “prayers.” For example, if a homeless man falls in front of you, you may walk right past them because helping them isn’t your “responsibility” as long as you engage with your typical rituals such as prayer or meditation.

#### The Master of Taoist Practices Versus the Average Person

**A master of Taoist practices only concerns themselves with the Tao.** By focusing solely on the objective truths of the universe, they avoid falling victim to their own prejudices. Conversely, the average person often engages with the more shallow levels of faith, often using their shows of faith to bolster their own biased view of the world.

(Shortform example: A religious person may believe that they are a part of God’s chosen “group,” and that, by engaging in prayer and other religious traditions, they’ve earned the favor of a higher being. They may use their participation in these shows of faith to reinforce their personal belief that they are superior to those who aren’t a part of God’s chosen “group.”)

**A master is powerful because they don’t seek power.** By not searching for _more_ power, they are able to use the strength that the universe has given them effectively. Conversely, the average person is never powerful because they’re always seeking power, blinding them to the strength the universe has already given them.

**A master never leaves anything incomplete because they never do anything without the universe’s prompting.** In being selective with their actions in this way, they never take on more than they can accomplish. Conversely, the average person frequently leaves things incomplete because they take on more than they can accomplish.
