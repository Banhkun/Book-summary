## Section 3: Harmonious Living

**To achieve harmony, understand your place in the world and work to fulfill the function the universe requires of you—nothing more, nothing less.** Contrary to popular belief, you can’t improve the world. It's sacred, and if you try to change it, you’ll lose touch with it. Instead, focus on what the universe requires of you, and you’ll find peace within your existence.

There’s a time for everything, including negative emotions and experiences. If you’re one with the Tao, nothing will faze you, not even death. Through the lens of the Tao, death is an unavoidable part of life. Instead of fearing death, embrace it as part of the cycle of the universe. This will allow you to live your life without apprehension.

**In this section:**

  * You’ll learn to embrace harmonious living in your personal life by rejecting the corrupting forces of society and avoiding violence and aggression. 
  * You’ll see how leadership can lead to harmonious living on a larger scale. 



### Corruption

**When the world is in harmony with the Tao, life can flourish.** However, when humanity works against the Tao, the world becomes corrupted.

(Shortform example: If humanity was willing to live within the guidance of the Tao, only taking what we needed to survive, we could co-exist with the animals of the world. However, because of mankind’s need to industrialize, many species have either gone extinct due to pollution or have become a part of the ever-growing meat industry, thus corrupting the natural order of the Tao.)

Instead of succumbing to corrupting forces, approach the world with compassion and empathy. **Listen to the guidance of the Tao, finding your place within the world instead of trying to rule over it.**

### Violence and Aggression

**Peace should always be your top priority.** Approach the world around you gently. Meet people where they are instead of trying to force them to bend or break. Aggression only pushes people away.

Violence should only be used in the most extreme of circumstances. If you _must_ resort to violence, it should pain you to do so. Even if you’re victorious, you should be upset by the fact that you had to use aggression.

### Leadership

**In order to promote harmonious living on a larger scale, leaders must embrace the teachings of the Tao.** If a leader doesn’t live according to the Tao, their disconnection from the universe will likely be shared by those who follow them.

**To be a harmonious leader, don’t try to control the people you lead.** Ultimately, leadership requires trust. Trust generates more honesty and respect amongst the people you lead. If you don’t trust your people, you create the potential for conflict as you tell your people that they aren’t trustworthy or respected.

**When issues arise, you must trust that your people will do the right thing.** You may be tempted to take control of the situation through regulation and restriction. However, though it sounds counterintuitive, the more that you try to restrict the people under your leadership, the less control you actually have. This is because strict regulation implies that you don’t have faith in your people, setting the stage for further internal conflict.

**The strength of a leader can be determined by their relationship to the people they lead:**

  * The strongest leader is one who doesn’t have to constantly make their presence known. They’re able to guide others without manipulating emotions. For example, a strong leader wouldn’t have to utilize propaganda to get their constituents to follow them.
  * The average leader is one who is loved by their constituents. After that is a leader who is feared by their constituents. In both cases, the leader uses emotion to ensure their authority. For example, an average leader may use fear tactics to create a “common enemy,” thus rallying their constituents and boosting their public image.
  * The weakest kind of leader is one who is hated. They don’t live according to the ways of the Tao and have no genuine authority in the eyes of the people they’re meant to lead. For example, a weak leader may imprison or eliminate those who oppose them, making clear that defiance to their rule will be met with punishment. 



> **Guiding Others to the Tao**
> 
> **If you lead through the Tao, others will be drawn to you and will ask for guidance, especially other leaders.** When someone comes to you for advice or help, don’t offer your money or wisdom. Instead, offer to teach them the ways of the Tao, as it is forgiving and allows for growth. You can help them gain earthly power through your wisdom, but you’ll help them find a universal power within the Tao.

#### Action Over Words

**Leadership should rely more on action than words.** In fact, the greatest leaders are able to generate large-group cooperation without ever having to say a word.

(Shortform example: A politician who assists in the creation of community kitchens to combat hunger will likely be more respected than the politician who makes speeches about hunger but never takes action to fix it. Furthermore, while the community will be able to directly support a community kitchen, they can’t take cooperative action based upon empty words.)

**Note: taking action does _not_ equate to using force or violence.** Even when people challenge you or resist your guidance, avoid using violence at all costs. Violence will only make you seem unstable or desperate. Instead, adapt to the flow of the world around you, embracing that many of the workings of the universe are outside of your control.

#### Moderation

**Lead through moderation, not extreme ideals.** Moderation stems from objectivity. By removing personal bias, you can make temperate, wise decisions based on the guidance of the Tao. Conversely, if your choices are driven by ambition or personal desire, you’re more prone to make extreme or one-sided decisions driven by emotion.

**To maintain moderation, never use “goodness” as a platform for your leadership.** As you learned earlier, if you introduce the concept of “good,” you also create the concept of “evil.” If you try to convince your people of the “goodness” of one side, you’re inherently placing your personal biases onto your actions and setting the stage for an opposing force to arise. Lead through observation and adaptability instead of ideals, and “evil” will disappear.

#### Final Thoughts on Leadership

**As you continue to grow as a leader, keep the following in mind:**

  1. **Remember that the more power and influence you possess, the more others will be drawn to you.** The more influence you hold, the more important the Tao becomes. The Tao promotes objectivity and humility. Without these, power can be a corrupting force. 
  2. **Remain humble, admitting your faults and working to remedy them.** Connect with people you lead and show them that you value and respect them. This will allow you to lead without resistance and guide others through empathy.
  3. **When faced with questions or opposition, don’t use eloquence to prove yourself.** This is often a sign of insecurity. Instead, keep your thoughts and words simple. This will keep you genuine and sincere, removing your ego from the equation. 
  4. **Be generous.** The more you give to others, the more fulfilled you’ll feel and the more content your constituents will be. With contentment, the people you lead won’t seek happiness elsewhere. Instead of longing for a “better” situation, they’ll engage with their work and bolster the people around them.
