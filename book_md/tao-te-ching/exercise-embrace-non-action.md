## Exercise: Embrace Non-Action

To effectively engage with the Tao, you must wait for the universe to guide you. If you rush to action, youâ€™re setting yourself up for failure. Instead, embrace non-action, or the willingness to remove personal desire, and act only when the time is right.

Describe a time when you rushed to action, and the end result was less than ideal.

Knowing what you know now, how would non-action have changed your perspective on the situation? How would you have approached it differently?
