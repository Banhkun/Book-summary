## Exercise: Make Progress Toward Early Retirement

According to Fisker, to retire early you need to minimize your living expenses, diversify your skill set, and invest your savings. Think about how you might make progress toward these three goals.

* * *

Brainstorm three different lifestyle adjustments you could make to reduce your living expenses: one that would save an extreme amount of money, one that would save a moderate amount, and an easy one that would save a little. For example, you could sell your house and move into a much cheaper one (extreme), learn to fix your own car instead of going to a mechanic (moderate), or get a library card instead of buying books (easy).

Think of a product you regularly buy. What problem are you using that product to solve? If you couldn’t spend money to make the problem go away, how might you solve it yourself? For example, if you’re regularly buying new running shoes when they wear out, you could learn how to repair soles.

What kind of investing interests you the most, and why? What’s a step you could take to educate yourself about this kind of investing? For example, if you like the idea of investing in real estate, you could search online for free courses on the subject.
