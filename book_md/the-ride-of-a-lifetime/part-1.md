## Part 1: Learning | Chapter 1: The Bottom

Iger starts the recounting of his journey with brief aspects of his childhood and his early start at ABC.

### Bob Iger’s Childhood

Iger grew up working-class on Long Island, NY. He lived with his sister, younger by 3 years, his mother (a stay-at-home mom), and his father, a Navy veteran who flitted between advertising jobs. He never thought of their family as poor, and only as an adult did he realize how threadbare their finances were.

Iger comments on his father’s influence most:

  * He instilled a curiosity of the world in Bob by prompting him to read through their full bookshelves.
  * He had strong political views, often on the side of the underdog, and had difficulty not speaking out. This got him in trouble professionally.
  * He had bipolar disorder, which gave rise to erratic moods. They never knew if his father would arrive home manic or depressed, and Iger and his mother suffered for it.
  * He viewed himself as a failure, and he was determined to have Bob and his sister avoid the same fate. Thus, he constantly insisted that Bob and his sister use their time deliberately to achieve their goals.



Because of his father’s instability, Iger felt he had to be the stable core of the family. He fixed things that were broken around the house; having to take things apart and use tools, he gained an interest in technology, which would later shape his views on embracing technological changes.

**Bob didn’t want to end up like his father—perpetually considering himself a failure—and he worked hard and strove to achieve.** He began working for money in eighth grade, picking up a series of jobs in shoveling snow, working in a hardware store, and cleaning the school in the summer. During college (he attended Ithaca College), he worked harder than he did in high school, determined to achieve some kind of success and escape disappointment. Throughout his career, Bob would have a habit of accepting every opportunity, even if he felt unprepared; he wanted to move up, learn more, and be capable of doing more things.

Later, when Bob became CEO of Disney, he expressed his gratitude to his father. He appreciated his parenting, and he knew he inherited many of his father’s important traits. Bob hoped it would relieve a little bit of his father’s eternal disappointment in himself.

### Bob’s Start in Television

After college, Iger worked for a year as a reporter and weatherman for a small Ithaca TV station. He’d once dreamed of becoming a big-time news anchorman, but his mediocrity at the job and the unclear path upward convinced him to try something else.

In 1973, at 23, he moved to Manhattan and got a job as a studio supervisor at ABC. It paid $150 per week and was the very bottom of the totem pole. His job was to do anything needed to get shows ready for airing, including showing up at 4:30 AM to let the stagehands onto the set, checking on catering, and keeping the staff happy however he could.

This was a pivotal experience for the young Bob Iger. He learned how shows of all kinds were made, from soap operas to news shows to game shows. He learned to work with all kinds of television staff, from makeup artists to electricians to carpenters. Most importantly, **the grueling hours and workload developed a flinty work ethic** that stays with him today.

> **Management Principle: Carve Out Personal Time**
> 
> Today, Bob Iger still wakes up at 4:15 AM. He relishes the time he gets to himself and his thoughts before the daily mundane demands of email and triaging priorities set in.
> 
> Even if you don’t want to wake up at 4:15 AM, it’s important to carve out time to yourself every day to explore your creativity unfettered.

Iger’s run in the department ended when he clashed with his boss. Iger’s boss was corrupt and used company resources for himself and his mistress. Iger asked other people what he could do about it, and his boss accused him of spreading rumors. In an argument, Iger was told to transfer to another department or lose his job.

Iger moved to ABC Sports as a studio operations supervisor, which in retrospect turned out to be a lucky break.

### Roone Arledge and ABC Sports

ABC Sports was a star department at ABC. They produced hit shows like _Monday Night Football_ and _Wide World of Sports_ , and they had exclusive coverage of the Olympics.

A large part of their success was due to the division’s president, Roone Arledge. His strong points of view changed the way sports were broadcasted:

  * He understood that sports was not just about the game being played but also about the human drama behind it. Underneath their superhuman performance, athletes were humans who had childhoods, who grew up in a unique way and culture, and had to surmount obstacles to get to where they were.
  * If covering sports was about telling stories, then you needed great storytellers to cover them. Roone found great broadcasters, like Jackie Stewart and Howard Cosell, and made them household names.
  * Roone embraced new technology as a way of better achieving his goal of connecting to viewers. He championed innovations like slow-motion replays and live events via satellite. **He taught Iger to “innovate or die,” and to avoid fearing the new.**



Roone Arledge was also a perfectionist. **He was unwilling to accept “good enough” and demanded greatness.** He knew everything about his production and examined minute details. Irritatingly, he would often review the work at the last minute, the night before the broadcast. He’d decide everything needed to be scrapped—the lighting changed, the set redesigned, the introduction re-edited—and cause his team to work overnight to make the deadline. And during the live broadcast, he’d deliver continuous feedback, phoning in from home if he had to.

Roone didn’t accept excuses. **If you came to him saying something couldn’t be done, he’d push you to find another way.**

This was exhausting, but also inspiring. People knew that Roone’s heart was in the right place—to create the best work product possible, regardless of the human cost. Roone was also usually right, and his high expectations lifted what people thought they were capable of doing. Because of Roone’s stature and the quality of his product, people wanted to meet his expectations.

For instance, in 1979, North Korea was hosting the World Table Tennis Championships. Roone wanted to cover it, regardless of how hostile the international politics were, and Bob Iger was assigned to the job. At first, the State Department shot Iger down, saying this grossly violated US sanctions prohibiting any business with North Korea. But knowing Roone wouldn’t accept failure, Iger eventually found a workaround—securing rights through the table tennis organization, not with North Korea directly. They were able to film in North Korea, a breakthrough moment for US media. Iger knew he wouldn’t have done it if Roone weren’t in his head demanding he get the job done.

> **Management Principle: Pursue Perfection**
> 
> Today, Iger practices “the relentless pursuit of perfection.” This doesn’t mean being 100% perfect at all costs. Rather, it means **refusing to accept mediocrity**. Don’t just make things “good enough”—make them great. Sweat the details.
> 
> A successful pursuit of perfection consists of two things: 1) a mindset of perfection, and 2) the work ethic to achieve it.

There was no question, though, that Roone was abrasive in his pursuit of perfection. He was very clear about what was wrong, and he didn’t care what it took to achieve his vision. He could also be cruel in how he expressed this. Despite the inspiration, working with Roone was exhausting and could be demoralizing, and plenty of people thought about quitting.

> **Management Principle: Be Empathetic and Fair**
> 
> Today, Iger knows that the pursuit of perfection doesn’t have to come at all costs. You can achieve greatness while still being empathetic and fair.
> 
> This doesn’t mean lowering your expectations. Rather, it means hearing people out, being emotionally stable, and giving people second chances for legitimate mistakes.

#### Cultural Expansion

Since ABC Sports was a star division in the company, people who worked there earned special treatment. They had expensive clothes and tastes, they associated with Hollywood celebrities and sports royalty, and they jetset around the world to cover sports in exotic places.

The travel broadened Iger’s worldview, giving him both his first refined French meal and his exposure to the daily struggles of people in the Soviet Union. At the same time, he was aware of how relatively unsophisticated and uneducated he was compared to his co-workers, and this drove him to the one place he knew he could win—work harder than anyone else.
