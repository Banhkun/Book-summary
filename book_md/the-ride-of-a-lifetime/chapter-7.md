## Chapter 7: Iger Aims to Be CEO

The board began its CEO search, and Iger wanted the job. He didn’t feel _entitled_ to it, but he did think he would do a good job.

He’d have to convince the board he was the right person, but his challenge was escaping his contributions to the decline of Disney. As COO for the past 5 years, he was clearly partially responsible for the decline. He _could_ simply blame Michael Eisner for the troubles, but he saw this as a betrayal of Eisner and a cowardly excuse.

He soon got a solution from political consultant and brand manager Scott Miller. Miller argued that, as a member of the old guard, Iger could never win the vote as an incumbent. Rather, he needed to be an insurgent—**the past didn’t matter anymore; only the future mattered**. The message to the board should be: “We can’t change the past. We’ve learned lessons that we can apply, but we can’t redo our mistakes. What matters now is where we take this company from here. The soul of the company is at stake—we need to protect it and grow it. Here’s my plan for the future.”

To make his plan concrete, Miller also counseled Iger to outline his strategic priorities. Iger started listing priorities, when Miller cut him off, saying that too many priorities meant there were no priorities. Iger could have only three priorities. In response, Iger focused on three:

  1. **Disney needed to make _high-quality_ content.** In an age where content was free and cheap, consumers would continue wanting to spend their time and money on great content.
  2. **Disney needed to embrace technology.** Consumers had more choice than ever, and, to compete, Disney needed to make it easy for consumers to access their content and create high-quality experiences with technology. They needed to see technology as an opportunity and not a threat.
  3. **Disney needed to become a global company.** They had superficial reach throughout the world, but now they needed to penetrate each country, particularly China and India. This meant thinking about new products that would appeal to more people they didn’t currently reach.



> **Management Principle: Define Your Priorities**
> 
> Priorities are an articulation of where you want to go and how you’re going to get there.
> 
> If your team members understand the priorities clearly, they can focus their own work in the right direction. They can make individual decisions that support the priorities.
> 
> In contrast, a team without priorities is aimless and anxious. They waste time wondering what they should be doing and working on things that don’t help the priorities.
> 
> Choose just a few priorities. Communicate them often.

### Convincing the Board

Iger had an uphill battle—most of the board members were against or lukewarm about his becoming CEO. But Iger knew there were a few swing voters he could try to persuade.

His first interview was an all-on-one meeting. The tone was pure business; that Iger had been on the board for the past 5 years didn’t give him any favors. Iger laid out his vision for the future, centered around his three strategic priorities. He stated that his goal was for Disney to be “the most admired company in the world” by their consumers, shareholders, and employees.

The interview process continued for another 6 months and another fourteen interviews (including one-on-ones with individual board members). It was an intellectually demanding time. While interviewing, he still had his COO responsibilities of running Disney. Interviewing was like a second job that required him to think strategically about the company like he never had before.

But the work was the easy part—Iger had been a hard worker for all his life. The more difficult part was the **psychological strain from the public scrutiny and his many detractors**. The press covered the interview process closely, and many commentators asserted Disney needed fresh blood, not Iger. The board members who were against his appointment made their disapproval clear in interviews.

For the most part, Iger remained calm, filtered the noise, and stayed centered about who he was and what he could do. He only broke on two instances:

  * At a Clippers basketball game with his son, he started feeling chest pains and shortness of breath. Thinking he’d had a heart attack, he left the game. His doctor said he’d had an anxiety attack. Iger, who had prided himself on being able to take huge amounts of stress, had to acknowledge the interview process was more draining than he’d realized.
  * In his last all-on-one interview, a board member tried to prod Iger into insulting Eisner once again, asking what Eisner did wrong and how Iger would be different. Iger snapped back, saying the question was insulting, he’d been asked the same question multiple times, and he would refuse to answer. After the interview, the more supportive board members told him the final interview was a bad time to show cracks.



> **Management Principle: Filter the Noise**
> 
> There may come a time when you have lots of detractors. People tell you you’re terrible at your job and that you should be replaced. This might even be public, and people who don’t know you make judgments about you.
> 
> During these times, don’t let how other people feel affect how you feel about yourself. You have little control over what other people say about you, but you do have control over what you do and how you feel. This perspective will help you through the rough times.

### Iger Gets the Job

In March 2005, the board met to finalize their decision. Iger wasn’t sure how the votes would swing, and he anxiously spent the day with his family.

He soon got a call from the interim chairman and Michael Eisner—**Iger was to be the next CEO of Disney**. He appreciated that Eisner was on the call, as difficult as it must have been for him to name his successor.

He sat and absorbed the moment with his wife, then called his parents, his daughters, Dan and Tom and Capital Cities. Then he called Steve Jobs, knowing that repairing the relationship with Pixar was going to be critical. Jobs was skeptical that anything would change, given that Iger had spent over a decade under Eisner, but Iger knew he had to give it a shot.
