## Prologue

In June 2016, Bob Iger had been CEO of the Walt Disney Company for 11 years. He was now in China, ready to unveil Shanghai Disneyland, the culmination of 18 years of planning and work. Even among all of Disney’s gigantic projects, Shanghai Disneyland stood out—it cost $6 billion to build, was 11 times the acreage of Disneyland, and required countless negotiations with the Chinese government. Opening the park was meant to be a joyous event, a union of Disney’s ever-popular magic with an authentic Chinese flavor. Just as millions of American children hoped of going to Disneyland, now a new generation of Chinese children would have the same joy.

It wasn’t going to be smooth. Two tragedies would occur in quick succession that tested Iger’s composure.

First, the Sunday night before the unveiling, the Orlando nightclub shooting occurred just miles from Disney World, killing over 50 people. Concerned about whether any Disney staff were among the victims, Iger’s team quickly phoned the security team in Orlando to stay updated. They’d learn a few days later that two part-time Disney employees were killed, and other employees were friends of victims. Their trauma and grief team quickly went to work for affected employees. Moreover, they’d learn from investigators later that the gunman had originally intended to target Disney World, until apparently being dissuaded by the extra police presence who happened to be there because of a concert.

Second, the day before the unveiling, a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at Disney’s Grand Floridian hotel in Orlando. That night, the family had been playing on the beach of the Seven Seas Lagoon, a man-made lake, and the child was near the edge of the water. An alligator attacked the boy and dragged him away.

In this tragedy, Iger felt deeply responsible. As the head of the company, he felt he should be the company’s voice in crises rather than a cold PR team, despite the possibility of complicating their legal liability. He wrote a statement about his experiences as a father and grandfather, and how that gave him just a glimpse into the pain of losing a child. He then tearfully called the child’s parents to offer his support; his parents begged him not to let their child’s life be in vain, to prevent this from happening to any other child. Iger promised to do this. Within a day, the Orlando security team put up fences and signs throughout the entire park.

The Shanghai Disney opening continued as scheduled, but it was the saddest day of his career.

> **Management Principle: Trust Your Team**
> 
> Iger confesses that he usually doesn’t feel anxiety when things go bad. He sees a crisis more as a problem to be solved, rather than something he has no agency over.
> 
> When emergencies like the shooting and alligator attack happen, he triages the problem, decides the response, trusts his team to do their jobs, and then gets out of the way when he has little more to add. This avoids micromanagement and meddling with little benefit.

### Iger’s Principles

Bob Iger has had a long career—22 years at ABC, then 23 at Disney (after Disney acquired ABC). He started as a bottom-level crew member on television sets and eventually became CEO of Disney for 15 years. He led Disney through momentous changes in technology, global expansion, and its noted acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. He still looks back at his career in mild disbelief as an incredible, lucky ride.

This book is a retelling of his professional career, with his leadership principles woven in.
