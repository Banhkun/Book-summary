## Chapter 5: Second in Command

With Michael Ovitz gone, Bob Iger now reported to CEO Michael Eisner. But Eisner was reluctant to name anyone to be president or COO, and he ran the company without a formal number two.

Eisner treated Bob erratically, at one moment warm and confiding and at another cold and distant. At the root of this treatment seemed to be **Eisner’s insecurity about grooming a successor who would potentially compete with him for the top job**. (Shortform note: In our summary of business classic Good to Great, read about how mediocre leaders refuse to groom successors out of ego, while great leaders support their successors whole-heartedly.)

For his part, Iger was ambitious and wanted a shot at running Disney one day, but he was also respectful and patient. He had no intention of aggressively competing against Eisner. Instead, he wanted to do a great job in his current role and learn as much as he could about the company.

> **Management Principle: Be Ambitious, But Not Impatient**
> 
> Ambition to take on more responsibility and rise up is valuable, but it can be stretched too far toward impatience. Some people focus so much on the job they want that they start doing poorly in the job they have. In turn, they sabotage themselves from achieving the job they want.
> 
> As an employee, do a great job in where you are today. Make your ambition clear through your action—be eager to learn, help out where you can, and work hard. When your boss has an opportunity, you want to be the one they think of first.
> 
> As a manager, when you think about who to promote, don’t focus on people who keep asking for promotions but don’t have the work to back it up. Focus on people who do the work well and are true team players. In turn, if you establish a pattern of rewarding people on merit and not on politics, your team will be loyal to you.

### Walt Disney International

In 1998, Iger was chairman of ABC Group, overseeing the ABC network, ESPN, and Disney TV. In one of his warmer moments, Eisner asked Iger to head Walt Disney International, a new organization to focus Disney’s international efforts.

At the time, Disney had offices and cultural influence globally, but the efforts were scattered and unfocused. There was no compelling global strategy, the offices didn’t talk to each other, and there were no proactive efforts in the international offices to find local opportunities.

Iger’s job was to form a coherent global strategy, as well as achieve a monumental task they’d sought for decades—build a theme park in mainland China. From his time in ABC Sports, Iger had previous experience in China, and he flew to Shanghai to hash out details with local officials. They chose a property close to Shanghai; it was then an unimpressive rural place, with stray dogs and patches of farmland dotting the landscape, but 20 years later it would be one of Disney’s crown jewels.

### ABC’s Downward Slump

By the end of the millennium, ABC television’s momentum had run out. Long-running favorites like _NYPD Blue_ and _Monday Night Football_ were still reliable anchors, and new shows like _Home Improvement_ and _The Drew Carey Show_ did well, but they were being outpaced by other networks. (Shortform note: Notably, NBC took top spot for several years with juggernaut shows like _Seinfeld_ , _ER_ , and _Friends_.)

**Iger blamed the malaise on complacency and lack of risk-taking** , and today he acknowledges some responsibility for this. When they found a new #1 show in _Who Wants to Be a Millionaire_ , they milked it to the extreme, running it three nights a week. This temporarily buoyed their ratings, but it masked their fundamental issues with creative show development. For years, they would slip down to third behind NBC and CBS.

Besides _Millionaire_ , there was one other bright point—ABC’s coverage of the coming of the new millennium. In 1998, Iger thought this was a globally intriguing event that people would want to see unfold throughout the world. He pitched a live 24-hour event to the ABC executive team; his former boss, Roone Arledge, demurred, saying a calendar event wouldn’t make for a day-long event. Iger, however, had an instinct that he was right, and he cajoled Roone into taking on the event, saying only he was capable of running such a demanding, history-making event. The event turned out to be a hit—ABC had coverage from the earliest time zone in Vanuatu and followed the globe through China, Paris, Brazil, and the United States.

Two years later, Roone died from cancer. Iger visited him the week before he passed, and they reflected on how times had changed.

### Iger Becomes Second in Command

By 1999, Eisner had been straining for years under the load of running Disney by himself, and he started thinking he needed a number two. He’d been CEO for 16 years, and the board was now pressuring him to plan for succession. But Eisner was still hesitant, not just because of his concern about being undermined but also because of Michael Ovitz’s very public and costly failure.

**Eisner’s indecision left a power vacuum** , and multiple people, such as Disney’s general counsel, tried to angle for the COO job. This caused ripple effects downward as executives jockeyed for authority. In turn, this corrupted long-term strategic thinking and soured morale.

Eisner continued his confusing treatment of Bob Iger. In a private dinner in August with former Capital Cities CEO Tom Murphy, Eisner asserted that Iger would never succeed him. Murphy called Iger to report the news and counseled him to leave Disney, and Iger was crushed. He’d worked so hard to integrate ABC into Disney and to build Disney’s international presence, at great personal cost.

A month later, Eisner asked to meet with Iger. Given that Iger thought he was “unpromotable,” he fully expected to be fired. But Eisner asked an unexpected question—**was Iger willing to move to Los Angeles and help him run the company?** Iger was shocked. He brought up Eisner’s vacillating treatment of Iger over the past years; his boss responded candidly that he was hesitant to groom his own competition. Iger reassured Eisner that he had no intention of competing with him, and that he couldn’t see a Disney without Eisner.

The meeting ended ambiguously—Eisner hadn’t actually proposed a title and didn’t make concrete plans to move forward. But in December, Eisner formally proposed that Iger become president, COO, and a member of the Disney board.

Iger hashed out the details with Disney’s general counsel, who had himself angled for the COO role. In a dirty move, the counsel called him the day before the announcement, saying the plan had changed—Iger would be executive vice president instead of COO, and he’d no longer be on the board. Iger firmly responded that he would take only the original deal or nothing. An hour later, the lawyer called back and said it would go through as planned.

Mimicking his appointment to head ABC Entertainment 10 years ago, Iger packed up part of his family (his new wife Willow Bay and child), left the rest of his family (his daughters from his first marriage and his aging parents), and left for Los Angeles.
