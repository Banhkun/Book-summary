## Chapters 12-14: Acquiring 21st Century Fox and Iger’s End as CEO

By 2016, Iger’s three big acquisitions were well underway and all looked like home runs. But this still didn’t feel like enough. Even though Disney had grown considerably, the technology and media landscape had changed even further. The massive technology companies of the day—Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix—commanded the attention of billions of consumers. All these companies were also investing heavily in creating their own content.

In this climate, Disney had two choices. First, it could simply continue business as usual—it could continue distributing films through movie theaters and shows through TV, and it could license its content to distributors like Netflix and Apple. However, **Disney risked being made a commodity content producer** , just one option among thousands. The tech behemoths would continue to gain power and consumer loyalty, and eventually Disney might have no choice but to be on these networks, meaning it’d lose all its negotiating leverage and lose its direct connection to consumers.

The other option was for **Disney to control its own distribution to consumers, with no middlemen**. This would require developing their own technology platform and severing ties with distributors like Netflix. It would also mean disrupting their own existing businesses in the short-term and losing many millions in revenue. But **if they did it right, Disney could control its long-term destiny**.

### Building Their Own Tech Platform

Iger thus started to look at companies that could plausibly serve as their technology platform, including Snapchat, Spotify, and Twitter (giants like Google and Amazon were obviously too big for Disney to have a chance at acquiring, and none expressed interest in acquiring Disney). They settled on Twitter, and negotiations reached a near-complete deal. But one weekend, Iger got cold feet. The political and social tensions of Twitter—its reputation for polarized speech, fake news, and general toxicity in its members—would be too much for Disney to handle. Iger called off the deal and apologized to Twitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey.

Around the same time, they had looked into BAMTech, a company primarily owned by Major League Baseball. The company had developed streaming services for both MLB and for HBO, and they could do something similar for Disney. Disney thus bought 33% of the company in August 2016 for $1 billion and started making a subscription service for ESPN. Soon, the vision expanded to creating a subscription service for all of Disney’s other content.

At the following year’s annual board retreat, Iger presented the progress to date and the challenge of disruption. He then shared a more aggressive plan to**buy a majority stake in BAMTech, then use that to launch what would become Disney+ and ESPN+ within the next two years**. Far from being skeptical, the board gave full-throated approval—a few newer board members from Nike and General Motors were acutely aware of the threat of disruption and the need to move quickly. Disney announced its strategy to the public in August 2017, and their stock jumped, an indication of support from investors for Disney’s fight for its future.

Disney was now poised to serve its content directly to its consumers, with no intermediaries. As a result of the public announcement and the stock market’s positive response, Disney was galvanized to execute the plan.

Such a fundamental change, though, meant big adjustments in the short-term. For one, Disney cut ties with Netflix for its shows and movies, which meant a short-term loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in licensing fees.

Another change was the murky compensation structure for developing new content for the streaming platforms. Traditionally, content creators would be rewarded directly on the success of their own projects—the more profits they earned, as in box-office gross sales, the more they were paid. However, the bottom-line profit in streaming services couldn’t be clearly measured, since consumers weren’t paying for individual titles. To resolve this, Iger proposed a compensation model through stock grants, based on Iger’s subjective assessment of how much the executives were contributing to the streaming project, and how well they were working together. It was unusual, but it was a necessary part of Disney’s disrupting their own business.

### Rupert Murdoch Entertains a Sale

Around this time in August 2017, Rupert Murdoch asked Iger to visit him at his winery in Bel Air. Murdoch was then the founder and biggest owner of News Corp and 21st Century Fox, which included the 20th Century Fox film studio, the Fox television network, and a bevy of other studios and cable channels.

At their meeting, Murdoch commiserated about the threats to their media companies, particularly from big tech companies, and how much scale mattered in surviving in the environment. These threats were exactly what Iger and Disney had been defending against with their acquisitions and their own streaming service. But the difference between their two companies, according to Murdoch, was that **21st Century Fox didn’t have scale, but Disney did**.

It soon became clear that Murdoch was suggesting that Disney should buy 21st Century Fox. The implication was that his company’s shareholders, of which he was the largest, would benefit more from being part of Disney and building a strong united front than they would by standing alone. The possibility was intriguing to Iger, but it would represent a deal possibly ten times bigger than Pixar’s $7 billion sale.

Iger and his team started studying what assets they could acquire, and what it would mean for Disney. First, they knew they couldn’t buy the entire company—antitrust regulation would prevent them from owning the Fox television network or their sports networks, and Murdoch liked Fox News too much to let it go (let alone the political muddying with the ideologically clean Disney). The assets left included their movie studio, a major stake in National Geographic, their international operations, and stakes in streaming service Hulu and Sky (Europe’s largest satellite broadcasting company).

Next they had to figure out what these assets were worth to Disney. This meant projecting not just their performance as a standalone company, but also the gains from combining with Disney. This included reducing costs through efficiencies and in growth through synergies, such as Disney using Fox’s presence in India and Fox bringing in great content talent. It looked like the growth opportunity was in the billions. It could be a really good deal.

### Competing With Comcast

Having done their analysis, Disney offered to buy Fox for $28 a share, or $52.4 billion, and maintained that they couldn’t go any higher.

Around that time, word leaked of the possible deal, and Comcast put in its own significantly higher offer. Iger wasn’t intimidated—Comcast would face significantly more antitrust scrutiny (given that they already owned NBC-Universal and one of the nation’s largest distribution networks). He thought the Fox board and shareholders would prefer the higher likelihood of Disney’s deal, even if it were lower in value.

Furthermore, Iger was willing to walk away from the deal. Fox would be a major accelerant in Disney’s strategy, but integrating the two massive companies would be wearying, and there were still plenty of unknowns about how the combined entity would succeed. Despite Murdoch’s insistence on $29 a share, Disney’s best offer was $28, and no higher.

At the end of November, Murdoch accepted their bid, and they announced the acquisition a few weeks later on December 14. This wasn’t a done deal—an acquisition of this size and importance required regulatory approval, which could take six months and still allowed for competing bids.

Notably, the media industry was watching for the outcome of an antitrust lawsuit blocking the merger of AT&T and Time Warner. If the lawsuit was upheld and the merger was deemed illegal, then Comcast would likely have little success in buying Fox. But if the lawsuit were overruled, then Comcast might pursue Fox with renewed vigor and make a higher bid for Fox.

Even still, Disney had to plan as though the deal were going to go through, and Iger began planning for the integration. Merging all the business units would be an organizational headache. So he asked himself—“If I were designing the combined company from scratch, how would it be organized?” He decided first on separating the content pieces (the movie studios and TV stations) from technology and operations (which included apps, distribution, data analysis, and sales). This would let creative people be creative and let the tech and operations people focus on distributing the content and making money. Then, the remaining businesses, like the theme parks and consumer products, went into a third group, “physical entertainment and goods.”

With this master structure worked out and approved by his deputies, Iger began the difficult challenge of deciding who would lead which business units. He started flying around the world meeting with Fox and Disney executives.

### Me-Too and Bad Behavior at Disney

During the time that Disney was building its direct-to-consumer services and working through the Fox acquisition, another wave was sweeping through the media industry—the Me Too movement, revealing years of sexual harassment perpetrated by powerful men, most notably of which was Harvey Weinstein, a former Disney employee.

Iger called for HR policies enabling victims to come forward, share their stories, and ensure they wouldn’t be punished. In the fall of 2017, multiple Disney staff members complained about John Lasseter’s gratuitous physical contact, including unsolicited hugs and kisses, as well as inappropriate comments. Despite his critical role in Disney Animation, Iger knew they couldn’t compromise their values for money. Lasseter was placed on a six-month leave, then ultimately left Disney and Pixar entirely.

The Me Too movement itself was part of a larger trend toward transparency and punishment for bad behavior. The very same technology movement that put Disney in jeopardy was the one that highlighted poor actors. In this stretch, **Iger had to deal with two further scandals** :

  * In December 2017, the President of ESPN, John Skipper, revealed that he had a drug problem. Iger had no choice but to fire him. (Shortform note: Skipper later revealed that he abused cocaine, and that someone he bought from had extorted him and threatened to reveal his drug use, which prompted Skipper’s admission to Disney.)
  * In May 2018, Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, an advisor to President Obama, saying she looked as though the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby.” A year earlier, Roseanne had returned to television in a revival of her namesake show. Iger knew she was volatile and cautioned her to stay off Twitter. Once again, Iger had little choice but to fire Roseanne, cancel the show, and apologize publicly.



This left Disney without key leaders in Animation and ESPN, but Iger didn’t hesitate to do what he had to. The integrity of the company was priceless.

> **Management Principle: Maintain Integrity**
> 
> Your company is defined by its actions and the actions of people working for it. Any behavior that discredits the company is intolerable and needs to be acted on. You cannot compromise your integrity, regardless of the financial losses you might incur in the short term.

### The Final Battle With Comcast

In June 2018, the event Disney feared came to pass: the AT&T-Time Warner lawsuit was struck down by the court judge, and AT&T could proceed with buying Time Warner. The next day, Comcast issued a new offer: $35 per share, or $64 billion, in cash. This was a huge premium over Disney’s $28 per share, and the fact that it was all-cash rather than a stock transaction made the offer even sweeter. Disney had spent six months deciding how to integrate Fox, and it might all be a waste.

The Fox board was due to vote on the Comcast offer in a week, and Disney had a few options to bid in response. It could issue a lower bid like last time, hoping that Fox would still prefer Disney due to lower risk of a regulatory hiccup. Alternatively, it could match Comcast’s offer. Lastly, it could exceed Comcast’s offer and try to win outright. Disney’s execs and bankers counseled Iger to go low or match, but Iger wanted a clearly better offer, and not just an incrementally better one—a significantly better offer that would be hard to match.

Two days before the Fox board meeting, the Disney team flew to London in secret and met with Murdoch. They proposed $38 per share—$3 higher than Comcast’s offer and $5.5 billion more—in half cash and half stock. The next day, Murdoch brought the bid to the board, and they approved Disney’s offer, not Comcast’s. This came as a surprise to Comcast.

Soon thereafter, Disney tried to get a clear answer from the Department of Justice on the likelihood of their approving the deal. The DoJ responded that if Disney sold the sports networks, they wouldn’t block the acquisition. This gave Disney an even greater advantage over Comcast.

The final Fox shareholder vote was due in late July 2018, and Comcast could still return with a higher bid. But **Comcast announced it was dropping its campaign to buy Fox** and congratulated Disney. The deal was approved by Fox shareholders.

It still wasn’t totally done. Disney needed to secure regulatory approval globally, including in China, Russia, India, and the EU. It took months, but in March 2019, nineteen months after the initial meeting with Murdoch, they completed the deal. **Disney was now one of the largest media entertainment companies in the world.**

### The Future of Disney

In April 2019, Disney hosted an investor’s day to share the fruits of their years-long effort to control their own destiny. They revealed the quality content that would be available on Disney+—not just the huge catalogue of existing Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and _Star Wars_ films, but also new, original shows like _The Mandalorian_. They would price the service at $6.99 a month, an accessible cost to the global audience that they estimated would gain them sixty to ninety million subscribers within five years.

Disney was also transparent about the short-term impact of these efforts. The cost of creating new content and technology, along with reduced revenue from undercutting their existing businesses, meant their profits would drop by a few billion dollars a year in the short-term. But over time, these profits should return and more than compensate.

**The investor response was immediately ecstatic** —Disney’s stock rose 11% after the conference. More good news came— _Avengers: Endgame_ became the highest-grossing movie of all time; Disney acquired Comcast’s stake in Hulu; Galaxy’s Edge opened at Disneyland.

Fifteen years earlier, when vying for the CEO job, Iger had laid out a three-point plan—produce high-quality content, embrace technology, and become a global company. Now Iger could see that **they had executed beyond their expectations** , Disney had become an entertainment giant, and all the hard work was worth it.

### Final Word

At the time of the book’s publishing in 2019, Iger had spent forty-five years at ABC and Disney. He was sixty-eight years old, and he was determined to retire by 2021. He ends the book with a few final reflections.

First, he comments that **it’s not always healthy to hold power for too long**. You can eventually become overconfident; you’ve seen it all, and you tend to strike down new ideas impatiently. People also start treating you differently—rather than voicing their true opinions, they wait to hear what you think. You lose self-awareness—with all these people telling you you’re powerful and important, it’s hard not to get caught up in your own ego. As you gain power, it’s critical to maintain perspective, to keep listening to people and entertaining new ideas.

Iger thanks his mentors throughout his career, including Roone Arledge, Tom and Dan from Capital Cities, and Michael Eisner. He also acknowledges the thousands of people in Disney who made the progress possible.

He doesn’t comment on what he wants to do next, other than noting in an earlier chapter that he’s always been interested in public service and has entertained running for President of the United States. For now, he thinks back to his childhood self in Brooklyn, watching Disney shows on TV and pining for his first visit to Disneyland. What that boy would have thought if he knew he’d one day be safeguarding Disney’s legacy for decades to come.
