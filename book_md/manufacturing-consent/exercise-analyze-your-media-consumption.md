## Exercise: Analyze Your Media Consumption

Think about how and where you get your news.

* * *

Where do you primarily get your news from (television, print media, social media)?

Is there a particular source or form of media that you trust more than others? Explain why or why not.

Do you find that you tend to gravitate toward media sources that reflect your personal worldview? Explain your answer.

Are you interested in expanding your media consumption habits to incorporate more sources that challenge or contradict your views? How do you think you might do this?
