## Exercise: Assess Problem-Solving in Groups

Syed argues that diverse groups are better problem-solvers than homogeneous ones since diverse groups have better coverage of the problem space. In this exercise, reflect on a group that you were part of and consider how that group’s diversity affected your ability to problem-solve.

* * *

Describe a recent situation in which you belonged to a group tasked with solving a problem. What was the problem?

Which diverse perspectives in the group helped cover the problem space?

How did those perspectives affect the group’s problem-solving process? Alternatively, if the group lacked diverse perspectives, how did that lack of diversity affect the problem-solving process?

Which perspectives were _missing_ from the group?

How might these perspectives have changed the group’s proposed solution to the problem?
