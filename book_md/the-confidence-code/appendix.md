## Appendix: Assessments

Now that you have a good handle on how confidence works, try this assessment of self-esteem (which is related to confidence) and an assessment of confidence.

### Self-Esteem Assessment

Give yourself a score of 0-3 on each of the following questions. 0 means you strongly disagree, 3 means you strongly agree.

  1. You have at least as much worth as everyone else.
  2. You have many positive qualities.
  3. You can do things as well as almost everyone else. 
  4. You think positively about yourself.
  5. Overall, you’re happy with yourself.
  6. Overall, you think you’re a success.
  7. You have a lot to be proud of.
  8. You respect yourself.
  9. You feel useful most of the time.
  10. Most of the time, you think you’re valuable.



If your score is below 15, you might have low self-esteem. If it’s between 15-25, you’re in the normal range.

### Confidence Scale

Give yourself a score of 1-4 on each of the following questions. 1 means you strongly disagree, 4 means you strongly agree.

  1. You can always solve hard problems if you apply effort.
  2. You can usually solve hard problems if you apply effort.
  3. When you face a problem, you can think of many solutions.
  4. You can overcome people who oppose you.
  5. You find it easy to meet your goals.
  6. You believe you could efficiently deal with unpredictable events.
  7. You believe you’re resourceful enough to deal with unpredictable events.
  8. You can usually deal with whatever happens to you.
  9. You know you’re resilient to challenges so you can remain calm.
  10. If you’re in trouble, you can find a way to rescue yourself.



A lower score indicates less confidence, and higher, more confidence. The worldwide average is 29.
