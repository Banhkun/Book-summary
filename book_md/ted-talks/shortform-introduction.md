## Shortform Introduction

A great speech has the power to inspire and change the world, but most people believe that public speaking is an innate talent. As curator for TED, Chris Anderson knows better—he has seen hundreds of speeches succeed and fail, and he has figured out the secret formula. Published in 2016, _TED Talks_ is a nuts-and-bolts guide to public speaking that takes you from the initial idea to your final bow.

In this guide, we go through Anderson’s advice piece by piece, explaining what works in public speaking and what doesn’t. From scripting to wardrobe, and everything in between, we compare his advice to that of other public speaking experts and supplement his ideas with actionable methods.

### About the Author

Anderson has been the TED Conference curator since 2002. One of his primary responsibilities in this role is to select speakers for the nonprofit’s premier medium: TED Talks. Anderson was born in a remote village in Pakistan in 1957 and traveled throughout his childhood with his missionary parents. He grew up in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and England, before attending Oxford University and obtaining a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics.

He began his career as a magazine editor and went on to found two publishing companies and a media nonprofit—the Sapling Foundation. In 2001, Sapling acquired the struggling TED Conference, and Anderson turned the nonprofit around and helped make it an international success.

Anderson has authored two books: _TED Talks_ and its teen version: _Thank You for Coming to My TED Talk_.

### The Book’s Publication

_TED Talks_ was published in 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. The eBook version of _TED Talks_ is available here.

TED provides a list of websites where you can purchase paperback and hardcover versions of _TED Talks_. They note that all proceeds are donated to TED’s nonprofit mission.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

TED is a nonprofit organization dedicated to spreading knowledge, innovation, and ways of thinking. Its primary medium is TED Talks, which are short talks (18 minutes or less) that pack a punch with insightful ideas and engaging deliveries. TED was founded in 1984 as a conference focused on technology, entertainment, and design (hence the acronym), but it has expanded since then to include all topics worth exploring.

Anderson took over TED in 2002 and began sharing the talks online in 2006—when YouTube was still a young company and video streaming wasn’t quick or easy. Despite the uphill battle, TED Talks were so captivating that they reached one million views in less than three months. In 2012, they surpassed one billion views. Today, TED Talks are considered the gold standard of public speaking.

In this book, Anderson describes in-person speaking, but because TED Talks are recorded and put online, he frequently touches on how his advice translates to video format. At the time this guide is being published (2022), his advice is more relevant than ever, as more presentations are happening via teleconferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Intellectual Context

In 2014, two years before _TED Talks_ was published, _Talk Like TED_ was released. The author of this book is Carmine Gallo, a communications coach who is not affiliated with TED but who watched hundreds of TED Talks and interviewed TED speakers. His book claims to have identified the nine secrets that all great TED Talks share. Other books also discuss the secrets to a great TED Talk, but Anderson’s is the only one to date written by someone affiliated with the nonprofit.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_TED Talks_ is a _New York Times_ best seller, and _Publisher’s Weekly_ dubbed it an “invaluable guide.” The book __ has enjoyed highly positive reviews by readers, with many praising it for advice that’s easy to understand and apply. Common praise mentions the abundance of practical tips, the organized structure, and the easy-to-read format. Many online reviewers state that they read the book in anticipation of giving a speech, and they found it to be a valuable tool in their preparation.

Critics of _TED Talks_ are few and far between, but a common complaint among detractors is that the book is too heavy on anecdotes and too light on principles. Some felt that it was difficult to find the messages among all of the stories.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach and Organization

_TED Talks_ is made up of 21 short chapters that cover all the aspects of public speaking: idea development, connection with your audience, the physical setup of your stage, visual aids, wardrobe, voice and body language, and so on. Anderson uses personal anecdotes from his work as a curator and examples from previous TED speeches to illustrate his principles.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve grouped Anderson’s advice into thematic sections and discussed the principles while omitting his personal anecdotes:

  * Part 1: Why people fear public speaking and common misconceptions about it
  * Part 2: The initial idea and how to keep your speech attached to it, as well as speech styles that don’t work
  * Part 3: How to connect with your audience, and specific strategies to use depending on the type of speech you’re giving
  * Part 4: How to write and rehearse your speech
  * Part 5: Stage setup options and how to use visual aids effectively
  * Part 6: How to master stage presence, which includes wardrobe, speaking, body language, and controlling your nerves.



Additionally, we’ve supplemented Anderson’s ideas with advice from several other public speaking experts.
