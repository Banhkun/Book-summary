## Part 3: Strategies for Different Speech Types

Developing a solid idea and strong throughline are essential, but they don’t guarantee you’ll make an impact. Anderson explains that **you must connect with your audience in order to be effective and memorable.**

In this section, we’ll look at Anderson’s recommended strategies for engaging your audience. We’ll also explore how some strategies differ depending on the type of speech: explanatory (when you teach your audience something new), persuasive (when you try to change your audience’s mind), or “revelatory” or imaginative (when you aim to delight or inspire).”

### For All Speech Types: Connect With Your Audience

To change a person’s mind about anything, you first need to get them to drop their protective walls. Anderson explains that people hesitate to open their minds to strangers because their mind is the most personal and important thing they own. He advises you to **gain your listener’s trust by connecting to them on a human level.**

Anderson provides **five strategies to connect** with your audience: **Meet their eyes, drop your ego, be vulnerable, use humor, and tell them a story.** You can use any or all of these strategies in your speech.

#### Strategy #1: Meet Their Eyes

Anderson explains why eye contact is so important in public speaking: Neuroscientists have proven that **when you look into someone’s eyes, your emotions naturally sync up**. For example, if you look into the eyes of a nervous person, you’ll start to feel nervous; look into the eyes of someone who is sad, and you’ll feel sad. Eye contact with an occasional, genuine smile will make your audience feel relaxed and trust you.

Anderson’s advice: Greet your audience, choose a few people to make eye contact with, nod hello, smile, then begin.

(Shortform note: According to speech analysts, three seconds is the ideal amount of time to hold eye contact, and 10 seconds makes the other person uncomfortable. There are cultural differences to consider, however, and this is the recommendation for public speaking in America. If you’re speaking in another country, it’s a good idea to research what is customary there.)

#### Strategy #2: Drop Your Ego

If the audience senses that you’re egotistical, they’ll immediately dislike you and tune you out. Anderson says to avoid the following behaviors because they signal to the audience that you’re full of yourself: name dropping, sharing stories only to show off achievements, and making your speech about yourself rather than your ideas. Anderson adds that a bit of self-deprecation can go a long way.

(Shortform note: All speeches have three components: the speaker, the audience, and the message. Of these three, the speaker is the least important. Keep this in mind as you write your speech (pay attention to how much you talk about yourself versus your ideas) and also let it take the pressure off as you’re speaking. Use this mantra: “message over messenger.”)

#### Strategy #3: Be Vulnerable

Being vulnerable with your audience is a symbolic way of showing that you’re not armed or dangerous. Anderson says that when you’re vulnerable, you show your human side and invite connection. To do this, share a time when you experienced failure or embarrassed yourself, and explain what you learned from it. Or express a deep fear and reveal how it influences your behavior.

While Anderson encourages vulnerability, he strongly warns against faking it, as this will cause your audience to feel manipulated and angry. Ask yourself if what you’re sharing is helpful to the audience, or if your goal is to elicit a response. The former is genuine vulnerability, and the latter is manipulation.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Vulnerability, _Brené Brown makes a distinction between vulnerability and oversharing. Vulnerability is appropriate to the conversation and relationship, and oversharing isn’t—rather than feeling compassion, the recipient of oversharing feels uncomfortable. If you’re unsure whether your vulnerable moment is actually an overshare, ask yourself two questions: 1) Is this share in service to the audience, or is it in service to me?, and 2) Is this share appropriate for strangers to hear, or is it best saved for a close relationship?)

#### Strategy #4: Use Humor

Humor is a great tool for connection. **We naturally like people who make us laugh** because when you’re in on the same joke, you feel like you’re on the same team. If humor is one of your strengths, Anderson recommends you use it. Even if your speech is about a serious topic, he says you can use humor in the beginning to connect with your audience before transitioning into the serious stuff. (Shortform note: In dramatic films, humor is often used as a way to approach uncomfortable topics. Audiences also appreciate that humor gives them the opportunity to exhale and release tension during long periods of seriousness.)

Funny stories and anecdotes work well, but stay away from scripted jokes, puns, and sarcasm. Additionally, jokes that are at the expense of another person make the audience cringe. He advises that you **never joke about gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, or politics** —it’s too easy to offend or upset people in these realms. Finally, Anderson says **if you know you aren’t funny, don’t try to be**. A failed attempt at humor is worse than no humor at all. If this is you, he says to use another strategy for connection instead.

(Shortform note: If you include a funny story in your speech, don’t announce it to your audience. For some inexplicable reason, the simple act of starting with, “Here’s a funny story,” almost always ensures that the story won’t receive laughs. Instead, tell the story with no setup; if it _is_ funny, the surprise will make the story even funnier. If it’s _not_ funny, then there’s no expectation to meet or disappointment to navigate.)

#### Strategy #5: Tell Them a Story

Anderson says one of the easiest ways to connect with an audience is to tell a story.**Everyone loves stories—they inspire curiosity, encourage empathy, and induce relaxation.** When an audience recognizes that a story is being told, they immediately relax because it doesn’t take mental effort to listen to a story. Anderson recommends using stories at any time during your speech: Use them in the beginning to introduce your topic, in the middle to illustrate a point, or as an ending to pack a final punch.

**Stories that are about you or someone close to you are the most authentic** , but make sure they aren’t designed to make you look brilliant or heroic. Self-deprecating humor, or stories where you learned a valuable lesson, will be received much better.

(Shortform note: According to Carmine Gallo in _Talk Like TED,_ storytelling serves an additional purpose: It provides “proof” that your claims are legitimate. For example, if you’re trying to convince your audience that walking every day will lead to longevity, telling a story about your 105-year-old grandmother walking to a job every day supports your thesis.)

##### Avoid Tribal Thinking

Anderson says that **tribal thinking** (discriminatory thinking against other groups as loyalty to your own) **is the single greatest barrier to connection**. Politics and religion are the two biggest tribes, and if you say something to misalign yourself with the audience, they’ll dismiss the rest of what you say. Anderson says to imagine the world through _their_ eyes, and **unless it’s the point of your speech, steer clear of inflammatory language** that makes your political or religious views known.

> **Approaching Controversial Topics**
> 
> Anderson doesn’t provide guidance on how to approach a speech on a sensitive topic, such as politics or religion. While you can assume that most of your audience is already part of your “tribe” and shares your views, the purpose of public speaking is often to change hearts and minds. So how can you connect with audience members who don’t already agree with you?
> 
> The authors of _Public Speaking: Finding Your Voice_ recommend you take a “co-active” approach, which consists of six steps:
> 
>   * **Establish goodwill** : Introduce yourself and assure the audience of your positive intentions.
> 
>   * **Find common ground:** Present and discuss values and goals that both sides share.
> 
>   * **Explain your position:** You’re not trying to persuade the other side yet; rather, you are giving reasons for why _you_ believe what you do. This is a good opportunity for storytelling.
> 
>   * **Cite authority figures that the other side respects:** The source is often as important as the information. Discuss where the other side has agreed with your view.
> 
>   * **Set small, reasonable goals:** Major change rarely happens overnight; it usually happens in increments. Aim to convince the other side to take one step in your direction.
> 
>   * **Acknowledge the validity of their viewpoint:** Discuss a few contentions that the other side has with your view and why they are valid. You should still maintain your position, but don’t dismiss their concerns.
>

### Strategies for Explanatory Speeches

The most common types of speeches are explanatory, when you’re teaching your audience something new or explaining a difficult concept. To connect with your audience in an explanatory speech, Anderson recommends the following strategies:

  * **Meet them where they are.** Reference the current moment or state of the world to make your topic relevant to the audience. Ask yourself, “How can I connect this new information to what they already know and why should they care?”
  * **Spark the audience’s curiosity**. Pose an interesting question without an obvious answer, tell an entertaining story, or show a striking image.
  * **Introduce terminology and concepts** one by one using familiar metaphors, clear examples, and stories. Mix the new with the familiar.
  * **Do a jargon check**. If you’re using words the layperson doesn’t know, you need to either eliminate them or explain them. (Shortform note: Consider the “layperson” to be the average audience member. If you’re presenting to a group of astrophysicists, it’s safe to assume that they have a different vocabulary base than someone who works in a different field.) 



> **Tips for Explaining Complex Topics**
> 
> Physicist and TEDx speaker Dominic Walliman is an expert at explaining difficult concepts in a simple way. The proof: He writes children’s books and creates YouTube videos for kids to explain quantum mechanics and nanotechnology. In a 2016 TEDx talk titled “Quantum Physics for 7 Year Olds,” Walliman gives four steps for explaining difficult concepts:
> 
>   * **Meet the audience where they are.** (This advice is the same as Anderson’s).
> 
>   * **Stay on topic.** Don’t allow yourself to get sidetracked by tangents or rabbit holes. Think about the one focus of your speech and always move in that direction.
> 
>   * **Favor clarity over accuracy.** When you’re explaining a complex concept, 100% accuracy requires deep dives into mundane details, which can confuse your audience or lose their interest entirely. Walliman says it’s okay to sacrifice complete accuracy as long as the audience understands the majority of what you’re saying. If they want more information afterward, you’ll have the opportunity to educate them further.
> 
>   * **Tell them why this matters to you.** Enthusiasm is contagious, and unless you care deeply about your topic, why should they?
> 
> 


**Beware the curse of knowledge:** The better you know something, the harder it is to imagine _not_ knowing it. This is why so many experts give dry, incomprehensible explanations. Anderson recommends you **practice your speech on a private audience and ask them afterward if anything was confusing**. (Shortform note: Try using the kindergarten test: If you’re able to explain the concept to a 5-year-old, then you’ll be able to explain it to any group of adults. This isn’t to say that you should use the same explanation as you would with a kindergartener, but it shows that you understand how to break a concept down into its most elementary parts and relate them to the world.)

### Strategies for Persuasive Speeches

To change someone’s opinion, Anderson says you must **nudge them in your direction one small step at a time** so that by the end, your argument is completely plausible in their minds**.** He says that you should start by priming your audience, and by the end they should be motivated to make a change. In the middle, you can employ strategies such as **appealing to logic, discrediting the opposite stance, or guiding them to the conclusion through process of elimination.**

#### Strategy #1: Prime the Audience

Anderson says that a good persuasive speech begins with priming. To prime someone is to expose them to a certain image or thought to influence how they react to the next image or thought. For example, if your speech is about the benefits of art in elementary education, showing a photograph of children happily painting primes your audience to think positive thoughts about creative activities.

(Shortform note: Priming is a manipulation of the subconscious often used by salespeople and advertisers. For example: If you own a restaurant and want your customers to order Italian wine, you can prime them to desire it by playing Italian music in the background. According to the theory, the customer isn’t consciously thinking that they want Italian wine to go with the music, but their eye will go to that part of the menu because of it. However, after several studies failed to replicate earlier findings about the impact of priming, some psychologists believe that its effects are more limited than previously thought or altogether nonexistent.)

#### Strategy #2: Appeal to Logic

Anderson says that appeals to logic are the most commonly used techniques in persuasive speaking, and they include: citing evidence and expert opinions, using “if, then” statements to show cause and effect, displaying statistics, and using anecdotes. While these aren’t the most groundbreaking techniques, he says that every persuasive speech should employ at least some of these strategies.

(Shortform note: About 2,300 years ago, Aristotle determined that effective persuasive speaking has three components: ethos, pathos, and logos. Ethos is the credibility and trustworthiness of the speaker, pathos is the appeal to emotion, and logos is the appeal to reason. While many argue that appealing to emotion is more effective than appealing to reason, you should strive to do both.)

#### Strategy #3: Discredit the Opposite Stance

Anderson says an effective persuasive technique is to display the opposite viewpoint and show your audience why it won’t work, why it’s an inferior choice, or why it’s dangerous or immoral. For example, proponents of electric vehicles could show how fossil fuel pollution is damaging animal and human habitats (dangerous and immoral), discuss the rising cost of gasoline (an inferior choice), or present statistics that show why gasoline isn’t a sustainable resource (won’t work).

(Shortform note: This is a strategy often used in political debates. If you present your opponent’s viewpoint upfront and show why it’s not good, you leave little room for argument. However, rather than using the “straw man” technique (a fallacy in which you create a weakened version of someone’s argument and destroy it), it’s more effective to build a “steel man”—create the _strongest_ version of your opponent’s argument that you can, and show why _it_ won’t work.)

#### Strategy #4: Guide the Audience to Their Conclusion

Anderson says**** one of the most entertaining ways to engage your audience is to present a big question at the beginning of your talk that sparks curiosity. Then, take your audience through all of the possible answers, eliminating them as you go and arriving at the conclusion. People love to feel like they’re solving a mystery. (This is one reason why true crime documentaries are so popular.)

(Shortform note: When the audience “solves the mystery” themselves, they also have ownership of the conclusion. You’re more likely to persuade someone if they believe they arrived at the decision on their own.)

#### Strategy #5: Leave Them Motivated

**Effective persuasive speeches leave the audience energized and motivated to make a change.** Even if the audience agrees with you by the end of the speech, if they aren’t left motivated, they’ll quickly forget the whole experience. If this happens, you can’t say that you have actually changed this person’s view of the world. Anderson says that **telling a personal and memorable story that humanizes the issue will move your audience and imprint your speech into their memory**.

(Shortform note: Experts say that persuasive speeches should end with “attitude not platitude,” meaning that the finale of your talk should be exciting and not a lecturing statement. One suggestion for how to do this is to give your speech a provocative title, and then use that title in your final sentence. It provides lyrical symmetry to the speech, closes the loop, and helps your audience remember and reference your performance.)

### Strategies for Imaginative Speeches

Unlike explanatory or persuasive speeches, the purpose of imaginative speeches is to delight or inspire. Anderson offers one strategy for artists, and another for inventors.

#### Strategy for Artists: “The Tour”

Most often used by artists, designers, architects, and photographers, “the tour” is a talk that walks the audience through a series of images. **Displayed** **one after another, each image inspires a bit more wonder than the last**. Anderson explains that in this speech, the purpose is to inform or inspire, and it’s meant to be an enjoyable experience. The subject can be serious, funny, or even provocative.

This type of talk has a simple structure (going from one image to the next), but to be effective, **each image needs to build on the one before it, or they need to have a throughline** that links them all together. He adds that if you’re showing something you created, show your process (including mistakes) to add interest. Although you can explain each image as it comes, you should also feel free to embrace silence as the audience takes in each image.

(Shortform note: Chicago artist and curator Sergio Gomez says that the best art talks follow a storyline—similar to how Anderson says a series of images should have a connecting throughline or build off one another. Gomez uses a formula when presenting his artwork: He begins with the story, then discusses his process, influences, and concerns. Next, he shows a series of works from the collection, and he finishes with a few final thoughts.)

#### Strategy for Inventors: “The Demo”

**If your presentation is about a new invention or process** , images and words won’t be enough—**a demonstration is ideal**. These talks are exciting because they give the audience a glimpse of the future. Anderson advises against beginning your presentation with detailed context and terminology. Instead, he says to tease and intrigue the audience: Give them only as much information as they need while you reveal more and more, building to a climax where you demonstrate the full technology. **End your talk with how this new technology or invention will impact the world** , and leave the audience feeling inspired and hopeful about the future.

(Shortform note: Steve Jobs was known for presenting Apple’s new products using live demos, and his demonstration of GarageBand is considered by some to be a masterpiece. Jobs employed several techniques to keep his audience engaged, beginning with the declaration that this invention is not just for pro musicians, but for everyone. If your product, invention, or process appears on the surface to be niche, make the wider value known from the beginning.)

### Unconventional Strategies

**If you want your speech to stand out, incorporate “out of the box” methods** **to elevate it and leave a memorable impression. However,** Anderson warns that if not done correctly, these strategies can come across as gimmicky.

Here are the **five unconventional strategies** that Anderson believes can be carefully employed:

**1) Use props:** Dramatic or unexpected props can _ignite an audience’s curiosity_ and _deepen their understanding_. If you use a prop, Anderson says to make sure it’s serving one of those two purposes—if it isn’t, then it’s a distraction.

(Shortform note: Consider the size of your audience when deciding whether to use a prop. If you’re speaking in front of a large group, will you be displayed on a large screen? If not, a prop might not be visible beyond the first few rows. If you’re speaking to a small group, a prop can be displayed or passed around.)

**2) Stimulate the senses:** During most speeches, the audience sees and hears you. Multisense stimulation is the act of involving the audience’s other senses—smell, taste, or touch. For certain subjects, this can work well. For example, if you’re discussing cooking, a taste for the audience will elevate the experience.

(Shortform note: Some people use scented oil diffusers to set a mood in the room. Scents like peppermint, citrus, and eucalyptus are said to awaken your audience, while lavender and sandalwood induce relaxation.)

**3) Interview the subject:** This format is half speech, half interview. The speaker is interviewed by another person, which gives the talk a more “in the moment,” conversational feel. The speaker has an idea of the topics ahead of time, however, and relevant images are queued up throughout to keep the talk visually interesting and on track.

(Shortform note: Oprah Winfrey is known for delivering powerful messages through the use of interviews. Her interviews are compelling to the audience because of the way she connects with her guests. She uses physical touch, eye contact, active listening, empathy, and energy matching—all of which enable her guests to vulnerably share stories and meaningful life lessons.)

**4) Hold a faux debate:** If you are delivering a talk with another person or within a group, present the information in a debate format. Both sides of the issue are presented one at a time, and each side presents a short closing argument at the end. You can even have the audience vote on a winner. Because the presentation is a group effort and not a true debate, you can lead the audience to the conclusion you want.

(Shortform note: _Debate_ and _discussion_ formats are similar in that two presenters go back and forth arguing their position on a topic. There is one striking difference, however: In a debate, the participants’ goal is to win. In a discussion, the goal is to understand. Both of these can work well as a presentation style, as long as it’s clear which one you’re using.)

**5) Feature a surprise guest:** If your talk is about a specific person, usher that person onto the stage near the end as a surprise for the audience. Anderson makes it clear that the purpose _shouldn’t_ be for them to simply say “hello” to the audience. Rather, it should be to perform in a way that amplifies the speech. For example, if your speech is about the process of writing a hit song, bringing an artist on stage to sing one of your #1 songs would be a valuable addition.

(Shortform note: If you choose to include a surprise guest, you risk pulling the focus away from you and your thesis. Once the guest comes out, the energy of the room will elevate and it will be difficult to regain your audience’s attention. Save your guest for the end of your speech after you’ve delivered all of the crucial information. Then have the last word in your speech by thanking the guest and the audience.)
