## Part 4: Writing and Rehearsing Your Speech

At this point, you should have an idea and throughline for your speech, and you know what _type_ of speech you’re giving. You’ve explored strategies to engage your audience based on that type of speech, and you might be considering an unconventional method. Now it’s time to decide whether or not you want to script your speech.

All speeches fall into one of four categories:

  1. Scripted and memorized
  2. Scripted and read
  3. Unscripted but planned out
  4. Unscripted and winged 



Anderson defines an unscripted speech as one where you’re not trying to remember a prewritten sentence word for word. However, he makes an important distinction between the words _unscripted_ and _unprepared_ : He says **there is no excuse for not preparing** , and that you should never “wing” a speech (especially an important one). It runs the risk of not being high quality—and even if it is, **your lack of preparation is disrespectful to the audience’s time and attention.**

(Shortform note: Former Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh encouraged public speakers to “wing it” in his book, _Delivering Happiness_. He used himself as an example: He said that his own perfectionism and nerves couldn’t handle making mistakes during speeches, and the stress leaked into his performance; winging it took away that pressure. However, most experts vehemently disagree with this advice.)

While Anderson doesn’t support winging it, he says the other three approaches can be used effectively or ineffectively. In this section, we’ll discuss **what makes each style work, the pitfalls you should avoid, and the best way to rehearse**. We’ll also cover Anderson’s advice for how to open and close your speech.

### Category 1: Scripted and Memorized

**Benefits:** You can ensure that there’s time for everything you want to say; you can choose your words carefully; and you can practice your speech on other people, which allows for feedback and improvement. (Shortform note: For people who suffer from intense fear of public speaking (glossophobia), scripting and memorizing is the favored option because it gives a feeling of control and preparation.)

**Risks:** Memorized speeches can come across as dry and unengaging. Even though your audience knows that your thoughts are scripted in one way or another, they like to feel as if they’re part of the moment as it unfolds naturally. Anderson explains that this is similar to how people prefer to watch sports live rather than recorded—they want to believe that they’re part of the action. (Shortform note: While inspiring your audience is the ideal result, those with the most severe forms of glossophobia might be trying to just make it through the speech without panicking or feeling humiliated. If this is you, getting through the speech is more important than avoiding the risks Anderson mentions here.)

**Rehearsal:** If you decide to memorize your speech, Anderson says you have to really commit. In the beginning of rehearsal, the speech will come out passionately but not super smooth. Once you reach the memorization point, the speech will come out smoothly—so smoothly in fact, that it will lack character. It will be flat and without passion. This is where most people stop practicing, which Anderson says is a mistake. If you push past this stage of memorization and _continue_ to practice, you’ll eventually get to a point where you know the speech so well that you’re no longer concentrating on the words and the passion will return to your voice.

Bottom line: Don’t stop practicing your speech once you’ve memorized it—keep going until you have fully embodied it. Anderson says you’ll know you’re ready when you can recite your entire speech while doing another cognitively demanding task (solving math problems, for example).

(Shortform note: Proponents of this method include Jill Bolte Taylor, Brené Brown, and Amanda Palmer. Bolte Taylor says she rehearsed her TED talk over 200 times, and Palmer says she practiced over a period of four months.)

### Category 2: Scripted and Read

**Benefits:** Anderson says there are two occasions when reading your speech works well: First, if the speech is paired with gorgeous imagery and your audience’s eyes are on your images instead of you. Second, if you’re a gifted writer and the audience understands that they’re hearing a piece of written work. (Shortform note: With the right tools (such as a teleprompter) and lots of practice, you can master reading without drawing attention to yourself. We discuss these tools in Part 5.)

**Risks:** There are three major risks if you choose to read your speech: First, your audience might not trust your authenticity. Second, they might perceive you to be unprepared. Third, your audience might become so bored that they tune you out or leave. (Shortform note: Despite these risks, reading a speech might be the better option if you don’t have time to memorize it, especially in situations where your authenticity isn’t going to be doubted—for example, eulogies at funerals are usually read, not memorized.)

**Rehearsal:** If you’re a writer reading a written work (such as a poem), Anderson recommends you still know your speech well enough that you can look up at your audience from time to time and so your voice will sound natural. He adds that with read speeches, it can be especially impactful if you stand up at the end and deliver your last paragraph without reading. (Shortform note: Amanda Gorman balanced reading and looking up at the audience—to great effect—while reading her poem, “The Hill We Climb,” at President Biden’s inauguration ceremony.)

### Category 3: Unscripted (But Planned Out)

**Benefits:** The speech is passionate, fresh, and in the moment. Anderson says the audience feels your authenticity and wants to go on the journey with you.

**Risks:** With this much flexibility in your wording, you risk using too much jargon, not fully explaining difficult concepts, rambling, and running out of time.

**How to prepare:** Even with an unscripted speech, rehearsing is crucial. While you aren’t planning out exact words to use, you do need a structure to keep you on track. Start by identifying the point you’re trying to make (your “big idea”), then decide how you’ll get there. (Shortform note: Those who don’t want to write a script might prefer a graphic organizer instead. A “mind map” is a visual representation of where you’re starting, where you want to go, and the stops you’ll need to make along the way. Draw it out like a literal map with your opening and closing statements, your big idea, and the concepts that lead to your idea.)

To keep your words spontaneous but still be fully prepared, Anderson recommends you do the following:

  * **Practice different ways to explain each concept**. This way, if your brain fails to remember one, you have others to fall back on.
  * **Prepare transition phrases between each point**. This will keep you from skipping a section and helps you move on to the next point if your mind goes blank.
  * **Practice using only 90% of the time you’ve been assigned** to prevent running over time (which is stressful for the organizers and the audience). Know what your halfway point is and keep an eye on the clock to make sure you’re on pace.
  * **Script your opening and closing lines** to give it a polished touch.
  * **Don’t rely on your slides** to jog your memory, and don’t put words on your slides that you plan to speak. Audiences hate this. 



> **Answer Key Questions**
> 
> Try writing out all of the key questions that your speech will answer and then verbally answering them in several different ways. Make sure the questions are open-ended.
> 
> For example, if you’re giving a congratulatory toast at a wedding, your questions might look something like this:
> 
>   * How do I know the groom? How do I know the bride?
> 
>   * What do I love about the two of them together?
> 
>   * Why do I know their marriage will be successful?
> 
>   * Who is the stubborn one? Who is sentimental?
> 
>   * What should they each remember about the other?
> 
> 

> 
> Practice answering these questions in several different ways. When you go to deliver your speech, there will be no surprise answers coming out of your mouth.

### The Opening

Anderson says **you only have about 60 seconds to keep your audience’s attention once you begin your speech**. Your opening sets the tone for the rest of the talk, so even if you choose not to script your speech, you should carefully consider how you plan to open. Here are three ways that he says you can grab your audience from the beginning:

**1) Say something dramatic:** Anderson says you can never go wrong with a powerful opening line—or at the very least, a powerful line within your first paragraph. Don’t think of your speech as having to be sequential. He recommends you take the heart of what you’re going to talk about and come up with one statement to use as a teaser to the audience.

(Shortform note: The opposite of saying something dramatic is to say something humorous—something that many TED speakers do to open their speeches. The most famous TED talk of all time is by Sir Ken Robinson, and he makes his audience laugh 10 seconds into his speech, “Do schools kill creativity?”)

**2) Show a fascinating image (or object):** Sometimes, the best way to get an audience’s attention is to show them something stunning, confusing (in an intriguing way), or hilarious. Once you delight the audience, you have their attention.

(Shortform example: About 30 seconds into her TED talk, “10 things you didn’t know about orgasm,” author Mary Roach shows an ultrasound image of a male baby masturbating in the womb.)

**3) Pique their curiosity:** Sparking curiosity is the easiest way to grab and hold a listener’s attention. Anderson says you can ask a question explicitly, or you can make a counterintuitive statement. If what you say challenges the audience’s prior knowledge, it will intrigue them even more.

(Shortform example: Apollo Robbins, said to be the greatest pickpocket in the world, opens his TED talk, “The art of misdirection,” with the question: “Do you think it’s possible to control someone’s attention?” Ironically, by asking this question, he instantly has his audience’s attention.)

(Shortform note: Besides getting your audience’s attention, a strong opening should reveal your speech’s purpose (the “what”), explain why the audience should care (the “so what”), establish your credibility, and preview the major points.)

### The Closing

Anderson warns that a spectacular talk can be ruined by a bad ending. **The way a talk ends is the way the audience will remember it**. Avoid boring endings, asking for money, or alluding that there was more you couldn’t get to.

Instead, Anderson offers these five strategies for ending your talk on a high note:

  1. **Apply what you’ve discussed to a broader situation.** For example, “If this management style can transform Fortune 500 companies, imagine what it could do in the White House.”
  2. **Declare a personal mission.** End your speech by making a proclamation about how _you_ are going to use this knowledge to improve the world.
  3. **Leave them with a dream.** Paint a picture of a better world. Inspire your audience with your dream for the future, but be sure to avoid clichés.
  4. **Call them to action.** Ask your audience to take the information you just gave them and do something with it. For example, “If we all contact our congressmen, they’ll have to listen.”
  5. **End with beautiful language.** A poetic statement, song lyric, or eloquent phrase can add a somber and memorable touch.



Anderson says whichever way you choose to end your talk, a short and simple “thank you” (followed by a pause for applause) before walking offstage is always successful.

> **Use the Power of Three**
> 
> To give your speech a rhythmic end, you can use any of the above strategies in combination with a pattern of three. Some of the most well-known examples of this are:
> 
>   * Julius Caesar: “Veni, vidi, vici” (I came, I saw, I conquered)
> 
>   * General Patton: “Blood, sweat, and tears”
> 
>   * Thomas Jefferson: “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”
> 
> 

> 
> Hearing information in threes is satisfying and feels like closure. Many speakers that have delivered TED Talks have employed the power of three in their final lines, including Brené Brown. In her talk, “The power of vulnerability,” she ends by saying that when we believe we’re enough, “then we stop screaming and start listening, we’re kinder and gentler to the people around us, and we’re kinder and gentler to ourselves.”
