## Part 5: Stage Setup

You have your idea and a script (or an unscripted plan) and have considered your strategies. Before committing to all of your methods, Anderson says to consider the stage setup and visual aids that are available.

If you have your speech memorized and feel confident speaking without notes, setup isn’t important—it’s just you and the stage. Anderson says this method is the gold standard because it allows for the greatest connection with the audience. However, he concedes that not everyone is able to do this, and most people feel more confident with a strategic setup in place.

In this section, we look at Anderson’s setup suggestions and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

### Note Cards

**Advantages:** Anderson believes that this is the most invisible way to reference notes. A small card held in your hand is less obtrusive than a lectern, and it’s less off-putting to the audience than your eye-line moving to a teleprompter.

**Disadvantages:** If you have multiple notecards, there is the risk of dropping them or getting them mixed up. For this, Anderson recommends you keep them in order on a keyring.

(Shortform note: How much information should you include on your note cards? One expert suggests using just five cards—one for the introduction, three for your main points, and one for the conclusion. On each card, he details how to set up a _keyword outline,_ which includes word prompts rather than full sentences. He also recommends writing on only one side of the cards; if you write on both, it’s easy to get confused about which side you should be looking at.)

### Large Lectern

**Advantages:** Having a large lectern might give you more confidence because it provides a large physical barrier between you and the audience. There is enough space for you to spread out your notes and have a glass of water.

**Disadvantages:** Large podiums, or lecterns, do two things that damage the connection between you and your audience. First, by separating you from the audience, a podium reduces your vulnerability—and vulnerability is the key to connection. Second, when your audience sees you behind a lectern as a professor or preacher might be, they feel you’re _preaching to_ rather than _speaking with_ them _._

(Shortform note: Oprah Winfrey is known for sitting within arm’s reach of her guests and having no physical objects (like tables) between them. She uses this method because she’s found that it allows her guest to readily connect with her.)

### Small Lectern

**Advantages:** If you need to have your full speech available to read, Anderson says the best option is a small, unnoticeable lectern. A podium with a thin or transparent stem with enough room for a few sheets of paper is all you need.

**Disadvantages:** Even with a small lectern, you have an object between you and the audience, which can affect the connection. If you choose this set-up, Anderson recommends you know your speech as well as possible so that you can connect with the audience through lots of eye contact.

(Shortform note: If you choose to use a music stand or small lectern, be sure to rehearse using the same stand. It’s not unusual for a speaker to rehearse using a sturdier piece of furniture, only to have a clumsy moment when they lean on a tinier one during the actual speech.)

### Comfort Backup

Anderson defines a comfort backup as **placing your notes and a bottle of water on a lectern to the side or back of the stage**. The idea is to deliver your speech without notes if possible, but to have them as a last resort.

**Advantages:** The notes are away from the audience’s view, so there’s no severed connection between you and the audience. You’ll feel less nervous knowing that you can use your notes if you freeze up, or take a sip of water if your mouth gets dry.

**Disadvantages:** Anderson says the only disadvantage to this method is if you have to return to your notes several times (whereas once is okay).

(Shortform note: If you’re nervous about needing water during inopportune times, strategically build “water breaks” into your speech. A great time to take a sip of water is during a pause. Often this will happen after you make a joke and the audience is laughing, or after you reveal an important statistic or revelation that you want your audience to consider seriously. During this time, plan to drink some water even if you don’t feel like you need it.)

### Smart Device

**Advantages:** You can have your entire speech or a few notes on a phone or tablet, easily accessible.

**Disadvantages:** Even if you’re using your phone as a tool, your audience is conditioned to think that you’re instead _distracted_ by it. One accidental tap can close your app, and an incoming call or text (even if silenced) can pop up on your screen and distract you. Though popular these days, **Anderson strongly advises against using a smart device as a tool**.

(Shortform note: Most experts agree with Anderson that using a smart device for notes isn’t a great idea. If you must use your phone, however, they say you should do two crucial things: Announce to your audience that you will be using your phone for notes, and put your phone in airplane mode.)

### Confidence Monitors and Teleprompters

##### _Confidence monitors_ are screens that come up from the floor or down from the ceiling and display your slides to use for reference. _Teleprompters_ display your written speech in scrolling format for you to follow.

##### **Advantages:** With a confidence monitor, you can see your slides with added notes (called “presenter view”) which will keep you from turning around and checking the slides that your audience is viewing. Teleprompters are advantageous in that you don’t have to find your place on a piece of paper.

**Disadvantages:** Anderson cautions against this set-up, as he finds that speakers tend to rely on them and don’t connect with the audience as a result. Even if you use the right vocal inflections, the audience can tell by your eye-line that you’re reading, and this is off-putting.

(Shortform note: If you’re being offered one of these tools for a one-time speech, it might not be worth trying to learn; however, if you’ll be speaking often and these tools are always available, they’re worth mastering. A common mistake is transfixing your eyes on the prompter, which leads to an unnaturally stoic facial expression and robotic vocals. One tip is to practice using the prompter while manipulating an object in your hands. By doing another action that pulls focus, you’ll learn to read without staring intently at the words.)

### Visual Aids

Anderson says that not all talks require slides—particularly if your story is already punctuated with humor or emotional storytelling. Some talks, however, are enhanced by the use of beautiful or informative images. Slide images are helpful if you are trying to explain something that is easier to show, or if your talk is about a visual topic (such as art, architecture, or photography).

In this section, Anderson hands the “mic” to TED Community Director, Tom Rielly. If you choose to use visuals in your presentation, Rielly advises you to keep the following dos and don’ts in mind.

| **Do** | **Don’t**  
---|---|---  
**Font Type** | Use a medium-weight sans-serif font like Helvetica or Arial.  Use bolded words to show emphasis.  | Use excessively thin fonts (hard to read) or fancy fonts (unprofessional).  Use italics or underlining—they are too subtle from the audience’s perspective.   
**Font Size** | Use 24-point or larger for ease of reading.  | Use more than three sizes in your entire presentation.   
**Font Color & Background** | Contrast light and dark (light font on dark background or vice versa).  | Use more than one color throughout your presentation, unless to show emphasis or surprise.   
**Photos** | Credit all photos in a subtle and consistent way (same font, size, color and positioning in all photos).  Use high-quality images at the highest resolution possible.  Expand your photo to fill the entire slide.  | Include more than one photo of yourself, unless it’s necessary for understanding.  Include photos of your team for the sole purpose of giving credit (instead, show them in action).  Display multiple photos on the same slide.   
**Videos** | Keep them under 30 seconds.  | Use a poorly produced video. No video is better than a video that distracts the audience.   
**Slide Transitions** | Use “cuts” to go to a new concept, and a quick “dissolve” when continuing with the same concept.  | Use any other types of transitions. They’ll be perceived as gimmicky and unprofessional.   
**Explanatory Slides** | Use words only when necessary. Show, don’t tell.  Present a series of slides to explain a complicated concept step by step.  | Use bullet points or include text that you’ll be saying out loud.  Include more than one concept per slide.   
  
> **More “Dos” of Visual Aids**
> 
> In addition to the “do’s and don’ts” that Rielly gives for visual aids, presentation coaches recommend the following:
> 
>   * **Make sure that everyone can see your visual aids.** One way to check this is to do a rehearsal of your slides while sitting in the furthest seat from your presentation. You might find that you need to increase the font size, increase the weight of the font, or change the font entirely.
> 
>   * **Design your visuals to match the tone of your speech.** If you’re giving an energetic speech, use brighter colors (as long as they aren’t harsh on the eyes or distracting). If you’re giving a more serious speech, black and white might work better. Consider font choices and images in the same manner.
> 
>   * **Use your visual aids to _add_ to your presentation, not replace it. **Don’t rely on your slides to do the presentation for you. If you do, your audience will feel as if their time is being wasted. The exception to this rule is when you’re doing a “show don’t tell” presentation, like displaying photographs or artwork.

#### Technical Tips

Anderson provides the following tips to help you navigate the technological aspect of creating a slideshow.

  * Four great programs to use: PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, and Prezi
  * Use the most updated version of your program.
  * After sending your slideshow to the program coordinator, bring an extra copy on USB.
  * Test your video and sound at the presentation site ahead of time (it helps to bring your own computer).
  * Don’t be afraid to hire a presentation designer—Behance.net is a great source.



(Shortform note: Whether you should use technology in your presentation depends on a few factors: how comfortable you are with the tech, the purpose of your speech, and the audience you’re addressing. For example, if you’re presenting to a group of people who work in technology, they’re likely to expect you to use new and innovative presentation tools. If you’re presenting to a nonprofit, on the other hand, a down to earth approach with less technology and more human connection is a better option.)
