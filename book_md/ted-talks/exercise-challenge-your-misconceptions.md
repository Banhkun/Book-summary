## Exercise: Challenge Your Misconceptions

Tackle your misconceptions about public speaking to release your fears.

What is one misconception that youâ€™ve held about public speaking? Why did (or do) you believe it?

How has this misconception affected your public speaking in the past?

Has your mindset changed regarding this misconception, or do you still believe it? Why or why not?

If you still believe this misconception, what can you do this week to challenge yourself to let it go?
