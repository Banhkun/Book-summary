## Chapters 3-7: Socialized Into White Supremacy

In the last chapter, we described how white supremacy is the dominant ideology of the United States, shaping every institution and every facet of American society. We also saw how white mythologies about individualism and objectivity blind white people to their _own_ racial identity and the ways in which they benefit both materially and psychologically from white supremacy.

In this chapter, we’ll explore in greater detail how **white people are socially conditioned from birth to accept and support white supremacy**. As we’ll see, white people, even those who profess to be free of bias, sustain and uphold white supremacy through:

  * A deluded belief in “colorblindness”;
  * “Race talk” that reinforces white solidarity and codes racial minorities (particularly African-Americans) as dangerous, without explicitly mentioning race;
  * Maintaining segregated neighborhoods, schools, and workspaces; and
  * Romanticizing the past, thereby ignoring the hardships of life for people of color during previous periods of American history.



### Racism Without Racists: The Delusion of Colorblindness

The successes of the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s were a watershed moment. Television images of black protestors, including women and children, being brutalized by southern sheriffs or beaten during sit-ins at segregated lunch counters offended and horrified many white Americans, particularly in the northern United States.

For them, **these scenes of outright barbarism perpetrated against African-Americans became the epitome of “racism.”** Moreover, landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 represented the first serious federal efforts to dismantle the system of legal segregation and disenfranchisement that defined American life since the end of the Civil War.

In the wake of these developments, **overt expressions of racism on the part of white people became a social taboo**. Whites did not wish to be associated with the violent scenes of anti-black racism they saw on the evening news; moreover, civil rights legislation made explicitly racist actions in political and economic life illegal. The vast majority of white Americans came to accept that blatant support for white supremacy (which had been open and commonplace among whites) was no longer socially acceptable.

But that did not mean that they engaged in the difficult work of examining how institutional racism still pervaded American life. Whites wanted to be seen as good people (because they now associated racism with acts of immorality and illegality) but did not wish to question their privileged status.

They thus seized on the idea of colorblindness, often by misappropriating Dr. Martin Luther King’s quote, “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”

#### Denying Race, Denying Racism

**Colorblindness enabled white Americans to delude themselves into believing that they could avoid problems of race by simply pretending that they didn’t exist**. White people often claim colorblindness through statements like:

  * “I don’t see race.”
  * “Race doesn’t matter to me, I judge everyone based on their merits as an individual.”
  * “I don’t care if someone’s black, white, green, or orange.”



But this is, of course, false. Race may not have a genuine _biological_ basis, but as we saw in the previous chapter, it is very much a _social_ reality, one that profoundly shapes people’s experiences, views, and expectations. It is simply impossible for a white person raised in a society organized on the basis of institutional racism to not “see” race.

And even if it were possible, colorblindness would not be a desirable goal, because the experiences of people of color _are_ inevitably defined by race. **To deny the existence of race or to minimize its importance is to deny the existence of racism itself—and thus give implicit assent to it.** By refusing to acknowledge a person of color’s racial identity and claiming that “you don’t see color,” you as a white person are denying the often-painful reality of their lived experiences, absurdly and offensively equating them with your own, and ignoring the existence of racism as a historical and structural phenomenon, as well as a daily one for people of color.

A person of color, for example, may have been made to feel unwelcome in the workplace or felt uncomfortable walking through a certain part of their city because of their race—for them, race is an inescapable, defining feature of life. Claiming to not see race is contributing to this person’s marginalization, while blinding yourself to your own racist socialization.

This professed belief in colorblindness is also a great trigger of white fragility. A white person who professes to not see race unsurprisingly becomes defensive and agitated when the realities of institutional racism—and their responsibility for it as a beneficiary of it—are explained to them. They may even double down on their commitment to colorblindness, claiming that by bringing the discussion back to race, _you_ are the one engaging in racism.

**The myth of colorblindness is actively harmful.** It lets white people off the hook for their complicity in sustaining the institutional and ideological underpinnings of white supremacy by narrowly defining racism and reducing it to a matter of individual choice.

### Race Talk

**Even as they disavow overt racism, white people act in myriad ways to bolster institutional racism.** This is reflected in the ways that white people speak to each other about racial topics—often without ever explicitly mentioning race at all. This phenomenon is known as “race talk.”

Many experiences of ordinary American life are thick with racial meaning, even when they appear on the surface to be race-neutral. For example, white people automatically associate blackness with crime, danger, and undesirability. In part, this stems from living in highly segregated communities, as most white Americans still do. If you seldom come into contact with people of color, then your perceptions of them will come from stereotypes and media-amplified misrepresentations.

White people will engage in race talk on the topic of black crime by expressing concern about the “character” of a neighborhood, the test scores at a local school, or declining property values. Race does not have to be mentioned at all. It is assumed by all white participants in such a conversation that these negative attributes are definitionally tied to blackness. Such conversations serve to reinforce solidarity between white people (a topic we’ll delve into later in the chapter) and solidify white attitudes about the rightful ordering of the racial hierarchy.

These attitudes, in turn, guide white _actions_. Thus, in a phenomenon known as “white flight,” white Americans will leave neighborhoods that are becoming more diverse (one study showed that even a tiny 7 percent African-American population in a neighborhood can trigger white flight), citing the desire to send their children to “good” schools. **Although it’s not spoken, the assumption is that a “good” school is one attended by few minorities.**

Of course, such actions lead to real-world consequences, like underfunded schools and segregation, that are enormously harmful to people of color.

This all speaks to a crucial point—**nearly all** **white people contribute to systemically racist _outcomes_ , even when they believe themselves to harbor no ill will toward people of color. **These outcomes matter far more than whatever _intentions_ white people may believe themselves to be motivated by.

#### Racist Jokes and White Solidarity

Even as white people continue in the belief that “race” is an attribute only held by people of color and not white people, **they still subtly reinforce white racial identity—and thus, white supremacy—to one another.**

In 2007, sociologists Leslie Picca and Joe Feagin studied the ways in which white people expressed ideas and attitudes about race to one another. They found that innate beliefs in white supremacy were strong, even among supposedly liberal and progressive white millennials. They found that **white millennials in college settings frequently told racist jokes, all while persisting in the belief that they were open-minded and tolerant on the subject of race.**

The white group dynamics during the telling of such jokes tended to be similar—protagonists telling the joke; bystanders or spectators approving it through their silence or non-objection; and, occasionally, a dissenter who objected to the joke.

But Picca and Feagin argued that even the dissenter played an important role in this performative exercise among white peers. When the dissenter voiced their opposition, their peers tended to shut them down, saying that it was just a joke and that the dissenter was being too uptight or humorless. All of this amounted to a performative ritual of white solidarity that strongly reinforced white supremacist beliefs and actions.

#### Romanticizing the Past

**Another way in which white people use coded language and double talk to reinforce white supremacy is through nostalgia and longing for the past.** White people will often invoke some ill-defined bygone era as one in which life was simpler or better.

Implicit in this kind of reminiscence is that things were better for _white_ people. To pine for a past historical era in an American context is to romanticize the days when people of color faced even _greater_ risks than they do today, including slavery, lynching, internment, and disenfranchisement.

It is not surprising that white people have the privilege of longing for the past. For most of American history, white people’s position atop the nation’s political, social, and economic hierarchy was entirely unchallenged. Viewed in this context, Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan of “Make America Great Again” explicitly plays to this sense of white identity and nostalgia for a bygone age—and, more ominously, white people’s bitterness and rage at the idea that today they must share some measure of power and influence with non-whites.

### White Spaces

**The implicit conditioning of white supremacist ideas also occurs through how white people define and order physical spaces.**

We’ve already explored how white people instinctively view African-American communities as dangerous and crime-ridden. This is despite the fact that studies of census data and crime statistics do not support this belief, certainly when controlling for other factors like poverty (although it does not stop police from detaining and imprisoning men of color at far higher levels than their white counterparts).

White Americans overwhelmingly inhabit nearly all-white spaces in their neighborhoods, schools, clubs, and workplaces. For a typical white person, this starts at a very young age. A white child goes to a school where the vast majority of teachers and students are white; they see their white parents socializing with a nearly all-white group of friends; they go off to attend a college where the professors are predominantly white; and, ultimately, land a job where their boss and the majority of their colleagues will be white. The message that this sends to white people who grow up in such a society is that whiteness is natural and normal. Indeed, it is impossible _not_ to receive this message.

It also fosters a belief that **there is no space where a white person can go where they will not feel welcome and included.** Contrast this with the experiences of many people of color, who frequently feel that there are spaces where their presence is decidedly abnormal and unwelcome.

For example, while white parents may fear sending their children to a majority-minority school, many black children in cities like Boston and Chicago _were_ bussed out of their neighborhoods into majority-white schools during the 1970s as part of court-ordered desegregation efforts. White children, however, were never bussed out of _their_ neighborhoods to attend predominantly black schools. The work of desegregation was always to be borne by people of color.

Black children at these majority-white schools experienced harassment and even violence at the hands of the white students and teachers. White parents, meanwhile, mounted furious (and, ultimately, successful) assaults against attempts to desegregate neighborhood schools.

All of this sends a powerful signal that there are boundaries that keep people of color out of certain spaces—but they are one-way boundaries, that only white people remain free to cross.

#### Segregation and White Racial Innocence

Because these desegregation efforts largely failed in the face of white resistance, most white people today live in segregated worlds where they seldom interact with people of color. Yet white people frequently invoke this fact of their upbringing as a way of _absolving_ themselves of any complicity in supporting a racist society. For them, it is a get-out-of-jail-free card. They _cannot_ be racist, they argue, because they grew up in a “sheltered” all-white community.

In this telling, the absence of racial diversity is meant to signify an absence of racism. Of course, the opposite is true—“sheltered,” all-white communities are, by their very existence, _products_ of institutional racism. Living in such a place would _amplify_ one’s racist conditioning by making one more likely to form ideas about black people from stereotypes and media misrepresentations rather than from genuine interactions. Even describing such an upbringing as “sheltered” is suffused with racial hostility, as it implies that one was “sheltered” from the dangerous presence of people of color.

But one does not merely passively _receive_ the advantages of whiteness by accident of birth.**Partaking in the benefits of whiteness itself bolsters white supremacy—and shatters the idea of white racial innocence.** Even if a white person, when confronted with this reality, is able to overcome their white fragility and acknowledge the extraordinary advantages of being white, this is only a first step.

The systems of oppression that _maintain_ those advantages (and, by definition, _deny_ them to people of color) have been consciously built over centuries. A true dismantling of systemic racism must go beyond mere acknowledgment of its existence. White people must not treat racism as merely a neutral force of nature that simply _happens_ to people of color, as if it were a weather event. It is something done _to_ people of color _by_ white people. **To profess one’s own racial innocence is to further one’s culpability for systemic racism.**
