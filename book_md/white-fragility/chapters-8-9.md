## Chapters 8-9: White Denial

Now that we’ve explored the roots of white supremacy and the ways in which white supremacist power structures profoundly shape how white people collectively view their position in society, we need to see how this plays out in the real world. Specifically, we need to understand the ways in which the powerful social conditioning we outlined in the last chapter feeds misconceptions about what racism actually is.

This is important, because these misconceptions inform how white people view people of color (specifically African-Americans) and how they are able to deny their own culpability in reinforcing racial inequity—a culpability that is rarely questioned because of instinctive white fragility. We also need to examine how these racial attitudes (and the denial of them) have very real and painful consequences for black people.

### Individual vs. Structural Racism

As we’ve seen, overt expressions of racial hostility on the part of white people have become taboo since the civil rights era. Whereas whites of previous generations would openly and proudly proclaim their belief in the justness of white supremacy, few would do so now. Most white people today openly profess to believe that racism (however they define it) is immoral.

**But this shift in what white people are willing to publicly _express_ has done nothing to dismantle the very real _power_ of white supremacy in American life. **In many ways, in fact, it’s _reinforced_ racism by making it less visible for white people and giving them plausible deniability for their responsibility in upholding it.

Of course, we know from the previous chapter that white people receive messages about white superiority as soon as they enter the world—from media misrepresentation of minorities, the segregated spaces most white people inhabit, and the absence of minorities from positions of power in key American institutions.

Racism is _not_ defined by specific behaviors committed by cruel and depraved individuals. It is a structural phenomenon, a framework that defines how we define our place (and that of others) in society.

#### White Deniability

**White people are able to deny the presence of racism precisely _because_ they treat it as specific behaviors committed by specific people**, rather than the structural phenomenon that it actually is. In this wrong conception of racism, racism functions like an act of criminality. The possibility of it always exists, but it has to be consciously and knowingly “committed” by someone.

Thus, if one refrains from certain actions (like the use of certain racial slurs) one cannot be racist. Racism thus gets watered down to something that only “bad” people do. This is at the root of white fragility—**white people will furiously deny their racially problematic behaviors and patterns of thought because they view any discussion of them as an assault on their character.**

This is fundamentally _not_ how racism works. Racism is a force woven deeply and permanently into every institution of American life. The intentions or moral positions of individual white people are irrelevant here. Racism is a system that we _all_ participate in, that we _cannot_ escape from, and that imposes _real_ costs on people of color (and real benefits for white people).

It is seen in:

  * The poverty rates for people of color (there is a large and persistent wealth and income gap between white and black Americans);
  * The quality of the education they receive (majority-black schools receive fewer funding resources and African-Americans are less likely to receive a higher education degree);
  * Health outcomes (African-Americans have shorter life expectancies than whites); and
  * The alarming frequency with which black people are harassed, incarcerated, and even killed by the criminal justice system (African-Americans are incarcerated at five times the rate of whites).



### White Excuses: Colorblindness and Color Celebration

Two common manifestations of white deniability (and white fragility) are claims of colorblindness and a professed color celebration, or appreciation of token diversity. They are intended to show that the white speaker is personally free from the social conditioning of white supremacy.

These, however, are merely retreats into the myth of individualism and a refusal to engage with one’s racial biases. Such biases are impossible to escape, as **no white person is able to throw off the social conditioning of being raised in a white supremacist society** —we are all products of our environment, whether or not we choose to accept it.

We’ve already exposed the hollowness of colorblindness, but it’s worth exploring in greater detail here. Examples of colorblind statements might be:

  * A straightforward claim that one doesn’t “see race” or that it doesn’t matter to them
  * A claim that one’s parents weren’t racist or taught them to “treat everyone equally.”



These claims blatantly misrepresent the true, insidious nature of racism. It is impossible not to see race, because race is the defining element of the American experience. Moreover, to deny its existence is to invalidate the experiences of people of color, whose lives have very much been shaped by their racial identity.

Similarly, **it is impossible to “treat everyone equally” because all individuals have different needs and different relationships to us**. Treating different individuals differently based upon circumstance is not the issue. We treat people differently for many reasons that are independent of race. This is a basic part of socialization. The problem arises when this differential treatment is directed at members of _groups as a whole_ and leads to disadvantageous and unjust outcomes.

#### Color Celebration

Meanwhile, a statement of color celebration might be the claim that one can’t be racist because they grew up or live in a diverse city like New York or that they have black friends. But this, too, is absurd. The mere ability to be in the presence of people of color (as one would inevitably be in a city like New York) without becoming overtly hostile or agitated defines racism so narrowly that it deprives it of any functional meaning. If _that’s_ the standard for racism, then racism would be a very rare phenomenon.

Similarly, **having individual friendships with people of color does not invalidate or cancel out the powerful social conditioning that comes with being raised in a white supremacist society**. This is especially true if white people refuse to discuss race with their friends of color—thereby denying their friends’ lived experiences.

All of these statements amount to excuses, a refusal to engage in reflection about one’s own participation in a white supremacist society. Instead of helping to spark a dialogue and move the needle forward on dismantling racism, these reflexive defenses forestall any discussion and analysis. In doing so, they help preserve and bolster white supremacy.

Racial learning is a process, and one needs to be willing to engage in tough self-reflection to make progress toward it. **Racism is a continuum or a spectrum**. A white person will never be entirely free of racist attitudes, but with honesty and a willingness to question one’s own racially problematic behavior, one can move toward the more just end of the continuum.

### Black People: The Quintessential Racial “Other”

But any analysis of racism should focus on the real victims of it—people of color and, specifically, African-Americans. While other non-white groups have undeniably faced persecution in the United States, **black people serve as the ultimate racial “other” for whites.**

Some of this is due to more modern manifestations of white supremacy, like media portrayals of black communities as crime-ridden dystopias. But it also comes from the ways in which white identity itself is inextricably tied to notions of black inferiority. As we saw in Chapter 1, **our ideas of black racial inferiority arose as a means to justify the systemic oppression of black people** during the era of colonization. Before this time, concepts of “black” and “white” would have had little meaning. White people from different parts of Europe during the ancient and medieval periods had no idea of whiteness as a shared characteristic between them.

It was only upon contact with and enslavement of Africans by the millions beginning in the 16th century that a concept of whiteness began to solidify. Of course, for one race to be _inferior_ , the other must, by definition, be _superior_. The powerful ideology of white supremacy thus _needs_ black people to sustain itself. **White identity thus has never existed without black inferiority.**

#### Projection

White people commonly project their own fears and insecurities about themselves onto black people as a means of assuaging their guilt and anxiety about the systems of oppression they maintain. They do this by accusing black people of vices of which _white_ people are, in fact, collectively guilty.

White notions of black laziness, for example, ignore the real history of slavery, in which black people toiled in brutal conditions on sugar and cotton plantations—all while their labor was stolen by white planters. Similarly, white ideas of black people as violent or dangerous overlook the experience of black life in America, which has been marked by brutal violence and oppression at the hands of white people.

#### White Saviors

Anti-black racism is a complex and ever-changing social force that can take on many different forms, at once flexible and durable. It can even masquerade as benevolence in the form of the “white savior” cultural trope, in which black people require the intervention of kind-hearted white people in order to be rescued from circumstances of poverty or oppression.

Such portrayals, common in Hollywood films like _Green Book_ or _The Blind Side_ deny the agency of black people and portray their fates as being inextricably linked to the benevolence and goodwill of white people. Often, these films show a prejudiced white character overcoming their prejudice thanks to an unlikely friendship with a black person who teaches them the error of their ways.

These portrayals, however well-meaning they may be, also inhibit progress on race. They cast racism as an individual vice (ignoring its real, structural nature) and put the onus for overcoming it on _black people themselves_ , who must teach their oppressors why their racist attitudes are wrong. This absolves white people for their culpability in maintaining racism and allows them to shirk responsibility for doing the hard work of challenging it.

#### Fear of Black Advancement

**Another great source of white fragility is the fear of black advancement or upward mobility.** This underlies the centuries-old white contempt for “uppity” black people who dare to step out of line or question the justness of the racial hierarchy.

Any attempts to dismantle or even simply modify white supremacy are lambasted by white people as measures that confer an “unfair” or “undeserved” advantage for black people. Affirmative action in particular is a flashpoint of deep resentment for white people, who believe that it forces companies to hire unqualified black candidates over qualified white applicants.

This is all completely untrue. Affirmative action was implemented in the 1960s to combat the very real and demonstrable job discrimination that African-Americans faced. It only guaranteed that _qualified_ minority job-seekers have access to the same opportunities as other applicants, and it only ever applied to jobs in the public sector. Ironically, white women ended up being its biggest beneficiaries, not people of color.

Nevertheless, white myths and paranoia about the program were the decisive factors in its dismantlement in subsequent decades. Today, it is all but nonexistent. Beyond affirmative action, white people continue to express dismay at black advancement when they:

  * Delegitimize protests like the Black Lives Matter movement to end police brutality against black people by responding with claims that “All Lives Matter” (ignoring that _black_ lives in particular are at unique risk from systemic racism); and
  * Express contempt for NFL players like Colin Kaepernick who kneel during the singing of the national anthem to protest police violence against minorities.



These attempts by people of color to highlight the racial inequities in American life put white culpability front and center. As we’ve seen, because of their limited conception of racism as a personal character trait, white people collectively take these efforts as a deep affront. The white fragility on display in response to these efforts points to a collective unwillingness on the part of white people to seriously engage with the presence and consequences of white supremacy.
