## Chapters 1-2: The Power of Whiteness

To explore the phenomenon of white fragility and how it stands in the way of efforts to dismantle racist power structures, we first need to understand whiteness itself and the implicit assumptions and beliefs that support it.

In this chapter, we’ll explore:

  * How myths of individualism and objectivity make it impossible for white people to recognize how their views and actions are shaped by the white society in which they were raised;
  * The origins of whiteness and how white racial identity came to be associated with structural dominance in all facets of American society;
  * The difference between prejudice and racism, and why it is structurally impossible for people of color to be racist; and
  * The ways in which white supremacy defines who makes decisions and who wields power in the nation’s political, economic, social, and cultural institutions—with white people largely unwilling to even acknowledge the existence of these power dynamics.



### The Myth of Individualism

The belief in individualism is a central part of American ideology.**** It is the belief that individuals have full agency to shape the outcomes in their lives. According to individualism, no one faces any barriers on the way to achievement that are not of their own making. Factors such as where you were born, who your parents were, or the color of your skin are simply irrelevant.

**Individualism is a comforting and validating belief—for white people, who sit atop the nation’s economic and political power structures.** It tells them that their success and advantages in life are entirely the result of their own hard work, intelligence, and initiative. Individualism, therefore, supports the belief that society is fair and organized as a meritocracy.

But individualism sends a very different message to people of color. If powerful and successful people are powerful and successful because of their own merits as individuals, then it can only follow that _powerless_ and _unsuccessful_ people are in that condition because they are somehow “lesser” individuals.

**But this belief in pure meritocracy is a myth. White people are overrepresented in positions of power largely due to their status as beneficiaries of institutional racism.** This system provides them with wealth, educational opportunities, access, and social capital that people of color simply do not have. Even seemingly race-neutral job qualifications like an advanced degree are a marker of white privilege because of the inherent resources required to even _obtain_ such a degree—resources that black people are far less likely to have.

By its very nature, a belief in individualism renders one incapable of acknowledging the structural power disparities within society that lead to inequitable outcomes for different groups. In this way, **individualism supports and bolsters the existing racial hierarchy.**

#### Invisible Whiteness

**Individualism, by downplaying the realities of group identity and group experience, also enables white people to deny _their_ group identity as white people**—including the advantages they derive from that identity and the ways in which it defines their attitudes and actions. This is what enables white people to treat racism as a series of isolated and discrete acts that can only be committed by an individual, instead of perpetuated by a society.

People of color, of course, are never afforded the comforting luxury of individualism. Their identity is _always_ seen (be it by educators, lawmakers, employers, or the criminal justice system) as being shaped by their membership in a group.

#### No One Is Objective

White beliefs in objectivity are closely related to the myth of individualism. Because white people believe that they are unique individuals unshaped by history or society, they also come to believe that their views of the world are entirely objective.

This follows naturally from individualism. **If you don’t believe you’re conditioned by society or any other external forces, you can’t accept the reality of your own biases.**

But the belief in objectivity is also a myth. White people, like _all_ people, are molded by the beliefs and ideologies of the society in which they live. And white people in the United States live in a society that explicitly places people who look like them at the seats of power.

**Being asked to confront one’s actions and beliefs as racist can be deeply upsetting to white people, because it punctures their myth of objectivity.** It suggests that one does _not_ have complete autonomy over how one thinks and acts—but, rather, that one ventures out into the world profoundly shaped by forces beyond one’s control.

White beliefs about individualism and objectivity are central to white racial identity itself. They enable white people to see “race” as an attribute that only non-white “others” possess. White people unconsciously perceive whiteness as “normal” or “standard,” or simply lacking in race at all. In this conception of race, being white is synonymous with being American.

### Race Is Socially Constructed

**When we talk about race, however, we must be careful to define it as a social construct,_not_ a biological reality**. While there are certain physical differences between groups of people such as skin color, hair texture, or eye shape, these are superficial differences that owe their existence to where one’s ancestors lived hundreds of thousands of years ago. But these minor physical differences _in and of themselves_ have no bearing on traits that matter to individual success, such as intelligence.

**Modern notions of race really started during the age of European colonization of the Americas, which began in the 16th century.** Europeans (mainly through a combination of deliberate extermination and disease) killed millions of indigenous peoples in North and South America, dismantled their existing political and economic systems, and founded colonies whose main purpose was to extract raw materials for export on the world market.

After the indigenous populations died out, Europeans began to kidnap black Africans and transport them across the Atlantic Ocean to perform slave labor in the New World. Ideas of race arose from _these_ historical traditions. Notions of racial superiority (for white people) and inferiority (for non-white peoples, chiefly those of African descent) emerged to _justify_ the brutal system of exploitation. If black people were morally and intellectually inferior, then it was not immoral to enslave and kill them.

#### Defining Whiteness

After the founding of the United States, these ideas became further encoded into the nation’s legal system, with an entire set of laws emerging to protect the institution of slavery. Even after the abolition of slavery, whiteness became an essential qualification for full participation in American life.

When new immigrants came to America in the 19th and 20th centuries, the judicial system rendered judgments on which groups could and couldn’t be classified as white. By conferring specific advantages and benefits upon whiteness, **American society transformed race into more than an _identity_ —it became an _interest_ , one that white people would jealously guard and protect.**

Eventually, immigrant groups that once faced discrimination—like Irish- or Italian-Americans—were able to assimilate into white society by becoming more generically “American” and shedding their unique cultural or national identities. Implicit in this ability to assimilate, of course, was the idea that _whiteness_ was the key component of American identity. Other forms of identity such as language or religion could be integrated. But this path was never open to black people, regardless of how long their ancestors may have been in the country, because, unlike the Irish and Italians, they couldn’t “pass” as white. Race was an immutable characteristic.

It is important to remember that the social construction of race _preceded_ racism—indeed, it was essential to it. **Our notions of race are inextricably linked to centuries worth of ideas and practices about who should and should not wield power in society.**

### Prejudice vs. Racism

Understanding this link between race and power is crucial to understanding the true nature of racism. To illustrate this, it’s useful to explore the differences between prejudice and racism. Prejudice is when you have an opinion about a large group of people based on some shared characteristic and then use that generalization to evaluate individual members of that group. And because none of us are objective and are all products of the larger forces that shape our society, we _all_ have prejudicial beliefs and ideas of one kind or another.

For example, you might harbor the (incorrect) belief that people of East Asian descent have a natural aptitude for mathematics. You then assume that individuals of East Asian descent whom you meet must be math whizzes, based solely on their membership in that group.

**Discrimination is when you _act_ on prejudiced beliefs.** It can range from exclusion to verbal abuse to outright violence. If you believe that black men are somehow hardwired to commit violent crime, you might refuse to hire them or instinctively cross the street when you encounter them.

#### Power and Control of Institutions

But racism is a very different phenomenon, despite superficial similarities to simple prejudice.

**Racism is defined by power and control of key institutions within a society.** Thus (in the context of American history), slavery, Jim Crow, and discriminatory housing policies are just some of the functions of racism. They were products of white control over the political, legal, and economic apparatus of the country.

People of color can be _prejudiced_ toward white people and can even _discriminate_ against _individual_ white people; but because, as a group, they have historically been (and remain) locked out of dominant positions within the nation’s power structure, by definition they cannot be _racist_. In other words,**a group needs power within a society to even be _capable_ of racism. **Thus, “reverse racism,” the alleged oppression of whites at the hands of black people, is a contradiction of terms. Racism cannot be “reverse"—it can only go in one direction.

A black real estate agent might act on her prejudice and discriminate against an _individual_ white person by refusing to help them buy a home; but black people have no ability to pass laws mandating which neighborhoods white people _as a group_ are and aren’t allowed to live in.

### The Pervasiveness of White Supremacy

**Because white people have always been dominant in society, they have not had to confront the consequences or even the _existence_ of their enormous privileges. **This is largely because white supremacy encodes whiteness as the normal or standard condition for society. This pervades everything from language to how we view our nation’s history.

The “Americanness” of people of color, for example, is always qualified as “African-American,” “Asian-American,” or “Latin American.” Rarely are white people called “White-American” or “Caucasian-American.” Whiteness is assumed to be standard, normal, and synonymous with American identity itself.

Similarly, February is designated as Black History Month. Implicit in this labeling is the idea that “black” history stands somehow apart from American history in general. There does not need to be a corresponding White History Month, because the culture automatically _assumes_ that such a designation would be redundant—in a white-dominated society, white history is simply the same as “history.”

This placement of white people atop the nation’s hierarchy and the enshrinement of whiteness as the embodiment of national identity is what scholars of race mean by white supremacy. Many white people recoil at the term and refuse to consider the idea that they bear responsibility for it because they associate it with extremist groups like the KKK or neo-Nazis.

But even a cursory look at America’s most powerful institutions shows just how embedded white supremacy is.

  * The ten richest Americans are 100 percent white
  * Congress is 90 percent white
  * Directors of the 100 top-grossing films of all time are 95 percent white



Although this is just a snapshot, it demonstrates how whiteness pervades and dominates American economic, political, and cultural life. Seeing the overwhelming whiteness of America’s elite (not to mention the dominance of white figures like Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Lincoln, and FDR discussed in history books) sends a powerful signal to children, even at an early age.

**White children grow up with a profound sense of _belonging_ , regardless of where they go or what other personal attributes they might have**. There is no physical or social space in which they are ever made to feel that their presence would be unnatural or unwelcome. Children of color (especially African-Americans), by contrast, grow up feeling constantly apart from or “othered” by society, no matter how far up the social or economic scale they might personally ascend as individuals.
