## Part 2: Diagnosis | Chapter 2: Assess the Organization

In Part 1, we learned about adaptive leadership and adaptive challenges. There are two steps to solving such challenges, and in this chapter, we’ll look at the first step: diagnosis. Diagnosis involves:

  * Assessing the adaptive capacity of your organization and the people within it 
  * Assessing your own adaptive leadership abilities
  * Assessing the specific adaptive challenges you and your organization are facing 



These assessments will help you understand both the scope of the problem and the resources you have available (or can acquire) to address it when it’s time for treatment.

### Assess Your Organization’s Adaptive Capacity

There are five characteristics to consider when it comes to assessing an organization’s adaptive capacity (how capable it currently is of addressing adaptive challenges):

#### Characteristic #1: Sector Membership

Your organization’s adaptability is informed by the distinctive characteristics of the sector it belongs to. Be aware of the limitations that come with each sector, all of which can impact an organization’s ability to change:

  * **Not-for-profit organizations** are usually driven by their mission and usually believe in consensus, with everyone having the power to veto decisions.
  * **Private sector organizations** are usually driven by profit, usually deal with competition, and like to stick with what worked in the past. Sticking to the past doesn’t help them adapt.
  * **Public sector organizations** usually value security and aren’t especially affected by competition, meaning they don’t feel pressure to adapt.



#### Characteristic #2: Formal Structure

Another characteristic that affects your organization’s adaptability is its **formal structure—the rules and hierarchies that govern an organization** such as organizational charts, employment contracts, compensation plans, and so on. These structures encourage certain activities and discourage others, both implicitly and explicitly.

  * (Shortform example: If a company gives awards to individuals for individual performance, then everyone will be most concerned about themselves. If a company gives awards to teams for their best experiment or biggest mistake, then people will be motivated to work together and take risks.)



If your organization’s structure encourages activities that support adaptive leadership, your organization likely has higher adaptive capabilities.

#### Characteristic #3: Culture

The third characteristic that informs adaptability is**culture—the collection of stories, unwritten rules, and conventions that govern people’s behavior.** Culture is made up of four elements and all of them affect an organization’s capacity to adapt:

##### Element #1: Mythos

**Mythos is the collection of jokes and stories that reinforce an organization’s important ideas and help people understand their surroundings.** Most companies’ mythos includes stories that cover:

  * The reasons people, especially executives, are fired
  * Public disagreements with an authority figure
  * The most memorable events of office parties
  * The most memorable events of off-sites
  * How the longest-standing employees have managed to stay so long
  * Who started the organization and why, and whether or not they’re still involved
  * Who the most powerful person on the board is
  * Who executives listen to
  * Huge organizational failures
  * Huge organizational successes



Because mythos is so often repeated and focuses on important images and symbols, it contains valuable information about the company’s culture—including how flexible, and thus adaptable, the company is. However, it is also often incomplete because people aren’t always forthcoming when reciting folklore. For example, a myth might describe what’s allowed but skip what’s not allowed, or vice versa.

**_Reflection Questions and Exercises_**

  * Think of one person at your organization who was fired, one who resigned, and one who was promoted. Was the company’s official story about these events the same as the story people told? If not, what does this say about what behaviors are appropriate (or not)? What does this tell you about adaptability?
  * Ask everyone on your team to write a story about something they think shows the organization’s values. Share the stories.
  * Ask everyone on the team to tell a story on camera about one of the company’s recent successes. Then, ask everyone to watch all the stories and talk about what the most common themes were, what they say about the company culture, and what they say about adaptability.



##### Element #2: Practices

**Practices are repeatable rituals** , such as holidays or retirement parties. It’s important to understand company practices because you can associate them with adaptive challenges, which encourages people to pursue these challenges.

  * For example, if your team is used to going out for lunch to celebrate successes, say you’ll celebrate adaptive milestones by going out for lunch—this will motivate everyone to work towards solving the adaptive challenge.



**_Reflection Questions and Exercises_**

  * Make a list of your company's practices. What are they for? What does this say about adaptability?
  * Think of a behavior that would improve your organization’s adaptability. What practice could you put into place that would inspire the behavior?



##### Element #3: Norms

**Norms are how people interact with each other within an organization.** They often include:

  * Which jokes are appropriate
  * Who sits with each other at lunch
  * Which gifts are appropriate (if any)
  * Which forms of address are appropriate, and who gets to use whose first names, nicknames, and so on
  * How much socialization is appropriate and where it takes place
  * Who leaves their door open
  * Dress code



To assess how norms contribute to your organization’s adaptability, consider if the norms maintain the status quo or allow for learning and adaptation.

  * For example, if people socialize widely and don’t form cliques, they may be more open to learning from each other.



**_Reflection Questions and Exercises_**

  * What are the norms of your organization, and how do they affect its ability to adapt?
  * What actions are inappropriate at your organization? (For example, taking long lunches may be discouraged.) What does this tell you about adaptability?
  * Think back to your first day. What norms did you find notable at the time? Do you behave according to these norms now? If yes, how long did it take you to change? What does this tell you about adaptability?
  * Come up with a norm that would increase the adaptive capabilities of your company. Recruit a few colleagues to enact the norm and see if it catches on.



##### Element #4: Meeting Covenants

**Meeting covenants are the guidelines around meetings** —who decides the agenda, who is invited, and how often meetings are held. These covenants shed light on the distribution of power and of information, both of which influence adaptability.

To assess meeting covenants and what they say about adaptability, consider the following questions:

  * Do meetings focus on disseminating information or making decisions? Are participants encouraged to participate and be creative or just to receive orders?
  * In decision-making meetings, who makes the decision? For example, does one person decide, do participants vote and a majority is needed, or does it take consensus? Are all decisions made by the same person or group, or does the method change depending on the decision?
  * Are attendees allowed to comment on other people’s areas of expertise? If yes, are they taken seriously, and does their input lead to change?
  * Do attendees share what they learned in the meeting with their subordinates? If yes, how do they disseminate the information?
  * What does the most senior attendee do during the meeting? Does she make the decisions, does she facilitate, or does she do something else entirely? How does she handle conflict?



**_Reflection Questions and Exercises_**

  * Every time you host a meeting, start it with a new activity, such as a minute of meditation. Tell everyone that it’s an experiment and after a month, ask everyone’s opinion. Practicing change in small doses will help people become more comfortable with it, which will help them learn to adapt.



#### Characteristic #4: Habits

The fourth characteristic to consider when assessing your organization’s adaptability is **habits—the default perspectives or actions** that people take because they’re comfortable to carry out and have been effective in the past. The more people repeat a habit, the more entrenched it gets.

Habits can be helpful when times aren’t changing—people can quickly apply known solutions to known problems.

  * (Shortform example: If you work in customer service and the habitual response to a customer complaint is to give the customer a refund, anytime a customer complains, everyone knows how to solve the problem without needing to ask for help or take the time to develop a solution.)



However, habits can limit adaptability because:

  * People never even consider other options because the existing ones are so entrenched.
  * People don’t consider unique circumstances—they think if a habit worked in one situation, it’ll work in a similar one.
  * People become predictable and this leaves them vulnerable to their competitors or enemies.



For example, when there was a war between militant group Hezbollah and Israel, the U.S. Jewish community reacted out of habit—they raised money to help Israel recover. Had they instead considered other actions and adapted, they might have been able to do something even more helpful. For instance, one person suggested sending some of the funds to southern Lebanon, which had also suffered damage due to war and was receiving funding from Hezbollah. If Lebanon had found another source of funding, it may not have supported the militant group so much, which would have weakened it.

**_Reflection Questions and Exercises_**

  * What’s one of your organization’s habits? Where did it come from? When does this habit work, and when doesn’t it? When it doesn’t work, what’s different about the circumstances? What does this suggest about adaptability?



#### Characteristic #5: Politics

The final characteristic to examine when considering your organization’s adaptive capacity is**politics—how people relate to each other, both formally and informally, and who has power.** To successfully lead adaptive change, you need to diagnose the political landscape of the organization to predict people’s responses to the change—who will help you and who will resist? Resisters may oppose you because they will personally suffer loss from changing, or because they represent others who will suffer.

The following all contribute to an individual’s political alignment and willingness to participate in adaptive change:

**Contributing Factor #1: Ideal outcome.** When it comes to addressing the adaptive challenge, what is the best resolution for her?

**Contributing Factor #2: Investment.** To what degree does she care about the adaptive challenge and the company?

**Contributing Factor #3: Stakes.** What does she stand to lose? Your proposed solution to the challenge and the changes that this will create might threaten her values or just her desire for predictability. If you can figure out exactly what she’s afraid of losing (fear of change is really fear of loss), you can mitigate her resistance by helping her keep what she needs. To determine people’s stakes:

  * Assume that everyone could lose something if the organization changes.
  * Make a list of what each stakeholder might fear to lose, even if it doesn’t seem endangered by a particular proposed change. Consider threats to sense of self, salary, status, work-life balance, and so on.



**Contributing Factor #4: Values.** What is most important to the stakeholder? Often, opposing your change is a way of serving her values, but if you can understand her priorities, you can find ways to frame your proposed changes in a way that means accepting them will allow her to serve her values in another way.

  * For example, Jerry, a lawyer, wanted his firm to take on more pro bono work because he wanted to help the community. However, the other lawyers were more concerned about profit and their ranking compared to other law firms. Pro bono work was a factor in the rankings, so Jerry emphasized this when suggesting the firm do more pro bono work. Opposing pro bono work would have met the other lawyers’ value of profit, but supporting it met the goal of outcompeting, and this convinced them.



**Contributing Factor #5: Loyalties.** What people or parties depend on the stakeholder?

Everyone is loyal to three groups of people:

  1. **Coworkers,** who include peers, supervisor, and reports.
  2. **Community,** which includes friends, family, and members of groups the stakeholder belongs to, such as a congregation.
  3. **“Ancestors,”** who include people who have influenced the stakeholder, such as mentors, teachers, older family members, and those who share national, religious, or gender identity with the stakeholder.



Loyalties drive behavior (or inaction in the face of an adaptive challenge) because:

**They often conflict.** It’s impossible to make everyone happy, and fear of disappointing someone might make someone choose inaction.

  * (Shortform example: If someone is loyal to both her boss (who wants her to come down harder on her reports) and to her reports (who want her to defend them from the boss), she’ll inevitably disappoint one of the groups by doing what the other wants. She may choose to do nothing instead.)



**It’s hard to acknowledge unflattering loyalties.** Usually, the loyalties that are contributing to an adaptive problem are the ones people keep secret because they often stem from insecurity or the need for something they’re not proud of. People often don’t want to admit to these loyalties, and without acknowledging them, it’s difficult to address them.

  * For example, if your organization has an unfair compensation system and you’re paid unfairly well, you might be afraid to speak up about it because you don’t want people to be upset with you.



**Changing can result in ostracization.** If a stakeholder changes too much, they might not be welcomed back to the group they’re loyal to.

  * For example, when Alexander was working with the Black and Jewish communities in Brooklyn, representatives of each group met to discuss ending the conflict between them. However, when the representatives returned to their communities, their “constituents” felt the representatives had been changed by the other side, and they had to abandon all their progress to fit back in.



(We’ll look more at your own loyalties in the next chapter.)

**Contributing Factor #6: Allegiances.** What does the stakeholder have in common with other stakeholders, especially informally? These commonalities might encourage stakeholders to band together, strengthening their position (support or resistance) on your adaptive leadership.

  * To identify formal alliances, study your company’s organizational chart—people will have allegiances with other people in their divisions or departments. 
  * To identify informal allegiances, consider who might share interests and values. There are often informal alliances between people who fall into the following groups: freelancers, managers, staff, new hires, veterans, and people who share identities, such as gender.



**Contributing Factor #7: Power.** Who does she influence and what resources does she allocate?

##### Determine Political Alignment

There are two ways to assess someone’s political alignment (and thus, their receptiveness to your proposed solution to an adaptive challenge):

**1\. Flat-out ask her.** However, keep in mind that if you’re above a stakeholder in the organizational chart, she might not be honest or tell you everything. Try to read between the lines and hold conversations in safe environments, such as around the watercooler or at a teambuilding activity.

**2\. Talk to a third party.** Speak with someone both you and the stakeholder know to get another opinion on their alignment. Keep in mind that third parties may not tell you everything either, and they have biases and filters too.

Additionally, when assessing alignment, see people as complex, three-dimensional beings, not flat characters who selfishly get in your way. The goal of this perspective isn’t to be nice, but to be tactical. The better you understand someone, the more easily you can frame your initiative in a way that will appeal to her. For example, you can explain how supporting your initiative does more to further her values than resistance will.

### Reflection Questions and Exercises

  * What kind of behaviors do your organization’s formal structures encourage and discourage? Are you encouraging the right kind of behavior to reach your strategic goals?
  * Look at your organization’s organizational chart. What roles are the most and least important? Who works with whom, who is in what groups, who’s isolated, and who gets to make decisions? 
  * Consider the board of directors and executives. How many of them are there, how do they get their position, and how much are they paid? What do these things imply about the organization’s decision-making and values?
  * Gather your team and consider the organization’s mission. Make a list of all the formal structures that help achieve the mission. Then, make a list of all the ones that don’t.
  * What stops you from taking risks within your company? How are these deterrents related to politics?
  * Consider an adaptive challenge your organization is facing. Use this chart to brainstorm stakeholders’ position on the challenge (add as many rows as necessary): 

Stakeholder  | Investment in the problem  | Ideal outcome  | Most important values  | Loyalties  | Stakes   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
|  |  |  |  |   
  
  * How could you help the stakeholders mitigate the losses associated with a proposed change you’ve made to solve an adaptive challenge?
