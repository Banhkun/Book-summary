## Chapter 10: Maintain Emotional Commitment

In the last chapter, we looked at how to maintain purpose to keep tackling adaptive problems. Now, we’ll look at how to use inspiration to maintain emotional commitment to change. **Because** **adaptive challenges involve emotions, not just intellectual leaps, you need to be able to inspire people.**

You especially need to be inspiring when people have lost purpose, hope is in short supply, or there are high levels of conflict. **Inspiration will help people see that even though things are rough right now, a better future is possible via adaptive change,** and not everything needs to be lost to achieve that change.

### Two Techniques to Inspire Others

Everyone inherently has the ability to inspire, though everyone will do it differently depending on their purposes, communication style, and the adaptive challenge at hand.

To inspire, use the following two techniques:

#### Technique #1: Visibly and Audibly Express Your Emotions

**You feel strongly enough about your purpose to risk the dangers of adaptive leadership, so show people how much you care about changing things for the better.** This will help people see why their suffering and loss are worth pushing through. (Additionally, if you don’t share your emotions, people will be disinclined to share theirs with you, and them sharing is critical to technique #2.)

Expressing emotion in professional situations can be thorny—leaders are expected to be cool in the face of danger, and if you appear too emotional, people might think you’re unsuited for the job because you let your feelings cloud your judgment. (Women are particularly vulnerable to this accusation.)

Here are some tips for appropriately demonstrating emotion:

**1\. Prepare.** Before you go into a situation in which you want to display emotion, mentally rehearse what you’re going to say, remind yourself of your purpose, and clear your mind.

**2\. Don’t hold back as much as you usually would.** When you start to feel emotion, don’t suppress it, let it show.

**3\. Keep functioning through the emotion.**(For example, if your voice starts to break from emotion, keep talking.) Don’t suppress the emotion or run—finish your speech while also displaying the emotion. This leads by example—it shows everyone who’s listening that it’s fine to feel emotion and it’s possible to get things done even while in its throes.

  * For example, after 9/11, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani spoke openly about his emotions, which helped him connect with people, but he wasn’t so overwhelmed that he was incapacitated.



**4\. Use your voice and speech patterns effectively.** When you’re delivering an emotionally difficult message, pause more often than usual to give people time to process it. When people are in conflict, speak with a calming tone to lower the intensity, and when people are unmoved, speak more loudly and expressively to raise it.

Your default tone of voice is usually determined by your culture and environment. For example, in some cultures, people in leadership positions speak dispassionately and use more statements than questions. However, **you don’t need to use cultural and environmental defaults—use whatever tone of voice will be most effective in your circumstances.** If you’re an authority figure tackling an adaptive challenge, most of the time you’ll want to be confident in your tone (which reassures people that what you’re saying is possible) but tentative in your content (ask questions, acknowledge that the challenge will create uncertainty, and so on).

If you’re not an authority figure and you’re tackling an adaptive challenge, assume people will listen to you. This will prevent you from coming off as overanxious or strident and will instead make you sound confident (which _will_ encourage people to listen to you).

**5\. Only address one or two emotionally loaded points at once.** If you try to make many points all at once, people won’t be able to absorb them.

**6\. Be aware of connotations (meaning associated with particular words beyond their dictionary definition).** If you use a word that triggers your audience’s sensitivities, you can unwittingly create a lot of resistance or support for an opposing point. You’ll probably have to use trial and error to figure out which words carry connotation. (If you do unintentionally use something triggering, at least you’ll have some new insight into hidden conflicts.)

  * (Shortform example: Though the word “holocaust” technically means mass destruction, it’s so strongly associated with the mass murder of Jewish people in World War II that using it to describe anything else could come across as insensitive.)



#### Technique #2: Empathize With Others’ Emotions

The first technique was about sharing your emotions with others. Now, it’s time to get others to share their emotions with you so that you can empathize with them. Once you better understand people and their emotions, it’ll be easier to inspire them to pursue adaptive change.

To empathize with others, first, you need to find out what they’re feeling. To do this:

  * **Ask people what they’re feeling and listen to their answers.** People may be open to directly expressing themselves. Or, they might only tell you what they think you want to hear. Note that it’s harder to listen when you’re in a leadership position because both you and your team are used to _you_ talking and providing answers.
  * **Observe nonverbal cues.** People reveal what they’re feeling through their body language as well as their words. 
  * **Be aware of your own emotions.** Strong emotions are contagious, so when you notice yourself feeling something, there’s a good chance that you’re picking it up from others.
  * **Look for clues that reveal what the hidden stakes (fear of loss) are.** People might say they oppose an initiative because it’s too expensive, but they may _actually_ oppose it because it conflicts with their values or will cause them distress. 



Once you have a better sense of what people are feeling, empathize with them by:

**1\. Trying to feel in yourself what others are feeling.** This will help you understand their point of view and why they might feel distressed and therefore resist change.

**2\. Wielding silence.** While silence might be uncomfortable, it’s very useful for four reasons:

  1. **It prevents you from accidentally beating people over the head with your ideas.** Many leaders find silence uncomfortable and fill it by repeating what they’ve already said about their initiative so much that people get annoyed and stop listening. 
  2. **It provides processing time.** When you tell someone about an initiative that will seriously disrupt her life and cause major losses, she’ll need some quiet time to get used to the idea. Watch for nonverbal clues that indicate someone has had enough silent time and is ready to work. 
  3. **It captures attention, especially when it comes from a leader.** For example, the authors often restore order to their rowdy training sessions by standing silently in front of the group.
  4. **It buys you time to take a step back.** Silence isn’t emptiness—it can contain emotions and moods (body language, etc.), and if you learn to read it, you’ll be better at diagnosis.



### Reflection Questions and Exercises

  * Record yourself while you’re speaking to an audience. Then, watch the recording and pay attention to your volume, tone, and emotion. When do you and the audience seem most and least engaged? How could you improve your ability to express your emotions?
  * Sign up for an acting class. This will help you learn to express emotions and read an audience.
  * How do you react to silence? Do you react differently depending on what role (coach, meeting participant, and so on) you occupy? What happens as a result of your reactions?
  * To get better at enduring silence, try this exercise: Sit in front of another person, close enough that your knees almost touch, and stare silently into each other’s eyes for five minutes. Notice how you react and what you’re feeling. When the timer goes off, discuss your feelings with the other person.
