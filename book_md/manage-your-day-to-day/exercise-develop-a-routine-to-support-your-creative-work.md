## Exercise: Develop a Routine to Support Your Creative Work

Creativity experts suggest that the first step to becoming more creative is prioritizing creative work by building a routine around your creative projects.

* * *

Based on your preferred sleep patterns (your circadian rhythm), what time of day is your period of highest focus (morning, afternoon, evening, or nighttime)? On a normal day, how do you typically spend this time?

Reflect on your current schedule. How much time do you currently spend on your creative projects?

Are you satisfied with the amount of time you currently allot for creativity? If not, whatâ€™s one change you could make to your schedule that would help you to make more room for your creative projects during your period of highest focus?
