## Exercise: Where Have You Met the Characters of Myth?

Peterson writes that stories from around the world contain many of the same archetypes because the tales that resonate the most reflect the commonalities of all human experience—the Dragon representing the vast, unknown universe, the Mother representing the creative and destructive aspects of the wild, the Father (good or bad) representing society, and the Hero (and his Rival) who makes the choice to confront (or deny) the dangers of the world.

Think about a story that you’ve connected with since childhood, whether from books, TV, movies, or folklore. What is it about the story that makes it a meaningful part of your life?

Do you recognize any of the mythical archetypes in that story? Who is the Father, the Mother, or the Dragon? Do they represent what Peterson suggests, or do you feel they stand for something else? If so, what?

Who is the Hero of the story? What journey do they go on to resolve their main problem? How have they changed by the story’s end?
