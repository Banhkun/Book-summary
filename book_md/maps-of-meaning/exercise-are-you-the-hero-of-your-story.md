## Exercise: Are You the Hero of Your Story?

Peterson argues that the Heroic Journey represents the mental and emotional stages we go through when encountering unexpected difficulties in order to form a solution to a problem. When a difficult situation appears, at first we feel both fear and curiosity. Then, we have a choiceâ€”to seek comfort in the safety of routine and tradition, or to explore the problem and reevaluate our thinking to come up with a creative solution.

Describe a time when you experienced a major disruption to your life. How did it make you feel?

Once you were past the initial shock, what steps did you take to resolve the problem? Did you retreat for a time into safe, familiar patterns? Did you have to push yourself to learn something new in order to move forward with your life? If so, what was it?

In the end, how did you resolve the shake-up to your life? Did the event change your outlook in any way? How might the lessons you learned from the experience be used to help others in your life?
