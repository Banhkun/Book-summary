## 7: Economics and History

Much of history can be interpreted sensibly through the economics lens, as a contest among individuals, groups, and states vying for resources and economic power.

  * Consider that it was economic ambition that launched a thousand ships, not Helen’s face.
  * The Crusades were attempts to capture trade routes to the East. In turn, America was discovered as a result of the failure of the Crusades.



Not all activities are primarily economically motivated - like the teachings of Buddha or the nationalistic fervor of Hitler’s troops. The motives of leaders may be economic, but the passions of the masses may not be.

  * But in some cases, military might may _cause_ rather than result from economic operations, like the Bolshevik revolution, or army coups in South American history, or the Mongol conquest of Asia.



Money is vital in shaping the direction of history. “The men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all.”

  * In history, the bankers rise to lead the economic hierarchy, financing wars and popes, sparking revolutions.



#### Profit Motive

**The individual profit motive is vital to spurring productivity.** The profit motive sparks the spirit of competition and inventiveness, in a way that works without excessive monitoring, and scales well across an entire growing population.

Every successful economic system must eventually rely on profit incentive. Alternatives like slavery, governmental force, or ideology ultimately prove too unproductive or too unsuccesful to compete against incentive-driven systems.

### Inequality and Redistribution

**The concentration of wealth is a natural result of the concentration of ability.**

As we discussed in the section on biology, some individuals are better equipped than others to survive. This is the natural product of biological variation, which in turn is necessary for evolution and natural selection. And the complexity of civilization magnifies this difference, allowing the exceptional few to wield tools that further enrich themselves.

In a society, **the degree of wealth concentration depends on the economic freedom permitted by morals and laws**. Democracy, which allows the most liberty, accelerates inequality.

**Concentration of wealth and redistribution (violent or peaceful) cycle in civilizations like a heartbeat**. Concentration may reach a point where the strength in the many poor rivals that of the few rich; then the unstable equilibrium requires either legislation redistributing wealth, or by revolution distributing poverty.

  * Athens in 594 BC saw inequality, and statesman Solon instituted reforms to reduce personal debts and establish progressive income tax. The rich protested this as confiscation, but within a generation the consensus was he had saved Athens from revolution.
  * The Roman civil wars were motivated in part by uprising of the plebs.
  * The Reformation was in part a redistribution of Catholic Church wealth by reducing payments to the church and appropriating church property and revenues.
  * In the 1930s-1960s, the United States was able to peacefully redistribute wealth through taxation and social programs.
