## 3: Race and History

Western history has been biased toward the success of the white man.

  * 1800s French elitist Gobineau believed that a civilization’s success depended on the quality of the race. 
    * He stressed that environmental advantages cannot explain the rise of civilization, since similar soil-fertilizing rivers that watered Egypt produced no civilization in North America.
    * He saw degeneration of civilization when intermarriage with the conquered race.
    * He also believed in a superior Aryan race.
  * American Madison Grant confined achievements to a branch of Aryans he called “Nordics” - Scandinavians, Baltic Germans, Anglo-Saxon Americans
    * He believed these northern tribes swooped down South and conquered, invading India and setting the caste system to prevent intermarriage; creating the Athenians and Romans of the Republic; and conquering England, France, Italy.
    * He bemoaned the thinning of Nordic stock through wars and higher birth rate of Alpine and Mediterranean peoples, though he credited the Mediterranean race with superior intellectual and artistic attainments.



#### History is Color-Blind

The Durants reject all this in _Lessons of History_ \- “history is color-blind” and can develop civilization under any skin, given a favorable environment. Ancient Chinese, Egyptian, Rome civilizations counter the notion of Aryan superiority.

“Would any of the white races” have done better in Africa? The authors note that the heights of achievement of African-Americans are remarkable, despite their deep structural setbacks.

Civilization is not determined by the race. Instead, civilization development is a factor of geographic opportunity and economic and political development.

In turn, civilization makes the people. People who live in new areas adopt the new culture. Ethnic mixtures over centuries create a new type of people and culture.

A race-centric view of history is narrow-minded. A broadened education is the cure for a racially biased view of history. Civilization is a “cooperative product” - all people have contributed to it in some way.
