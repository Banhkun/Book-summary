## 11: Growth and Decay

The authors define civilization as “social order promoting cultural development.” Social order is granted by political order of custom, laws, and morals, and economic order through production and trade.

Looking back at history, all civilizations have ended. What are the patterns of civilization’s growth and decay?

In general, the pattern is one of coherent construction, then of individualistic deconstruction.

  * Civilizations often begin as a conquest of one group by another, and the spreading of the victor’s modus operandi.
  * Growth occurs as a result of taking advantage of a physical boon (land, water); directing people to productive work; to internal tension between the rulers and the ruled; of meeting external challenges (human or natural) and overcoming them.
  * Decay occurs as a failure of political or intellectual leaders to meet new challenges - natural disaster, improper uses of resources, economic changes, energy-sapping taxation, class war, external threat, or moral upheaval through education leading to secularism. 
  * The final blow may come from a major defeat in war.



On internal strife, the authors have an elitist perspective: as a natural result of inequality, society may be divided between a cultured minority and a majority of people unable to adopt the standards of “excellence and taste.” As this majority grows, it drags down the minority - its judgment and thoughts pollute upward, and the society undergoes a mass “barbarization.” This is the price that the minority pays for its unequal control of wealth.

**Does history necessarily repeat itself?** By and large, it has, because human nature is a relative constant. Humans react in stereotyped ways to frequently occurring situations like hunger and danger.

But the authors argue we are in an unprecedented time of development, where individuals are more differentiated than in primitive societies, and many novel circumstances will arise that demand novel responses. They say, with cautious optimism, that “there is no certainty that the future will repeat the past.”

Inevitably civilizations will fall, but this is not something to be bemoaned. **What is gone is the frame; what was created in that civilization can be immortal.** Civilizations pass its accomplishments onto their heirs. To wit, more people read Homer today than did in his time.
