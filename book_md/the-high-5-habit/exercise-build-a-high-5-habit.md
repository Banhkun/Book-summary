## Exercise: Build a High 5 Habit

The High 5 Habit isnâ€™t just about a daily high five, but a **habitual attitude of self-love.** Changing how you think about and talk to yourself takes practice.

* * *

Write down five positive qualities or strengths that you possess. These can be related to any aspect of your life, such as personal traits, skills, or achievements.

Reflect on one quality or strength, and consider how it has positively impacted your life or the lives of others. Write down specific examples or instances where this quality has been valuable.

Now consider how this quality or strength might serve you in the future. Write down at least one action or goal related to the quality you chose.
