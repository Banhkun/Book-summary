## Exercise: Think About Ways to Sell Over the Long Term

Devise a system to sell to customers over the long term.

* * *

Write down three to five ways you can continue selling—or adding value to—your product in the long term. This will be completely unique to your product or service. (For instance, if you sell pet products, consider setting up a subscription program. If you own a bike shop, consider offering customers periodic tune-ups on their bikes.)

Now, write down the frequency at which you can offer this long-term value. How often can you realistically provide additional services or products? If it’s helpful, refer to a calendar and jot down a tentative schedule. (For example, your bike shop might only be able to offer customers tune-ups every two months. The pet shop, on the other hand, might have the capacity to deliver subscription pet food every day.)
