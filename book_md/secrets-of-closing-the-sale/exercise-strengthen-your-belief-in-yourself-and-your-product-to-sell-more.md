## Exercise: Strengthen Your Belief in Yourself and Your Product to Sell More

Develop your conviction in your sales abilities and in the advantages of the product, and use both in tandem to sell more effectively.

* * *

Write down five qualities and strengths you possess. These don’t have to be related to selling. Do your best to get to five.

For each quality, note next to it how it can help you sell more effectively. This may not be initially obvious, and you may need to approach them from a different perspective to see their advantages to you in selling. (For instance, if you’re a deliberate thinker, you might note that this helps you respond thoughtfully and honestly to leads’ objections. If you’re a people person, you might write down that you can connect easily with customers.)

Next, write down five qualities of the product or service you’re selling. These don’t have to be qualities your company strongly advertises: It’s better if they’re assets you personally perceive in the product. (For instance, you might see the friendliness of the carpet installers as a major asset of the carpeting business you work for.)

Finally, for each product quality, jot down how you might pitch your lead on it using your own strengths. (For example, if you’re a people person who connects easily with customers, you might note that you can speak enthusiastically and convincingly about the friendliness of the carpet installers.)
