## Exercise: Dispel Your Misconceptions

Gawdat’s algorithm for happiness dispels six misconceptions that cause us to suffer. In this exercise, practice recognizing two related misconceptions—control and fear—in past and present experiences.

* * *

Describe a current or recent situation where you realized that part of the situation was out of your control. How did you react to this realization?

Which aspects of the situation _are_ in your control? Which _are not_?

How could you cope by using Gawdat’s strategy to do your best and accept that the consequences are out of your control? This could involve devising a plan to address the aspects of the situation that _are_ under your control.

Review your list of aspects you _can_ and _can’t_ control. Which (if any) could you influence if your fear of confronting it wasn’t holding you back?

With that fear in mind, answer two of Gawdat’s questions: What are the worst- and best-case scenarios if you confront that fear?
