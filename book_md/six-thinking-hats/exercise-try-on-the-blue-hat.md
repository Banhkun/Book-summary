## Exercise: Try on the Blue Hat

Create a draft meeting agenda or thinking plan based on the six hats.

* * *

Write down either: (1) a problem youâ€™re currently facing at work, or (2) a problem outside of work that you think might be amenable to the Six Hats method.

Consider the function of each of the six hats: The blue hat is for procedure, the white hat is for information, the red hat is for emotion, the black hat is for criticism, the yellow hat is for constructive thinking, and the green hat is for new ideas.

Put on your blue hat. Which of the above do you think should be addressed first and why?

Sketch a plan for the whole thinking process. Remember to touch on each hat at least once. Feel free to circle back to important hats as many times as you like.
