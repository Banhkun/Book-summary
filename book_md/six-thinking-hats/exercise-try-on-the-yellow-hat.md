## Exercise: Try on the Yellow Hat

Work with the yellow hat on a problem of your choice.

* * *

Consider the project or initiative that you’ve been thinking about in previous exercises. What design flaws and weaknesses did you identify with the black hat? List the main ones. For each flaw or weakness, put on your yellow hat and see if you can find ways to strengthen or overcome the weakness.

Think again about this project or initiative. What’s the underlying problem that it’s trying to solve? Can you come up with another way to solve it?

What’s the best possible outcome for your project? If everything goes right for the project, what would that look like?
