## Exercise: Conduct Customer Research and Create a Headline

Schwartz argues that the key to creating a captivating headline lies in researching what customers want, how aware they are of your product, and how aware they are of competitors’ products. Conduct your own customer research and create a headline as a first step toward creating a successful advertisement.

* * *

Describe your product. List the materials used to create the product, any technical specifications, the aesthetic details, and different ways customers might choose to use it.

List the different customer needs that your product can fulfill. Which customer need applies to the largest potential market for your product?

How aware are customers of your product? Recall: Customers move through five levels of product awareness: They don’t feel like they need your product, they feel a need but don’t know how to fulfill it, they know how they want to fulfill the need your product satisfies, they aren’t sure about your product, or they want your product.

How aware are customers of competitors’ products? Are they _unaware_ of competing products, aware of a _few_ competing products, or aware of _many_ competing products?

Craft a headline that emphasizes the most relevant customer need for your product, appeals to your customers’ level of product awareness, and differentiates your product from any similar versions in the market.
