## Exercise: Use Evidence to Change Your Own Mind

Let’s say you’re ready to free yourself from unconscious beliefs that are holding you back—how do you start? Follow Bishop’s suggestions to start retraining your brain.

* * *

First, think of an area of your life, big or small, where you’d like to make changes. What negative beliefs might be keeping you in your current situation? (For example, if you keep spending money on takeout even though you promised yourself you’d prepare more meals at home, you might uncover a belief that cooking is hard and you’ll never be good at it.)

What new beliefs would help you achieve your goals in this area? (For example, it will be easier to change your cooking habits if you believe learning to cook is easy and fun.)

Now imagine you’re on a debate team, and you’ve been assigned to argue against this negative belief. List two or three pieces of evidence from your life that directly _contradict the negative belief_. (For example: To argue that you’re not so bad at cooking, you can point out that one time you brought a dish to a potluck, and everyone seemed to enjoy it; or the one easy meal you make so often you’re practically an expert at it.)

List two to three examples from your life that _support the new helpful belief_. (For example, to reinforce the notion that cooking is easy and fun, you might remember how proud you were when your grandma taught you to make cookies, and how great it was when she let you lick the spoon.)

Over the next week, what can you do to collect additional evidence to support your new mindset? (For example: Find a recipe for a home-cooked version of one of your favorite takeout treats, and give it a whirl; start a cooking journal to document your progress.)
