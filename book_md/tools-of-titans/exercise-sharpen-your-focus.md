## Exercise: Sharpen Your Focus

If you feel like you have too many things going on, narrow down on the few things that matter.

* * *

What busy work do you do each day that doesnâ€™t move you closer to your goals?

Why do you spend time on this busy work? (Common answers include liking the feeling of being needed, or a desire to avoid deeper unsettling questions.)

What are the 2-3 life goals you most want to achieve?

Are you willing to devote 90% of your time to these life goals? What would you need to give up to do this?
