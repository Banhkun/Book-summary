## Exercise: Practice Gratitude

Be thankful for small things in life and put things into perspective.

* * *

Think of 3 things you’re grateful for. Instead of repeating the same things like your health, consider small things, like an old relationship that really helped you, something great that you saw happen, or something simple that you can see.

Think of a time you took a risk and it worked out. What happened? How does thinking about this make you feel?

What’s something that causes you stress right now?

Now think, “this too shall pass” or “at the end of today I’ll be in my bed.” Does this make you feel better about the stressor?
