## Checklists of Questions

Here’s a compilation of items for hiring, asking good questions, and solving your life problems.

### Good Hiring Questions

Here are questions that titans love asking in their hiring interviews:

  * “What do you think about that really gets you excited?”—neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley
  * “What interesting thing are you working on? Why is that interesting to you? What’s surprising about that? Is anybody else thinking about this?”—chef and scientist Chris Young
  * “What are you doing that the world doesn’t realize is a really big deal?”—Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian
  * Instead of interviewing, Wordpress founder Matt Mullenweg auditions his employees.
  * “Tell me something that’s true that very few people agree with you on.”—investor Peter Thiel
  * “What problem do you face every day that nobody has solved yet?” “What is a great company no one has started?”—Peter Thiel
  * “If I gave you $100 million, what would you build? How is it defensible?”—Valve founder Gabe Newell.
  * “What will people who don’t like you say about you?”—Navy SEAL and leadership consultant Chris Fussell



### Questions to Elicit Stories

These are questions and prompts to get good conversations with people:

  * Tell me about a time when…
  * Tell me about the day or moment when…
  * Tell me the story of…
  * Tell me about the day you realized…
  * What were the steps that got you to…
  * Describe the conversation when…
  * How did that make you feel?
  * What do you make of that?
  * What did you learn from that?
  * Explain that a bit more.
  * If the old you could see the new you, what would the old you say?
  * You seem very **__** now. Was that always the case?
  * Describe the debate in your head that you had about [a certain decision or event].
  * What did you want to do when you were a child, before anybody told you what you were supposed to do?
  * [To get vulnerability from someone, give vulnerability yourself.]



### Tips for Conducting an Interview

Tim Ferriss has interviewed hundreds of world-class people for his podcast. Here are his tips on how to get good stories out of people:

  * When interviewing someone, tell them to let loose. They can always control the final cut and cut stuff out later, but they can’t add interesting stuff in later.
  * Journalist Cal Fussman: “When asking questions, first aim for the heart, then go to the head, which will lead you on a pathway to the soul.”—Cal Fussman
  * Ask the person an unexpected question that will make them think.
    * When interviewing Gorbachev, Cal Fussman asked not about the Cold War but rather, “What’s the best lesson your father ever taught you?”
    * When meeting President Obama, comedian Mike Birbiglia told him his wife was pregnant, and he was the first to know. He then asked for parenting advice, and Obama shared his thoughts about breastfeeding, sleep, and baby poo.



### Questions to Find a Great Teacher

If you want to find a teacher for a sport or activity, don’t focus on finding a person who was good at the sport. You need to find someone who is good at training other people.

Here are Tim’s favorite questions to ask:

  * Who is good at [activity] who shouldn’t be?
  * Who are the most controversial trainers in [activity]? Why? What do you think of them?
  * Who are the most impressive lesser-known teachers?
  * What makes you different as a teacher? Who trained you or influenced you?
  * Have you trained others successfully? How successful are your students?
  * What are the biggest mistakes and misconceptions you see in training? What are the biggest wastes of time?
  * What are your favorite instructional books or resources on learning this?
  * If you were to train me for 12 weeks for a competition and had a million dollars on the line, how would you train me? What about 8 weeks?
