## Exercise: Respond to Being Shamed

There are five approaches to responding to being publicly shamed.

* * *

Imagine someone found one of your old social media posts, misinterpreted it, shared it widely, and you’re now the victim of a public shaming campaign. What’s your immediate response? (For example, do you apologize, withdraw, or go online and defend yourself?)

How might this shaming affect your life in the long term? (For example, you might get fired, followed by the media, and so on.)

Which of the approaches would you take to manage these long-term consequences? Why?
