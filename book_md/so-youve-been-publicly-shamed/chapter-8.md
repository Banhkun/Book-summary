Removing from Favorites 

## Chapter 8: Approach #5—Remove Your Story From the Internet

The final approach to being publicly shamed is to remove evidence of the shaming from the internet so that it doesn’t reappear when applying for new jobs or meeting new people. Ronson covers two ways to do this:

### Option #1: Apply for the Right to Be Forgotten

In 2006, the European Court of Justice ruled that **if an online text about someone was “inadequate, irrelevant...or excessive,” people could request that Google deindex the article or blog from its European sites.** This means that, in theory, you could ask Google to remove shameful information about you from its search indexes.

While this ruling did result in a lot of material being deindexed—within three months, 70,000 people made requests—it also brought some of the things that people wanted buried back into the spotlight. As Google met requests, it sent automatic notices to media outlets letting them know their articles had been deindexed, which created resistance to the ruling. People started bringing up old stories again so they couldn’t be forgotten.

### Option #2: Hire a Reputation Management Company

**Reputation management companies aim to hide shameful or damaging information about people by creating new online content that knocks undesirable content onto the second or third page of online search results.** According to Google, 53% of people don’t look past the first two search results and almost 90% of people don’t ever click past the first page.

**Reputation management companies tend to be discreet and mysterious, and few people who sign up have their identities exposed** , unlike the applicants for the Right to Be Forgotten. Their clients aren’t only people who have been publicly shamed—one unnamed company was started by a felony rapist who wanted to hide his crimes, and other common clients include pedophiles and neo-Nazis.

#### How Reputation Management Works

**It’s hard to influence Google’s search result rankings because the algorithms are always changing.** For example, in the mid-1990s, search engines ranked results based on how often a keyword appeared on a page. If you wanted to bury something about yourself, you could have just created a page with your name written over and over.

Keyword frequency wasn’t a very good way to get relevant search results, and two Stanford students came up with a new algorithm, PageRank, which would order search results by popularity instead. PageRank assesses links—**the more pages that link to a page, the more the algorithm assumes that the page is endorsed, authentic, and respected.** Twitter, LinkedIn, and Tumblr automatically have a high PageRank because Google’s algorithm thinks these sites are popular.

At the time of writing, **Google’s algorithm seemed to prioritize either brand new content, or content that was older than about twelve weeks** and is thus considered authoritative. This algorithmic element is another difficulty for reputation management companies—the content they initially put up about someone doesn’t stay at the top of the search results for long, and after time, the results revert to the older things that people want hidden.

Reversion isn’t necessarily a bad thing—it shows that Google’s algorithm is unsure of what information is most important. This is the company’s chance to make the new information take over for good by flooding the internet with even more non-shaming content. However, **the uploading has to be timed carefully and appear natural, otherwise Google’s algorithm will notice the deluge and realize it's being manipulated.**

#### Reputation.com

The reputation management company Reputation.com was created by Michael Fertik, who came up with the idea of online reputation management in the mid-2000s when revenge porn and cyberbullying were starting to appear.

**Fertik adheres to a code of conduct.** He won’t take on clients who are under investigation for or who have committed certain crimes—violent, fraud, sexual, or crimes against children—and he won’t put up any content that isn’t true (many companies invent accolades as part of their content creation). Fertik’s clients tend to be people who have been publicly shamed, revenge porn victims, people who were falsely accused of crimes, or politicians who had said something awkward that hasn’t yet gone viral.

Fertik is often criticized for his work because according to some people, reputation management manipulates the truth and attacks free speech. **He thinks his work is justified—public shaming can destroy people’s lives, and its prevalence makes everyone scared it will happen to them next.**

#### Extended Example: Lindsey Stone

In October 2012, Lindsey Stone posed for a photo by pretending to scream and giving the middle finger beside a sign at Arlington National Cemetery that read “Silence and Respect.”

The internet found the photo disrespectful and her public shaming lasted for over a year.

##### The Transgression: A Goofy Photograph

Lindsey Stone and her friend Jamie had a habit of taking stupid photos of themselves. For example, they’d mimic the poses of statues or smoke in front of no smoking signs. When Lindsey and Jamie encountered the Arlington sign on a trip with the residents to Washington, D.C., **Lindsey posed in front of the sign, doing exactly the opposite of what it advised. Jamie posted the photo on Facebook and tagged Lindsey with her permission.**

**A few of their Facebook friends commented that the photo was tasteless or offensive.** Stone responded to say that they were just goofing off like they did in their other photos and that they didn’t mean any disrespect. Jamie asked Stone about taking the photo down, but Stone thought it would be fine to leave it up.

Jamie’s Facebook settings weren’t private. **A month after the photo was posted, someone found it and passed it around the internet.** Stone never found out who started it, but suspected it might have been someone from work who didn’t like her or Jamie.

##### Immediate Aftermath

**Shamers accused Stone of hating the military, made fun of her appearance, and sent her rape and death threats.** A few people commented that the photo was just a joke and Stone’s life shouldn’t be ruined, but they were quickly shut down.

Stone apologized for the photo. However, **someone created a Facebook page calling for her to be fired** from her job with LIFE (Living Independently Forever), a residence for people with learning disabilities. **12,000 people liked the page** and many people also emailed her employer directly. Lindsey was fired.

The media showed up at Stone’s house. Her father spoke to them and noticed that the cameras focused on his cigarette and dog, which had followed him out of the house when he’d opened the door. This focus made it seem like**the media was trying to cast Lindsey's family as smoking hillbillies with guard dogs.**

**Other Lindsey Stones got shamed as well—sixty other people with the same name lived in the US.**

##### Long-Term Consequences

The photo became Stone’s entire internet presence and an iconic symbol of the enemy for military supporters, antifeminists, and right-wingers. One man even photoshopped it and turned it into wallpaper.

Stone became depressed and an insomniac, and isolated herself for almost a year. When she was ready to look for work again, no one responded to her applications. **Eventually, someone offered her a caregiver job. She was terrified the new company would google her** and debated telling them in advance of the interview who she was. She ultimately didn’t because once people get to know her, they aren’t angry about the photograph because they realize she’s a lot more than what the internet thinks of her.

Stone googled herself on Veterans Day in 2013. **The photo had still dominated Google Image results and some ex-army people were writing about tracking her down and restarting the shaming.**

**_16 Months Post-Shaming_**

Four months after Stone got her new job, she still hadn’t told anyone at work about the photo. She thought one of her coworkers might know because he made a comment about putting things up on the internet, but it was too vague for her to be sure. **She lived with constant anxiety and stress because if anyone at work googled her name, the photo would come up, and she might get shamed all over again.** Stone adored her new job and the children she worked with and didn’t want to lose it. Stone’s personal life was affected too—like Sacco, she hadn’t tried to date.

Ronson connected Stone with Reputation.com, who agreed to take on her case pro bono (it would normally cost several hundred thousand dollars) so that Ronson could observe the process as research for the book. Stone knew that she’d also have to appear in Ronson’s book, but her situation at the time was so uncomfortable that she thought removing the photo from the internet would be an improvement nonetheless.

Stone worked with Farukh Rashid to create a new internet presence. **Initially Stone found the process entertaining, but it became existential—she had to ask herself who she really was and how to brand herself.** When she described her five years working at Walmart as “soul-sucking,” Rashid asked her if she wanted to use that word. At first, she laughed, because she didn’t think that it could possibly offend anyone because it was true, but then she hesitated. **The process ultimately involved presenting a watered-down version of herself** —someone who liked Top 40 music and cats and travel but wasn’t as outspoken or playful.

**_20 Months Post-Shaming_**

**By October 2014, the photo no longer dominated Google’s search results.** It still appeared, but so did blog posts about traveling, new social media accounts, photos of Stone doing regular things, and photos of other Lindsey Stones. The reputation management process is an ongoing process, though, and Rashid calls Stone every week so she can approve Reputation.com’s latest content.
