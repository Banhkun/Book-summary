## Chapter 3: What Motivates Public Shaming?

If public shaming is so terrible, why do people participate in it? Scientists and observers have some ideas, but they don’t really know. They _do_ know that **one of the most popular theories—that people lose their minds when part of a crowd (known as contagion, group madness, or deindividuation)—has little scientific merit.**

First, we’ll look at why group madness probably isn’t the explanation. Then, we’ll look at some other thoughts on what motivates public shaming.

### Why Group Madness Isn’t the Explanation

**Group madness is the idea that when in a crowd, people lose their individuality and do things they never would have considered on their own, such as destroy property.** It’s not a very robust theory because the inventor made it up to serve his own ends, the most famous experiment proving its existence used questionable methodology, and there’s plenty of evidence that conflicts with the theory, such as the events of recent riots.

#### The Inventor: Gustave LeBon

Group madness was invented in the nineteenth century by Frenchman Gustave LeBon. Crowds were of particular interest in France at the time because the elite was worried about uprisings against them. (Napoleon III even tried to use urban planning to control crowds by replacing medieval streets with wide boulevards.)

LeBon lived through the uprising in 1871 and came up with the idea that people lose their free will, reasoning power, and restraint when in a crowd—**everyone goes mad all at once; there’s no ideological motivation or justification involved.**

LeBon tried to scientifically prove this idea. He was enamored with the elites of Paris society and thought that they might welcome him into their circles if he could give them a way to manage the madness.

LeBon’s science involved looking at skulls held by the Anthropological Society of Paris and measuring their volume as a proxy for brain size. He concluded that businessmen and aristocrats had the biggest brains and were therefore less susceptible to madness. He decided the brains of Black people and women were lighter to explain why people with the same-sized heads wouldn’t have the same-sized brains. He wrote a paper about his theories in 1879 that went over very badly. **The Anthropological Society of Paris was highly suspicious of LeBon’s conclusions because his scientific methods were so sloppy and he was so misogynistic.**

LeBon went to Arabia to study Arabians’ racial characteristics and over the next years and wrote and self-published several books. **These books weren’t based on any experimentation— he just wrote down what he thought. In 1895, he published _The Crowd_** , which explained his group madness theory. It contained two tantalizing ideas:

  1. Mass revolutionary movements (like feminism) were all madness;**morality played no part, so such movements could just be ignored.**
  2. **A good speaker could learn to control a crowd** by affirming their beliefs, exaggerating, and using repetition but never logic.



_The Crowd_ was very popular and was translated into 26 languages. Mussolini and Goebbels both endorsed the book. LeBon earned himself a place in the Parisian society but acted very strangely—during lunches he hosted, if someone said something he didn’t like, he’d ring a bell until the speaker went quiet.

**Even though group theory was made up and endorsed by people generally considered immoral, and everyone thought LeBon was socially awkward, it still persisted.**

#### The Stanford Prison Experiment: Philip Zimbardo

In 1971, **psychologist Philip Zimbardo tried to prove the existence of crowd theory, also called deindividuation, which is a version of group madness.** He turned a Stanford basement into a mock prison and recruited participants for an experiment. Nine would be guards, nine would be prisoners, and six would be on call. He acted as the superintendent.

Zimbardo ended the experiment after less than a week because the guards became too sadistic and treated the prisoners like animals. One guard, Dave Eshelman, screamed at the prisoners to “fuck the floor” and humiliated them by making them pretend to be in love with Mrs. Frankenstein. **Zimbardo appeared to have proven that when people are put into an evil place**(the basement included small cells, solitary confinement, and the prisoners wore chains)**and surrounded by evil influences**(himself and the other guards),**they act in evil ways.**

In fact, this wasn’t the case. Dave Eshelman was the _only_ guard who appeared to suffer from madness, group madness or otherwise. When speaking to Ronson, **Eshelman admitted that he’d been faking his loss of control because the experiment was going nowhere in the early days and Eshelman was concerned that Zimbardo wasn’t going to get good results.** He acted evil—channeling the sadistic prison warden in _Cool Hand Luke_ —to get the experiment started.

The fact that Eshelman was acting doesn’t invalidate what happened—Eshelman chose to act in the way that he did for some psychological reason, and the prisoners still experienced brutality regardless of its sincerity. However, **the fact that Eshelman was motivated by wanting to help Zimbardo is the opposite of group madness—Eshelman wasn’t corrupted by an environment; he was trying to do “something good.”**

Additionally,**there’s a lot of research that suggests that participants in studies are motivated to do whatever they think the researchers want.** Psychologist Peter Gray notes that in the Stanford prison experiment, **since Zimbardo acted as the superintendent and was present for the experiment, the participants would have felt even more pressure to do what they thought he wanted.**

#### The Conflicting Evidence: The 2011 London Riots

In 2011, some people in the UK rioted and looted for five days after the police shot a man named Mark Duggan. Scientists attributed their behavior to contagious group thinking that made people more violent than they would be alone. However, there were some clear problems with the contagion theory:

  * **If group behavior really is contagious and overpowering, then everyone who encountered the riot should have joined in. They didn’t** —plenty of people who watched the riot on TV stayed home, and the police didn’t join in either. 
  * **If everyone had lost their minds, the riot wouldn’t have spontaneously fizzled out.** Interestingly, rioters stopped at the bottom of a giant hill—possibly because it would be a lot of effort to climb, a realization they couldn’t have come to if they were all suffering from madness.



Crowd psychologist Steve Reicher notes that there are always patterns associated with crowd formation. While crowds often don’t have a leader and don’t form via a plan, the group tends to share an ideology. Public shamers, on the other hand, don’t always share ideologies. For example, when Justine Sacco (see Chapter 4) wrote an insensitive joke about AIDS, she was shamed by both humanitarian organizations and misogynists, two groups that rarely see eye to eye.

### Why People Participate in Public Shaming

**Online public shaming, while it does involve a digital “crowd,” may have a more complicated explanation than whatever scientists ultimately discover about crowd behavior.**

Another scientific principle that might have a hand in shamings that get out of control is **feedback loops—responses to your behavior that inspire you to change it.** For example, Your Speed signs are a feedback loop because they tell you how fast you’re going, which gives you an opportunity to make a change—for instance, slow down if you’re breaking the speed limit. If you do make that change, you get immediate feedback again—the next “Your Speed” sign will show you’re driving at the right speed, and some signs will even congratulate you for this.

**Online shaming is a form of feedback loop—if you shame someone and are congratulated, that positively reinforces your behavior and you’ll probably keep on shaming.** As the shaming grows, you’ll just keep seeing posts from people who agree with you and your social media feeds will become an echo chamber.

Additionally, while writing the book, Ronson discovered two factors that many public shamers have in common:

#### Factor #1: The Desire to Do Good

**Many people who participate in public shamings, like Eshelman, thought they were doing something good.** Public shaming is a way of getting justice in a broken system.

For example, Mercedes Haefer has participated in many shamings and online attacks because the internet is where she has power. When a boy on YouTube posted videos of himself abusing his cat, Haefer and other members of an online community called 4chan tracked him down. They told his entire town that he was a sociopath, which got the cat sent to a new home.

#### Factor #2: The Belief That Shaming Isn’t a Big Deal

Ronson also discovered plenty of people who were unaware of the effects of shaming. **Some people who had participated in online shamings had never thought about how their comments affected the shamee, or if they had, they assumed the shamee would be fine over time.** Ronson himself couldn’t even remember all the names of people he’d shamed.

Additionally, some people see shaming as not only harmless but as a popular leisure activity. These days, on Twitter especially, users actively look for misspeaking or poorly chosen jokes to shame people over.
