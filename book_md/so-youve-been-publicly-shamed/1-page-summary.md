## 1-Page Summary

Journalist and author Jon Ronson first became interested in the modern resurgence of public shaming after someone used his name and photo to create a Twitter spambot. Ronson was ashamed of what the bot tweeted—it didn’t accurately represent his identity—and started a public shaming campaign to get the bot taken down. It worked.

Intrigued by the process, Ronson researched public shaming, interviewed its victims, and sought out shame-avoidance and recovery strategies.

First, we’ll look at some basics of shame. Then, we’ll look at some strategies for managing the fallout when you become a victim of a public shaming.

### What Is Shame?

According to psychiatrist James Gilligan, **shame isn’t a feeling, it’s an _absence_ of feeling.** Initially, shame might feel like pain, but long-term, it becomes more like numbness or deadness.

**In modern times, the things people are most ashamed of tend to be personal secrets that aren’t objectively very scandalous or that would seem unimportant to others.** For example, Melissa’s salary is $550,000 a year and she’s ashamed that she makes so much, and Jim is ashamed that he smokes an ounce of marijuana every three weeks. When they both revealed these secrets at an honesty workshop, none of the other participants cared.

However, **there are some things that society generally labels as shameful.** For men, this includes exercising white privilege, committing a professional faux pas like plagiarism, or losing their jobs and being unemployed. Women are shamed for the same things as men and additionally for sex scandals. (Sex scandals used to be shameful for men back in the 1800s and 1900s, but these days, people consider other transgressions worse.)

  * For example, when the client list of Alexis Wright’s one-woman brothel was released, it contained the names of sixty-eight men and one woman. The men faced consequences—for example, pastor James Andrew Ferreira was fired and his wife left him—but didn’t experience shaming. The woman, on the other hand, did—even the men who had been involved in the scandal made jokes about her.



#### Uses of Shame: Punishment and Control

Because shame is so uncomfortable, it’s been used as a punishment and control mechanism throughout history and is making a comeback today.

##### Historical Punishment

Historical public humiliation consisted of whippings in the town square, locking people in the stocks for hours, public executions, and so on. Humiliation was used to punish criminals in the UK and the US until the 1830s when it was deemed too brutal. US founding father Benjamin Rush **wrote that public shaming was worse than death, and people who were sentenced to public humiliation such as whippings found the shaming worse than the physical pain.** Public shaming was so damaging because it destroyed people’s self-respect to the point that they felt they could never reform.

##### Today’s Punishment

Today’s public humiliation tends to take place on social media. **Social media shamings differ from older forms of public punishment because they’re democratic, anonymous, and lawless.** Anyone can choose a target, and unlike a formal justice system where the accused has rights, online, no one has any rights. People can be punished without evidence and there’s no time limit on the punishment.

Some people argue that online shaming is just commentary because it can’t hand down “real” punishment, but as we’ve learned, making people feel ashamed is one of the worst punishments out there.

##### Control

The use of shame as a control method, unlike as punishment, was never outlawed, and people still use shame to control and manipulate people:

  * Example #1: Death row lawyer Clive Stafford Smith comes up with an obscure question that an expert can’t possibly know the answer to. Experts can’t admit they don’t know, because being an expert by nature requires them to be respected and knowledgeable. So they try to address the question and eventually end up looking stupid and feeling ashamed. This discourages people from challenging him and helps his clients.
  * Example #2: Police stops are a way of controlling a space. **Being stopped and frisked by police is shameful, even when you’re innocent,** **because everyone else on the street who witnesses the police talking to you assumes you’ve done something wrong.** This threat of shame encourages people to leave areas with high police presence and go elsewhere. 



#### Consequences of Shame: Reform, Breakdown, and Violence

We’ve established that shame is brutal and dehumanizing—but does it work? In some cases, yes.

##### Reform

**Public shaming can be a force for a good** —the public can call out previously inaccessible people and companies for objectively despicable behavior. Shaming can force change that would be time-consuming or impossible to win through the justice system. It can also be a successful motivator for reform when used _within_ the justice system.

  * Example #1: After the death of gay singer Stephen Gately, _Daily Mail_ columnist Jan Moir wrote that civil partnerships could never have happily-ever-afters. The public was so angry that Nestlé and Marks & Spencer pulled their advertising from the _Daily Mail_ ’s website and the paper lost money.
  * Example #2: Judge Ted Poe, who’s famous for assigning embarrassing punishments, sentenced Mike Hubacek, who’d killed two people while driving drunk, to a variety of shame-inducing punishments. These included carrying a sign that said he’d killed people driving drunk while walking in front of bars and schools. He had to do this once a month for ten years. **While doing all of his punishments, Hubacek found a sense of purpose—he could warn others not to drive drunk.** He now speaks at schools and owns a halfway house. He’s very grateful to Poe.



##### Breakdown and Violence

**Public shaming can also destroy people.** First, shaming is very painful, and people who are shamed online can lose their reputations, jobs, friends, and family, potentially forever.

  * For example, Kevin Tunell, like Hubacek, killed someone while driving drunk. The victim’s parents offered to reduce his $1.5 million fine if he would pay them $936 up front and mail them a $1 check in their daughter’s name once a week for eighteen years. Tunell accepted the offer, but every time he had to write the girl’s name, he was overwrought with guilt and psychologically tortured, and he eventually stopped sending payments because he couldn’t bear to write the check. When her parents took him to court, he broke down. 



Second, **most violence isn’t motivated by revenge or self-defense—it’s motivated by shame.** Violence is an effective way to gain instant self-esteem—threatening someone with a gun tends to make them treat you with respect—and this self-esteem and respect help fill the void caused by shame.

  * For example, when psychiatrist James Gilligan studied violent inmates in prisons and mental hospitals in Massachusetts, he discovered that all of them had experienced severe shame at some point in their lives, such as being abused by their parents. Gilligan started deshaming programs such as therapeutic communities and education that boosted the inmates’ self-esteem, and violence decreased.



Finally, **even just the threat of public shaming negatively affects people—some people are so scared of being shamed that they worry about being surveilled and tone down their personalities to create a bland online presence.** Because public shamings over misunderstandings can be just as brutal as shamings resulting from actual wrongdoing, it’s safest to be mild.

**Due to these negative effects, Ronson recommends reflecting before shaming anyone.** He no longer shames people unless they’ve victimized someone.

### What Motivates Public Shaming?

If public shaming has such potentially dire consequences, why do people participate in it? Scientists and observers have some ideas, but they don’t really know.

#### What Probably _Doesn’t_ Motivate Public Shamings

One of the most popular theories to explain public shamings is that people lose their minds when part of a crowd and therefore engage in illogical, potentially destructive behaviors (such as shaming). (This is known as contagion, group madness, or deindividuation.) However, the theory has little scientific merit:

  * **The inventor made it up to get on the good side of the French aristocracy.** Gustave LeBon lived through anti-aristocracy uprisings in France and came up with the idea that when people are in a crowd they lose their free will, reasoning power, and restraint—everyone goes mad all at once; there’s no ideological motivation or justification involved. He didn’t do any experiments to prove this; he just wrote a book and people believed it.
  * **The most famous experiment proving its existence used questionable methodology.** In 1971, psychologist Philip Zimbardo turned a Stanford basement into a mock prison and recruited participants for an experiment. After a few days, one of the “guards,” Eshelman, became sadistic and treated the prisoners like animals. However, when Ronson interviewed Eshelman, he hadn’t been violent because he’d lost his mind; he’d decided to act like a prison warden he’d seen in a movie because in the early days, the experiment was going nowhere, and he wanted Zimbardo to get useful results.
  * **It doesn’t play out in real life.** In 2011, some people in the UK rioted and looted for five days after the police shot dead a man named Mark Duggan. If group behavior really is contagious and overpowering, then everyone who encountered the riot, including the police, should have joined in—but, they didn’t. Additionally, if everyone had lost their minds, the riot wouldn’t have spontaneously fizzled out, as it eventually did.



#### What Might Motivate Public Shamings

Whatever does motivate public shamings, it’s probably more complicated than crowd theory. Crowd psychologist Steve Reicher notes that there are always patterns associated with crowd formation and most people in crowds tend to share an ideology. Public shamers, on the other hand, come from a variety of backgrounds.

Ronson discovered a few factors that might contribute to shamings:

  * **The desire to do good.** Many people who participate in public shamings, like Eshelman, thought they were doing something good. 
    * For example, when people shamed Justine Sacco for an insensitive tweet, they thought they were working towards justice by calling out racism.
  * **Lack of understanding.** Ronson found that plenty of people didn’t realize how much public shaming affected the victims and thought the effects were temporary. 
    * For example, Sam Biddle, who may have started the pile-up on Justine Sacco, thought people would forget about her eventually and she’d be fine. Instead, Sacco was unemployed for months.
  * **Feedback loops.** These loops are responses to your behavior that inspire you to change or maintain it. If you shame someone and are congratulated, that positively reinforces your behavior and you’ll probably keep on shaming. As the shaming grows, you’ll just keep seeing posts from people who agree with you and your social media feeds become an echo chamber.



### How to Respond to a Public Shaming

So you’ve been publicly shamed—what next? Ronson discovered that there are six approaches to recovering from a public shaming. **(None of the approaches restore the victim’s life to what it was like before the shaming, and many of the solutions are fragile.)**

#### Approach #1: Withdraw and Wait

**Withdrawing includes shutting down social media accounts, refusing to give interviews, avoiding public places, and lying low until things blow over.** This is a popular approach, though it doesn’t work particularly well—sometimes the shaming reincarnates when the shamee tries to return, and the shamee has to endure feelings of isolation.

##### Jonah Lehrer

For example, bestselling author Jonah Lehrer chose to withdraw when the news broke that he’d made up some of the Bob Dylan quotes that appeared in his most recent book, _Imagine_. He resigned from his job, refused interviews, and stayed home. The strategy didn’t work very well for him—after seven months, Lehrer tried to publicly apologize, but Twitter piled on again. When he tried to publish a new book, people mocked him. (Shortform note: Lehrer’s new book was eventually published to mixed reviews.)

#### Approach #2: Write a New Narrative

Before a public shaming, the victim has a life story. During the shaming, the public reduces the victim’s identity to revolve entirely around their transgression. Instead of holding on to the original narrative, **approach #2 is to create a private third life narrative that explains the reasoning behind the transgression to reduce personal feelings of shame.**

##### Mike Daisey

For example, like Jonah Lehrer, monologue writer and performer Mike Daisey committed literary fraud: He invented details in a non-fiction monologue about horrible working conditions at Apple factories that he performed on the podcast _This American Life_ , among other venues. However, instead of withdrawing, he chose to create a new narrative.

Daisey told Ronson that**he’d known in advance that if he went on the podcast someone would uncover his lies, but he decided to do it anyway because sacrificing his career was worth getting the story out.** He cast himself as a hero to deal with his feelings of shame. He also defended himself online and responded to his shamers.

#### Approach #3: Become Emotionally Invulnerable to Shame

Becoming emotionally invulnerable to shame involves refusing to let shame affect you. To learn more about this approach, Ronson spoke to porn stars, who have to learn to manage shame because their industry is associated with it. Ronson interviewed Princess Donna Dolore, who said **that if she publicly shared the things that embarrassed her, they were no longer embarrassing.** One of her models, Jody Taylor, feels the same—**she thinks that fiction, by nature, can’t be frightening or humiliating,** so instead, the porn scenarios she performs are “awesome.”

Dolore’s goal is to make people feel less ashamed of what they want, and **her work to demystify strange sex is probably part of the reason that fewer men are shamed for sex scandals these days.**

##### Max Mosley

For example, Max Mosley chose to be invulnerable to shame when the news broke that he’d been involved in “sick” Nazi-themed orgies. He interviewed with BBC Radio 4 and agreed his sex life was strange, but he said people shouldn’t think badly of him for it. **Mosley brought his actual personality closer to his public persona, unlike Lehrer, who was almost two entirely different people and was shamed for being two-faced.**

Mosley also sued _News of the World_ , the paper that had broken the story, because they’d written that the orgy was Nazi-themed, which, in reality, it wasn’t. It was only German-themed. **Mosley won the case and as a result, most people see him as someone who was wronged.**

Mosley’s decision to refuse to be ashamed certainly played a part in his outcome, but he probably also escaped shame because he was also a man in a consensual sex scandal.

#### Approach #4: Attend a Radical Honesty Workshop

**Psychotherapist Brad Blanton believes shame thrives in secret—if you’re constantly worrying about what other people think or you’re worried about being exposed, you feel shame.** Therefore, you can get rid of shame by being radically honest and telling everyone exactly what you’re thinking at all times. For example, if you want to sleep with your wife’s sister, you should tell both your wife and her sister this. You can learn how to break news like this, or spill any of your secrets, by attending a Radical Honesty workshop.

To Ronson, the Radical Honesty method seemed to be mainly people yelling at each other, and sometimes this went quite badly. For example, after the workshop Ronson attended, one man tried to be honest with his wife and she tried to physically push him away. He responded by saying that he was going to get an ax and defend himself by killing her. Unsurprisingly, she called the police.

#### Approach #5: Apply for the Right to Be Forgotten

In 2006, the European Court of Justice ruled that **if an online text about someone was “inadequate, irrelevant...or excessive,” people could request that Google deindex the article or blog from its European sites.** This means that, in theory, you could ask Google to remove shameful information about you from its search indexes.

While this ruling did result in a lot of material being deindexed—within three months, 70,000 people made requests—it also brought some of the things that people wanted buried back into the spotlight. As Google met requests, it sent automatic notices to media outlets letting them know their articles had been deindexed, which created resistance to the ruling. People started bringing up old stories again so they couldn’t be forgotten.

#### Approach #6: Hire a Reputation Management Company

**Reputation management companies aim to hide shameful or damaging information about people by creating new online content that knocks undesirable content onto the second or third page of online search results.** According to Google, 53% of people don’t look past the first two search results and almost 90% of people don’t ever click past the first page.

##### Lindsay Stone

For example, after a photo of Lindsay Stone screaming beside a cemetery sign that read “Silence and Respect” went viral, she connected with a reputation management company called Reputation.com. The photo was Stone’s entire internet presence, and also the entire presence of anyone else with the same name. She couldn’t get a job or date because anyone who googled her would instantly find the photo and conclude that she was a bad person.

Reputation.com knocked the photo lower in the search results by making Stone new social media accounts (Twitter, LinkedIn, and Tumblr automatically show up high in the results because Google’s algorithm thinks these sites are popular). They wrote blog posts about travel, cats, top 40 music, and Stone’s other interests in her name.

**It took four months of reputation management for the photo to start fading.** When Stone googled herself, the photo showed up three or four times, but there were also lots of photos of Stone doing regular things, and photos of other Lindsey Stones. The reputation management process is ongoing, though, and Reputation.com calls Stone every week so she can approve Reputation.com’s latest content.
