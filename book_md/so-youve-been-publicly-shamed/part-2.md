## Part 2: Responding to Shamings | Chapter 4: Withdraw and Wait

In Part 1, we learned how shame works and how it’s used for punishment. In Part 2, we’ll look at how to respond and recover from public shamings. **(None of the approaches restore the victim’s life to what it was like before the shaming, and many of the solutions are fragile.)**

### Approach #1: Withdraw and Wait

Withdrawing includes shutting down social media accounts, refusing to give interviews, avoiding public places, and lying low until things blow over. **This is a popular approach, though it doesn’t work particularly well** —sometimes the shaming reincarnates when the shamee tries to return, and the shamee has to endure feelings of isolation while they’re withdrawing from public life.

### Extended Example #1: Johah Lehrer

On July 30, 2012, journalist Michael C. Moynihan broke the news that bestselling author Jonah Lehrer had made up some of the Bob Dylan quotes that appeared in his most recent book, _Imagine_. In response, Lehrer was publicly shamed.

Ronson interviewed Moynihan and Lehrer to find out how the events affected both of them. Initially, Ronson thought this case would set a positive precedent for future public shamings—powerful, fraudulent people who did bad things could actually be exposed and held accountable by the average person. As Ronson dug deeper into the story, however, he realized that **the consequences of public shaming could be permanent, and the experience was terrible for everyone involved.**

#### The Transgression: Literary Fraud

##### The Discovery

In July 2012, Michael C. Moynihan was working a ten-day blogging gig for _The Washington Post_. He was considering blogging about the differing opinions on self-plagiarism (reusing your own material) between the British and Americans—Americans considered self-plagiarism to be more of a crime. Writer Jonah Lehrer had been in the news about this at the time because he’d reused material from his columns for _The Wall Street Journal_ in columns for _The New Yorker_.

Lehrer was a hotshot academic, writer, and speaker. He had won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford and wrote his first book while he was still a graduate student. He made tens of thousands of dollars in speaker fees for inspirational keynotes at important conferences and was compared to Malcolm Gladwell. When Lehrer started a new job at _The New Yorker_ , it made the news.

Moynihan was curious about Lehrer and checked out his most recent book, _Imagine_ , which is about creativity. The first chapter is about Bob Dylan. **Moynihan knew a lot about Dylan and was suspicious of one of the quotes Lehrer attributed to him because usually, Dylan was rude to interviewers, but this particular quote sounded like a self-help book.** Moynihan was doubtful of a few other quotes as well.

##### Digging Deeper

Moynihan wrote Lehrer to ask him about the quotes. Lehrer responded that he was on vacation but would get back to him in eleven days once he had access to his notes again. (Moynihan thought this timing was suspiciously convenient because Moynihan had said his deadline was in ten days.) Lehrer did write, though, that he’d gotten access to some unreleased interview transcripts from one of Dylan’s managers, and that one of the transcripted interviews was in an expensive, multivolume anthology called _The Fiddler Now Upspoke_.

What**Lehrer didn’t tell Moynihan was that he hadn’t fact-checked his book.** He hadn’t completely made up the quotes, just embellished them—he’d changed the odd word or added a phrase—and he’d used them in part of his book proposal and never gone back to verify them. He was “too lazy” (fact-checking is a long, arduous process that sometimes makes the book less colorful) and “too stupid.”

Moynihan found one of the relevant Dylan interviews in _The Fiddler Now Upspoke_ and discovered that Dylan had never said the quote Lehrer had attributed to him. He also tracked down Dylan’s only manager, Jeff Rosen, who said he’d never spoken to Lehrer. Moynihan brought this up with Lehrer, who panicked. **Moynihan started to get uncomfortable at this point too—the detective work had been fun, but watching Lehrer panic was painful.**

Moynihan spoke with Lehrer’s literary agent, who told Moynihan that if he (Moynihan) published what he’d found out, Lehrer’s life would be ruined.

##### Exposure

**Moynihan sold the scoop on Lehrer’s false quotes to _Tablet_ , a small online magazine, for $2,200.** The night the story was due, Lehrer phoned him over and over again. **Moynihan seriously considered not publishing because though Lehrer was completely in the wrong and Moynihan in the right, Moynihan knew the story really would ruin Lehrer’s life.** By this point, however, Moynihan’s own career was at stake—one of his colleagues had found out he was writing about Lehrer, and both Moynihan’s editors and Lehrer’s literary agent knew about the story as well. If Moynihan _didn’t_ publish, everyone would think the literary agent had bullied him into a cover-up, and he’d never be able to get another writing gig. Moynihan hit send.

Just before the story went live, Moynihan and Lehrer had one final phone call. **Moynihan told Lehrer that he felt terrible, and Lehrer was unsympathetic, unapologetic, and icy.** After hanging up, Moynihan replayed the conversation and wondered if, at heart, Lehrer was devious and had just been trying to emotionally manipulate Moynihan this whole time. (Ronson wonders if Moynihan thought of Lehrer this way to make himself feel less bad.) **Lehrer’s life was going to get ugly, but the experience was traumatic for Moynihan too** —finding the story was an accident that could have destroyed his career, the stress was brutal, and he hardly even made much money.

#### Immediate Aftermath

The day Moynihan’s story was published, **Lehrer resigned from his job. His publisher offered refunds to everyone who had bought _Imagine_ and destroyed all unsold copies. Comments on the scandal popped up all over the internet,** both about Lehrer’s making up of the quotes and about Lehrer’s stonewalling of and lying to Moynihan.

The public shaming didn’t stop at internet comments, however. _Wired_ magazine, where Lehrer had previously worked, asked a journalism professor to look over Lehrer’s columns for journalistic misdeeds. He found some—Lehrer had plagiarized himself and others. (Moynihan was relieved to hear this—Lehrer really was sketchy.)

Lehrer disappeared. He refused to give interviews but did agree to talk to Ronson, though **he refused to talk about shame because it was so painful.** He also didn’t think he was a good candidate for inclusion in this book for three reasons:

  1. Americans want to read about happy endings, and **he was doomed.**
  2. He didn’t deserve to be portrayed kindly.
  3. Associating with him would endanger Ronson’s career.



Ronson didn’t quite know what to make of all this. **He thought Lehrer would be able to get past the scandal—the public wasn’t monstrous.** Ronson also didn’t expect that Lehrer could tank Ronson’s career, though he was a bit frightened that Lehrer believed this so strongly.

#### Lehrer’s Long-Term Consequences

##### Seven Months Post-Shaming

**After seven months, Lehrer decided to publicly apologize for all his misdeeds** during a keynote speech he was giving for an event with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The speech was broadcasted live and a live Twitter feed was projected onto a giant screen right behind the speakers’ heads.**** The speech and public response started well—Lehrer started by saying he’d committed plagiarism and lied to cover it up. He noted that he’d disappointed his readers and wasted their money. A tweet showed up behind him that commended his directness. **Ronson felt hopeful—people understood that seven months of shame was appropriate and now they’d lay off.**

In the next part of the speech, Lehrer spoke about neuroscience to try to explain how he’d made his mistakes. He took this approach because he’s a rational, scientific thinker and because a more emotional approach would have been too painful. **This came off as defensive and irrelevant and the live tweets accused him of being boring.**

**It got worse** when Lehrer brought up a quote from a behavioral economist about the human brain being a “confabulation machine.” The live tweets accused him of passing the buck, using bad science, and being a sociopath. **Twitter users wrote that they would never forgive him and he could never redeem himself.** When they learned that Lehrer had been paid $20,000 for the speech, they were even more brutal. Lehrer experienced a moment of emotional shut-down, one of the stronger phases of shame.

Moynihan didn’t think much of the apology either. He thought Lehrer had been robotic and insincere, and used his word choice to be as slippery as possible. Lehrer had said he lied to a journalist “called” Michael Moynihan, not “to journalist Moynihan,” which Moynihan found insulting.

##### Eleven Months Post-Shaming

**Four months after Lehrer apologized, he and his agent started pitching a new book about love.** The book proposal (which was immediately leaked) included a scene of Lehrer’s panic after his quote invention was found out. It described him so panicked that he puked into a recycling bin.

**Instead of realizing that Lehrer was suffering, people made fun of the excerpt,** calling for witnesses to verify that the puking really did occur. Daniel Engber, who works for _Slate_ , analyzed the proposal for plagiarism and found similarities between one of the chapters and an essay by one of Lehrer’s old colleagues at _The New Yorker_. Engber wasn’t sure if the similarities counted as plagiarism, but was convinced that even if Lehrer hadn’t actually plagiarised in this case, he’d do it again.

Ronson didn’t think people had given any thought to Lehrer’s well-being. **The collective power of shaming isn’t obvious to individuals, especially when the shaming is digital.** Ronson also thinks that people experienced cognitive dissonance—it’s uncomfortable to have contradictory ideas, so people justify their behavior by editing one of the ideas. In Lehrer’s case, they coded Lehrer’s emotional brokenness as robotic shamelessness, which made it okay to keep attacking him.

(Shortform note: Lehrer’s new book was eventually published to mixed reviews.)

#### Moynihan’s Long-Term Consequences

Moynihan also experienced consequences as a result of the shaming. **Other journalists were now frightened of him and someone he barely knew had confessed that he might have inadvertently plagiarized a biography.** Moynihan described himself as being cast as “head of a pitchfork mob” and was baffled and angry about it. He didn’t know why people were acting so cold and didn’t want anything to do with them.

### Extended Example #2: Justine Sacco

On December 20, 2013, PR manager Justine Sacco posted the following tweet before getting on an eleven-hour flight to Africa: “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!”

The tweet was supposed to be a comment on white privilege: white people have an easier time feeling like they’re immune to certain issues. However, people misunderstood it and thought Sacco was racist. She experienced a massive public shaming that lasted for months.

#### The Transgression: A Poorly Thought-Out Tweet

In December 2013, Sacco was traveling for the holidays. She tweeted caustic, clueless jokes about people on her flight and the cities she laid over in. Half an hour before getting on her flight to Africa, she posted her tweet about Africa. She didn’t get any responses before she got on the flight and was offline for the eleven hours she was in the air.

**One of Sacco’s 170 twitter followers sent the tweet to _Gawker_ journalist** Sam Biddle. Biddle thought the tweet was gold—usually, powerful people can get away with things that regular people can’t, but here was a PR chief being publicly and openly racist, and the internet had the opportunity to hold her accountable. Biddle and others retweeted Justine’s tweet, and **it tore around the internet, inspiring massive shaming.**

People assumed Sacco was a privileged, racist, spoiled brat because she shared a surname with Desmond Sacco, an African mining tycoon. In fact, she wasn’t related to Desmond and wasn’t rich or very privileged. However, she _seemed_ close enough, so people rewrote her identity. Likely, **many of the people who joined in the shaming thought that by calling her out, they were doing good.**

According to BuzzFeed, a hundred thousand tweets appeared in response to Sacco’s post. Some called Sacco racist, a bitch, or a cunt. (Many people find it most effective to shame people by calling for the worst things that could possibly happen to them, which for women tends to be sexaul assault because it’s massively degrading.) Her employer, IAC, tweeted that her comment was offensive and other employees tweeted about how they didn’t want to work with her. Many people tweeted about how she was going to feel when she turned on her phone and realized what was going on. Someone invented the hashtag #HasSaccoLandedYet.

**Biddle hadn’t expected such a response but he thought it was justified because Sacco was racist.** He also expected everyone would get over it eventually.

Ronson also encountered the tweet while Sacco was in the air and his first reaction was a little bit of glee that someone was “ _fucked_.” Shortly after, though, he wondered if Twitter was suffering from some sort of crowd theory because **though the tweet wasn’t a very good joke and was badly worded, it wasn’t actually racist.**

#### Immediate Aftermath

Sacco didn’t find out what was happening until she landed and her phone exploded. Some of the messages she received were sympathetic: Someone she’d known in high school texted her that they were sorry for what she was going through, and her best friend Hannah explained that she was the number-one trend worldwide. However, mainly, **the messages were shaming. One Twitter user even went to the airport to take a photo of her and tweeted it with a message about how she was wearing sunglasses to hide.**

Sacco issued an apology statement. It didn’t stop the shaming. She had to leave Africa early—her South African aunt told her she’d almost tarnished the family name and people who worked at hotels Sacco had reservations at threatened to go on strike. Her safety was in danger.

When Sacco got back to New York, the _New York Post_ followed her to the gym and other papers went through her Twitter feed to try to dig up more offensive posts.

Reporting about the tweet was cautious. **Writers acknowledged that lots of people write stupid things on Twitter that have the potential to be misinterpreted and blow up, but also made sure to not defend what Sacco had said.**

Google made money off Sacco’s ruin—Jonathan Hersh, an economics researcher, **conservatively estimates $120,000**. According to Google Adwords, in the two months before the tweet, Sacco was googled thirty times a month. Between December 20th and 31st 2013, she was googled over a million times, and Google makes money in ad revenue every time anyone searches for anything. (Even if no advertisers linked their product to Sacco’s name, it’s likely that people who wouldn’t have otherwise been using Google at the time searched for her and then rabbitholed to a site that did use Google’s advertising.)

#### Long-Term Consequences

In the wake of the shaming, Sacco was fired. She had loved her job and **felt like she’d lost her identity and purpose.** Her personal life was affected too—**she couldn’t date or meet new people because if anyone were to google her, they’d find evidence of the shaming and cut contact.** She cried often and struggled to sleep.

Like Lehrer, **Sacco didn’t want to talk to journalists—the experience was so harrowing that she didn’t want to relive it.** She also didn’t really want to be in Ronson’s book because this might open her to new criticism. However, she thought it was important that people see what had happened to her and how “crazy” her situation became, so she interviewed with him three weeks after the tweet went viral.

Sacco thought her situation was crazy because she thought it was obvious that she wasn’t being literal with her tweet. She didn’t understand how anyone could believe that anyone else _actually_ thought that white people didn’t get AIDS. **She was trying to make fun of the bubble white Americans live in and the fact that they aren't aware of serious situations elsewhere.**

Ronson thought the tweet was badly written, and because Sacco’s whole feed was acerbic, it wasn’t surprising that people had thought she was racist. On the other hand, **he thought that people must have realized what she was trying to say and had chosen to misunderstand her.** Ronson thinks that we use social media for drama since our regular lives tend to be plodding. On social media, everyone’s a flatter, less complicated version of themselves and can be easily slotted into hero or villain categories for our entertainment.

Sacco hoped that over time her situation would turn out differently from Lehrer’s because he had lied and comprised his integrity, but she had just done something stupid.

Almost immediately after the shaming, Sacco was offered a new job with a yachting company in Florida, which she thought was odd as she had no experience with yachts. **She was worried the company employed people who _actually_ thought white people couldn’t get AIDS and didn’t take the job.**

**After rejecting the job offer, Sacco went to Ethiopia for a month to volunteer** with an NGO that worked towards lowering maternal mortality rates. She enjoyed the experience, but it wasn’t her calling, and she returned to New York. She got some temporary work in PR, but her career hadn’t recovered.

(Shortform note: In 2018, Sacco got a new job with the company that had fired her for the tweet.)

### Extended Example #3: Adria Richards and Hank

Hank (pseudonym) and Adria Richards both suffered the consequences of public shaming as a result of the same incident—on March 18, 2013, Hank and his friend Alex made off-color jokes at a tech conference and Richards called them out on Twitter. Hank was fired. Then, Richards was attacked for getting him fired.

#### Hank’s Transgression: A Joke

In March 2013, Hank and his friend Alex were at the PyCon tech conference. During a presentation about initiatives to get more women into tech, a joke about a piece of hardware with a massive “dongle” popped into Hank’s head and he whispered it to Alex. Then Alex returned with another technological innuendo about “forking someone’s repo.”

Adria Richards was sitting in front of them and was offended by the jokes, especially given the speaker’s topic. **She took a photo of Hank and Alex and posted it to Twitter, explaining that the two men in the photo were making inappropriate comments.** She also tweeted her location for her safety—Hank and Alex were part of a crowd of mostly white males—and she was scared she might be hurt.

#### Hank’s Aftermath

##### Immediate Aftermath

Ten minutes later, a conference organizer collected Hank and Alex and told them someone had complained about their sexual comments. **Hank apologized and explained the joke, saying that they hadn’t meant for it to be sexual and were sorry for offending anyone who had overheard.** He and Alex were upset by the confrontation and left the conference early.

On their way home, they wondered how the conference organizers had heard about the joke, as the woman who’d taken the picture had been sitting in front of them the whole time. **Hank checked Twitter and found the tweet, but he was reassured by the fact that there were only a few comments on the photos, and one of Richards’s previous tweets was a stupid penis joke.**

The next day, Richards put up a blog post about the event. She wrote that Hank and Alex had felt protected by the anonymity of the crowd and were experiencing deindividuation (another example of the persistence of crowd theories).

Before Richards’s new blog post even went up, **Hank was fired.** He has a wife and three kids and was terrified. He was also upset because he liked his job. **He posted an apology on Hacker News,** a discussion board, writing that he didn’t mean to offend anyone or hurt Richards and that she had every right to report him.

In response to his post, Hank got messages from men’s rights bloggers, some offering support, some telling him he was weak for apologizing. Hank didn’t respond to any of them.

##### Long-Term Consequences

**Hank was able to quickly find a new job** and is more careful around female developers now, which isn’t too difficult as his new workplace doesn’t have any female developers.

#### Richards’s Transgression: Getting Hank Fired

Richards had never called for Hank to be fired (though she wasn’t sorry that he had been), but **it was her tweet and photo that got him in trouble, so people blamed her.**

#### Richards’s Aftermath

##### Immediate Aftermath

4chan, a discussion board that’s popular with trolls, started **shaming Richards, calling for her to be killed or raped.** Then, one person wrote that death and rape threats were feeding her cause—feminism—so it would be better to do something productive. **That something productive was attacking her employer’s website and servers and promising to stop the attack if Richards was fired.**

**The attack worked—Richards was fired only hours later.** The official reason was that her job was to unite communities, and instead, she was dividing them.

##### Long-Term Consequences

**Richards never completely recovered. She kept receiving threats even after she was fired and she had to drop off the face of the earth for half a year.** She slept on people’s couches, cried, journaled, and watched Netflix. When Ronson interviewed her for the book, she still didn’t have a new job. (Shortform note: The most recent information we could find about Richards is that she’s working as a freelance DevOps consultant and engineer.)

Hank doesn’t think she deserved any of these negative consequences.
