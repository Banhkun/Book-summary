## Chapter 7: Approach #4—Attend a Radical Honesty Workshop

The next approach to coping with shame is to be radically honest and tell everyone exactly what you’re thinking at all times. For example, if you want to sleep with your wife’s sister, you should tell both your wife and her sister this. You can learn how to break news like this, or spill any of your secrets, by attending a Radical Honesty workshop. **Psychotherapist Brad Blanton, who runs such workshops, believes shame thrives in secret—if you’re constantly worrying about what other people or you’re worried about being exposed, that’s when you feel shame.**

Ronson attended one of Blanton’s workshops, which starts with everyone in the room being asked to tell the group something they don’t want to share. Often, the group’s reaction is disappointment—**many of the secrets aren’t that scandalous or shameful, especially when considered within the context of all the secrets.** For example, after a man confessed to murdering someone, the woman who next said that her secrets were boring—all she did was have sex with her cat.

The workshop also includes roleplaying. **One participant sits in the Hot Seat and says (or shouts) whatever they’re really thinking and feeling, imagining that whoever’s making them feel shame is in the room.** Blanton believes that people get over conflicts by being honest and then sticking with each other until their resentment fades.

To Ronson, the Radical Honesty method seemed to be mainly people yelling at each other, and sometimes this went quite badly. For example, after the workshop, one man tried to be honest with his wife and she tried to physically push him away. He responded by saying that he was going to get an ax and defend himself by killing her. Unsurprisingly, she called the police, which endangered his job.
