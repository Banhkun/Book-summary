## Chapter 5: Approach #2—Write a New Narrative

The second approach you can take when suffering a shaming is to manipulate narratives. Before a public shaming, the victim has a rich and complex life story. During the shaming, the public reduces the victim’s identity to revolve entirely around their transgression. Instead of holding on to your life story,**create a private third narrative that explains the reasoning behind the transgression to reduce personal feelings of shame.**

### Extended Example: Mike Daisey

Like Jonah Lehrer, monologue writer and performer Mike Daisey committed literary fraud. He invented details in a non-fiction monologue about working conditions in Apple factories that he performed on the podcast _This American Life_ , among other venues.

Also like Lehrer, he was exposed by a journalist and publicly shamed, but instead of withdrawing, he created a new narrative.

#### The Transgression: Fictionalizing a Monologue

In 2010, **Daisey wrote a monologue about Apple factory workers he’d met in Shenzhen, China, and their terrible working conditions.** In the monologue, Daisey spoke about n-hexane, an iPhone screen cleaner that evaporates faster than alcohol but is toxic. People he met who were exposed to n-hexane had such shaky hands that they couldn’t pick up glasses. He also spoke about a man whose hand had been crushed in a press and a worker who was only thirteen.

In 2011, Ira Glass, the host of _This American Life_ , saw Daisey’s show and asked him if he’d like to tell the story on Glass’s podcast. **The podcast employees tried to fact check Daisey’s narrative, but Daisey told them his translator’s phone number didn’t work anymore. Since some of his other facts had been verified, they trusted him.**

**Daisey’s performance inspired change:**

  * 250,000 people signed a petition for better working conditions for Apple workers. 
  * Apple received so much pressure that it agreed to allow factory condition inspections by third parties.



**Rob Schmitz,_Marketplace’s_ Shanghai correspondent, was suspicious of parts of Daisey’s story. **Daisey said that he’d interviewed workers in Starbucks, which Schmitz thought was unlikely because Starbucks is very expensive and most workers couldn’t have afforded it.

Schmitz tracked down Daisey’s translator and**discovered that many of the events described in the monologue were inaccurate or completely untrue.** Daisey had only visited three plants, not ten as he’d claimed. Some of the stories he’d described were true, but he hadn’t actually talked to the people involved—n-hexane did make workers sick, but that had happened in a different town than the one Daisey had visited. Finally, some of the people he’d described didn’t exist, such as the man with the crushed hand.

On March 16, 2012, Glass invited Daisey back onto the podcast and asked him to explain. Daisey said that in a theatrical context, the truth means something different. **He ended the conversation by saying “I’m sorry” in a broken voice.**

**The interview was taped a week before it went live and that week was the most difficult for Daisey because the anticipation was terrifying.** He thought and talked about killing himself, never performing again, and getting a divorce from his wife.

#### Immediate Aftermath

Unlike Lehrer, **Daisey didn’t withdraw.** Just a few minutes after the interview went live, before the criticism had gotten momentum, Daisey apologized on his website. The next day he was active on Twitter and responding to his would-be shamers, calling them hypocrites. **Initially, his responses made them even angrier, but after some time, they realized he wasn’t going to back down and lost interest.**

#### Long-Term Consequences

Daisey didn’t experience the same professional consequences as Lehrer. Shortly after the shaming, he went on a theatrical tour that sold out. However, he did still experience feelings of shame. He felt the public wanted him to go down so they could use his story as entertainment or a cautionary tale, and he found that being treated like an object was worse than being hated.

In response, **Daisey created a new narrative—that he’d known in advance that if he went on the show someone would uncover his lies, but he decided to do it anyway because sacrificing his career was worth getting the story about the mistreatment of workers out.**

When Ronson asked whether he had worried that the lies would have downplayed the events in China, Daisy initially said he “would have” worried about that and then said he _did_ worry about that. **This correction suggests that he was continually editing his story.**

**This approach was likely idiosyncratic** —Daisey has a storytelling background, so creating new narratives comes naturally to him.
