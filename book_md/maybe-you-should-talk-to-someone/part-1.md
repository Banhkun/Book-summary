## Part 1: Lori’s Midlife Crisis

_Maybe You Should Talk to Someone_ is a memoir by Lori Gottlieb, a therapist and author. She tells the story of a bad breakup and the midlife crisis it led to.

After her breakup, Lori finds herself spiraling into depression and despair. She eventually seeks therapy herself, where she realizes that her issues are much deeper than the end of a relationship.

Though she thinks she’s just there for some crisis management to deal with the breakup, Lori eventually realizes that she’s facing several of the fundamental fears that all humans share: mortality, loneliness, freedom, and futility. **At the root of it all is uncertainty—Lori’s plan for the rest of her life has fallen apart. She doesn’t know what will happen next, and that terrifies her.**

Lori’s struggles are mirrored by those of some of her patients, whose stories and issues are interwoven with her own. In dealing with her patients, Lori gets insight into her own life. She brings many of these insights to her therapist, and together they are able to work through Lori’s problems and help her to accept uncertainty in life.

By the end, Lori is able to shift her perspective—instead of regarding uncertainty with dread, now she can regard it with hope. Instead of fearing what might go wrong, she can now look forward to what might go right.

### Therapists Are People Too

Many people don’t realize it, but therapists also go to therapy. It’s a requirement during training, but many continue to see other therapists while practicing. They will especially seek out help during difficult times in their lives, such as, in Lori’s case, a bad breakup.

A key point of this story is that therapists are humans too. **In fact, that’s one of the main reasons they can be effective: They go through many of the same struggles as their patients.** Therapists can use their shared experiences to forge meaningful connections with their patients. However, they must be careful what they share, so as to remain trustworthy and competent in the patient’s eyes.

Sharing too much, or the wrong thing, could make the patient lose faith in the therapist. Imagine if a therapist mentioned, for example, that she’d gotten a DUI; the patient’s view of the therapist would change, likely for the worse. On the other hand, in some situations, sharing that information could actually strengthen the relationship—say, if the patient is also struggling with alcoholism.

Whatever the case, the single most important thing for a therapist is to be honest. Even a little white lie can damage trust if discovered, and damaged trust is very hard to repair. However, when combined with the need to be seen as competent and collected, this means that therapists often find themselves toeing a difficult line when the conversation turns toward their own lives.

#### The Stigma of Mental Health

Unfortunately, there’s still a powerful stigma around mental health issues. For example, one of Lori’s colleagues lost a patient when that patient happened to see the colleague crying in Starbucks after getting some bad news. He didn’t feel comfortable seeing a therapist who had problems of her own, and he cut off their sessions.

As another example, Lori once had a husband and wife couple who were both hiding their antidepressants, because each didn’t want the other to know they were taking them. This phenomenon is almost unique to mental health issues like anxiety and depression—people don’t tend to hide other types of meds, or think less of people for taking them.

Because of that stigma, many people Lori meets outside the office become uncomfortable when they learn that she’s a therapist. She compares therapy to pornography: Both involve a type of exposure, both have the potential to be either exciting or uncomfortable, and both have millions of customers—many of whom hide the fact that they _are_ customers.

People also tend to be afraid that Lori will see through their defenses and expose their inner insecurities and vulnerabilities.**That concern isn’t entirely unfounded; breaking down people’s defenses and forcing them to examine themselves is the entire point of therapy.**

Many people believe that their problems are all because of circumstances or because of other people. It can be a useful defense mechanism; if their problems aren’t their fault, then there’s no need to change themselves. However, while it’s true that there are a lot of difficult people in the world, we cause our own problems far more often than we’d like to admit—something that’s true of Lori as well.

### Lives as Stories

**Lori acknowledges almost immediately that, as a writer and a human being, she can sometimes be an unreliable narrator who’s responsible for more of her own problems than she cares to admit.**

Lori speaks in terms of narrators and stories because she’s always had an interest in them. In fact, before becoming a therapist, she worked in movies and then the TV industry as a writer. When working on the medical drama _E.R.,_ she became fascinated by medical work, and she eventually quit her job to go to med school.

Lori knew she wanted to do something where she could form a real bond with her patients. Unfortunately, most medical fields had moved—or were in the process of moving—to a less personal, more “assembly-line” style of treatment. The focus was on maximizing how many patients doctors could see per day, rather than making meaningful connections with their clients. This growing disconnect between doctors and patients eventually led her to leave medical school as well.

Lori’s interest in people and their stories eventually led her to therapy work. The dean of Lori’s old medical school gave her the idea—Lori had originally called to float the idea of going into psychiatry, but the dean said that was a terrible idea. Lori wouldn’t be happy just prescribing pills to her patients, and going through medical school and residency as a new mother would be a nightmare.

(Shortform note: The nuances between psychiatry and psychology are often a matter of some confusion. The main difference is that psychiatrists are trained in how to use and prescribe various medications, while psychologists are focused entirely on talk therapy and similar treatments.)

Clinical psychology was the perfect opportunity for Lori to connect with and help people, while still leaving her time to spend with her young child. Being a therapist would also give her the flexibility to continue her writing career.

In fact, therapists are a bit like editors, helping patients to rewrite their stories. In that sense, it was a perfect match with Lori’s writing skills. Therapists look for important characters and recurring themes in patients’ lives. They help determine whether the “main character” (that is, the patient) is making progress or just spinning his or her wheels.

**There’s often some kind of grief at the heart of a patient’s issue, but there may be a lot of built-up stories to work through before finding it.** On top of that, people are often unreliable narrators—two people recounting the same event might tell wildly different stories.

For example, Lori tells people the story of her sociopathic ex-boyfriend who strung her along for two years, knowing the whole time that he didn’t want to live with a child. The boyfriend might have a very different take on the events. However, we never get to hear his side of the story, because Lori doesn’t know it either.

Even when the stories aren’t overtly biased, people are bound to forget or omit details that they deem unimportant or uncomfortable. Therefore, it’s also part of a therapist’s job to dig out those details.

### The Breakup

**The issue that drives a person to seek therapy is the _presenting problem_. **The presenting problem may be a major traumatic event, or simply a feeling that something is wrong. However, in therapy, the presenting problem is often a mask for a deeper issue, usually relating to grief, loss, or fear.

Lori has just broken up with her long-term boyfriend, whose name is not given. This is her presenting problem. The boyfriend left because of Lori’s 8-year-old son—his own kids will be moving out soon, and he doesn’t want to be tied down anymore once that happens.

He says he loves Lori and wants to be with her, but the kid is a deal-breaker. He thought he could come to terms with it, but after two years of dating, they were starting to talk about moving in together, and he realized that he didn’t want that.

Lori is reminded of patients who insist that they can only be happy in extremely specific scenarios, like if their dream job wasn’t quite so far away, or the person they’re madly in love with had a different career (or, in this case, didn’t have a kid). **Perfect can be the enemy of good—by waiting for this perfect scenario that will never happen, they’re denying themselves the happiness they could have had.**

As a therapist herself, one might expect Lori to immediately seek out help after this upsetting event. However, she tries to go on with life as normal—placing one foot in front of the other, as she often tells her patients to do.

Unfortunately, she’s not able to continue as normal. Two weeks later she’s suffering from forgetfulness and anxiety and obsessing over her now-ex boyfriend. One of Lori’s friends suggests that she should see a therapist, and Lori knows her friend is right.

However, finding the right therapist is tricky under normal circumstances and doubly so for another therapist. Many studies have shown that the single most important thing in treatment is how well you connect with your therapist; but therapists have to stringently avoid any conflicts between their personal and professional lives. That means that, in addition to finding somebody they “click” with, they also have to find someone they have no previous connection to. Not even a friend of a friend is acceptable—the two must be complete strangers.

Lori contacts a colleague—an associate, not a friend—to get a referral. She specifies, without saying that she’s the patient, that she wants a male therapist who’s married and has children. In short, she wants someone like her ex-boyfriend.

In Lori’s mind, if someone like that is as outraged by her ex’s decision as Lori is, it will prove that she’s “right” and he was “wrong.” In fact, Lori is quite certain her new therapist will confirm that her ex-boyfriend is a sociopath.

**After considering and rejecting a number of possible therapists, she settles on one named Wendell Bronson, who meets all of her criteria.** She makes an appointment with Wendell, saying that she just needs a few weeks of treatment for crisis management in order to get back on her feet.

### Welcome to Holland

**Many people’s lives don’t pan out the way they expected—an unexpected change in Lori’s life was the inciting incident for this entire book.**

_Welcome to Holland_ is a well-known essay about learning to be happy with what you have, even if it wasn’t what you expected. The premise is that a fictional person who was supposed to be going on vacation to Italy somehow wound up in Holland instead. That person now has two choices: either spend the whole vacation upset that Holland isn’t Italy, or explore and enjoy Holland for what it is.

One of Lori’s patients, Julie, was diagnosed with terminal cancer shortly after getting married. A friend of Julie’s sent her _Welcome to Holland_ in hopes of encouraging her to make the most of what she has. However, the essay enraged Julie, who demanded to know what good there could possibly be in her situation.

When Julie brings this up during treatment, Lori acknowledges that the friend was probably trying to help, but that Julie’s reaction to it is understandable and valid. **Later,_Welcome to Holland_ comes up again in Julie’s treatment, after she’s processed her anger about it. **

Julie now understands that almost nobody’s life goes exactly as planned, and there will always be people whose lives seem better—or worse—than one’s own. For example, the friend who sent her the essay in the first place has a severely autistic child. Taking care of the child has completely drained her friend both emotionally and financially. Julie isn’t sure whether she’d want to trade places with that friend.

With this new understanding and acceptance, Lori and Julie begin making her an “itinerary” for her time in “Holland.” They plan on Julie having 10 years to live, which they acknowledge is optimistic, but say they can adjust the schedule as needed. Julie starts making a bucket list—but not just to have one, as many people do. She makes a relatively short, attainable list of goals and immediately sets out to accomplish them.

Chronologically, this all happened before _Maybe You Should Talk to Someone_ began. However, after the breakup with her boyfriend, Lori begins thinking about the essay again. She has a similar reaction to Julie, wondering what good there could possibly be in being single—again—in her 40s.

At first, Lori feels guilty about comparing her situation to Julie’s, but she remembers that a key point in therapy is **you shouldn’t judge your pain based on the pain of others.** In other words, your pain isn’t invalid just because someone else has it worse. This also reflects Julie’s discussion about whether she’d want to trade places with her friend. Really, the question is irrelevant—Julie isn’t this other woman, and all she can do is deal with the life she has.

### Beginning Treatment

Lori has her first appointment with Wendell to start sorting out her own story. She finds that Wendell and his office are a bit strange: Perhaps oddest of all, his office doesn’t have the usual therapist’s chair, just two couches arranged in an L shape.

Lori sits as far from Wendell as possible, right at one tip of the L. She’s later surprised to learn that many people choose to sit right at the corner of the L, with Wendell just across from them (on the other couch).

Wendell doesn’t open with the usual questions, he just sits and waits for Lori to speak. **Like many patients, Lori tries to appear more in control than she is.** Patients are, of course, looking for help, but they also want people to think well of them, so they often try to hide their struggles. However, she soon breaks down and tells Wendell about the breakup while crying uncontrollably.

Lori is in her 40s now, and she’s lamenting the fact that half her life is over and she’s back to being single. While explaining what happened, she tries to cast her ex in the worst possible light. She explains all about his history of _avoidant behavior_ (trying to ignore problems instead of confronting them), and she repeatedly asks Wendell to confirm that what her ex had done was wrong.

Wendell doesn’t do this. Instead, he notes that it’s odd she knew so much about her ex’s patterns of avoidance and was still blindsided. **He also suggests that she may be grieving something bigger than simply a failed relationship.**

However, Lori isn’t ready to confront deeper issues yet. She goes back to talking about her ex. Wendell allows this, knowing that they have to build trust and understanding before they can address the underlying problems. Lori’s next several sessions go much the same way.

She’s contacted her ex several times looking for answers, and she comes to her therapy sessions with detailed notes about the conversations. She claims to be trying to understand how it had happened, what had led to the completely unexpected breakup.

During these sessions Lori barely gives Wendell a chance to speak. When he’s able to get a word in, he notes that Lori claims to want answers, but she keeps contacting the ex-boyfriend because she’s not getting the answers that she wants to hear. He also points out that if she’s taking such copious notes while talking to her ex, she can’t possibly be listening to him—and she’s not listening to Wendell, either.

#### The First Milestone

Finally, during one session Wendell interrupts Lori by kicking her foot. He jokingly says that since she seemed to be enjoying suffering so much, he thought he’d help with it. Later, in a more serious moment, he asks Lori to be kind to herself while she’s in his office.

**Eventually, Lori realizes that her behavior is a defense mechanism.** She wonders why she’s obsessing about her ex-boyfriend even though she knows it’s painful—what is she defending herself from?

She now recognizes that she’d also been using avoidant behavior herself during the relationship, ignoring a lot of clues that might have made the seemingly sudden breakup less shocking. For example, her ex frequently seemed annoyed by children in public places, would run errands rather than go with Lori to her son’s basketball games, and made his brother and sister-in-law stay at a hotel rather than bringing their kids to stay at his house.

Similarly, Lori now realizes that she’s been avoiding her real feelings about the breakup and her ex. She’s been saying that she isn’t mad, that she doesn’t want revenge, and that she doesn’t hate her ex. However, she now realizes that none of that’s true.

**She’s been trying to have the feelings she _thinks_ she should have, rather than the ones she’s actually experiencing. **Lori remembers that she frequently tells her own patients not to judge their feelings, but simply to notice them.

Lori now understands that she isn’t just mourning the end of a relationship, she’s mourning the loss of the future she thought they’d have together. She’s having such a hard time moving on because the loss of her boyfriend was really the loss of the life she’d planned. She’s also afraid that, at her age, she might never find another romantic partner. In losing her relationship, Lori is subconsciously feeling that she’s lost her last chance at a happy life with a loving husband.

**Now that Lori understands what her actual issues are, she and Wendell can begin working to correct them.**
