## Part 3: Hitting Rock Bottom

In this part of the book, Lori’s patients each deal with a crisis of some kind. The crises are necessary for their eventual recovery (or, in Julie’s case, making peace with her mortality). Meanwhile, Lori makes some significant breakthroughs in her own treatment and finds a way to move forward.

### Rita’s Emergency

**Rita calls Lori for an emergency session, where she admits that there actually is a man in her life—or there was, until recently.** A man named Myron had recently moved into her apartment complex, and the two had become close friends. However, the relationship had been completely platonic.

Right when Rita had been considering talking to Myron about romance, he had met someone else on Tinder. Rita stopped talking to him after that, and that was when she began therapy with Lori.

Myron’s Tinder relationship didn’t work out because he realized that he loved Rita and didn’t feel the same way about this new woman. He tried to rekindle his friendship with Rita, and he kissed her. Rita slapped him and ran away, then called Lori for this emergency session. Lori believes that Rita is afraid, or otherwise unable, to let herself hope she could be happy again.

In another session some time later, Rita repeats that her life is hopeless, and that it’s too late for her to change. **This is especially frustrating to Lori, who can see that Rita has been making great changes and progress lately.** However, people are often not accurate judges of their own lives.

After a near-collision in her apartment hallway while carrying art supplies, Rita became friends with the family across the hall and frequently joins them for dinner. The children were enthralled by Rita’s artwork, and the parents encouraged her to sell it. Myron had previously made Rita a website to display her work, and now this other family helped her add a store to it so she could sell her work.

#### A Life Sentence

In short, Rita has genuine connections, is making and selling art to people who appreciate it, and seems to have everything she claimed to want. However, she still seems to be in despair over her “wasted life.”

Lori wonders whether Rita is suffering from _cherophobia_ : the fear of joy. Rita confirms that she’s waiting for everything to go wrong, like it always does. She also believes that she deserves to be unhappy for all the mistakes she’s made with her own family: for being absent so much of the time and not protecting her children from their abusive father. Rita’s children have never forgiven her, and it seems clear that she hasn’t forgiven herself either.

**Lori muses that it’s possible to have compassion without forgiveness; to understand another’s pain without excusing what that pain made him or her do.** In fact, this is exactly what Lori needs to do with her ex-boyfriend—while she might never forgive him for breaking up with her so suddenly, she can understand and come to terms with it, even if only so she can move on with her own life.

Rita thinks if her new friends and fans knew who she _really_ was—that is, who Rita _thinks_ she is—they’d abandon her in disgust. Lori asks what Rita thinks an appropriate “sentence” would be for her “crimes,” and Rita answers that she deserves life in prison. Lori replies that that’s exactly what Rita’s giving herself.

However, unlike locking away dangerous criminals, Rita’s suffering only benefits one person: herself. If she convinces herself that she’s hopeless and deserves to suffer, that frees her from the need to examine herself and make real changes. **She has to first accept that she can be happy again, and even more importantly, that she _deserves_ to be happy again.**

> **The Eight Stages of Life**
> 
> In the mid 1900s, psychologist Erik Erikson developed eight stages of _psychosocial development_ : key points in a person’s life that have powerful impacts on the psyche and personality. **Each stage comes with a crisis that the person must face before moving on to the next.** For example, an infant is learning how to develop trust; the crisis for that stage of life is whether he or she is able to trust others or not. The eight stages are:
> 
>   1. Infant: trust vs. distrust—at this stage the infant is almost totally helpless and is completely dependent upon his or her caregivers. Whether those caregivers provide reliable and adequate care for the infant will have a large impact on his ability to trust people later in life.
> 
>   2. Toddler: independence vs. doubt—the child is beginning to discover his own abilities, but if overly criticized or coddled during this time, he may come to doubt his self-sufficiency.
> 
>   3. Preschooler: drive vs. guilt—the child will start interacting with others, inventing various forms of play and asking many questions. However, if these tendencies are repressed or if the child is treated as a nuisance, he may develop feelings of guilt around “bothering” others.
> 
>   4. School age: competence vs. incompetence—for perhaps the first time, the child's skills are being rigorously developed and tested in a controlled environment. His self-esteem will depend in large part on whether he is seen as competent, and encouraged or discouraged by peers and adults.
> 
>   5. Adolescent: identity vs. confusion—at this stage the child is starting to develop a sense of personal identity; who he is, what he wants to do, and how he views himself as a member of society. If he isn’t able to establish a clear role—such as a person who doesn’t know what he wants to do when he grows up—this can lead to confusion about his identity throughout his life.
> 
>   6. Young adult: intimacy vs. loneliness—the person is beginning to think about forming long-term, intimate bonds with people other than family members (not only romantic bonds, although those can be important as well). If the person shies away from commitment or fears intimacy, it can lead to an isolated and lonely life. (Shortform note: Lori is right around the end of this stage age-wise, so the breakdown she has after breaking up with her boyfriend may be her intimacy vs. loneliness crisis.)
> 
>   7. Middle age: creativity vs. stagnation—the person experiences a growing desire to leave something behind that will outlast him or her. This could be a great scientific discovery, a famous book, or even a child. Someone who doesn’t feel accomplished, or doesn’t believe that he’s left a mark on the world, may experience a lack of connection to or interest in the world around him.
> 
>   8. Old age: ego integrity vs. despair—as the end of life approaches, the person looks back at what he or she has done (or not done). Someone who is satisfied with his life will feel what Erikson calls _integrity_ : acceptance of his life as a whole, and a sense of completeness. This is often expressed as someone who has “done all he wanted to do.” On the other hand, someone like Rita who regrets her mistakes and doesn’t feel accomplished will feel bitterness and despair as the end of life draws nearer.
> 
> 

> 
> People around Rita’s age are generally in the final stage, torn between satisfaction at the lives they’ve lived and despair at the mistakes they’ve made. It remains to be seen whether Rita can move from despair to integrity.

### Charlotte’s Struggles

Charlotte has come to her last few sessions with a seemingly endless string of misfortunes. These ranged from having her wallet stolen, to dropping a weight on her foot, to getting into a fender bender while leaving work. Charlotte says she’s suffering from bad karma, but **Lori suspects she’s using all of these incidents to distract herself from her real problems.**

Charlotte keeps asking Lori what she should do about each of these situations, but therapists don’t tend to give that kind of advice. The problem with prescriptive advice is that, if it doesn’t work or doesn’t get the full results the patient wants, she can then blame the therapist for it. Not only is it helpful for patients to solve their own problems, but resentment toward one’s therapist could make further progress more difficult.

However, even though she knows all of that, Lori has asked Wendell similar questions during her own sessions. She subconsciously assumes Wendell is just a more competent person than she is, even though she has the background and experience to know that therapists aren’t “better” than other people.

A little later, Charlotte brings up the fact that a silly commercial about a dog driving her puppy around in a car made her cry. She cries again telling Lori about the commercial. This is especially exceptional because Charlotte displays _alexithymia_ : the inability to connect with and express her emotions.

**Between the endless requests for advice and her reaction to the commercial, Lori believes that Charlotte is trying to compensate for her inattentive parents.** Her parents were frequently absent, and they were drunk when they were around. Charlotte had to act like an adult too early, and she may be acting helpless now in order to experience the childhood she never had.

Two months pass, and Charlotte finally asks if Lori knows a good outpatient treatment program for alcohol abuse. She attends the program Lori recommends and stops drinking entirely during that time. There are noticeable improvements in Charlotte’s memory, energy, and motivation.

However, she is still struggling with relationships, most notably with a man she sits with in the waiting room. She’s been attracted to him for months, but he’s been stringing her along that whole time. He keeps breaking up and then reconnecting with his girlfriend, hurting Charlotte every time it happens.

During one session, Charlotte finally admits that he’s never going to change—and neither are her parents. Lori replies that they might not _want_ to change, and Charlotte won’t be able to force them to. She can’t control other people, only her own thoughts and actions.

Charlotte asks if she can change her appointment time to avoid sitting with this man. This is something Lori suggested a long time ago, but Charlotte wasn’t ready to act on it until now. **Overall, Charlotte shows remarkable improvement in this part of the book.**

> How People Change
> 
> Charlotte making this change—ironically, as a result of recognizing that the people around her would _never_ change—makes Lori think about the stages of change as laid out by psychologist James Prochaska in the 1980s. This model has five stages:
> 
>   1. Pre-contemplation: You’re not even thinking about making a change yet. This could also be seen as denial, refusing to even acknowledge that you have a problem.
> 
>   2. Contemplation: You now recognize that you have a problem and are—in theory—ready to do something about it. However, you haven’t yet started taking action. This is the stage when many people seek therapy, because they know that something’s wrong but feel powerless to change it on their own.
> 
>   3. Preparation: At this point you’re not yet ready to make the needed change, but you’re getting yourself ready to. This could mean researching how others have dealt with your situation, looking for support groups, or any number of ways that you could ready yourself for a major change.
> 
>   4. Action: The action stage is when you finally make the change you’ve been thinking about—quit drinking, start going to the gym, or what have you.
> 
>   5. Maintenance: The final stage is to maintain the change. This is more difficult than it sounds—there are plenty of triggers, or reminders of the old behavior, that may cause you to backslide. However, by this point you should have the proper tools and support to get back on track.
> 
> 

> 
> Interestingly, Charlotte went through this same process with her drinking. When she first came to Lori’s office she wouldn’t even admit that she had a drinking problem (pre-contemplation). After getting a DUI, she started thinking about making changes, but wasn’t ready to commit to an alcohol-free lifestyle (contemplation). However, after a while she started doing research on various methods of controlling or limiting her drinking, without having to give it up entirely (preparation). Eventually, she asked Lori to recommend a good treatment program (action). Now, she’s in the final stage of maintenance, which for her means staying sober.
> 
> As far as her tendency to fall for unavailable, hurtful men goes, **changing her therapy session to get away from the man in the lobby would seem to indicate that she’s moved into the fourth phase, action.** From here on, her therapy will be focused on the fifth stage, maintenance.

### Julie’s Progression

Julie’s cancer has continued to progress, and she may only have a year or so left to live. It’s spread throughout her body, and doctors have to keep removing parts of her to keep her alive a bit longer.

Julie compares this process to the kids’ game “Would You Rather?” wherein a person is presented with two unappealing options and has to pick one. **As a child, she broke the rules and chose neither. In fact, that was her high school yearbook quote: “I choose neither.”** Now, though, her choice is between losing more of her organs or dying. “Neither” isn’t an option. It becomes a question of how much of herself she’s willing to give up.

Julie’s disease is also taking a heavy toll on her husband Matt. She hadn’t thought about it until one night when he snapped that he wished they could have one night off from cancer. He immediately apologized and wished he could take it back, but the words were already out there. **Though it upset her at the time, more importantly this incident made Julie realize that she’s not the only one suffering, and that Matt will still be suffering after she’s gone.**

Julie says that she wants to help Matt find a new wife. She was inspired by a story from one of her cancer support groups of a woman who made her husband promise to go on one date with a close friend of his after the wife’s funeral. He did, and now the two are married.

Lori is initially surprised, and a bit repulsed, by the idea. She thinks it sounds like masochism on Julie’s part to help her husband meet another woman. However, she soon accepts that the idea is coming from a place of love, and that Julie just wants to make sure Matt will be okay. This isn’t the first time that Julie’s had an idea that sounds strange, but ends up being the best thing for her—remember her part-time job at Trader Joe’s.

In another session, Julie and Lori discuss all the best and worst responses that Julie’s had to her diagnosis. The worst come from well-meaning people who fall back on empty platitudes, like assuring her that there’s a reason behind everything, or assuring her that she’ll make it through when Julie knows full well that she won’t. **The best are the genuine responses, the ones that express support and love, even if the person doesn’t quite know what to say.**

Lori and Julie have also been working on her obituary together. After considering a lot of different options and what to say about the people she’s leaving behind, they settled on a simple message just saying that she was loved for every day of her life.

Despite her newfound spontaneity and appreciation for life, Julie still likes to make plans. **She is approaching the end of her life as prepared as possible, both emotionally and practically.**

### John’s Loss

A month after leaving therapy, John unexpectedly calls Lori back and makes an appointment. At that appointment, he finally tells Lori about Gabe, his son: **John reveals that Gabe died in a car accident when he was six.**

John had just landed his first major project at his TV studio, and he was constantly working even while at home. He called his cell phone a blessing, because it let him spend time with his family and still be in contact with his work. **However, John’s wife said that she didn’t _want_ him to be working while he was with his family. **The phone became a point of contention between them.

They went on a family vacation to Legoland, a three-day trip during which John promised he would only use his phone “if someone died.” He gave those same instructions to his coworkers: They were only to contact him if somebody died.

Two hours into the drive to Legoland, John’s phone rang. He asked if his wife would at least check who was calling, in case it was an actual emergency, but she angrily refused. Finally, John reached for the phone himself. During that short time, an SUV swerved into their lane and struck their car, killing Gabe. The rest of the family survived. The phone call turned out to be a wrong number. Incidentally, this background also helps explain why John was so angry about his daughter getting a phone.

John says that he came back to therapy because he had a dream that caused him to wake up screaming. This upset his wife, who went into the bathroom to cry. John, however, says that he can’t afford to do that—either wake up screaming or run away to cry. He feels that he needs to stay strong for his children.

Lori now understands why John is so emotionally unavailable. He’s spent years repressing his emotions, both about Gabe’s death and about his own mother’s death when he was six. **He also tries to force himself to believe that he can’t be hurt anymore because he’s somehow special and just surrounded by idiots.** This is effectively the opposite of Rita’s defense mechanism—she doesn’t need to change because she’s hopeless; he doesn’t need to change because he’s perfect.

Lori suggests that it might be healthier for the entire family if they were able to talk about Gabe and to grieve naturally. Even while protesting that he can’t afford to be a weepy basket case, John begins to cry.

He complains that this is exactly what he came to therapy to avoid: He didn’t want to break down. Lori suggests that instead of breaking down, perhaps he’s finally breaking open. **This is the most truthful John has been with himself—or anyone else—in years, and it’s an excellent step forward for him.**

### Lori’s Illness

Considering the need to be truthful with one’s therapist—and oneself—Lori reveals to Wendell that on top of everything else, she’s been suffering from a mysterious illness. This unknown disease causes painful rashes, fatigue, and muscle tremors and weakness. She’s visited numerous doctors, but none have been able to piece her symptoms together into a diagnosis. She calls her ongoing search for answers her “Medical Mystery Tour,” but even though she gave it a lighthearted name, she’s terrified of not knowing what’s wrong with her.

While discussing her illness, she also mentions that her ex had said on their first date that he’d stopped dating another woman because she was sick and he didn’t want to get stuck taking care of her. That was one major reason she had hidden her symptoms and her numerous tests from him—another example of Lori being in denial about their doomed relationship because if the disease progressed, then sooner or later it would become impossible to hide. If the boyfriend held true to his pattern, he would have abandoned her over the disease if he hadn’t left because of the child.

One specialist believed that Lori’s symptoms were the result of anxiety, a condition called _conversion disorder_ : so called because the patient’s anxiety is “converted” into physical symptoms. Conversion disorder is the modern name for hysteria, or any number of other absurd diagnoses given to women throughout history (such as “wandering uterus”).

Furthermore, many of her lab tests and scans came back with results that were not consistent with conversion disorder. Effectively, the doctor gave a diagnosis of “women are crazy,” and Lori was rightfully offended by it. However, at the same time, she’s trying not to admit to anyone—even herself—that something is really medically wrong with her, and she doesn’t know what.

**Lori has hidden her symptoms and testing from everyone, and she admits that she’s been in denial about the disease herself.**

### The Four Fundamental Concerns

When Lori tells Wendell about the disease that nobody’s been able to diagnose, he says that **what she’s really afraid of is uncertainty.** Since she doesn’t know what her disease is, she doesn’t know whether it’ll prove fatal, or what impacts it might have on her life going forward.

This uncertainty doesn’t just apply to her illness, but also to her fears that she won’t find a new partner, her anxiety about her writing career, and her advancing age. Wendell believes that Lori has been trying to cope with that uncertainty by sabotaging herself.

Wendell points out that she stayed in a relationship she knew was doomed, she is ignoring the book she should either write or break her contract for, and she has tried to hide her symptoms from everybody, even herself. Even though the situation she’s created isn’t the one she wants, it’s one that she has control of—at least for now. Eventually, of course, she’ll have to either write her book or cancel her contract, and the disease will progress however it does.

In addition to uncertainty, Lori is also dealing with several fundamental human concerns. **The four fundamental concerns all people share are mortality, loneliness, freedom, and futility.** The psychiatrist Irvin Yalom wrote about these in his book _Existential Psychotherapy._

Lori is concerned about death due to her illness and what she perceives as her advancing age. Yalom wrote that being aware of death, rather than trying to ignore its inevitability, helps people to live fuller, less anxious lives. **Lori sees Julie, the cancer patient, as an example of how to live fully while being aware of your own death.**

Lori’s ex distracted her from her fears about death, while also solving her concerns about loneliness, at least temporarily. However, ignoring one’s own mortality isn’t an effective way to cope with that anxiety. Now that her distraction is gone, Lori has to face this issue herself.

She also explains that she is concerned about her freedom. While she’s free in every practical sense, she misses the emotional freedom she had when she was younger. Children, for example, are completely free emotionally. They can laugh, cry, and scream without any concern for what others might think. **Lori says that her therapy—and the entire crisis she’s going through—may be about recapturing that emotional freedom, and opening up instead of shutting down.**

She comes to terms with the idea that uncertainty doesn’t have to mean hopelessness; instead, it can mean that there are possibilities she hasn’t considered yet. She doesn’t know what will happen next, or how much longer she has, but she is now determined to make the most of whatever’s left of her life.

**To do so, she now has to grapple with the last fundamental concern: futility.** Some time after this appointment, Lori finds her old grad school coursework, including her studies about the psychologist Viktor Frankl, whose work was all about how people’s primary drive was to find meaning in their lives.

The part that Lori finds especially relevant is Frankl’s discussion about how the only thing a person will always be able to choose is how to respond to his or her circumstances. There’s a time in between a stimulus and the response to it where a person is able to choose what that response will be.

Lori hasn’t thought about this concept in years, but she sees now how it applies to her and every one of her patients. **The trick is finding and using that in-between time to respond, instead of just react—to act deliberately instead of reflexively.** For John, this might mean responding to problems with compassion and patience instead of anger and insults. For Charlotte, it may be taking the time to recognize that she’s falling for yet another distant, unavailable man and is bound to get hurt again. For Lori, the trick may be to recognize that uncertainty also carries opportunity—she’s afraid of what might go wrong, but never stops to think about what might go right instead.

(Shortform note: For another powerful take on finding purpose in one’s life, read our summary of Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning _._)

### Today Only Happens Once

In between talking about her patients, Lori digresses to share some stories from her time as a therapy intern. **These stories are all about appreciating the moment, which is something Lori still struggles with.**

Lori and the other interns were always rushing to finish their internships as quickly as possible. They would try to take on more and more cases, even when their schedules were already full, just to get through the required number of hours more quickly. They’d also obsessively track those numbers and plot out how long it would take them to finish, and how old they’d be when it finally happened. Lori, who’d had two false starts to her career already (the TV industry and medical school), was in even more of a hurry than her classmates.

One day, one of the older supervisors overheard them talking about their hours and when they’d be finished with their internships. She told them, basically, that time would pass no matter what they did. What difference did it make _when_ they finished their hours? **No matter how hard they worked to get through their internships, they’d only get to live today once.** Her point was that they should enjoy what they have, instead of always racing toward something in the future.

It was a lesson that Lori never took to heart. Even after she finished her internship—which she did fairly quickly—and moved into her own office, she now felt pressured to start _enjoying_ her life as soon as possible. She’d found her calling later than she thought she “should have” and was in a hurry to get as much joy and satisfaction as possible out of the rest of her life. **Ironically, this pressure she put on herself actually _prevented_ her from enjoying what she had.**

Also on the topic of being present and enjoying the moment, Lori shares something she observed both in her patients and from people in general: They were always connected to their phones. As soon as they had a quiet moment where they would be alone with their thoughts, they immediately ran away from that feeling to take comfort in scrolling through social media or checking their emails.

It seemed to Lori that the 50 minutes her patients spent in her office, talking to her without any electronic distractions, was one of the few pure, human moments left in the modern world. Though Lori was at this point struggling to make her practice lucrative, she was totally unwilling to give that up in favor of online or over-the-phone counseling services. **That is perhaps the one way in which Lori has always lived in the moment.** However, that desire to be present and focused hasn’t bled into other aspects of her life yet.

Lori realizes this all ties back to what she said to Wendell in their first session together, that her life was already half-over. **She’s still feeling that same pressure to enjoy life now and, ironically, is totally unable to enjoy life because of it.** She’s not able to fully experience the moment because she’s constantly regretting her past decisions or worrying about her future, which from her perspective seems closer every day.

### Lori’s Freedom

The story now returns to the present day. In spite of—or perhaps because of—her unknown disease, Lori has recently started taking positive steps in her own life as well as helping her patients. She’s shared her condition with some of her friends as well as Wendell, **and she has learned to be okay with the uncertainty of it.** She’s also finally started working on the book she’s supposed to be writing. She’s about three-fourths of the way through writing the first draft.

While taking a break from writing, Lori realizes that she has an email from her ex-boyfriend. This is the first contact she’s had with him in eight months. She’s nervous to open the email, but for a very different reason than before. Rather than desperately hoping that he’s changed his mind and wants to get back together, she now knows beyond doubt that she’ll reject him if he tries. Though it’s an uncomfortable realization for Lori, and she’s afraid of the unpleasantness of rejecting him, this is proof that she’s moved on from the breakup.

The email ends up being inconsequential gossip about work. Lori is amused and somehow pleased by it. She notes that it’s textbook avoidant behavior; her ex is trying to act like nothing ever happened between them.

However, the trivial email causes Lori to have a revelation: She doesn’t want a meaningless relationship with her ex-boyfriend, and she doesn’t want to write a meaningless book. **If mortality and futility are two fundamental concerns that people have, it makes sense that Lori—who has no idea if her disease might prove fatal—doesn’t want to waste some of her unknown remaining time writing a book she doesn’t care about.**

She stops writing her book, and instead writes her truth: She wants to cancel the contract. She sends an email to her editor saying so. Even though she’ll have to pay back the advance she got on the contract, which was apparently significant (though we never learn the actual amount), the freedom she now feels is more than worth the money. Recall Wendell’s image of the cartoon character in the cage with no walls; Lori has finally stopped rattling the bars and walked around them instead.

Lori is feeling much better, but she’s thrown off when she gets to Wendell’s office for her appointment. Wendell has been away for a couple of weeks, and in that time the office has been completely redecorated. Wendell, too, looks different, sporting a beard and nicer clothes.

Lori finds him attractive, and for a while this makes her very uncomfortable. However, by the end of the session, she realizes it’s a sign of her improvement: She’s feeling attraction and interest again. In fact, she has a date scheduled for later that evening. **Like her patients, Lori is making significant progress.**
