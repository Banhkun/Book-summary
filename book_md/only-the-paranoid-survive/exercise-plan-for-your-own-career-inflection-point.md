## Exercise: Plan for Your Own Career Inflection Point

Grove talks about the importance of looking ahead and planning for market disruptions in your own career. In this exercise, weâ€™ll walk you through a guided reflection on preparing for your next career inflection point.

* * *

Choose an industry, either the one you currently work in, or one you would someday like to work in. Take some time to reflect on a trend that is changing the industry. What impact can you imagine this will have?

Speculate on who you think will be the winners and losers of this change. Which kinds of employees and/or companies will be in a better position to take advantage of this change? Who might be positioned to become less relevant in the industry?

Lastly, brainstorm a list of at least three things you could do to position yourself on the winning side of this trend before it hits. (Are there skills you would need to develop that will help you in the future? Is it time to start planning a career switch?) What can you do today that would put you in a better position for this transition?
