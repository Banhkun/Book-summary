## Exercise: Consider When and How to Strengthen Your Top Five Abilities

Pinpoint situations in which you can both build upon your top five abilities and use them in novel ways.

* * *

Now that you’ve reviewed all 34 abilities tested for in the Strengths Test, write down the five abilities you feel best describe you.

For each ability, briefly describe a specific situation in which you often use that ability and how you currently use it. This can be in the workplace, in the home, or in your social life. (For instance, you might use your logician ability to regularly conduct high-quality analyses of app performance at the tech company you work for.)

Now, write down briefly how you could use each ability _differently_ to excel in that situation. How else can you contribute your unique ability to the situation to improve it? What additional actions could you take to use your ability to its fullest? (For example, you might use your logician ability to explore and analyze why your company’s advertising is failing and share those findings with the marketing team to build better collateral.)

Finally, write down five situations in which you _don’t_ currently use each ability. Where in life do you rarely, if ever, use a certain ability? Now, as you did in the last question, jot down how you can use your ability to excel in that new situation. (For example, you might apply your logician ability to your personal life, implementing it at your regular book club to explore a claim made in a non-fiction book.)
