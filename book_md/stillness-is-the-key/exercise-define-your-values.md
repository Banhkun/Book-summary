## Exercise: Define Your Values

Holiday says cultivating virtue in yourself must begin with intentionally defining your values. Take some time to contemplate what’s truly important to you.

* * *

What makes life worth living, for you? List as many things as you can think of.

Looking at your list, identify the _values_ underlying those things that make life worth living. For example, if your list includes “raising my children,” the values underlying that might include love and loyalty to family.

Once you’ve defined your most important values, how can you reprioritize some of your time to better align with those values?
