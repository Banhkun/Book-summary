## Shortform Introduction

The story of _The Tattooist of Auschwitz_ is based on the accounts of the real-life survivor, Lali Sokolov, as told to the author 70 years after the events. The author has stated that 95% of the story is based on Lali’s retelling and the rest imagined as creative license. However, certain historical organizations have reported that many of the events described in the novel are inaccurate or outright impossible. Therefore, this story should be viewed as a dramatized account of the characters’ lives based more on memory than factual data and not be taken as a true historical account of what life at Auschwitz was like for the thousands of prisoners held there.

Finally, the novel is organized in several chapters of varying size that cover several different events. We have chosen to group the story according to main events and themes into fewer chapters for coherence.
