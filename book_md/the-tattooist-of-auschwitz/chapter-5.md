## Chapter 5: Back in the Saddle

Lale wakes up to a familiar, albeit undesirable, voice. Baretski stands above his bed, marveling that Lale is still alive. He’s never heard of anyone surviving the punishment blocks before. He also tells Lale that Schwarzhuber requested that Lale get his old job back. **Lale can’t believe it. Are they really letting him tattoo again?**

But it was true, and after making the long walk to Auschwitz, Lale rejoins Leon at their work table. Leon is so overjoyed, he spills a bottle of ink. The men celebrate Lale’s return for a few seconds more before Lale suggests they get back to work. He doesn’t need any trouble his first day back.

Lale’s first order of business as soon as he has a break is to see Gita. He waits outside the women’s compound at the end of the work day. When Gita and Dana see Lale, they throw their arms around him. Dana kisses Lale on the cheek and moves on to give the lovebirds some privacy. Gita can barely speak. His disappearance shook her to her core, and she is still wary about being too relieved. What if it happened again? But Lale assures her it won’t. He reiterates his promise to get them both out alive. Gita finally relaxes and says she trusts him.

On his way back to his room, two teenage boys ask if he can get them some extra food. Lale tells them those days are over, but when they show him a small diamond, he can’t resist. **He takes the diamond and wonders how much luck one person is allowed in life.**

Lale takes the diamond to Victor and Yuri the next morning. He says his business is on a smaller scale than before, but if they could bring a little extra food and some chocolate, he’d appreciate it. Victor and Yuri are happy to see Lale after his long absence. Yuri gives Lale a block of chocolate, and they agree to meet up again tomorrow.

Without a second thought, Lale takes the chocolate to Gita’s kapo. A moment later, Gita walks into her block to find Lale waiting for her. She finally asks what happened to him after he was taken away, but he won’t tell her. The only thing he’ll do is show her his back, now gashed with long welts from the whipping. **Gita kisses his wounds, and the two make love, savoring each moment together.** Lale has never felt anything so beautiful in his life.

### Disaster Strikes

It’s business as usual for Lale. Thousands of Jews are brought to the camps each week, and he and Leon have their hands full with work. He still sees Gita from time to time, but even when they aren’t together, Lale is always thinking of her. There is a strange sense of stability to Lale’s life. **With his work, his life with the Romany, and his relationship with Gita, he has as much of a normal routine as he can in the camp.**

But his world comes crashing down one night when he wakes up to shouting and barking dogs. Lale is stunned when he sees the Romany being forced out of the block. Thousands of them are forced onto trucks, even the children and elderly, and the ones who refuse to go are shot. Lale catches sight of Nadya. He rushes to her and asks her not to go, but she says she has no choice. She must stay with her people.

The trucks drive off, and Lale slinks against the wall. Eventually, he goes back to bed, but he can’t sleep. **Lale is depressed about the Romany being taken in a way he hasn’t been since arriving, not even when he thought he was going to die.** They were his family, and he suffers greatly.

The next day, Lale throws himself into work to distract his mind. Mengele is up to his regular routine of picking and choosing prisoners from the line of arrivals for whatever experiments he’s conducting. As always, he makes his way over to the tattooing station and hovers over Lale and Leon. Lale does his best to ignore Mengele’s leering, but then Mengele leans down and tells Lale again that one day he will take him. Maybe that day is today.

Lale holds it together long enough for Mengele to get bored and walk away, but then an ash lands on his hand. He looks to the sky and sees it filled with ashes bursting from one of the crematorium chimneys. Lale knows whose ashes those are and cracks. He drops his tool and begins to shake. Leon tries to calm him down, not knowing what is wrong. But it doesn’t work. Lale begins to weep and curses loudly.

Lale’s breakdown draws Mengele’s attention again. He comes back over and leans close to Lale’s face. He says maybe Lale should come to his examination room to be checked out. Lale mumbles that he’s fine without looking Mengele in the face. Suddenly, Mengele pulls out his pistol and points it at Lale. He says he should shoot Lale for his insolence. He tells Lale to look at him and places the pistol to Lale’s head. Begrudgingly, Lale raises his eyes to the doctor and apologizes. The doctor sneers and moves on.

### Uprising

Lale struggles for weeks to get over his sorrow about the murder of the Romany. Gita does what she can to help him, but she doesn’t know how. He doesn’t talk and has lost the playfulness he used to have with her. She understands how he feels, but she doesn’t feel the same level of despair. She never met the Romany because Lale won’t allow her to come to his block. Further, **after two and a half years of abuse and watching their people suffer incomprehensible horrors, she finds this first real display of emotion from Lale maddening**.

Gita accuses him of not caring about his own people. What about the thousands of Jews killed at Auschwitz? What about the women he saw abused by Mengele? Lale realizes that because of his job, he has only seen most people as numbers, not humans. But Gita has to process the paperwork of the new arrivals. She sees their names, ages, and family details, which makes them real to her. He apologizes for his insensitivity and promises to do better.

Just as Lale is about to kiss Gita, an explosion sounds. They jump up from their secret spot and run to the courtyard. **Another explosion booms, and they see that one of the crematoriums is destroyed.** People are running everywhere, and the crematorium workers flee the building. On top of the roof, one of the workers has a gun and is shooting at the SS below. He is quickly taken down by return fire.

Chaos ensues. Bullets fly, and the SS seem to be shooting anything that moves. Lale grabs Gita’s hand and pulls her against a wall. Another crematorium explodes. A voice comes over the camp speaker and informs the prisoners that they will be allowed to return to their blocks without incident if they go now. Lale tells Gita to hurry to her block, but she wants to stay with him. He says she can’t. She needs to get back to her group and go on with business as usual. She can’t make herself a target. She must stay alive.

That night, Lale decides to become acquainted with the Hungarian Jews who have replaced the Romany in his block. Up to now, he’s avoided them, but he’s eager to learn anything he can about the uprising. The Hungarians tell him that several women working in ammunitions started smuggling gun powder under their fingernails. They also stole several weapons and grenades. The gunpowder was used to make homemade bombs from sardine cans.

**The uprising was in response to rumors that the Russians were about to liberate the camp** , and the prisoners wanted to help. That didn’t happen, but there is still hope that the Russians are on their way. Lale can’t believe it. He hasn’t seen any sign of help since the Americans flew over months ago. But this news gives him hope. Could this nightmare really be over soon?

### The End of Auschwitz

Months go by with no sign of the Russians. A cold fall turns into a colder winter. The year changes to 1945, and the prisoners struggle as another dire year of life at the camp looms before them. **The never-ending stream of new arrivals ceases, and Lale and the crematorium workers find themselves without work.**

Victor and Yuri, as well as their crew, no longer come to the camp. Nothing new is built. In fact, the Germans have started shipping prisoners out of Auschwitz-Birkenau. No one is sure where they’re headed. Gita and Cilka are in charge of processing the paperwork, but it doesn’t state the destination.

Not long after, Baretski tells Lale that Leon is no longer at the camp. Lale demands to know what happened to him, but Baretski warns that if Lale keeps up the questions, he could find himself in the same boat. Leon’s disappearance does something to Lale. **He feels a new fighting spirit enter him, and he tells Baretski that he looks forward to watching Baretski’s world crumble around him.** Baretski grips his holster and tells Lale to get inside where it’s warm. The cold is clouding his judgment.

A few weeks later, Gita dashes to Lale’s block in the snow. She tells him that the SS are running around in a panic at the administration building destroying documents. Lale tells Gita to find her friends and stay in the block, then he runs to the building to investigate. He runs into a female SS worker and finds out that the Germans are going to empty the camp starting tomorrow. The Russians are getting closer.

Lale rushes to Gita’s block with this news. He walks right in, her kapo nowhere to be found. He finds the women huddled with fear. He tells them the news and says they should stay in their block until further notice. Before he leaves, he delivers personal messages to each of Gita’s friends. He thanks Dana for helping to keep Gita alive all the times when she was ready to give up. He thanks Cilka for her help and tells her she is the strongest person he knows. **When he turns to Gita, she refuses to let him speak. He will not say goodbye to her, she says. She’ll see him tomorrow, period.**

As Lale leaves the block, he looks at the group of women. All young, all taken when they were barely women. Their futures, once full of promise and hope, have been taken. Even if they are set free, they will never be able to lead a normal life. He wishes them well and leaves.

### The Road Out

The commotion at the camp dies down, and Lale is able to fall asleep. But he wakes up in the middle of the night to gunshots and loud voices. **He walks outside and sees thousands of women lined up in rows awaiting a fate no one seems to have any information about, not even the SS.** It’s pandemonium. Lale rushes through the rows searching for Gita. At last, he sees her near the main gate. Only Dana is with her, and they’re both crying.

Dana sees Lale first, and the two women move back in the line to try to get closer. Lale and Gita lock eyes across the yard. He wants to run to her, but an officer smacks him with a rifle across the face. Blood spurts from a large cut on his forehead, but he manages to stand. He pushes forward and screams Gita’s name. Somehow, amid the shouting and barking, he hears her call to him. She shouts her name, revealing her last name for the first time—Gita Furman. **Lale watches his love get swept out with the rest of the women and stands helpless as the gate closes behind them.**

The next morning, the chaos from the night before has bled into another day. The gate is open, and prisoners seem to stumble through, unsure of what to do. The guards are too crazed with panic to notice or care. Lale moves through the gate and sees a train idling down the road. A sea of men are pushed toward it, and Lale can’t get out of the way fast enough. He is shoved into a car, and the door closes. He peers through a crack and sees the remaining prisoners dropping to the ground as bullets fly from SS guns. The train begins to move, and through the falling snow, Lale watches Auschwitz-Birkenau get smaller and smaller until they’re gone.

Farther down the road, Gita, Dana, and the other women march through a thick layer of snow. The two search through the crowd for Ivana and Cilka, but they don’t see them. They march for hours, and many of the women succumb to exhaustion or the cold. When they fall, they’re shot. The group shrinks in size as another full day of marching comes and goes. Finally, Dana can go on no longer. She falls, and Gita tries desperately to pull her up, but it’s no use. **Dana urges Gita to go on without her, but Gita doesn’t move until four girls pull her away.** She waits for the shot to sound behind her, but she doesn’t hear it. A small moment of mercy.

Finally, the women make it to a train station, where several cattle wagons wait to be loaded. Across the field is an old farmhouse, and the girls, who Gita has learned are not Jewish but Polish, decide to make a run for it, and Gita joins them. The guards are so busy herding the women onto the train that they don’t notice Gita and the girls running off across the field. The door to the farmhouse opens as they approach, and suddenly they are on the floor in front of a fire. The owners give them bread and warm beverages and listen to their harrowing tale. The husband says they can’t stay with them because their house is often searched, but he gives them the address of a relative in a nearby town. That night, the girls sleep in a pile on the frozen forest floor, hoping they make it through the night.
