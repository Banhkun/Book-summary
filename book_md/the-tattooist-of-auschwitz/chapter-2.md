## Chapter 2: The Chosen One

Pepan takes Lale to the main compound the next morning, where new prisoners are unloaded. Lale freezes when he sees the hundreds of men, all young and frightened, surrounded by the SS and dogs, both chomping at the bit to tear these men apart. Pepan guides him to the table where the tattooing equipment is laid out.

An older immaculately dressed officer, Officer Houstek, approaches with an entourage of younger officers. Houstek’s attire and demeanor remind Lale of the rich men he used to dress at a department store in Bratislava. Pepan introduces Lale as his new helper. **Houstek looks at Lale with a steely gaze and asks how many languages he speaks. Lale rattles off Slovak, German, Russian, French, Hungarian, and Polish, all while holding the officer’s eyes.**

The officer grunts and walks away, but Pepan is livid. He tells Lale never to look that man in the eye and never underestimate the power he holds in the camp. Lale understands and again admonishes himself for his brazenness.

Weeks go by, with Lale working diligently next to Pepan. He has tattooed hundreds of prisoners, both men and women, including the woman from the Prologue, who stole his heart. One day, Lale shows up to work and finds the table and equipment set up, but Pepan is not there. The new arrivals start to line up, and Lale grows anxious. Houstek is suddenly in front of him with an SS officer, Officer Baretski. Lale keeps his eyes low as Houstek says he’ll be tattooing alone that day. There is no mention of Pepan, and Lale receives no answer when he asks.

Lale is now the new tattooist, and Baretski is his new direct supervisor. Their fates are now entwined, Baretski tells Lale, and he knows Lale will not do anything to embarrass or endanger him. **As a perk of the job, Lale will be moved to a new room. He is now part of the political branch of the SS and needs to be isolated for protection.**

Lale isn’t sure what to say, but he doesn’t want to do the job alone. He convinces Baretski to give him an assistant to make the work go faster and keep Houstek happy. Baretski pulls a random man from the line and tells him he is now Lale’s assistant. Lale looks at the young man, Leon, and delivers the same speech Pepan gave him. If he worked hard, it could save his life.

### A New Vocation in a Dark World

The tattooist job comes with other perks, not all of which Lale is happy about. His new room is the kapo’s quarters of an empty block near the construction zone. Stretching out in bed for the first time in months is a treat, but Lale misses the camaraderie of the men in Block 7. He also gets to take his meals in the administration building. The food is better than the prisoner slop, and he is offered a second portion as soon as he devours the first. **Extra rations are allowed for political workers, so he takes a hunk of bread and hides it in his sleeve.** Later, he gives the bread to Leon in Block 7 and promises to bring more for Leon and the others when he can.

Lale tells Leon to keep his extra rations a secret in case he isn’t able to come through. He also feels a bit nervous about his new status. He’s now living like a king, relatively speaking, and people may try to befriend him for the wrong reasons. He also knows that the others may resent him for associating with the Germans. He’s almost sure he heard one of the men in Block 7 call him a collaborator when he visited Leon. **He feels alone on his island, but he is protected now. And that is no small thing.**

Baretski instructs Lale to get his assignments daily from the clerk in the administration building. He can also get whatever supplies he needs for the work. The clerk tells Lale to always carry his supply bag with him and say that he is with the political department if anyone asks. No one will bother him if he does these things. Baretski seconds the clerk’s remarks but makes it clear that he won’t hesitate to kill Lale if he messes up.

Prisoners are pumped into the camp at all hours, and Lale and Leon work through the night at times. Baretski also has to stay up to supervise them, and he takes his frustrations out on Leon. Lale never reacts, learning that the abuse gets worse if he tries to intervene. But one day, Leon drops his needle after a boy screams during his tattoo, and Baretski knocks him to the ground with his rifle. He stands on Leon’s back, pressing him into the ground. Lale can’t stay silent.

Lale says as casually as possible that he needs the manpower to get the work done. Before Baretski can reply, Houstek appears and whispers something to Baretski, then moves on. Baretski removes his boot and Leon gets up. **Baretski tells Lale he is lucky he told Houstek about his language abilities. He has wormed his way into Houstek’s good graces and is now protected.** Baretski suggests he and Lale become friends in the hopes of benefitting from Lale’s new powerful connection.

### A Sunday Kind of Love

Sundays are the prisoners’ day off at the camp, and the men and women gather in the yard in groups. Lale is usually one of those men, but one Sunday, he stumbles across the young woman he tattooed who caused his heart to skip a beat. Like before, their eyes lock, and he feels the breath leave his body. They hold each other’s gaze until Baretski interrupts.

The girl’s companions scatter, but she doesn’t move, seemingly as transfixed by Lale as he is by her. Baretski quickly notices and begins to tease Lale. **He says he’ll get him some paper and a pencil so Lale can write her a note, but Lale doesn’t respond. Paper and a pencil are contraband.** They both know what will happen if he is caught.

Baretski takes Lale to the main compound of Auschwitz for a special work assignment. He is extra talkative today and asks Lale how old he is and where he’s from. Lale answers to appease Baretski and asks him similar questions. Once he sees that Baretski enjoys talking about himself more than listening, Lale keeps it up. He learns that Baretski is from Romania, not Germany, and his town is only 100 miles from Lale’s. His father was abusive, and he has two sisters still at home. He left home at a young age to become one of Hitler’s youth, and the rest is history.

Baretski is one year younger than Lale, but his personality is more like a teenager. He talks about girls in crude ways and knows nothing about matters of the heart. Lale tries to give him advice on how to treat a woman, seeing an opportunity to get on Baretski’s good side. But Baretski scoffs. He would never consider giving a woman flowers or asking her questions about herself. Still, Lale feels less wary of Baretski after this conversation and accepts the offer of paper and pen.

That night, **Lale writes the girl a message. He tells her his name, where he’s from, and that he wants to meet her Sunday in the yard**. Baretski reads the letter and makes fun of Lale for not being more forward. He brags about what he would say, especially if he didn’t know how much longer he’d be alive, like Lale. Despite these insults, he takes the letter and promises to deliver it.

The next day, Baretski delivers the girl’s response to Lale. She writes that she is also from Slovakia and was brought to the camp a few weeks before Lale. She works in the warehouse sorting through the prisoner’s possessions. But she doesn’t tell him her name, which drives Lale crazy with desire.

Sunday comes, and Lale rushes through breakfast. He shoves half of his bread up his sleeve to give to this girl when they meet. For a long time, he looks for the girl but doesn’t see her. Then, he spots her with a group of friends. Like the teenagers they are, the girl’s friends giggle at the sight of Lale. Lale gives her the bread and asks her name. One of her friends tells him it’s Gita, then whisks her away. It isn’t the meeting he imagined, but at least he gets her name.

**In the privacy of the women’s barracks, Gita reads Lale’s note again and again and gossips with her friends.** The next Sunday, she searches for Lale in the yard. She’s distraught that she can’t find him, but suddenly, he swoops in from behind and grabs her hand. Gita’s friends giggle when he pulls her away and takes her behind the administration building. They sit against the wall, and Gita asks if they’re safe. Lale doubts it, but he had to be close to her.

Their conversation is light. They joke about how their days are going, giving answers that would have been true back in the real world. Their hands drift closer and touch. Lale says he wants to know everything about her, but she says there is nothing to know except what her number is in the camp. For her, the outside world doesn’t exist anymore. But he does learn that she works in one of the warehouses where they take the confiscated possessions from the Jews. Lale says he’s heard they find jewels and cash sometimes. But Gita says all she finds is moldy food.

When the siren blares, signaling the end of “free” time, Lale helps Gita to her feet. He says he will bring her food next time. He also tells her to be careful at her job and always be on the lookout for the SS. **They stare into each other’s eyes for longer than is safe, then walk back to join the others.**

### The Cost of Living

Summer turns to fall, and the days grow shorter as winter approaches. All this time, **Lale has continued to be curious about the men working in civilian clothes. With the protection his tool bag provides, he decides it’s safe to ask them**. He approaches two workers, a father and son, laying bricks for a new building. Without looking at them, Lale asks why they aren’t branded with a star and in uniforms like everyone else. At first, the son, Yuri, tells Lale to mind his own business. But the father, Victor, admonishes his son for his rudeness. Victor explains that they live in town and come here to work. They’re paid for their labor and allowed to return home in the evenings.

Lale can’t believe that anyone would choose to work in the camps. He tells them that he is the tattooist, and Victor looks regretful when he says it must be a busy job and that it’s about to get busier. The building they’re constructing is slated to be Crematorium One. Lale doesn’t miss the suggestion that there will be a Crematorium Two.

Victor offers Lale a piece of hard sausage from his lunch. Yuri throws a fit and tries to stop him, but Victor reminds him that they have plenty where they live. **He tells Lale to come back the next day, and he’ll try to bring more. If they can help even one prisoner, they’ll do it.** Lale gets an idea. He asks if he can find a way to pay Victor, can he get some chocolate. Lale wants it to give to Gita, like he would in the real world. Victor says he’ll try. Lale walks away as snow begins to fall.

In his room, Lale becomes overwhelmed with emotion at the news of the crematoriums. But there is no time for emotions. There is work to do. He divides the sausage into small strips and wraps them in waxed paper. He looks at his fingers—soiled, thin, and calloused, not like the smooth, clean, and fleshy hands that once held rich foods at bountiful tables. How long ago that seems.

Lale takes the bits of sausage to one of the confiscated possessions warehouses, but not the one Gita works in. **He stops two girls leaving work and offers them the sausage. He says he’ll bring more if they’ll smuggle some jewelry out for him** , and the girls agree. He reminds them not to tell anyone about their agreement or where they got the food. Their lives depend on it.

The next day, Lale tells Victor he isn’t able to pay him yet but will be soon. Victor doesn’t mind. He has plenty to share. Yuri is also friendly this time and shakes Lale’s hand with a smile. Apparently, he received a talking-to about manners from his mother. Victor gives Lale two packages, one full of sausage, and the other full of chocolate.

Lale performs the same dissection and takes the wrapped pieces to the girls. He gives the girls extra to share with others, and they drop four bundles into his bag. The bundles contain cash, diamonds, rubies, and several rings. When Lale sees these items back in his room, he feels grief for the people who once loved these valuables. He also feels fear. **The extra food was already risky, but getting caught with jewels means certain death.**

He shoves the packages under his mattress and takes one ruby and a ring to Victor the next day. Lale passes the jewels through a handshake, and Victor drops the food into Lale’s open bag. Their business relationship is now official. Before Lale leaves, Victor tells him Happy New Year. It is now 1943.

### Circle of Friends

As the winter of 1943 progresses, Lale’s relationships with both Victor and Gita grow stronger. **Lale and Gita continue to meet on Sundays, but keeping their interactions secret gets harder because of the snow and cold.** Many prisoners choose to stay in the barracks because of the bitter winter. Still, a stolen glance or passing touch of hands sustains them.

One Sunday, Lale can’t find Gita. He circles the yard, but when he doesn’t see her or her friends, he risks punishment by moving closer to the women’s camp. Suddenly, Gita’s friend Dana appears outside their block. She tells Lale that Gita has typhus and is very sick. The kapo wants to transfer her to the hospital, but Lale’s seen what happens to people at the hospital at the hands of the doctors and fears for Gita. He tells Dana to help Gita go to work each day and pretend that everything is fine until he can get some medicine.

The next morning, **Lale takes all the bounty he’s collected, a small fortune, and gives it to Victor in exchange for penicillin**. Victor agrees to bring some the next day. Afterward, Lale and Leon go to work. Lale tries to focus on tattooing the newcomers, but he’s consumed with worry about Gita’s health and future at the camp.

As soon as the last person is tattooed, Lale packs up and hurries toward Gita’s block. Dana tells him they were successful in getting her to work and keeping her hydrated. Lale gives Dana all of his breakfast rations and says he’ll have medicine soon. He doesn’t have to wait long. Victor brings him a small vial of penicillin the next day, along with the usual food packages.

A couple days later, Lale is relieved to see Dana and their other friend Ivana carrying a slightly improved Gita to work. The medicine has started to work already. Lale wants to make sure Gita never gets sick again, so he goes to Baretski and does something he never thought he’d do—asks for a favor. **Lale asks for Gita to be transferred to work in the administration office, where there is heat.** Baretski says he’ll try and finds great enjoyment in telling Lale that this favor will need to be returned in the future.

Gita recovers and is able to walk in the yard again. Lale continues to give her extra food to help her regain her strength. He doesn’t tell her about the favor, not knowing whether Baretski will be able to pull it off. So Gita is surprised the next day when she is called to the office. Fear overtakes her. Do they think she is too weak to work? What will become of her? Then, she is taken to a desk and told to learn her new duties from Cilka, another Jewish woman who has somehow managed to keep her beautiful long brown hair. When Gita sees Lale enter the office to receive his duties and receives a wink, she realizes he’s responsible for her new position.

### Love and Hate

Over the next few weeks, Lale and Leon are overwhelmed with work. The prisoners get shipped in faster than ever when the Germans start cleansing more of Europe of Jews. Now, French, Greek, and Italian Jews, among others, join those from Poland, Germany, and the surrounding regions at the camp. With so much work, Lale is unable to keep up his appointments with either the warehouse girls or Victor. He takes bathroom breaks just so he can retrieve the items the girls have smuggled out. But without his ability to trade with Victor, the collection under his mattress grows larger.

**The increase in prisoners has also required Lale and Leon to work on Sundays. Five Sundays come and go before Lale is able to see Gita again.** When they finally reunite, Lale takes Gita to their spot behind the administration building. He tells her to close her eyes and open her mouth. When she does, he teases her with a piece of chocolate before dropping a chunk on her tongue. Gita opens her eyes and savors this luscious treat. She takes a piece and does the same thing to Lale, teasing him first before dropping the chocolate in his mouth. They share a passionate, chocolaty kiss, and Lale cries with joy.

Lale confesses his arrangement with the warehouse girls and Victor. This action is a testament to his feelings for Gita. Entrusting her with this dangerous information is the same as entrusting her with his life. He gives her the rest of the chocolate to share with her friends and says he’ll bring more. They walk back hand-in-hand as far into the yard as they can before parting ways without a second glance. **Lale hates leaving her so informally, but it’s too risky to be seen together, a fact hammered home when he sees Baretski watching them.**

After Gita leaves, Baretski marches up and says Lale is needed in Auschwitz. Something is off about him, and Lale feels uneasy. As the two walk the few miles to Auschwitz, SS officers say hello to Baretski, but he ignores them. When they come upon three prisoners hunched together on the ground, Baretski wastes no time in shooting them. Lale is stunned. This unprovoked killing is something he hasn’t seen since that first night when he got up to use the bathroom. He doesn’t know what’s wrong with Baretski, but he doesn’t want to be next. He follows along dutifully, cursing God.
