## Chapter 1: Spring 1942—Becoming 32407

The cattle car surges through the countryside, one of many in a long line. **Lale Eisenberg is among hundreds of men shoved into the train wagons normally used to transport cattle.** There are too many heads to count, and they’re packed in so tightly that they can’t even sit. Lale has been fortunate to get a wall spot where a slight breeze trickles in through the wooden slats. It’s enough to partially relieve the stench of his filthy hair and skin and that of the others.

In this 10-foot-wide train car, a man sleeps against Lale’s shoulders. The other men don’t like Lale much. He’s dressed in a suit, tie, and pressed white shirt, his normal attire for travel. And why not? He’s on his way to work for the Germans. That’s the deal he made to keep his family safe back home in Krompachy, Slovakia, and he always dresses to impress. He has one suitcase and a little money stashed in his jacket pocket. He hopes he can buy his way into a better, higher-ranking work duty. He hopes his four languages will make him valuable.

People keep asking him where they’re headed. He assumes it’s because he’s dressed so well, but he doesn’t know why they’re asking him or where they’re headed. **All he knows is that he’s been on this train for three days, and he’s as confused and scared as everyone else, even if he doesn’t show it.** Lale tries to answer with something encouraging. A young man suddenly pushes his way through the stacked men and asks Lale why he’s so calm. His name is Aron, and he wonders if they shouldn’t try to fight when they get off the train. Lale reminds him that the Germans have guns. Fists can’t beat guns.

Lale keeps his mind from the final destination. He concentrates on his family, on the word “safe.” Through the slats, he catches a glimpse of a field of poppies. He never knew they grew wild like that. The next time he gives a girl flowers, they will be handpicked, he thinks. This thought leads to others, and soon he is making a list of all the things he will do when he’s home. **He is 25. His whole life is ahead of him.**

### Back Home

**News spread across the region that Jews in small communities were being sent to work for the Germans.** They were no longer allowed to work normal jobs or own their businesses. Lale had decided to leave his home in Bratislava to help out around his parents’ house. For four weeks, he worked on the house with his father and older brother, Max, both also forced out of work.

His sister, Goldie, was more fortunate. She was still working as a seamstress, which meant she was the sole breadwinner in the family. She traveled to and from work in the dark. Her superior skills were the only reason her boss risked the wrath of the Germans to keep her on.

One night, Goldie returned with a poster stating that all Jewish families had to offer up one adult child for work duty. **They would work for the German government, and the rest of the family would be safe.** If they refused, the entire family would be sent to a concentration camp. Lale couldn’t believe that the Slovakian government had bent to Hitler’s demands.

Lale volunteered to go because he was unattached, not like Max, who had a wife and two children. He was willing to make this sacrifice for his family. He reported for duty and was processed by two friends he’d grown up with. They told him to go to Prague and wait for his assignment. Never in his imagination did he think his decision would land him on a cattle car stuffed like sardines with other young Jewish men. **But he knew that if given another chance, he’d make the same choice again.**

### Welcome to Auschwitz

Lale and the men rattle through the countryside for two more days. There’d been a few stops along the way, but never for more than an hour, and they were never let off the train. At one stop, the men in one car tried to burst through the wooden walls boxing them in, which created a domino effect in the other cars. But the guards did nothing, and neither did Lale. They both knew there was no way to escape.

The train stops again, and this time, the doors are flung open. The air is filled with the vicious barks of dogs and the more vicious commands of the German soldiers. The men are ordered to get off and leave their belongings on the train. Some of the men don’t understand the language and take their possessions with them. The possessions get snatched and the men beaten. **Lale is one of the last to exit. He sees the dead body of one passenger and says a prayer before stumbling out.**

Lale struggles to comprehend the scene around him. The dogs, the men stumbling on numb legs from the journey, the violence, the soldiers. He notices their uniforms—black, sharp, two lightning bolts on the collar—the SS. If he didn’t fear them so much, he’d be in awe of the fine craftsmanship of their attire. But he does fear them, so he places his suitcase on the ground, wondering how they’ll know it’s his. At least he still has the money in his pocket. He touches his breast to make sure.

All hope of seeing his things again disappears when trucks arrive and the soldiers toss in all the bags, books, and other items the men believed they needed. He says a silent apology to his mother for losing her books. An officer fires a gun and tells Lale to get going. **He walks through the gates. The phrase “Work makes you free” is written in German across the top.**

Through the mayhem, Aron finds Lale. Lale tells him to do whatever they tell him to do and everything will be fine. He doesn’t even believe these words, but he repeats them to himself nonetheless. A commander approaches the group of dumbfounded men. He introduces himself as Commandant Rudolf Hoess and welcomes the men to Auschwitz. Lale can’t believe the geniality of this man. He listens as the commander says that if they work hard and follow the rules, they’ll be free to leave.

Everything moves quickly. Lale is shoved into a line, processed, and roughly tattooed with the number 32407. He notices that all the men processing the workers are Jews, and they all wear the same striped pajamas. Lale stares at his tattoo and wonders how something like this is possible. **He tries not to think about himself being reduced to nothing but this number** , but he can’t help it.

Dehydration begins to take over, and Lale is more thirsty than he’s ever been before. An ounce of relief returns when he learns they’ll be able to shower. The men are marched into a building and told to strip. They’re told they can collect their clothes afterward, but Lale has started to realize he and the others have been hoodwinked. He knows he won’t see his clothes again.

He thinks about the money in his pocket, and rage boils inside. He takes a pack of matches from his pants and discreetly lights his shirt on fire. He hustles away with the line. A raucous breaks out when someone notices the fire. A soldier tries to stamp it out. Reality sinks in, and he realizes that was a careless thing to do. **He’s been counseling all the men to keep their heads down and do as they're told, and then he goes and sets a fire?** He admonishes himself and makes a vow to stay alive and leave the camp one day a free man.

All the men drink as much shower water as they can. They’re shaved nearly bald and given Russian uniforms to wear. Then, the men are marched a few miles to their barracks at Birkenau, the secondary compound at Auschwitz, through rain and mud. Some men fall and are shot.

The rain provides more hydration, but there is no food. Someone asks the soldiers for food once they are in the barracks—a large hut with three bunks stacked in rows. Aron has again found Lale, and they climb to a top bunk, which they’ll share with two others. Someone suggests they eat the hay from the mattresses like cattle. A flutter of chuckles follows, but the laughter fades, and the men finally sleep.

Lale wakes in the night. He needs to use the restroom. He goes to the back of the hut and is grateful to see at least a ditch dug out for their waste. Three other prisoners, as he now realizes they are, sit on the wooden toilet boards chatting. Lale sees them, but he also sees two SS officers rounding the opposite corner. He waits despite the pressure in his bladder.

**One second the soldiers are smoking and laughing, and the next, they shoot the three men.** Lale hides until they’ve passed. One of the soldiers is just a boy. When he climbs back onto the bunk, Aron says he needs to go too, but Lale stops him. He says to hold it until morning.

### Providence

Lale’s first morning at the camp starts with shouting, whistles, and barking dogs. The prisoners exit Block 7, Lale’s new home, and stand outside awaiting orders. An SS officer performs a roll call. Two numbers are not spoken for. The two men are found dead inside the barracks.

The officer explains that they will eat once in the morning and once at night. He then slyly adds, “If you survive.” He tells them **they will be given work duty and will help build the camp to accommodate the many other Jews arriving soon**. Breakfast arrives next. Lale gets to the front of the line and receives a cup full of slop. He can’t identify what it is, but he dumps it down his throat before he can think about it.

After breakfast, Lale is assigned to roof duty. He is to sit on the roof and lay down tiles handed up from men below. Two men are already on the roof when he climbs up. They tell him to watch what they do and follow it. It’s not hard work, but it must be done quickly. The men have Russian accents, and Lale responds in Russian, which makes them both smile.

Lale works alongside the Russians for hours, his stomach cramping from hunger. Finally, the officer tells them they can take a break. The Russians tell Lale to stay on the roof out of sight of the officers on the ground. If they can’t see them, they can’t kill them. Lale learns that the men are Russian soldiers who were captured. They’d been at the camp for two months already.

From atop the roof, the whole of Birkenau is spread before them. Lale sees the long line of barracks leading off into the distance. Some are filled, and others are waiting to be filled soon. Horror runs through Lale’s body at the prospect of so many more prisoners coming to the camp, and he tries to hide his emotions from the other men. The men fill Lale in on who is at the camp. **Red stars signify political prisoners, yellow stars the Jews, and green stars the kapos. The kapos are former criminals, which makes them perfect for guard duty.** The Russian soldiers aren’t given stars.

The three men continue working together for the rest of the week, but they haven’t spoken much since that first day. Lale is fully in prisoner mode, forcing himself to keep his head down and do the work. He does what he is asked, doesn’t argue, and stays alive. Still, he watches everything happening at the camp, making mental notes. He eavesdrops on SS conversations. The officers don’t realize he can understand German, so they speak freely about the disposition of different officers and the commander. Lale stores all this intel in his mind.

Lale sees a group of men wearing normal clothes and interacting freely with the SS without fear of repercussions. Another group strolls through the compound without working. **Lale makes a note to find out who those different groups are and how to become one of them.**

### Climbing the Ladder

Lale has taken to showing strength in front of his kapo. When the man is near, he shouts orders to the other roof workers. He always catches the kapo’s eye and gives him a respectful nod. When he speaks to the kapo, he speaks in Polish. His actions work. One day, the kapo tells Lale that he’ll be his assistant. **He will do whatever the kapo asks, and in return, he will have an easier life. Lale quickly accepts but can’t help feeling uneasy about the alliance.**

Not long after, Lale is in the yard and notices a truck driving behind the administrative building, which is weird because supply trucks usually stop at a different spot. He turns on an air of confidence and strolls behind the building to get a better look. The truck pulls up next to a bus enclosed in metal. Dozens of naked men file out of the truck and onto the bus. There are so many men, the bus can hardly hold them.

An SS officer climbs onto the bus holding a canister. He opens the top hatch, dumps the contents inside, closes the hatch, and quickly scrambles to the ground. Within the seconds, the bus begins to shake. **Lale hears the men screaming from inside and realizes the canister contained a noxious gas. He falls to his knees and tries to vomit, but there is nothing to bring up. He can’t move. He is stuck in this hell.**

The next morning, Lale can’t get out of bed. He is hot with fever and passes out. When he finally regains consciousness, he feels someone feeding him water and cooling his forehead with a rag. The person is an old man, who looks down at Lale compassionately. Lale is disoriented but tries to sit up. The old man helps him outside and finds a place for them to rest.

The old man introduces himself as Pepan. He is the _Tätowierer_ —the tattooist. Lale bristles when he realizes this is the man that marked him the first day, but he knows the man had no choice. Pepan is French. He was an economics professor captured for his anti-German political beliefs. He says Lale was sick with typhus for seven days. Everyone thought he was a goner.

Lale doesn’t understand how he survived. Pepan explains that the SS had found him collapsed in the yard and added his body to the truck of bodies hauled out each day. A young man tried to convince the officers that Lale wasn't dead, but they wouldn’t listen. So when the officers weren’t looking, **the young man pulled Lale from the truck and took him to Block 7. Pepan was passing by and helped the man pull Lale inside**.

Later that night, Lale learns that the men in his block, along with Pepan, shared their rations with him, forcing food and water down his throat. They changed his soiled clothes, exchanging them with the clothes of men who’d died. He also learned that Aron was gone. When the kapo had asked Aron where Lale was, Aron lied and said Lale had died. The kapo was so mad, he took Aron instead. No one had seen him since.

Lale doesn’t understand why these men saved him. They tell him that **Aron believed that Lale was the chosen one who would save him. So after Aron disappeared, they kept caring for him just in case Aron was right**. That was also why Pepan had taken an interest in Lale.

There are many more loads of prisoners coming to the camp, and Pepan will need help tattooing them on arrival. He offers Lale the opportunity to work with him. He says this work will help Lale survive. Lale doesn’t think he can do it. He remembers how it felt to be branded and doesn’t want to be the one to inflict that kind of pain on his people. But he realizes that if he doesn’t do it, someone who doesn’t care as much will and will hurt the men. Lale agrees.
