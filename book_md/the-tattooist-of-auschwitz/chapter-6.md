## Chapter 6: The Long Journey Home

Lale’s train travels throughout the day. Like that first train ride back in 1942, he has no idea where he’s going. The train finally slows to a stop in front of Mauthausen, another concentration camp in Austria. **Lale left most of his new bounty of treasures in his room, but a few jewels are hidden in pouches inside his pants.**

The men at this camp seem worse off than those at Birkenau. They’re like walking skeletons. The guards are more relaxed at this camp and simply instruct the new arrivals to find a place to sleep for the night. It takes Lale four tries before he finds an empty bunk to call his own.

Morning comes, and Lale leaves his block to find a long line of naked men. He realizes they are going to be strip-searched, and his precious stones will be found. Quickly, he shoves three diamonds in his mouth and rushes back to the block to hide the rest. When the officers check the mouths of the men in front of Lale, he shoves the diamonds under his tongue and opens his mouth. When the guards get to Lale’s waiting mouth, they glance in and move on.

Lale is at Mauthausen for several weeks. He never would have believed that boredom would be his predominant emotion in a concentration camp, but after his busy life at Auschwitz, he languishes with nothing to do. He observes the guards to determine which one might make a good ally. He speaks German to one officer who walks by, and the two strike up a conversation. Lale tells this man all about Auschwitz, making it sound more like Disneyland than a camp. He doesn’t see the point in dredging up the horrible truth.

Days later, this same officer tells Lale that he can get him transferred to a different camp in Vienna where there might be work opportunities. The only catch is that they don’t accept Jews. He tells Lale to hide his tattoo and to give them his name at the truck. Lale almost doesn’t understand what he’s hearing. **He hasn’t been anything but a number in so long, he has forgotten he could be addressed by his name.** Lale gives the officer a diamond for his troubles.

### Longing for Freedom

In Vienna, the guards are even more lax than at Mauthausen. They simply tell the prisoners to find a bunk and where to get their meals. Lale keeps to himself in this new camp, having nothing in common with the other prisoners. With an unoccupied mind, Lale can’t stop thinking about Gita. **He knows that moving from camp to camp is going to make it harder to catch up to her, wherever she is.**

One day, two men ask Lale if he was the tattooist at Auschwitz. Lale says he was and asks who wants to know. The men say they were just curious and move on, but a few minutes later, SS officers grab Lale and take him to see the commanding officer. They pull up his sleeve, revealing his tattoo. The commander asks if Lale is Jewish. Lale says that he’s Catholic, but the officer is dubious. He asks Lale twice more if he is Jewish, seeming ready to force the truth out of him. But the subject is quickly dropped when Lale starts to take off his pants to prove he is not a Jew.

After this visit, something changes inside Lale. **He’s had enough of these interrogations and decides he won’t be a prisoner for one more day.** He finds a weak spot in the fence at the back of the camp and crawls through. For the rest of the day and night, Lale walks through a forest. He hears and sees gunfire in front of him and moves closer, hoping it’s the Russians or Americans. But when he hears a shot only a few feet away, he jumps in the river and pretends to be a dead body floating by. Cold and exhausted, he climbs up onto the bank and collapses.

The next day, Lale makes it to a road overrun by Russian soldiers heading in one direction. He steps out from the forest, hoping to find help, but the Russians could care less about him. He decides to risk walking in the opposite direction in search of a town. Lale doesn’t get far before a jeep carrying a Russian official stops next to him. This man has never heard of Auschwitz and seems unfazed by Lale’s tattoo. What does interest him is Lale’s perfect Russian. **After learning that Lale speaks five other languages, the official orders Lale into the jeep.**

### From Rags to Riches

The jeep pulls into a circular drive of a large chalet atop a hill, the wide Vienna countryside spread out below. Luxury vehicles are parked along the drive, and inside the chalet, the furnishings and artwork are exquisite. Lale can hardly handle the level of wealth and sophistication in this place compared with where he’s been for the last three years. He’s led into a large study, where a senior Russian officer sits behind a beautiful mahogany desk.

It doesn’t take long before Lale learns what his job will be. **He is tasked with finding women in the village down the hill willing to party with the Russians.** He’s taken to a large room with a four-poster bed, a private bathroom, a desk holding a Tiffany lamp, and a balcony with french doors. Of course, his first thought is that Gita would love it there, but he pushes the thought away. It hurts too much, and he’s not free to search for her yet.

Lale is shown a closet full of men’s clothing and told to find something nice that will fit him. Suits, dress shirts, polished dress shoes, and ties are neatly displayed in the closet. Lale runs his hands over the fine fabrics. In a drawer, he finds woolen socks and cotton underwear. **A small spark lights up inside. This is the wardrobe of the old Lale.** After picking out a suit for tomorrow, Lale runs a hot bath. He sits in it for a long time, replenishing the hot water once. This is his first bath in three years, and he soaks for as long as possible.

After the bath, a man named Friedrich enters Lale’s room. He will be Lale’s handler, and he has been ordered to shoot Lale if he tries to escape. He shows Lale a vault filled with cash and jewels, a much larger collection than Lale’s at camp. Lale will take cash and jewelry to entice the village women, and he can make whatever deal he wants. The money and jewelry are meticulously catalogued, and Lale must return whatever he doesn’t use at the end of the day.

Once his duties are explained, Lale is introduced to the chalet chefs. Friedrich tells him to ask for anything he wants, and it will be made. That night, Lale receives a dinner tray in his room. The meal consists of lamb in a rich sauce and carrots with butter and parsley. **The food is rich and flavorful, but he struggles to enjoy it. Without knowing what has happened to Gita, the delectable meal is unsatisfying.** He eats half and saves the rest, the way he did at camp.

### A Good Worker

Lale does well in the village the next morning. He meets a group of women at a boutique who are familiar with the Russian parties. Five of them volunteer right away, and he gives them a little cash, promising more when they are picked up that night. He stops a few women on the street, and before long, he has 10 lined up for the Russian officers. That night, he and Friedrich pick up the women and bring them to the chalet. **Lale retires to his room, in no mood to party, but he is pleased to hear laughter downstairs. At least no one is getting hurt.**

For weeks, Lale performs his duties daily dressed in a sharp suit. All the women in town know him by now, and they adore him. When he walks down the street, he receives shouts and waves from many. Women have started coming to the boutique when they know he’ll be there to either be chosen for the party or to see Lale. One woman asks if he’ll marry her, but he says his heart is already spoken for.

Each day, Lale takes a small gem and hides it in the cuff of his trousers. He returns the rest to the vault keeper and stores his stolen treasure in a sock. One night, Lale is overcome with a longing for home. He has a hard time remembering anything good from his past. His whole life is now tarnished by the horrors of the camp. To cheer himself up, he empties the gem sock on the bed and looks at the small mound.

A knock on his door brings him back to reality. He throws a blanket over the mound of jewels and opens the door to Friedrich. **Lale learns that Friedrich is being transferred in the morning. The commander has decided that Lale is trustworthy and can handle the village business alone.** The men share a few nice words, having had many conversations on their drives, but then Friedrich sees something glittering on the floor.

In his rush to hide the jewels, Lale failed to notice a ruby fall to the ground. Friedrich picks it up and asks Lale to explain himself. Lale is genuinely surprised to see the stone, which works in his favor. He said it must have gotten stuck in his pants lining. He reasons that if he’d been trying to steal it, he wouldn’t have left it lying around. Friedrich accepts this excuse and takes the ruby back to the vault.

The next morning, Lale dresses in a fine suit and shirt. He wears four pairs of underwear and three pairs of socks. He takes his gem collection and gives the room a long last look. In the garage, no one thinks twice as Lale jumps in the usual truck and drives away. He arrives at the village and parks down one of the streets. **He steals a bicycle from outside a cafe and rides away, a prisoner no more.**

### Lost and Found

When Gita and the four Polish girls arrive in the relative’s village, the sun is just setting. It gets dark quickly, and they struggle to read the house numbers. They have no choice but to ask a woman walking by for directions. Gita lets the girls do all the talking to hide the fact that she’s Jewish. The woman agrees to take them to the house and waits with them until someone comes to the door. The woman tells the owner to take care of the girls and walks away.

Once inside the house, the girls explain why they’re there. The homeowner, an older woman, asks if they know who it was that brought them to her house. She seems nervous. **The girls find out that the woman who helped them is an SS officer, rumored to be one of the meanest officers at the camps.** The owner fears that this officer will be back for the girls, which means they can’t stay at the house. Gita and her friends are disappointed, but they’re served hot soup at the kitchen table. Gita doesn’t remember the last time she ate at a table.

Before long, a neighbor shows up and says the girls can stay in her attic. They can sleep there, but with home searches still happening, they have to leave during the day. Each morning, the five girls hide in the woods nearby until dark. The locals find out about them and take food to the home where they sleep.

After a few weeks, the Germans are run out of the village and replaced by Russian soldiers. One soldier catches the girls sneaking out of the woods one night. They show him their tattoos and explain their journey here. **The Russian takes pity on them and offers to guard the house so they can stay during the day.**

This new arrangement works so well, Gita and her friends get a little too comfortable. They lower their guards and start becoming more visible in town. One night, the house door bursts open, and a drunken soldier rushes in. He attacks one of the girls and tries to assault her, but the commotion draws the attention of other officers, who shoot the offender in the head. The girls are traumatized and decide it’s time to move on.

As an apology for the abusive soldier, a senior officer arranges for transport to take the girls to Krakow, where the sister of one of the Polish girls lives.
