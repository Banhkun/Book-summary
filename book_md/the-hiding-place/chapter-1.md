## Chapter 1: The ten Boom Family

_The Hiding Place_ is Corrie ten Boom’s autobiographical account of her experiences rescuing Jews from Nazi persecution during the Holocaust. Her decision to risk her own safety to stand up for what she believed was right derived from her deeply held Christian faith and her unshakeable conviction in the power of love to trump hate.

Corrie grew up in the Netherlands city of Haarlem as part of a long-established, devoutly Christian family deeply committed to their faith. The ten Boom family were pious Christians, regular readers of the Bible who took the tenets of their faith seriously and sought to live their lives in a way that accorded with what they saw as **the best principles of Christian theology—mercy, charity, forgiveness, kindness toward one’s neighbors, and most of all, the unconquerable power of Christ’s love.**

### Faith

The ten Boom family—father Casper, son Willem, and daughters Betsie, Nollie, and Corrie—were pillars of their community, widely respected and admired by their neighbors and friends. As long as Corrie could remember, her father and her late mother had taken in children without homes, believing that it was their Christian duty to extend their bounty to those less fortunate.

The home was always filled with children, whom the ten Booms came to regard as members of their family—scores of children passed through the ten Boom home, known as the Beje, marking the house in Corrie’s mind as a hiding place of refuge and sanctuary from a world that was often cruel and indifferent. Casper could never bear the idea of a home without children and could never close his door to a child in need. In this, the family took their inspiration from Isaiah 32:2: **“And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.”**

The bedrock of this faith was what would sustain Corrie ten Boom and her family through the horror of the Nazi occupation. This faith would be her salvation—as well as the salvation of all those whom she rescued from persecution and almost certain death, as **their home would become both a spiritual and a literal hiding place.**

Cornelia “Corrie” ten Boom, born in 1892, grew up as part of a tight-knit extended family, with each of her maternal aunts coming to live at the Beje at one point or another. The family’s devout faith was a constant throughout her childhood, as her father, Casper, and her mother, Cornelia (after whom Corrie was named) held regular Bible study sessions and taught their children to live according to Christian principles.

Corrie’s childhood was a happy one. Looking back, she fondly recalled watching her father work in his watch shop (located on the ground floor of the Beje, below the family’s living quarters) and accompanying him on the train to business trips in Amsterdam. For Corrie, the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam was a far cry from the sleepy, small city of Haarlem. Casper traveled to Amsterdam frequently to do business with wholesalers and suppliers, many of whom Corrie remembered as being Jewish.

Reminiscing about these happy times with her father, **Corrie also remembered the spirited—but always respectful—theological debates and discussions her father would have with these Jewish friends.** Although devout in his faith, Casper’s religiosity was tolerant and respectful of the beliefs of others. He did not seek to convert or berate his Jewish friends: he simply loved discussing faith and God with them.

During one of these journeys with her father, young Corrie asked him about “sexsin,” a word she had heard in a poem at school. Topics like sex were rarely discussed openly by families in early-20th century Europe—and certainly not in the conservative ten Boom household. When she asked this question, Casper asked Corrie to carry a box full of heavy watches across the train platform. She struggled and told her father that she couldn’t do it. He explained to her that **just as there were physical burdens that were too heavy for her to bear, so too were there emotional burdens that she could not carry on her own, so that it was best to let God carry them for her.**

### Mama

Corrie’s mother, Cornelia, was a woman thoroughly dedicated to Christian charity. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Haarlem, when young Corrie was coming of age, the city was home to many poor and indigent people, including children. Mama took Corrie and her sister Nollie with her on her many visits to the city’s poorest slums to deliver alms to the needy.

On one of these alms-giving expeditions, Corrie and Nollie went with their mother to a house where a baby had died the night before. To Corrie’s shock, the baby still lay in a crib, dead of malnutrition. Corrie and Nollie even reached out to touch the deceased child, feeling the cold skin against their hands. Casper later explained to Corrie that death was in God’s hands, and only He could judge when one’s time on Earth has ended**. Her father said that when death came for her, God would give her the strength she needed.**

When Corrie was 14, she met Karel, a classmate and close friend of her older brother Willem. She was immediately smitten with the young man, and she fantasized about a married life with him. Although Corrie was becoming interested in boys and romance at this time, she lacked confidence that she would ever find a husband. She was bashful and shy, and she did not think of herself as pretty. She sometimes struggled in social situations—she kept silent, despite having much to say.

Her older sister, Nollie, on the other hand, was attractive and vivacious, always able to hold her own at parties and gatherings and draw everyone’s attention—whether she was talking about Einstein’s theory of relativity or Admiral Peary’s journey to the North Pole.

Corrie was sometimes sad and disheartened by her awkwardness and difficulties expressing herself. Mama, however, reassured her by sharing what she saw as the key to happiness. **Happiness was not simply a product of one’s surroundings—it was something that you created for yourself.**

### Tante Jans

The family at the Beje extended beyond Corrie’s parents and siblings. During her childhood, Corrie’s maternal aunts (“Tante” in Dutch), Bep, Jans, and Anna came to live at the Beje. They were elderly and widowed, and in poor health.

Corrie formed a special bond with Tante Jans. Tante Jans was, like the rest of the family, deeply and passionately committed to her faith. She was a larger-than-life presence at the Beje, well-known in Haarlem (and throughout all of Holland) as a writer of fire-and-brimstone Christian tracts, often assailing “modern” forms of dress like mutton sleeves and bicycle skirts. She was indefatigable, possessed of boundless energy—for **she believed that God judged individuals based upon how much they accomplished in life. For Tante Jans, her faith-based work _was_ her life.**

Unfortunately, Tante Jans was diagnosed with diabetes in 1914, just on the eve of the First World War. In those days, such a diagnosis was typically a death sentence, but Tante Jans refused to succumb to despair. She resolved instead to pour herself even _more_ forcefully into her work.

Every week, Tante Jans needed to have her blood sugar level tested. Corrie eventually took it upon herself to administer the diabetes tests to Tante Jans. The doctors instructed Corrie to heat the compound to a precise temperature (no easy feat on a coal-burning stove) and record its color. If it was clear, then the sugar levels were stable; if it turned black, Corrie was to notify the doctors immediately. She did this diligently for the next five years, while the First World War raged across Europe.

One morning in January 1919, Corrie ran the test and observed the results, praying that she was mistaken—the compound was pitch black. She immediately notified the doctor, who told her that she _wasn’t_ mistaken. Tante Jans, the doctor told her, had a mere three weeks to live. The family conferred on the matter that night. Casper made the decision to tell Tante Jans about her impending fate. He told her that, **while some people meet God with empty hands, Tante Jans would return to the Lord with hands full from a life spent in meaningful work** —raising money for the poor of Haarlem, starting clubs for returning veterans, and writing devotional literature.

Tante Jans broke down upon hearing this, insisting that _everyone_ went to God with empty hands—because **our deeds on Earth were nothing compared to Jesus’s sacrifices on the cross.** All we needed in life was to be sure of this. Tante Jans died shortly after, but her boundless energy and commitment to her work set an indelible example for Corrie.

### A Courtship

Four months after Tante Jans’ death, the ten Boom family took a day trip to the rural village of Made, where Willem was to deliver his first sermon as a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church. At the sermon, Corrie, now 27, was reunited with a familiar face—Karel! Although she had seen Willem’s old schoolmate a few times over the years since their initial meeting and had never stopped loving him, this occasion marked a new phase of their relationship.

**Corrie and Karel began a brief courtship, during which Karel would visit the ten Boom home and take Corrie out for walks around Haarlem**. The couple would talk about their future together and even discuss how many children they wished to have. She began to believe that she had found her partner, with whom she would be able to start her own family and live out the rest of her life.

Sadly, this was not to be Corrie’s fate. Willem informed Corrie that, although Karel did indeed love her, the two would never be married. **Karel’s parents, Willem explained, wanted their son to “marry well”** —they wanted their daughter-in-law to have the right social pedigree and wealth. Corrie, in their eyes, was unfit to marry their son. Karel, although hurt by his parents’ antipathy to his courtship with Corrie, decided to acquiesce to their wishes. In Karel’s goodbye to Corrie, he begged her to write to him and keep him informed about her family, whom he had come to love.

Corrie was initially devastated when Karel visited the Beje with his new fiancée. She shared her feelings with her father, who told her that love was the strongest force in all creation. Casper comforted her the way he always did, the way no one else _could_. He explained that **Corrie should never seek to block out her love for Karel, but instead, look to God to show her a _new_ way for that love to express itself**. Even if our love could not find the expression or object _we_ wanted, God always had a higher plan for it.

With this, she was able to make peace with this experience. Now approaching 30 (an old age to still be unmarried in this era) and with a decreasing likelihood of ever becoming a mother, Corrie began to embrace life as a spinster. She would save her love for her nieces and nephews, and the needy and downtrodden of Haarlem. Years later, God would reveal to Corrie just how much love she truly had to share with the world.
