## Chapter 7: After the Camps

Mere days after Betsie’s death, Corrie was ordered to stand to the side during roll call and report to the administration barracks. **When she arrived, the clerk stamped her papers, which bore the words “CERTIFICATE OF DISCHARGE.”** Next, she was handed a rail pass that would take her out of Germany and back into Holland.

Corrie was stunned—her ordeal was really coming to an end! But before she could walk out of the camp, she had to submit to one more humiliating, dehumanizing medical inspection. Much to her dismay, the doctor immediately looked at the swelling in her legs and feet and declared her unfit for release. Apparently, she was suffering from edema. Before she could walk out of Ravensbruck, Corrie would need to report to the camp hospital—the same place where her sister had died.

### The Hospital

**The hospital was a dreadful place, filled with dying and suffering women, languishing from untreated injuries and illnesses** , many of them delirious from the combined effects of fever, malnutrition, and neglect. Some of the women had been on transport trains that had been hit in Allied bombing raids and were suffering from third-degree burns and severed limbs.

The nurses took little care for their patients, often mocking their tortured cries or yelling at them to shut up and stop complaining. On Christmas Eve 1944, Corrie’s first night in the hospital, four women fell from the top bunks onto the floor, where they died from shock. The sounds of pain rang throughout the ward. Corrie did what she could to ease the suffering, bringing bedpans to the patients who were too weak to make it to the ward’s filthy latrine.

One night, Corrie saw that the bedpans she had laid out for the patients were missing. She discovered that two Hungarian gypsies had stolen them, secreting them under their cots to save themselves the trip to the latrine. Corrie pleaded with these women to return them so that everyone could use them, but seemingly to no avail. That night, one of the gypsies threw her bandage at Corrie’s face—a bandage that had been used to cover this woman’s gangrenous wounds. Traumatized and disgusted, **Corrie contemplated giving up on the bedpans, but she ultimately realized it was her Christian duty to help those in greater need.** She dutifully went under the gypsies’ beds to retrieve them and share them with the other patients.

### Release

Finally, at the end of December, the doctors cleared Corrie for release. She was given back the possessions she’d been arrested with and, on New Years Day 1945, was placed on a train bound for Berlin. Only years later did Corrie learn that her release had been the result of a clerical error—the rest of the women at the hospital in Ravensbruck were murdered in the gas chambers a mere week after Corrie left the camp.

**On her train journey, Corrie saw the devastation that war had wrought on Germany.** The towns and countryside lay in bombed-out ruins. The Nazi menace, and the global war it had provoked, had wrought unimaginable physical destruction on Europe. After making her way to Berlin, she boarded another train bound west, for Holland. During the random stops in bombed-out rail stations, Corrie would sleep in deserted cafes and waiting rooms. At last, her train made its way across the border into Holland.

The train only took her as far as the Dutch border town of Groningen. When she got off the train, she had nowhere to go. With her remaining strength, Corrie limped to a hospital, where a kindly nurse took her in. Recognizing that Corrie was suffering from severe malnutrition, this woman gave her a hot bath and shared with her the small amount of food she still had left. After nearly a year in prison and in the camps, Corrie was deeply grateful and joyous to be treated with kindness and humanity. The staff at the hospital also managed to get word to Willem and Nollie that Betsie had died and that Corrie was on her way home.

**After a ten-day sojourn in the Groningen hospital, Corrie made it onto a food truck headed to Willem’s town of Hilversum**. The trip was illegal, as, by this time, the German authorities only allowed military transport and supply vehicles on the roads. But Corrie was willing to take this risk—her only desire now was to reach Willem and Nollie and whatever else remained of her family.

She finally made it to Willem’s nursing home, where she was joyously reunited with her brother, nieces, and nephews. Willem was in a deeply unhealthy state and could now only move around with a cane. He had never recovered from the jaundice he had been suffering from when she saw him at Scheveningen. Indeed, although he would survive the war, he would die of tuberculosis just a year later.

Willem told Corrie that they had received no word on Kik. He had simply disappeared after being apprehended by the Germans in connection with his work with the Dutch Resistance. **Years later, they learned that Kik died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1944.**

### Fulfilling the Vision

After two weeks in Hilversum, Corrie bade farewell to Willem and began the journey home to the Beje. Willem had to arrange a special car ride for Corrie, disguising it as an official nursing home trip, as travel was severely restricted by the German authorities. But she was accompanied on her journey by an old friend—Pickwick!

**The former Resistance leader told Corrie that all the Jews she had hidden at the Beje were safe, except for the unfortunate Mary Itallie.** The rescue operation was still running, with several people who had been made homeless by the war now sleeping at the Beje. When she arrived back in Haarlem, she was joyfully reunited with Nollie and the watch shop saleslady, Toos. To her astonishment, Corrie also saw that Toos had kept the shop going in the time since the arrest. With her help and the kindness of her neighbors in Haarlem, Corrie managed to get the business fully back in order—she was soon at work repairing watches and picking up orders from suppliers and customers. Life was resuming a normal rhythm.

The Beje continued to be a safehouse for the persecuted. Mentally challenged people were being hidden in the house to avoid the Nazi extermination program aimed at these people, deemed to be dangerous to German racial hygiene. Upon her return, however, **Corrie found that she had no more energy for underground work. She sensed that God had a different calling for her.**

She began preaching in the streets of Haarlem in spring 1945, sharing the message of the unconquerable power of Christ’s love. In the war-torn city, this was a powerful message, one that resonated deeply with a community yearning for hope in a hopeless world. In her new role as a crusader and missionary for the Lord, Corrie was driven to finally bring Betsie’s vision to life. She wanted to create a home that would bring healing to the wounded and suffering.

After one of her preaching sessions, Corrie was approached by the widowed Mrs. Bierens de Haan, an aristocratic woman who lived in the wealthy Haarlem suburb of Bloemendaal. As the two women spoke, Mrs. de Haan shared that her mother had been a friend of Tante Jans, years before. Mrs. de Haan had always admired Tante Jans’s charitable work and Christian writings and had known of the Beje as a place of refuge and Christian charity. And Corrie, too, had known of the de Haan estate as the most beautiful home in all of Haarlem.

**Mrs. de Haan offered the house as the place for Corrie’s home for concentration camp survivors**. Here was the beautiful place where Betsie’s vision would at last be fulfilled. Mrs. de Haan even suggested having the survivors replant the dilapidated and neglected gardens on the estate—just as Betsie had envisioned!

Liberation finally came to Haarlem in May 1945. For the first time in five years, the Dutch flag hung from the windows and the once-forbidden Dutch national anthem played non-stop on the radio. Almost immediately after, the first wave of what would become hundreds of people began making their way to the house in Bloemendaal. Everyone who came was scarred by the war, either physically or psychologically. These were people who had lost husbands wives, siblings, and even children. Many of them had spent years in concentration camps or in hiding.

### Sharing the Glory

**The house became a place of refuge, where the wounded and weary could heal their psychological wounds and process the experience of their war trauma.** Corrie saw it as her mission to tend to all those who had been destroyed by the war—including the perpetrators and collaborators.

Indeed, former NSB operatives had been ostracized and publicly humiliated by their neighbors, who often forcefully shaved the heads of the former collaborators and paraded them through the streets in revenge for the suffering and pain they had caused during the war. Corrie understood this need on the part of survivors for emotional release, but she also knew that even former Nazis were creatures of God, deserving of love and forgiveness.

Corrie knew that she could not keep her efforts to spread the word of Jesus Christ confined to Haarlem, or even to The Netherlands.**She was compelled by Christian duty to take the message to all corners of the world. And for the next four decades until her death in 1983, this is precisely what she did.**

She believed that God had given her certain experiences in life, as a concentration camp survivor, to prepare her for her true mission and purpose. Corrie first traveled to war-torn Germany, the home of her persecutors, to share the message of Christ the redeemer to a traumatized people. She helped people whose lives had been destroyed by war and hate find hope and meaning in the world.

One day in Munich, after a church service, Corrie encountered a man she didn’t expect to see: one of the former SS guards she had known at Ravensbruck. This presented Corrie with one of her hardest challenges yet. This man had caused her untold suffering. When he reached his hand out to Corrie, she struggled to accept it and found herself searching for the strength to forgive this man. And yet, she did—for Corrie had come to understand that the world hinged on God’s love and forgiveness. **If God could see a way to salvation for this man, so could Corrie ten Boom.**

Later, Corrie spearheaded the efforts to open a rehabilitation center in Germany—on the site of the former Darmstadt concentration camp. This was the ultimate fulfillment of Betsie’s dying dream at Ravensbruck, to transform a symbol of hatred and destruction into one of love and renewal.

**Corrie ten Boom went on to travel the world as a renowned public speaker, visiting more than 60 countries in her lifetime**. She went to far-flung and dangerous places, including Russia, China, Cuba, and other Communist-aligned countries. She saw scenes of dire poverty and oppression, just as she had witnessed in the concentration camps—but she also saw hope and love. In Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe, she shared her personal story and delivered her constant, unchanging message: that Jesus’s love was unconquerable.
