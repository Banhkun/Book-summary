## Chapter 2: The Evil Comes

**In 1918, Cornelia ten Boom, Corrie’s mother, suffered a cerebral hemorrhage that put her into a coma**. She lay unconscious for two months before she finally came out of it. She managed to survive, but she was a shadow of her former self. She was physically disabled and limited in her movements. Worse, she almost entirely lost her powers of speech. One of the few words she retained, however, was “Corrie.” This was how she now referred to _all_ people. But Mama’s condition taught Corrie about how truly strong love was. Although her mother could hardly move or speak,**Corrie knew that Mama loved her family and her community. Love could not be bottled up or stifled, no matter the circumstances.**

Despite her condition, Cornelia survived to see the wedding of her daughter Nollie in 1921. At the wedding, something miraculous happened. Cornelia, who had not spoken coherently in years, suddenly rose to sing the hymn “Fairest Lord Jesus,” with the entire assembled family and congregation joining her in rapturous wonder. For Corrie, it was a miracle, albeit a temporary one, a blessing from God on that happy day. **Mama passed away a mere four weeks after Nollie’s wedding, but no one, least of all Corrie, ever forgot her moment of grace.**

### Life at the Beje

In the years that followed, Corrie settled into her life as a dedicated spinster aunt. As her siblings got married and started families of their own, she became a caregiver to a growing brood of nieces and nephews, whom she loved as though they were her own children. **Although she loved them all, she was especially fond of Peter, one of Nollie’s sons**. Peter was a musical prodigy who delighted the family, and the community at large, with his magnificent and beautiful piano playing. She also became the bookkeeper for her father’s watch shop, helping to bring some order and regularity to Casper’s notoriously eccentric business practices. In her life at the Beje, she was joined by her older sister Betsie, who also chose not to marry.

Thus began a tranquil time in Corrie’s life, one defined by domestic affairs and family commitment. Corrie became more involved in the workings of the watch shop, developing an aptitude and appreciation for the craft as well as the business—and, of course, relishing the opportunity to work beside and learn from her father. Betsie, for her part, made the Beje at last truly glow during this period, with flowers and beautiful decor infusing every corner of the old house. Betsie kept alive Mama’s tradition of making the Beje a true home for the entire city, opening its doors to anyone who wished to stop in for a hot cup of coffee, homemade soup, or Christian prayer and fellowship.

**For the better part of the next two decades, the widowed Casper and the unmarried Betsie and Corrie settled into a happy, if familiar routine**. Life was a procession of new nieces and nephews (as Nollie and Willem started families of their own), family gatherings, Bible readings, and business in the watch shop. It was a tranquil and happy existence—but one that would eventually be shattered in ways the happy trio could scarcely have imagined.

### The 100th Anniversary Party

One afternoon in 1937, when Corrie was 45 years old, the ten Booms held a party to celebrate the 100th anniversary of their family watch shop, started by Corrie’s grandfather, Willem, in 1837.

The entire extended family, as well as the ten Booms’ Haarlem friends, neighbors, and business associates, came out to the Beje. Nollie, along with her husband and six children, were there, as well as Willem and his family. Corrie remembered Betsie’s grace, beauty, and vivacity on this day. Betsie, Corrie recalled, seemed to have an uncanny gift for creating beauty all around her.

**Corrie would recall this day of celebration as one of the best and proudest of her life.**

The entire Haarlem community showed up to toast the ten Boom family, including fellow congregants at their church, St. Bavo’s, as well as business associates, suppliers, customers, and even competitors. Also in attendance was a man Corrie and Betsie called “Pickwick,” a nickname he earned because of his resemblance to the sketch drawings in Charles Dickens’s _Pickwick Papers_. Although physically unattractive, Pickwick was benevolent and cheerful—Corrie remembered how he always used to amuse children by balancing teacups on his protruding belly.

**Although the day was joyous and carefree, there was whispered, frightened talk of the menacing political situation brewing in neighboring Germany.** Willem had traveled and studied extensively in Germany. As a student in the 1920s, years before the rise of Hitler, **Willem had written an academic paper about the growing specter of racial ideology in the country, and, in particular, the widespread acceptance and open expressions of antisemitism.** With such a background, Willem was knowledgeable about developments in Germany and, at the party, spoke to guests about his fears of another European general war, this one brought on by the murderous Nazi ideology of racial superiority and territorial expansion.

But Willem was not the _only_ source of the growing concern about what was happening in Holland’s large, powerful neighbor to the east. Casper had long enjoyed business contacts in Germany, as many of his suppliers, customers, and wholesalers were based there. Many of these individuals, Corrie knew, were Jewish. But recently, the contact with these Jewish business contacts had dried up. Letters sent to these people would be returned with a curt official reply that they had either moved away and changed addresses, or gone out of business. **Often, they received no more than a cryptic reply that read simply, “address unknown.”** The whole thing was mysterious—what had happened to these friends and colleagues, with whom the watch shop had done business for years?

(Shortform note: By 1937, many of these Jewish-owned businesses may have fallen prey to Nazi Germany’s _Arisierung,_ or “Aryanization,” policy. Under this policy, businesses owned by Jews were stolen from their original owners and given to racially “pure” Germans, who often paid the Jewish owners a fraction of the true value of the enterprises, if they were compensated at all. Jewish businesses ranging from major department stores to small sole proprietorships were expropriated through this process. According to Yad Vashem, only 8,000 of the 50,000 Jewish-owned enterprises that had existed in 1933 were still in business by 1938.)

**Willem, bravely, was already taking in Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.** He housed these refugees in a small nursing home that he and his wife operated in Haarlem. At the 100th anniversary party in 1937, Willem introduced the guests to a German Jew named Gutlieber. Gutlieber, Willem told the guests, was forced to flee Munich after a violent assault at the hands of Hitler Youth members, during which they attempted to set his beard on fire—a troubling sign of the violence and mayhem that seemed to be lurking just outside the peaceful world of the Beje.

### Otto

**In the late 1930s, Casper hired Otto, a young watchmaker from Germany, to work in the shop. Although technically skilled, Otto was harsh and cruel in temperament.** Otto was a member of the Hitler Youth back in his native Germany, a fact of which he was immensely proud, and took every occasion to remind anyone who would listen.

Although Corrie and her family already knew from Willem the stories about the repressive political situation in neighboring Germany, this was their first personal interaction with a self-professed Nazi. He was stridently antisemitic in his rhetoric, scornful toward Dutch culture, and boastful about the supposed superiority of the German people and way of life.

**Otto went out of his way to mock the ten Boom family for their religious commitment when they invited him to their evening prayer sessions**. He sneered at the Old Testament and dismissed it as being of Jewish origin, and thus, fraudulent. Although Corrie was truly shocked by Otto’s blasphemy and disrespect, Casper always chose to turn the proverbial other cheek, taking pity on the cruel young man. Even when the landlady at Otto’s rooming house found a ten-inch blade under the young man’s pillow, Casper charitably believed that Otto was merely mistrustful of strangers and fearful for his safety, because he was living and working in a foreign land, away from his family and neighbors. To Casper, Otto deserved mercy, not scorn.

**But this was hardly the end of Otto’s antisocial behavior. The young German also took delight in tormenting poor Christoffels**. Christoffels was an itinerant clock mender, one of the few non-family members employed by the watch shop. Christoffels was a kindly, elderly man who was a frequent presence at the ten Booms’ prayer and Bible study sessions. Casper kept him on because he believed that itinerant watchmen like Christoffels, though a dying breed, were unmatched in skill.

But Otto took every opportunity to heap verbal, and even physical, abuse upon the old man. Christoffels’s advanced age was a particular focus of Otto’s rage—likely a product of his fascist ideology, which held that elderly people like Christoffels wastefully consumed resources while contributing little to the racial community. If people were unable to contribute to the state, in Otto’s Nazi worldview, they were useless and expendable. Accordingly, **Otto frequently had “accidental” collisions, shoves, and trips with Christoffels, both inside the shop and out on the streets in Haarlem.**

Otto’s abuse of Christoffels proved a bridge too far even for the warm and forgiving Casper ten Boom. Casper tried desperately to explain to Otto why his behavior was wrong and unacceptable, but the young man refused to listen. Casper had no choice but to fire him and send him home to his native Germany. Corrie later recalled that he was the only employee her father ever dismissed.

### The War Begins

**On May 10, 1940, Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, making the country’s worst fears of war and occupation a reality**. Although Dutch forces initially put up a stiff resistance, they were no match for the superior military might of the combined German Army and Air Force. Having seen the devastation of the German blitzkrieg tactics in Poland in September 1939, the Dutch government made the decision to surrender and submit to German occupation four days after the invasion, on May 14, 1940. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands left the country shortly after to form a government-in-exile in London.

The pace of events came as a sudden and violent shock to people all over the country. Although the frightening specter of war had haunted the minds of nearly all Europeans ever since Hitler’s rise to power in Germany in 1933, it was still a stunning turn of events—not least for the pious ten Boom family.

**The night of the invasion, Corrie had a terrible nightmare, one that she later came to see as a prophecy.** In it, she and her family were in the Grote Markt, the central market square in their home city of Haarlem. It was always a joyous and bustling place for Corrie, filled with beautiful medieval architecture, commerce, and familiar and friendly faces. But in her dream, the Grote Markt was pitch black, silent, a grim and desolate place. She and her family were being carried through the square on a cart, driven by four black horses. She did not know where they were being taken.

(Shortform note: The four horses may be a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, described in the New Testament’s Book of Revelation. In some interpretations, the Four Horsemen bring the Apocalypse before the Final Judgement and Second Coming of Christ. As a devout Christian, these are images and ideas with which Corrie ten Boom would likely have been familiar.)

At first, life in Haarlem carried on as it always had. The presence of German soldiers on the streets was unusual, but something one quickly became used to. As The Netherlands had been placed under a civil, rather than a military, occupation, much of the basic day-to-day administration of the city was carried on by Dutch officials, including the local police force. But things would soon take a terrifying turn for the worse.

### The Occupation

Disturbing changes began to present themselves. German uniforms and insignia became a common feature of ordinary life on the streets of Haarlem. Although business boomed at the watch shop initially (the influx of soldiers with good wages and disposable income stimulated economic demand), it came at a terrible price.

**Racist and antisemitic propaganda began to be published in once-respectable newspapers, now under the control of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda**. “News,” as Corrie had known it, was no more. Life also began to get stricter and more regulated, with less freedom of movement. The occupying authorities issued ration cards, which stipulated how much food each household was to be allotted. All residents were issued identity cards, which had to be produced any time a German official demanded to see them—and there would be severe consequences for anyone caught without one.

**The Germans also restricted information—what people were allowed to read, watch, or listen to.** Early in the occupation, the Germans ordered that all privately owned radios were to be handed over, lest the population hear broadcasts from Allied nations. The ten Boom family, like many other people living in occupied countries, relied upon broadcasts from the BBC in London for real news about the war. Without it, German lies and propaganda would be their only sources of information about the outside world. Thus, the ten Booms chose to defy the confiscation order. Accordingly, when the German requisition officer visited the Beje to ask if the family had a radio or other contraband materials, Corrie lied and told him that they didn’t.

**This was one of the first moral conflicts of the war she faced. Corrie knew that lying was a sin, expressly forbidden by the Ten Commandments**. But she also knew that the confiscation order was unjust and that she would be compromising _another_ part of her and her family’s moral code to comply with it. She knew that her only way to survive was to put her life into God’s hands and trust in His will. By lying to the requisition officer, Corrie had taken her first steps toward resistance. She was to take many more.
