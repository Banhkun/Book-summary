## Chapter 6: In the Camps

One day early in the summer of 1944, Corrie was abruptly ordered by the guards at Scheveningen to pack out and form a line with the other women to evacuate the prison immediately. **As she saw the prison being emptied, it became clear what was happening—the Allied armies had landed in Europe and were beginning the process of liberating the occupied countries!**

In response, the Germans were moving their political prisoners out of the path of the rapidly advancing Allied forces and deeper into the interior of Europe. Corrie stuffed her few possessions—her sweater, pajamas, toothbrush, and Bible—into a pillowcase and awaited further orders as she was taken to a freight yard on the outskirts of The Hague. She was happy to be getting out of Scheveningen, but she was deeply fearful that something even worse might be in store for her. She was particularly terrified of being transported out of The Netherlands into Germany.

At last, their train arrived. The guards marched and shoved the prisoners onto the train, refusing to tell their human cargo where they were headed or what would happen to them when they arrived. But there was one ray of hope: **Corrie and Betsie were at last reunited. They had endured terrible hardship, but they would no longer be alone.** Betsie was without the Bible that Nollie had given her—she had given it away to others, as she did with all things.

Corrie could only see a tiny bit of the outside world from inside the cramped train. But she saw enough to know that they _weren’t_ being sent to Germany when she saw that the train did _not_ take a turn east at a trestle. They would be staying in Holland, and, for her, this was a source of comfort.

### Arrival at Vught

**The train disembarked, but not at a rail station or even a camp. The guards forced them off the train in the middle of the woods.** Once the suffering and half-starved prisoners had all cleared off the train, they were ordered to march on foot, at gunpoint. Betsie was ill and was having difficulty breathing, so Corrie helped her make the journey through the dark woods. At last, Corrie saw where she and the other women were being taken: the Vught concentration camp for political prisoners.

They were ushered into a quarantine compound just outside the camp, languishing in this holding area for two weeks before being processed for admission into the main camp. When Corrie and Betsie’s names were called, they were issued pink forms. The inmates from the main camp told them that this meant that the ten Boom sisters were being processed for release!

These hopes were soon dashed, however, when they arrived at the administration building. They were not being released, but merely transferred to the main camp, where fresh horrors awaited them. They arrived in a yard flanked by concrete buildings. There, they were told by a veteran inmate what the function of these buildings was: torture centers for recalcitrant inmates who failed to obey camp rules. If they stepped out of line, Corrie and Betsie would be taken to one of these buildings, be stuffed into a room the size of a gym locker, have their hands bound above their head, and be left to wait in this condition indefinitely.

**Betsie, however, never lost her faith in the redeeming power of Christ’s love. She saw the goodness—or _potential_ for goodness—even in the concentration camp guards**. She would not seek revenge, but she would turn the other cheek at her persecutors. She saw it as her Christian duty to show these wayward souls the error of their ways and that, through Christ, it was never too late to embrace love.

### The Philips Factory

**In July, Corrie was assigned to a slave labor unit in the Philips factory at the camp, assembling parts for radios for German fighter planes**. Corrie was deemed healthy enough for this form of manual labor; Betsie, in her weakened condition, was assigned to duty sewing prison uniforms with the other sickly inmates.

(Shortform note: The legacy of the Dutch electronics giant Philips during the Nazi occupation is a complex one. The company, under Nazi pressure, did open a factory inside the Vught camp in 1943. This factory used slave labor from political prisoners and materially contributed to the German war effort. On the other hand, the company hired as many Jews as possible to work in this factory, telling the German occupiers that these laborers were too valuable to be sent to Auschwitz to be killed. According to company history, 382 out of the 469 Jews who worked in the Vught factory survived the war. In 1996, the government of Israel awarded company president Frederik Jacques Philips the _Yad Vashem_ “Righteous Among the Nations” medal, given to non-Jews who helped to rescue Jews during the Holocaust.)

The Philips factory was run by a foreman named Moorman, a fellow prisoner. Moorman was a veteran of the concentration camp system and knew what it took to survive in such a place. He worked hard to ensure that those whom he supervised were protected from the worst excesses and random brutalities of the guards and advocated as much as he could for better rations and provisions for the workers. Moorman assigned Corrie the dull and monotonous job of measuring small glass rods and arranging them in piles according to their measurement.

Moorman was an expert operator within the camp system. **He skillfully presented a subservient and obedient face to the Germans, while covertly organizing sabotage and work slowdowns among his workers in an effort to hamper the German war machine**. On one occasion, Moorman even admonished Corrie for being too diligent and conscientious with her work, reminding her that they were, after all, making radios for German airplanes.

### Strength Through God

But Corrie was still becoming hardened by her experiences. The ordeal of the concentration camp took a clear physical and psychological toll on her. The days were marked by an early roll call out of the barracks, during which prisoners were forced to stand at attention for agonizingly long periods of time. After a thin breakfast, they were marched to work detail.

**Many of the women tried to peer into the adjacent men’s camp, hoping to catch a glimpse of a son, brother, or husband**. They knew that discipline and punishment were far harsher in the men’s camp. Every day, the women would hear rifle shots ringing out from the men’s camp, prompting speculation about who, and how many, had been killed.

These oppressive conditions put Corrie’s religious beliefs to the test. One day, Betsie told her that a new woman had been transferred on to the sewing detail. Betsie shared that this woman had been betrayed to the Gestapo by a man named Jan Vogels—the man whom, according to Betsie, had also betrayed the ten Booms to the Gestapo. Corrie’s mind began to wander to places it never had before. She even believed that she was capable of killing Vogels if she ever saw him. Knowing that this murderous hatred existed within her caused Corrie to experience great physical and spiritual anguish.

**But, in the end, she hung on to her humanity—thanks to Betsie’s inexhaustible well of Christian mercy and forgiveness**. Betsie told Corrie that this man must have been wracked with guilt over what he had done, that _he_ was as tormented as they were. Through Betsie’s example, Corrie saw the error and sin of her vengeful thoughts. She saw that _she_ faced the same judgment before God as Vogels did. He had caused the deaths of others through his deeds; but Corrie had murdered this man with her tongue and in her thoughts. That night, she prayed to God to forgive Vogel and herself as well. In forgiving him, she found herself at peace as well.

### Atrocities

**Corrie and Betsie found community with the women in their barracks**. One of them was the pregnant Mrs. Floor, a Communist whose husband was imprisoned in Vught’s men’s camp, as were those of many of the other women. Corrie feared for Mrs. Floor’s health, and that of her baby, noting how dangerously thin she was for an expectant mother. Mrs. Floor told Corrie that ration-card offenders (which was what the authorities believed Corrie and Betsie to be) usually received a six-month sentence. If this was true, this would mean a September 1 release date. Corrie clung to this date in her mind, although Betsie warned her one evening in August not to get her hopes up.

But the sheer brutality of the camp was impossible to ignore. As the long summer of 1944 wore on, the women heard snippets of news (or possibly rumors) that the Allied forces were rapidly pushing east across Europe, liberating occupied towns and cities and driving the German armies further and further back. The guards seemed to be acutely aware of this state of affairs, becoming more brutal toward the prisoners with news of every German setback. Notably, the rifle fire from the men’s camp became more and more frequent.

**At last, September 1 arrived—but it did not bring the freedom for which Corrie had hoped**. On that day, Mrs. Floor went into labor. With no access to basic gynecological or post-natal care, she was forced to deliver her child, a girl, on the floor of the filthy and infested barracks. The girl lived a mere four hours.

One evening that September, the women heard the loudspeaker from the men’s camp calling the names of the male prisoners to report for roll call, though they could not make out the specific names from the women’s camp. Suddenly, the sound of rifle fire erupted. The men had been called to die in a mass execution. As the Allied armies drew near, the guards were performing summary executions on the male prisoners. **Seven hundred men were murdered by the Nazis that night, including, they later learned, Mrs. Floor’s husband.**

The next day, one thousand women, including Corrie and Betsie, were ordered to gather their personal effects. The sisters took toothbrushes, needle and thread, Nollie’s blue sweater, and their precious Bible. By this time, Betsie was astonishingly weak, barely able to carry her meager possessions or stand under her own power. Corrie helped Betsie make the march to a rail depot, where they herded onto a freight train. The car was packed with 80 women, stuffed into the train like cattle. The guards jabbed and pistol-whipped the women to force them onto the increasingly crowded freight car.

**Conditions were awful inside the train and many women fainted from exhaustion and overcrowding**. In the cramped conditions, with no provision made for bathrooms or sanitation, the air soon became foul, particularly as the temperature rose. The women had to stay in crouching conditions just to accommodate the mass of human cargo that had been stuffed into the car. Their only view of the outside world was from a hole in the wall of the railcar that one of the women had managed to gouge open. The train began its long journey out of Vught.

No one on board knew exactly where they were headed, but, from looking out of the crude window they had gouged into the side of the train car, **they knew what direction they were traveling—east, out of Holland and towards Germany, as Corrie had always feared**. The journey wound on for two days as the women languished in the fetid and unsanitary conditions of the freight car. At last, after two days and two nights, the doors opened and the prisoners emerged. As she disembarked, Corrie knew immediately where they had arrived: Ravensbruck, the notorious women’s extermination camp.

### Coming to Ravensbruck

**When she stepped off the train, Corrie saw a ghastly image: the tall smokestack rising like a spire from the camp**. A strange smoke wafted up from it. She knew all too well that it was not coal or wood being burned there—it was the bodies of murdered Jews, political opponents, and other “undesirables” being cremated. She could scarcely bring herself to lay eyes on it.

**The camp was a world of squat, ugly concrete barracks, far worse than Vught or Scheveningen**. The barbarism and brutality of Corrie and Betsie’s new home soon became apparent. When they arrived, the women began cutting each other’s hair to prevent lice infestation. The new prisoners now looked just like the old ones: bald, emaciated, sick, and terrified. For the first two nights, no provision was made for the incoming women from Vught. Corrie and her fellow transports slept under a crude tent that had been set up, with straw covering the ground. To her horror, Corrie saw that her straw was infested with lice.

After these first miserable nights out in the rain and cold, Betsie’s condition had grown even worse. She had a lingering cough and was soon suffering from intestinal cramps. Her only option to relieve herself was in a ditch that had been dug to serve as a latrine for the newcomers. On the third night, the new arrivals were at last processed into the main camp.

**The ordeal was unimaginably degrading. Corrie and the other women were forced to strip naked and shower in front of the SS men** , in cockroach-infested showers. Deprived of proper sanitary facilities, they were ordered to relieve themselves using the drain holes in the shower as toilets. There was no privacy, no dignity. Corrie managed to hold on to her Bible by concealing it in her blue sweater. Miraculously, the guards overlooked it when they searched the women as they emerged from the showers. It was her spiritual nourishment in this place that seemed so far removed from God. But she knew that God was with her, even in Ravensbruck.

Conditions were worse in the rodent and louse-infested barracks, temporary housing for the new arrivals. Corrie and Betsie had to share a bed with three other women, who were already asleep in the bed when they arrived. The cabin was overcrowded, with women scrambling over one another to find a place in their beds, kicking and jostling one another. If someone needed to relieve themselves in the middle of the night (using one of the filthy and overflowing toilets) they needed to climb over their bedmates.

Roll call was at 4:30 am. Corrie and Betsie’s barracks were located next to the punishment barracks—the place prisoners were sent if they violated the camp rules. **Screams of torture from beating and whipping could be heard from inside. For Corrie, they were the very sounds of hell.**

### Barracks 28

**When the women were returned to their barracks after roll call, they had one source of hope and comfort—Corrie’s Bible**. The message of the conquering power of God’s love came through to all the women in the barracks, even in a place like Ravensbruck. The Bible told them that nothing, not torture, or even death, could separate them from Christ’s love. Ultimately, through that love, they would triumph.

**Corrie remembered that Christ, too, had been beaten and tortured, just as the prisoners at Ravensbruck had been**. She saw in His agony on the cross—and ultimate redemption—a parallel for her own experiences. Like Him, she had been beaten, whipped, and stripped naked. And like Him, she would rise up and conquer.

As the fall grew colder, Betsie grew sicker. The appalling living conditions only worsened Betsie’s rapidly deteriorating health. The arrivals from Vught were moved into permanent barracks in October 1944. The ten Boom sisters—now, Prisoner 66729 and Prisoner 66730—took up residence in Barracks 28. When they arrived, they were struck by the revolting stench of the place. The plumbing had backed up and the straw bedding was filthy. Worse, it was infested with fleas.

The inmates of Barracks 28 were from all the occupied countries of Europe—Belgium, France, Holland, Poland, Austria, the Soviet Union—and spoke a multitude of languages and dialects. **The difficulty of communication, combined with the general misery of their conditions, exacerbated tensions among the prisoners and made quarrels a constant feature of camp life.** But, gradually, the women learned to cooperate and share what few resources they had. They were all in it together.

Corrie and Betsie were assigned to a work detail in the Siemens factory, where they were forced to unload heavy metal plates from the railroad depot and transport them inside the factory. Their only meal during the grueling 11-hour workday was a boiled potato and thin soup. Once back in the barracks, prisoners would receive a small portion of turnip soup.

**But the barracks became a spiritual sanctuary for the women living there. Corrie and Betsie led daily prayer sessions** , giving their fellow prisoners the strength they needed to persevere through their ordeal. Corrie recalled the moving power of these barracks religious services, as women translated the Bible to each other across the Dutch, German, French, Polish, Russian, and Czech languages. The women were of all different Christian denominations, but they shared in the redeeming strength of God’s word.

### Miracles

Corrie noticed that during these clandestine prayer sessions, the guards never seemed to wander near Barracks 28. Everyone was grateful for this, as anyone carrying on Bible readings would have been either sent to the feared punishment barracks or possibly executed right on the spot. But the guards always seemed to stay away—almost as though some benevolent, divine force was protecting the congregants of Barracks 28.

There were other miracles. Corrie’s Davitamon bottle, containing medicinal oil, never seemed to run dry. Whenever Betsie or any of the other ailing women needed a drop, more always seemed to be there. Betsie, unable to explain the seemingly inexhaustible supply of oil, told Corrie it was a gift from God who loved them. One day, a prisoner arrived with an even greater bounty—a bottle of yeast compound vitamins that would provide the prisoners with life-saving nutrients to supplement their starvation diet.

**But the brutal conditions were still taking their toll on Betsie, miracles or no miracles.** All throughout November, Betsie grew sicker and weaker, with her fever continuing to rise. Finally, when her temperature reached 104 degrees, Betsie was admitted to the camp hospital.

### A Vision

Corrie missed Betsie terribly after she was sent to the hospital. She _had_ to see Betsie. One of her fellow inmates told her that there was a window in the hospital’s latrine that never fully shut. It was possible to get into the building through this window. As the guards would never let her actually visit Betsie, this was Corrie’s only chance of catching a glimpse of her sister.

Corrie made it to the window and wriggled her way into the filthy latrine, which featured rows of overfilled, overflowing toilets. The stench made Corrie gag. But there was something far worse than this inside. **Against the wall, there was a pile of emaciated corpses, their dead, unblinking eyes staring at the ceiling**. Corrie ran from the room in horror. She eventually found her way to Betsie. Corrie noticed that her sister’s condition did seem to have improved somewhat, even if it was just the result of a brief break from hard labor (there certainly wasn’t any serious medical treatment being offered at the hospital).

Three days later, Betsie returned to Barracks 28. She was no longer assigned to hard labor, but would instead be working as part of the “knitting brigade,” sewing prisoner uniforms. This work detail gave Betsie a greater degree of freedom than she had enjoyed before, and she relished the opportunity to read aloud from her beloved Bible during her knitting.

Betsie’s mere presence rejuvenated Barracks 28 with warmth and vitality. She helped ease the constant quarreling and restore some semblance of order and community to the group. She even pointed out to Corrie that the fleas were actually a blessing—they kept the guards out of the dormitories and the indoor work areas. God truly did have a purpose for all creatures, even the fleas that Corrie had so despised.

**By December 1944, winter had fully set in at Ravensbruck. The early morning roll calls became even more brutal, dehumanizing affairs**. During one roll call, a guard beat unconscious a mentally challenged girl who had soiled herself while being forced to stand at attention. Corrie was grateful when the beating finally stopped and the girl lay motionless and bleeding on the ground. The sheer contempt for human life was simply unimaginable.

**One day Corrie shared with Betsie her idea to create a home for survivors of the Nazi persecution after the war.** It would be a place of healing and love, where the persecuted and terrorized could heal the physical, psychic, and spiritual wounds. Betsie heartily agreed, saying that she wished to show that love is always greater than hate. It dawned on Corrie that while _she_ was talking about helping the victims, _Betsie_ was talking about helping the _perpetrators_.

Shortly after this conversation, Corrie joined her sister in the “knitting brigade.” She would later recall these weeks working alongside Betsie as the most joyous time she ever spent at Ravensbruck. During their days together, Betsie fleshed out her vision for what God wanted them to do after the war.****

**They were to operate a house, larger than the Beje, and open it to all the souls whose lives had been destroyed by the concentration camps**. In her vision, Betsie could even picture what the house looked like—floors of inlaid wood; a broad staircase; and grounds filled with gardens, where the former prisoners could plant and nurture the flowers, giving them exposure to beauty after years of ugliness. In merely describing this future house, Betsie transported them outside the squalid barracks.

### Betsie’s Ascension

**Shortly before Christmas, Betsie took a turn for the worse.** When Corrie’s pleas to have her readmitted to the hospital fell on deaf ears, she did what she could on her own in the barracks to help ease her sister’s pain and discomfort. Betsie was delirious with fever and was clearly on death’s door. Yet even in this state, Betsie continued to describe her vision for after the war. This time, she spoke of converting a former concentration camp in Germany into a home for those who had been destroyed by Nazism. She would turn the death camps, the most visible manifestation of this brutal ideology of hate, into places of healing and love.

At last, Betsie was removed to the hospital. The nurses, however, would not permit Corrie to enter, so she had to wait until they left before talking to Betsie through the outside window. Betsie was barely conscious during this meeting, only murmuring, “so much work to do…”

The next morning, Corrie snuck off to the hospital and made her way to Betsie’s window. What Corrie saw was an emaciated, yellowed body being transported to the washroom, the same awful place where she had previously seen the stacked pile of corpses. The body was Betsie’s, dead at last from illness, neglect, and cruelty.

Corrie knew that Betsie’s body would be transported to the ghastly washroom with the pile of corpses that she had seen on her previous visit. A fellow inmate met Corrie on the other side of the hospital exterior and helped push her in through the washroom window. There, a sympathetic nurse allowed her to watch as Betsie’s body was stacked along with those of the other victims.

**But then, Corrie witnessed a miracle. When Betsie’s body was laid down on the pile, it was transformed.** No longer emaciated and yellow, Betsie was healthy-looking and beautiful again. Corrie believed she was seeing a vision of her sister as she looked in heaven. Betsie, like Casper, had passed through the suffering of the mortal world and ascended to Heaven in a state of beauty and grace.
