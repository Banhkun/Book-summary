## Exercise: Practice Encouraging Collaboration and Experimentation

Reflect on a recent project and consider how you could have encouraged more collaboration and experimentation.

* * *

What could you have done to foster more trust and safety in your team during a recent project? For example, you could have displayed vulnerability, reminded your team that you value their perspectives, or demonstrated that you trusted them.

How could you have invited more honest participation when discussing a decision? Marquet recommends asking open questions, voting before debating the options, and encouraging people to express dissenting opinions.

How could you have asked team members to commit to—not comply with—the decision, even if they didn’t personally agree with it?

What are some ways you could have celebrated your team’s achievements and reflected on areas of improvement? For instance, you might have given observational praise or encouraged team members to talk about their journey.
