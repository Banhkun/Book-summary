## Theme #3: Innovation

The next key theme in _Hit Refresh_ is **the importance of continuous innovation in ensuring a company’s long-term survival**. In this section, we discuss the three key elements of innovation: adopting a growth mindset, creating a diverse workforce, and working together.

### Adopting a Growth Mindset

Nadella writes that Microsoft had become stagnant at the time he became CEO. While the company led the “PC Revolution” of the ’80s and ’90s, Nadella argues that it had a “fixed mindset”—it rested on its past successes instead of continuing to take risks and push innovative tech products. With the advent of mobile phones and iPads, its rivals started to pull ahead.

(Shortform note: In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek cites Microsoft as an example of a company that practiced “finite” thinking—essentially a fixed mindset that leads to short-lived companies. He argues that Microsoft under Steve Ballmer was focused on how it could beat Apple and thus based its decisions on Apple’s moves. In contrast, he writes that Apple practiced “infinite” thinking. It was proactive rather than reactive and focused on improving customer experience through innovation.)

Nadella argues that no company can afford to retain a fixed mindset and get too comfortable in a fast-changing environment. Instead of sticking to what it has always done well and seeking short-term gains, companies should attempt to plan ahead by anticipating the next big trends and seeking to address them.**Nadella helped break Microsoft out of its fixed mindset by adopting a “growth mindset,”** which enabled the company to regain the initiative instead of falling behind in technological trends. Risk-taking and innovation became the order of the day instead of playing it safe, leading to new opportunities in AI and cloud computing and changing the general atmosphere at the company.

(Shortform note: Having a growth mindset is just as important in your personal life as it is in a company. In _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth writes that people who have a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter or more talented over time if they put in the work and are given the right opportunities. They’re more likely to persevere despite obstacles and failure. In contrast, people with a fixed mindset believe that intelligence and talent are static, and thus attribute their failures to something they believe they’ll never have.)

In addition, **Nadella believes a growth mindset means that you learn from your mistakes**. While many things had gone wrong at Microsoft in the years before Nadella took over as CEO, having the courage to confront those mistakes and finding a way forward was instrumental in the company’s rejuvenation.

He uses Nokia as an example: Microsoft had acquired Nokia for $7.2 billion in the hopes of bolstering its smartphone presence but ultimately decided to write it off. (Nadella notes that he voted against the acquisition, which was put into motion before he took over as CEO.) He says that letting go of so many talented people was heartbreaking but that the Nokia experience taught him many lessons. For one, he learned that they should only be in businesses where the company has a strong differentiator.

(Shortform note: Nadella’s approach to mistakes is similar to Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull’s. In _Creativity, Inc._ , Catmull writes that Pixar embraces failure because it’s an inevitable result of innovation—if you don’t take risks, you won’t be able to come up with something original. To take the stigma out of failure, he recommends admitting your own mistakes and explaining how you moved forward. You should also take the pressure off managers to perform perfectly and encourage them to create an environment where employees can fail and recover.)

### Creating a Diverse Workforce

Aside from having a growth mindset, Nadella believes that diversity and inclusion contribute to an innovative workplace. **Having diverse employees prevents homogeneous thinking, opening up the company to different values and perspectives that lead to better ideas and products.** Nadella himself can be seen as a diversity success story: an Indian immigrant who was able to rise through the ranks of Microsoft to eventually become its CEO.

> **Creating a More Inclusive Workforce**
> 
> Many modern businesses are increasingly aware of the problems of diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and are placing a greater emphasis on the DEI approach (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion). **Diversity** is about ensuring more equal representation across different ethnic, racial, and sexual orientations when hiring employees. **Equity** is about creating a workplace in which everyone has equal opportunities to excel. Finally, **inclusion** is about making sure every employee has a positive work experience, and that each employee feels capable of participating to the best of their abilities.
> 
> Trying to bring greater diversity in the workplace isn’t as easy as it seems. As research suggests, diversity training is frequently ineffective, since participants can often respond negatively to it as a seemingly coercive measure. Nevertheless, a more diverse workforce does bring many tangible benefits, such as greater profitability than more homogenous workplaces, as the mix of backgrounds and perspectives can create a more dynamic and innovative team.

#### The Grace Hopper Debacle

While Nadella espouses diversity and inclusion, he admits that he still has his own blind spots. One headline-grabbing occurrence was his appearance at the Grace Hopper Celebration for women in computing in 2014, where he was invited to talk about increasing the visibility and involvement of women in tech industries. When asked how a woman in tech could approach getting a pay raise, Nadella claimed that so long as someone continues to work hard and well, they will eventually be recognized for their efforts and rewarded accordingly—an assumption that, as the questioner pointed out, was not at all in keeping with her own experiences and those of many other women in tech.

Nadella recognized and learned from this mistake: After the conference, he sent a company-wide email, owning up to his blunder and stressing that his answer was completely wrong. He had seen first-hand how women (like his mother and his wife) had to put careers on hold for the sake of children and reiterated that **leaders should actively root out biases to create a fair environment where everyone can speak up for themselves**. Since then, Microsoft has become more transparent about pay equity and channels resources into diversity programs.

> **Women and Tech: Recognizing Common Obstacles**
> 
> In spite of the advancements women have made in recent years, women still face significant barriers when pursuing careers in tech. These barriers include:
> 
> **1) Sexism around women’s professional roles.**Tech is still a male-dominated field, and traditional ideas around which roles and careers women “should” prefer can act as a hindrance. A lack of visibility of women in tech also means that women rarely get exposure to potential mentors, and remain ignorant of the opportunities available.
> 
> **2) Social conditioning.** While men are often encouraged to be confident go-getters in the workplace, many women struggle to assert themselves when it comes to promotions, pay raises, and making their ideas heard. This means that—as Nadella himself discovered—even deserving women are frequently overlooked while working in the tech field.
> 
> **3) Lack of support.** Tech cultures are not always family-friendly or sensitive to the needs of women, many of whom may prefer more flexible work options and a more supportive work culture. Balancing professional and family obligations remains an issue for many.

### Working Together

Another barrier to innovation that Nadella wanted to address was the bureaucracy and isolation between departments that had built up over the years. He asserts that such segregation only holds a company back; **the key to moving forward is collaboration and being open to other people’s ideas** instead of remaining in your own bubble.

To break down departmental silos and generate fresh ideas, the executive team introduced an annual week-long hackathon, where teams across different groups—engineering, research, marketing, and so on—work together to solve problems creatively. For example, in the first year of the hackathon, one team found ways to improve learning outcomes for kids with dyslexia; this project ended up being built into some of Microsoft’s key products.

> **Forging Better Cross-Departmental Communication**
> 
> Effective cross-departmental communication is crucial for ensuring the smooth running of any company. Here are seven ways you can build effective cross-departmental communication:
> 
> **1) Communicate more.** Solicit feedback and ideas from each department and staff level to consolidate the brain power at your disposal, and seek new ways of opening up the channels of communication.
> 
> **2) Make your meetings more effective.** Have a clear agenda for each meeting, and try to cover as much as you can per meeting to avoid having meetings too frequently.
> 
> **3) Use small talk to your advantage.** Encouraging informal communication and team-building exercises can help people from different departments build strong bonds with one another.
> 
> **4) Employ technology designed for collaboration.** Tools such as Microsoft Teams and Google’s G-Suite can help foster employee collaboration and coordinate departments more effectively when working on tasks.
> 
> **5) Vary your communication methods.** Toggling between different communications methods helps keep things fresh and ensures that there are multiple ways for departments to reach out to one another. Use email, phone calls, video calls, and internal messaging services.
> 
> **6) Bring leadership levels together.** Have regular meetings involving the leaders at each level of the organization and from different departments, so that everyone is on board with what’s happening in the company overall.
> 
> **7) Choose your managers wisely.** Make sure that every manager you hire is a good interpersonal fit with the other leaders, and that they come into the company with a strong sense of the importance of collaboration and open communication.
