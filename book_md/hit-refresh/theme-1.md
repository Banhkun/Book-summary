## Theme #1: Empathy

The theme that is the most central to Nadella’s business philosophy is empathy. **Nadella defines empathy as the cornerstone of all that he does, both personally and professionally** , and believes that it’s shaped his career at Microsoft and his vision for the company.

Nadella acknowledges that empathy was something he had to develop early in his career. He cites his son’s disabilities as helping him to become a more empathetic person. Faced with the reality of his son’s permanent condition, he writes that he learned to put aside his own feelings in order to better understand the struggles his son faced, and, with his wife Anu’s encouragement, learned how to become a strong support for his son.

(Shortform note: Nadella’s son, Zain, was born with cerebral palsy and required extensive therapy and visits to the ICU. In 2021, Nadella and his wife donated $15 million to Seattle Children’s Hospital—which Nadella described in _Hit Refresh_ as their family’s “second home”—in support of care and research for children with neurological conditions. Zain died in 2022 at the age of 26.)

For Nadella, empathy is about understanding others’ points of view and also seeking to help empower them. He believes that empathy enables Microsoft to understand its employees and customers better, helping the company to anticipate the needs of its clientele while also creating a more welcoming and dynamic environment in the workplace.

(Shortform note: Nadella values empathy so much that he required Microsoft’s senior leadership to read Marshall B. Rosenberg’s _Nonviolent Communication_. The book is about conflict resolution based on compassion instead of life-alienating communication. This was a necessary tool at Microsoft, where senior leaders were constantly at odds.)

### The Facets of Empathy

Nadella identifies four main facets of empathy: empathy as central to leadership, empathy as rooted in direct engagement with employees and customers, empathy as understanding the barriers and obstacles others face, and empathy as the foundation of trust.

#### 1) Empathy as Central to Leadership

Nadella believes that**empathy is central to good leadership**. The enemy of empathy is detachment and isolation: If the leader always keeps to his office or only associates with his senior inner circle, he will lose touch with the other employees in the company. An isolated CEO will also lose out on chances to get to know both his customers and his competitors better.

**Empathy is about understanding where others are coming from and addressing their needs,** whether they’re an employee, a customer, or even a competitor or business partner you may have disagreements with from time to time. Nadella says he places empathy at the heart of every relationship he has.

(Shortform note: While research supports Nadella’s view that empathy is the most important skill leaders can have, one study suggests that empathy can have its downsides for CEOs, especially during a crisis. The study argues that being _too_ empathetic can cloud a CEO’s judgment by making them too quick to react to perceived problems, overly apologetic even if the situation doesn’t merit it, and slower to address issues in a company’s operational structure. The two sides of the empathy issue thus suggest that moderation and context are key in order to employ empathy effectively.)

#### 2) Empathy as Direct Engagement

Nadella asserts that**empathy is rooted in direct engagement** and that it should be the cornerstone of all of a CEO’s relationships.

##### Empathy for Employees

Nadella believes the CEO must actively seek out employee feedback and be willing to listen to their ideas and concerns with an open mind. He writes that when he took over as CEO of Microsoft in 2014, he made a public promise to employees that he would listen to others to take stock of where the company was and the problems it faced. He actively solicited employee feedback through wide-ranging surveys and meetings in which he encouraged open conversation and debate.

(Shortform note: Such openness can lead to conflict, but hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio believes conflict can be productive, leading to the best ideas and decisions. In _Principles_ , he writes that you can work through disagreements and move toward cooperation by asking questions rather than making statements, focusing on _what_ the other person is saying rather than _how_ they’re saying it, and maintaining mutual respect.)

Nadella also chose to open the lines of communication by bypassing some of the hierarchy and bureaucracy that made it harder for lower-level employees to be heard. One example of how he achieved this is when he invited junior members of Microsoft to what had traditionally been a seniors-only annual brainstorming retreat. While some senior members resisted the inclusion of the more junior members, the retreat ended up being more productive and dynamic thanks to the presence of fresh ideas and a willingness to listen to them.

(Shortform note: While Dalio similarly values the ideas and opinions of junior employees, his approach is less democratic. To him, it’s important to give more weight to the opinions of people who have proven their credibility. In _Principles_ , he describes his firm’s principle of “believability-weighted decision-making,” which is different from weighing everyone’s opinions equally. Believable people are those who have repeatedly succeeded in the area under discussion and can logically explain their process.)

##### Empathy for Customers

Nadella employs **direct engagement with customers by going out into the world to see how Microsoft’s products are used in action.** By seeking out opportunities to directly engage with how Microsoft is used by customers, Nadella learns what they need.

He invited customers—schools, nonprofits, small businesses, and so on—to the senior leadership team’s annual retreat so that Microsoft’s senior researchers, engineers, sales, and other executives could understand what the customers’ problems were and work together to solve them. He also writes about witnessing the positive effects of Microsoft’s technology in hospitals and clinics—during Zain’s stays at the hospital, Nadella noted how many of the devices in the ICU ran on Windows and were connected to the cloud. This reminded him of how Microsoft’s work could make a difference in people’s lives.

(Shortform note: Nadella’s attitude toward customers is in line with the modern principles of sales, which Daniel Pink details in _To Sell Is Human_. Pink writes that contemporary selling strategies require building a connection—getting in sync with and adapting to people, communities, and contexts to serve their needs. One way to do this is to use your imagination to consider the customer’s perspective. This enables you to see if you missed any of their needs by focusing on your own perspective or experience.)

##### Empathy for Competitors

Nadella also says it’s important to **engage directly with competitors in order to learn from them or to resolve disputes.** He writes about meeting with executives from large tech rivals such as Apple and Facebook to better understand what they were doing well that Microsoft wasn’t doing and willingly learning from them. We’ll discuss this in more detail later in the guide.

(Shortform note: While Microsoft was engaged in storied rivalries, particularly against Apple, Nadella brought in a different mindset, one that’s similar to what Simon Sinek describes in _The Infinite Game_. Sinek writes that viewing competitors as worthy rivals rather than just rivals enables you to see what they’re better at and how you can improve. This encourages you to shift your focus from defeating others to maintaining a healthy position in your industry.)

##### Empathy for Partners

Nadella writes about how empathy plays a big part in his approach to business disputes with partners. He seeks common ground instead of trying to win or dominate others. He argues that **empathy allows business leaders to understand the legitimate concerns or objections others may have and to find positive solutions that work for both parties.**

He describes how this empathy paid off in a dispute with Yahoo, which used Microsoft’s Bing as its search partner. Yahoo wanted to breach its contract, and the situation could have easily escalated. Instead of making threats and demands, the Microsoft team practiced empathy and listened to the Yahoo team’s concerns. They worked together to find a solution that satisfied both parties—without costly litigation.

> **5 Steps for Resolving Conflicts in Business Partnerships**
> 
> While business partnerships can bring considerable benefits to both parties, nonetheless, it’s not uncommon for partners to face occasional rough patches. These five steps can help you resolve conflicts in business partnerships and get back on track. They dovetail with Nadella’s approach to practicing empathy:
> 
> **Step #1: Hear both sides.** Set aside your own opinions temporarily, and listen to what your partner has to say with an open mind. Seek to _understand_ your partner’s position even if you don’t agree with how they view the situation.
> 
> **Step #2** : **Re-establish common goals.** Disagreements are often rooted in a misunderstanding or in a misalignment of goals. Going back to the drawing board to re-establish the goals you wish to reach together will help to clarify what needs to happen.
> 
> **Step #3: Focus on the facts.** To avoid impulsivity, emotional outbursts, or the blame game, seek to keep the focus on the facts and not on your feelings about them. Objectively assessing the situation can help keep things productive and calm.
> 
> **Step #4: Talk to a mediator.** A third party can help resolve disputes by bringing a neutral voice into the discussion to moderate disputes. Hire a business coach or counselor to air your issues and seek guidance.
> 
> **Step #5: Make a plan.** Work with your business partner on a clear, step-by-step plan for getting back on track and reaching your shared goals. Make sure that each partner contributes to, and fully understands, the plan before getting back to business.

#### 3) Empathy as Understanding Others’ Obstacles

Nadella also posits**empathy as crucial for understanding the obstacles others may face** due to racial, gender, or class categories/backgrounds.

Nadella says he faced occasional abuse as an Indian immigrant when he first came to America, but that the privileged background he came from back in India helped to insulate him from taking the insults too personally. He acknowledges that, for many immigrants and people from less-privileged backgrounds, the barriers can be even harder to overcome.

Nadella says that witnessing the career sacrifices of his mother and wife opened his eyes to the struggles many women face professionally. His mother was an accomplished Sanskrit scholar, whose career struggled—and then floundered—under the pressures of trying to balance both her family and working lives. She eventually gave up working after the death of Nadella’s younger sister, just as Nadella’s wife eventually gave up her career as an architect to care for their young children.

(Shortform note: As Nadella describes, inequality within the business world takes many forms. Research indicates that the greatest divide up until the 1970s was originally along gender lines, with men and women largely confined to differing roles. But since the 1980s, gender and ethnicity have been roughly equal as factors in job segregation. The research also found that minority or marginalized members of the workforce tended to report lower levels of job satisfaction and to be more likely to leave than employees who belong to the dominant demographic in a workplace.)

Later in the guide, we’ll discuss how Nadella’s understanding of these obstacles makes him more conscious of the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

#### 4) Empathy as the Foundation of Trust

Nadella also promotes**empathy as the foundation of trust,** which sustains both personal and professional relationships over time.

Nadella describes how when he first took over as CEO, Microsoft’s workplace had grown toxic over many years. Employees were more interested in backstabbing one another or arguing with each other than they were in pulling together as a team to achieve common objectives.**** To combat this, Nadella promoted team-building exercises and encouraged seeking common ground. He also took the time to get to know his senior team members as individual people, not just as employees, by hosting a meeting in which each person was allowed to open up about themselves on a more personal level.

(Shortform note: As some writers have observed, these changes are largely because of Nadella’s personality. His predecessors, the hot-tempered Gates and the larger-than-life Ballmer, were known for ruthless business tactics that turned customers off. In contrast, Nadella is calm and subdued, replacing Microsoft’s winner-take-all approach with openness and curiosity. As a result, he was able to reform Microsoft’s image from that of a big, bad corporation to that of the “cool kid.”)

**Listening to competitors and partners and empathizing with their points of view created trust, Nadella says,** and this in turn led to more fruitful business partnerships and harmonious coexistence with rival companies.

> **Inspiring Trust at Work**
> 
> Nadella’s focus on trust is in line with the view that trust is the foundation for solid leadership. Experts conceptualize trust as a triangle made up of three main points:
> 
> **1) Be compassionate and interested in others.** Always be patient when dealing with colleagues in the workplace. Give others your full attention during interactions to show them you’re engaged in what they have to say. People are more likely to trust and respect someone who they believe is sincere in caring about them.
> 
> **2) Be clear and comprehensible in your ideas.** People tend to trust those who are able to present their thoughts and reasoning in an orderly, comprehensible way.
> 
> **3) Be yourself.** Don’t hide behind a “work persona” at all times, making your real self a mystery to those you work with. Instead, learn how to open up to your colleagues and show a more personal side. It’s easier for others to trust you when they know who you really are.
