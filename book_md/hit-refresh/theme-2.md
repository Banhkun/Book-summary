## Theme #2: Leadership

While empathy is at the heart of Nadella’s leadership, much of _Hit Refresh_ focuses on how he defines good leadership more generally. In this section, we’ll discuss Nadella’s leadership principles and his priorities as CEO.

### Key Principles of Good Leadership

Apart from empathy, Nadella**** writes that there are several key principles for anyone who wishes to become an effective and inspiring leader, regardless of their industry. We’ve synthesized his main points below.

#### 1) Put Your Team Ahead of Yourself

As a lifelong devotee of cricket, Nadella understands the importance of working together as a team. He writes that **individuals—no matter how talented—can destroy a team if they’re more concerned about personal glory rather than collective success**. Nadella himself is an example of someone who puts the team ahead of himself: In _Hit Refresh_ , he acknowledges how different team members help him lead Microsoft.

(Shortform note: Leaders who put themselves ahead of the team can be considered positional leaders—they think they’ve “arrived” by virtue of their title and are obsessed with protecting their position. In _The 5 Levels of Leadership_ , Maxwell writes that such leaders make others look bad to make themselves look good and use their position to their advantage instead of thinking about their responsibilities to the team. This is bad for the workplace because it results in low morale and a toxic work environment.)

He also writes about the importance of creating a “shared context” when leading a team. This means being able to get your team on board with your decisions. He relates that prior to becoming CEO, he was appointed to lead a new group and decided not to bring his old team with him. Each leader in the new group seemed to be operating autonomously, so Nadella met with each one individually and listened to what they had to say. This led to more openness and cooperation within the group.

(Shortform note: Nadella doesn’t go into detail about how to create a “shared context.” In _Team of Teams_ , Stanley McChrystal writes that one way you can build this shared context, or shared consciousness, is by adopting a policy of extreme transparency. This means sharing information so that everyone has an accurate, real-time view of the organization. In McChrystal’s case, he implemented a daily briefing, making use of technology so that others who weren’t at headquarters in Iraq could still participate.)

#### 2) Have Conviction and Believe in What You and Your Company Can Do

Nadella insists that his loyalty to Microsoft stemmed more from a belief in the company’s mission than in his own personal ambition: He believed that Microsoft could do a lot of good in the world through its democratizing approach to technology. To help inspire employee conviction when he became CEO, Nadella drafted a mission statement that defined the company’s beliefs and goals in a succinct and accessible way. This helped to give employees a sense of direction and a renewed sense of purpose.

(Shortform note: It’s important to find a common purpose as Nadella did because, according to the authors of _Tribal Leadership_ , doing so encourages people to come together and work effectively. To find a worthy purpose, the authors recommend asking four questions: 1) What’s working well? 2) What’s not working? 3) What can we do to make the things that aren’t working work? 4) Is there anything else?)

#### 3) Think Long-Term _and_ Short-Term

In order to spot opportunities and take smart risks, a company must always be considering how the decisions it makes today could affect both its own standing and the world around it over the long term. An example of this at Microsoft is Nadella’s approach to AI: While openly enthusiastic about AI’s potential, Nadella also stresses the importance of anticipating the disruptive effects it could have in the workforce. He argues that companies must plan ahead to help avoid inflicting hardship upon workers and find ways to make AI something that can boost efficiency while also avoiding making humans permanently unemployed. (We discuss this in more detail under Theme #5.)

(Shortform note: Part of the reason behind Microsoft’s decline was that it fell into the trap of short-term thinking, but this isn’t uncommon—it has become a serious problem for many American companies. To avoid the pitfalls of short-term thinking, experts recommend that companies decouple executive compensation from quarterly gains and prioritize long-term investors over short-term investors in a company.)

#### 4) Don’t Be Complacent

While Microsoft helped to pioneer the personal computer revolution in the 1980s and ’90s, it missed out on several other important technological trends, such as search engines (an area in which Google soon dominated), mobile phones, and—for a while—cloud computing. Nadella realized that Microsoft had grown too fixated on doing what it had always done, and that the key to remaining competitive as a business was to take risks and seek new opportunities for growth and product development. Armed with this realization, Nadella poured his energy into encouraging the development of Microsoft’s cloud computing and AI systems.

(Shortform note: Microsoft isn’t the first innovative company to be lulled into complacency by its success. In _Business Adventures_ , John Brooks describes how Xerox found massive success with its first copier, but new competitors were soon eating into its market share. This reminded Xerox leaders that they had to explore other fields and led to the establishment of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed some groundbreaking tech—including the graphical interface that led to the development of Windows. Unfortunately, Xerox executives missed out on capitalizing on PARC’s innovations. They remained hyperfocused on copiers, much like Microsoft execs relied heavily on Windows and Office.)

#### 5) Prioritize Corporate Culture

Nadella believes that as CEO, **his first and most important job is to foster a good corporate culture**. Thus, refreshing corporate culture was at the top of his priority list. (Shortform note: Nadella believes that culture is a crucial component of a corporation, but some warn that an overemphasis on culture can be damaging. In _Nine Lies About Work_ , the authors argue that companies might force employees to shed their individuality to conform to and preserve the company culture, ignoring the unique strengths they bring to a company.)

When he took over as CEO of Microsoft in 2014, he believed that the company had lost its soul and was no longer representative of its original core values. The corporate culture had grown toxic: The company had fallen behind its competitors and its employees were dissatisfied and disillusioned—surveys revealed that they didn’t feel like Microsoft was going in the right direction. Nadella thus sought to transform the culture into one that would lead to a positive, rejuvenated work environment for all employees.

> **Elements of a Strong Corporate Culture**
> 
> Prioritizing culture as Nadella did can lead to a more integrated and satisfied team, better overall communication, and an improved corporate image both internally and externally. If you’re looking for ways to improve your company’s culture, consider addressing the following elements:
> 
>   * **Involvement.** A strong culture is one that encourages the involvement of everyone, from the highest to the lowest ranks. Solicit employee feedback and ideas whenever possible to tap into everyone’s creativity.
> 
>   * **Values.** Make sure that conduct is consistent with the company’s stated values. Senior management should strive to set an example for lower-level employees by modeling ideal behavior.
> 
>   * **Coherence.** Foster clear interdepartmental communication and streamlined work processes to create a coherent and unified whole.
> 
>   * **Analysis.** Take frequent stock of what’s working and what isn’t to make sure your workflow is efficient and that your results are the best they can be.
> 
>   * **Transparency.** Avoid a culture of secrecy by always sharing with your employees what the company’s goals, struggles, and current approaches are.
> 
>   * **Recognition.** Ensure that employees feel appreciated by recognizing achievements and providing bonuses and incentives for those who excel in their roles.
> 
>   * **Flexibility.** Offer flexible work options whenever possible to help accommodate employee preferences and needs, such as remote working or time off for family obligations and personal engagements.
> 
>   * **Autonomy.** Empower your employees by delegating responsibilities to them and giving them autonomy to carry out their tasks. This builds trust between managers and employees to create a healthier workplace dynamic. ****

##### Foundations of the Renewed Microsoft Culture

Nadella transformed Microsoft’s corporate culture by:

**1) Speaking and listening to employees**. Nadella solicited honest feedback through his surveys and meetings, and made an open show of being open-minded and ready to listen. When he witnessed an employee being aggressive or negative toward others, he stepped in and tried to steer the interaction into a more positive direction. He emphasized to employees that change was needed, from top to bottom.

(Shortform note: Nadella puts into practice what Marshall B. Rosenberg describes in _Nonviolent Communication_ , a book that Nadella required managers at Microsoft to read. Rosenberg’s four steps to nonviolent communication are: 1) Observe without evaluating, 2) identify and express your feelings, 3) connect the feelings to your underlying needs, and 4) make specific requests, highlighting what you _do_ want others to do rather than what you _don’t_ want them to do.)

**2) Engaging with senior managers—and beyond.** Nadella hosted meetings in which senior managers could open up and share more personal experiences and ideas with one another. He also tried to build a context in which they could learn new things together, to foster a sense of momentum and bring them closer to one another as a team.

Beyond getting to know senior managers, Nadella argues that CEOs must remember that they lead an entire company, not just senior management. Thus, a CEO must always stay in touch with the broader base of employees, and they must seek decisions that benefit the company overall and not just one small part of it.

(Shortform note: Nadella practices one of John Maxwell’s _21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership_ : Leaders connect with others. Maxwell asserts that leading is more than just giving instructions. It means becoming emotionally engaged with followers so that they’ll be moved to follow you and work hard. He adds that leaders shouldn’t expect their followers to come to them; instead, leaders should initiate contact.)

**3) Clearly and** **succinctly defining Microsoft’s mission.** Nadella writes that having a clear mission inspires others and gives them a sense of direction. Before Nadella took over as CEO, the company didn’t have a clear mission—the executive team struggled to explain the corporate strategy to over 100,000 people across more than 190 countries. To get everyone on the same page, Nadella and his team streamlined and defined the company’s mission, worldview, objectives, and culture. The key message: Microsoft’s mission was **“to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.”**

(Shortform note: Nadella writes that he received hundreds of positive responses from employees who thought the new mission was inspiring and energizing. However, it wasn’t without its critics: One writer for the Financial Times took aim at the vagueness of the mission, writing, “Achieve more of what?” She argues that Microsoft’s old mission under Bill Gates—“a computer on every desk in every home”—was much more concrete and precise.)

By simplifying the message, they inspired people and enabled them to see how their work fit into the company, fostering a shared sense of purpose.

> **How to Create an Effective Mission Statement**
> 
> As Nadella has proven, a clear mission statement can inspire people and get them on the same page. To make your own mission statement, experts recommend that you:
> 
> **1) Build upon employee and customer feedback.** Launch a fact-finding mission to discover how your employees and customers view your company and what they want from you. This can help you better understand what your mission statement needs to zero in on before you begin crafting it.
> 
> **2) Narrow in on your most important values and goals.** Avoid wordiness and vagueness by targeting only what is essential: your most important corporate values and the main missions you have.
> 
> **3) Be concise and clear.** Any kind of insider jargon should be avoided in favor of clear, direct language that anyone can understand.
> 
> **4) Target your ideal client.** Imagine the person you’re trying to reach, and consider what they would need to know in order to understand what you stand for and what you offer, then build your statement around that.
> 
> **5) Define what makes you unique.** Make sure your statement openly defines what makes your company stand out from your competitors.

**4) Encouraging people to learn together as well as work together.** Nadella believes that team-building exercises and creating an environment in which constant learning is actively encouraged helps bind a team and encourages employee growth. It also contributes to innovation, as we’ll discuss in the next section.

> **Benefits of Team-Building Exercises**
> 
> Microsoft has an annual hackathon (to be discussed in the next session), which requires people across different departments to work together. There are many quick and effective team-building exercises you can do to facilitate employee bonding. While team-building exercises can be a lot of fun, they also help employees build valuable workplace skills, including:
> 
>   * **Better communication and interpersonal awareness.** Team-building exercises can be a great way to break the ice for new employees and help established employees get to know one another better.
> 
>   * **Problem solving.** Exercises that require creative and/or analytical thinking can sharpen problem-solving skills, which in turn can be applied to issues that arise in day-to-day working life.
> 
>   * **Effective planning and adaptability.** Exercises and games that require strategizing and adaptability of approach can help employees with developing more methodical thinking and flexibility.
> 
>   * **Trust and teamwork.** Virtually any exercise you do will help foster trust by encouraging employees to open up to one another and work together in new ways.
