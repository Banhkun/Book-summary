## Exercise: Assess McGilchrist’s Historical Arguments

McGilchrist argues that the left hemisphere’s continued influence threatens to upend contemporary society and leave us without meaning or happiness. In this exercise, reflect on McGilchrist’s predictions and propose ways to address the left hemisphere’s undue power.

* * *

In light of the hemisphere differences that McGilchrist cites, how would you describe your own relationship toward your left and right hemisphere? For example, do you resonate more with the specialties of one hemisphere in particular?

To what extent do you agree with McGilchrist that the left hemisphere is dominant in society today? Explain your answer.

Which ramifications of continued left hemisphere dominance are you most worried about? Why?

Which steps do you think we as a society (or as individuals) should take to keep the left hemisphere in check? Why?
