## Exercise: Consider Your Opinions About Elon Musk

Elon Musk is a divisive figure, seen by some as a technological visionary and others as a wanton disruptor. Isaacson paints a complicated portrait that suggests both propositions might be true. Think about how your impressions of Musk might have either changed or been reinforced by the material in his biography.

* * *

Isaacson describes how Musk’s traumatic childhood shaped how he interacts with the world as well as his mission in life. How does Musk’s ambition to positively impact the future make you feel about his behavior? To what extent can you empathize with Musk?

SpaceX has successfully commercialized spaceflight, while Tesla helped to popularize electric cars and their advantages. Which of these advances do you think will be the most important in the future? Why do you feel that way?

Musk’s purchase and rebranding of Twitter has angered many of the platform’s long-time users. Has this affected you personally, and if so, how? How has Musk’s handling of the business changed or reinforced your feelings about him?
