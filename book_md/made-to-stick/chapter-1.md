## Chapter 1: S—Simple

In the simplest terms, there are only two steps to making your message stick: 1) find the essence and 2) translate the essence into a compelling message using the SUCCESs template. This chapter explains the first step, while the rest of the book covers step 2.

The first sentence above is an example of what you need to do with your message. It distills the essence or core of this book to a single sentence, albeit not a scintillating one.

### Find the Essence

The “S” in the SUCCESs formula for creating “sticky” messages stands for “simple.” **Making your message simple doesn’t mean dumbing it down or making it simplistic like a typical sound bite.** Simplifying it just means determining the most important thing about it, the essence or core that holds it together like gravity.

It must focus on one thing, not multiple things. The challenging part is prioritizing your points and then eliminating all but one central point. **A simple, well-designed idea effectively shapes and guides others’ behavior.** The following are some examples of how core-focused messages are created and how they work.

#### The Commander’s Intent

Military operations require massive amounts of planning, starting with an order from the president that flows down through numerous levels, becoming increasingly specific and detailed so that ultimately it dictates the actions of foot soldiers and everyone in between. The process is time-consuming but necessary—commanders must think through all the potential issues and options. However, the plans often prove to be worthless. The saying is that “no plan survives contact with the enemy.” Things always change due to a huge number of variables.

**To make its planning more useful, the Army adopted the concept in the 1980s of “Commander’s Intent.”** It refers to a concise statement at the top of each order, defining the goal or intended outcome. All aspects and details are distilled to a central point. At a high level, the Commander’s Intent could be abstract (“Break the enemy’s will…”) while at ground level it’s concrete (“Clear Hill 45 to protect the flank of the First Brigade”). Plans may change but everyone is responsible for executing the intent.

The Commander’s Intent coordinates people’s actions, while allowing them to react to changing circumstances as they pursue a clear goal. **Finding the essence of your message is like writing a Commander’s Intent: focus on the most important thing.**

#### The Commander’s Intent at Southwest Airlines

Southwest Airlines is known for its obsession with finding ways to reduce costs. This goal has kept it profitable for decades and kept it ahead of its competition. But putting the cost-reduction goal into action requires communicating to thousands of employees what it means to them.

To do this, the airline has its own version of a Commander’s Intent, a simple message distilling cost reduction to its essence, which guides everyone’s actions: “Southwest is _the_ low-fare airline.” CEO Herb Kelleher once gave an example of how it works. A marketing director proposed giving passengers on the Houston to Las Vegas flight a chicken Caesar salad instead of just peanuts. Kelleher’s question was: “Will adding the salad make Southwest _the_ low-fare airline from Houston to Las Vegas?” The answer was no, so the salad idea was scrapped. The message works because any employee can apply the low-fare test to his or her actions: it’s about prioritization.

#### A Tool for Prioritizing: The Inverted Pyramid

Journalism provides a model for how to find and convey what’s most important in a memorable way. A reporter’s first sentence, or lead, contains the most important elements of the story. For example, here’s a 1995 Washington Post lead from a compilation by the American Society of Newspaper Editors:

“JERUSALEM, Nov. 4—A right-wing Jewish extremist shot and killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin tonight as he departed a peace rally attended by more than 100,000 in Tel Aviv, throwing Israel’s government and the Middle East peace process into turmoil.”

**News stories follow a structure called the inverted pyramid that presents the facts in decreasing order of importance** , with the most important at the top. It’s convenient for time-starved readers—they don’t have to read far to get the most important points. Also, stories can be shortened easily from the bottom. Supposedly, the inverted pyramid structure originated in the Civil War when stories were transmitted by telegraph—the connection could be lost at any moment, so reporters had to convey the most important information first.

Although reporters are trained to prioritize and distill information, they can still get lost in the details and have trouble finding the key point or essence of a story. **Missing the key point is referred to as “burying the lead.”**

When crafting your message, **think about what you’d want to say first, if you had to worry about losing your line of communication any second**.

> **‘It’s the Economy, Stupid’**
> 
> Most politicians like to talk, but as a presidential candidate in 1992, Bill Clinton was particularly susceptible to losing focus. He loved delving into policy details, answering media questions at length, and generally holding forth on any topic. Struggling to keep Clinton and his campaign focused, his political adviser James Carville one day wrote several phrases on a whiteboard. One of them was, “It’s the Economy, Stupid,” which became a central idea of the Clinton campaign.
> 
> Carville said he added with word “stupid” as a barb to remind campaign staff to not get too full of themselves. Clinton was frustrated by the constraint because he wanted to delve into the balanced budget issue being pushed by third-party candidate Ross Perot. But Clinton’s advisers insisted he stick to one “lead:” the economy. Multiple messages would be tantamount to having no message or burying the lead.

### Communicate the Essence

**Once you’ve zeroed in on your key point, you need to communicate it.** Knowing your priorities is one thing, but communicating and achieving them takes additional steps.

For example, Dunn, North Carolina newspaper publisher Hoover Adams encapsulated his top priority, providing relentlessly local coverage of his small community, in the phrase “Names, names, names.” The phrase was intended to remind reporters that covering the local community required getting local names into every story without exception.

But in addition to creating his message, he still needed to make it stick with his staff. He wrote a memo to convince them he wasn’t just paying lip service to the concept of “local first.” The memo was convincing because:

  * He used clear language. 
  * He used an analogy: The local mayor is as important in this community as the mayor of New York is to that city. 
  * He exaggerated for emphasis: if an atomic bomb fell on Raleigh, it wouldn’t be news in Dunn unless the ashes spread that far. 
  * He underscored that names were his priority, by saying he’d hire additional typesetters and add pages if reporters could get enough names to fill the space. His goal of publishing names was more important than the bottom line.



By identifying his top priority and communicating it in memorable terms, Adams ensured that “Names, names, names” was top of mind and guided each employee’s decisions like the force of gravity, whether the boss was present or not.

Adams’ clearly communicated, core-focused message has resulted in a paper read by 112% of the community, meaning that more newspapers are sold than there are households in Dunn.

#### Keep it Compact

“Names, names, names” worked because it was core and because Adams communicated it memorably. But it also worked for two more reasons: it was compact, meaning succinct, as well as profound. **A simple message is core (distilled to its essence), compact, and says something of value.**

Proverbs are an example of sticky messages that meet these criteria. Proverbs are compact distillations of wisdom that have lasted through centuries and cultures, guiding people’s behavior and ethics. The writer Miguel de Cervantes defined a proverb as “a short sentence based on long experience.”

Their stickiness is unparalleled. For instance, the proverb, “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire” exists in more than 55 languages. Versions of the “bird in hand” proverb have survived more than 2,500 years—without the help of an advertising campaign or social media.

Adams turned his core value, “Names, names, names,” into a journalistic proverb with impact and staying power. Compactness helps people learn and apply a core message.

#### How to Make it Compact

Making your message compact, particularly when you’re conveying a complex idea, is challenging. Here are three techniques: Tap into schemas, create a high-concept pitch, or use a generative analogy.

##### 1) Use Existing Knowledge: Tap Into People’s Schemas

A schema is basically a conceptual framework—information you’ve collected and mentally categorized based on generic properties—that you use to understand something complex. For instance, when someone mentions a sports car, your mind conjures up a picture of a typical sports car—small, red, two-door, convertible, fast—based on your past experience with sports cars.

To see how schemas work, imagine two ways you could describe an unfamiliar fruit to someone. One way would be to use a lot of detail: The pomelo, the largest citrus fruit, has a thick, soft rind that’s easy to peel. The fruit is light yellow to pink, varies from juicy to a bit dry, and tastes sweet, but tangy. This is a lot of information, but even so, it doesn’t convey the essence of the fruit.

However, using a schema (generic knowledge someone already has), you can instantly and understandably convey what a pomelo is: it’s an oversized grapefruit with a thick, soft skin.

“Grapefruit” is a schema—your grapefruit schema is a mental collection of generic properties including tangy flavor, yellow or pink color, a bit larger than a softball. This schema gives you a good idea of what the pomelo looks and tastes like. This second description is easier to understand and remember, even though it appears to contain less information than the first description.

**Schemas allow you to pack a lot of meaningful information into a simple statement**.

Teachers frequently use schemas to teach new or difficult concepts. For instance, some use the solar system model as a schema for how an atom works, with electrons orbiting the nucleus the way planets orbit the sun. This is an oversimplification (electrons actually travel in “probability clouds”), but the solar model provides a useful starting point—you have to keep your schemas simple in order for them to be useful and to avoid being sidetracked by the curse of knowledge.

##### 2) Create a Hollywood Pitch

**Analogies are a simple way to call up a schema**. For instance, you could use a simple analogy to describe a pomelo: A pomelo is like a grapefruit. Another example of an analogy is, “Life is like a box of chocolates” (Forrest Gump).

Hollywood producers use analogies to make “high-concept” (striking and easily communicated) pitches for new movie ideas. In just a sentence, the best ones can get the go-ahead for a $100 million movie. Besides attracting financial support, they also instantly tell everyone working on the movie what they’re aiming for.

Examples of high-concept pitches include “ _Die Hard_ on a bus” (for the movie _Speed) and “Big_ for girls” (_13 Going on 30_). Hollywood’s high-concept pitches are essentially industry proverbs.

##### 3) Use a Generative Analogy

**Generative analogies provide a model or platform the listener can use to generate additional insights**. For instance, psychologists have long used the brain-as-a-computer metaphor (a type of analogy) to inspire insights and investigations. Computer features such as memory and processors suggest (or “generate”) ways to think about the brain. Good analogies are thus “generative.”

Using a generative analogy to create a sticky idea, Disney refers to its employees as cast members. For instance, they _audition_ rather than interview for a job; their jobs are referred to as _performances_ , and whenever employees are in the park, they’re _on stage_. The cast member analogy generates insight into how they should behave—for instance, not smoking while in costume (uniform).

Proverbs are the ultimate in simplicity, compactness, and meaning. A core message with these characteristics isn’t easy to create, but the experiences of the U.S. Army, Southwest Airlines, and Disney show that the benefits are worth the effort.
