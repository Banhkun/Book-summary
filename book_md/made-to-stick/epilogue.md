## Epilogue: Practical Challenges

Following are some challenges and tips for putting the SUCCESs checklist into practice to make your ideas stick.

**1)** **If the message works, leave it alone** , even if it’s not exactly the message you intended. Once you’ve presented your idea, your audience owns it and may adapt it in ways you didn’t expect. They may change the meaning, compress it, or improve on it. For instance, Dodgers coach Leo Durocher is credited with the phrase, “Nice guys finish last,” but he actually said something longer and more complicated. For years, he denied the shortened version, but it stuck and he eventually gave up and used it as the title of his autobiography.

**2) To stay alert and able to spot useful ideas and stories** , imagine wearing a set of core idea lenses, allowing you to look at things from the perspective of how they might support your core idea. This is similar to the way you start keeping an eye out for an appropriate gift when you know someone’s birthday is coming up.

**3)** **Don’t worry about being a great speaker** —worry instead about telling the right story. A Stanford study showed that even when you have strong speaking skills, people don’t remember what you say, especially data, unless you make it sticky by telling a good story. Also beware of the curse of knowledge—communicate at the level of your audience.

**4) Use the SUCCESs checklist** to address these problems:

  * **They’re not listening.** Surprise them or create a mystery or puzzle that arouses curiosity and holds their attention.
  * **They’re not getting it.** Simplify your message and be concrete. Use a generative analogy or tell a story.
  * **They’re skeptical**. Build credibility with relevant details. Use someone who can speak from experience. 
  * **No one seems to care**. Tell a challenge story or a creativity story. Appeal to group identity.



**5)** **Remember that with sticky ideas, you can make a difference**. Think of Jane Elliott’s lesson on prejudice, Floyd Lee’s mess hall, Barry Marshall’s ulcer demonstration, Nora Ephron’s journalism teacher. Normal people in everyday situations, who know how to make ideas stick, have a profound impact.
