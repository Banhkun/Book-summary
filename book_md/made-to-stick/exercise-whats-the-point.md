## Exercise: What’s the Point?

For a message to “stick” with a listener it must be simple. The key to simplifying a message is determining the most important thing about it, the core that holds it together like gravity. It should also be compact, or succinct, and meaningful.

Think of a hobby, sport, or skill you’re expert in. If you were teaching it to someone, how would you encapsulate it in a simple sentence that would guide a newbie practicing your craft? Remember to avoid the “curse of knowledge”—think like a beginner rather than an expert.

Now, try incorporating a schema or analogy into your message.

Describe your job in a simple sentence for someone unfamiliar with the details of your field. What is the core or essence?
