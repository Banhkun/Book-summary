## Exercise: Spotting a Story

An inspirational story can help you get your message across. The key is spotting stories you can use. There are three common types: challenge stories, connection stories, and creativity stories.

* * *

Think of a story you read or heard recently that was inspiring and stuck in your mind. What made it inspiring? Was it a challenge, connection, or creativity story?

How did the story make you feel and act?

Think of something that you and your coworkers need to accomplish at work. What kind of story might improve your performance? Where could you look for such a story?
