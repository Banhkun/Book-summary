## Part 3.3: Use the Power of Prayer

Peale tells us that prayer can be a source of great power, helping to change your life positively, tapping forces and strength that aren’t normally available to you. Prayer can even restore physical health and well-being and is used by some therapists and other practitioners to help people with their health issues.

**Prayer is a manifestation of energy; you can generate spiritual energy through the mechanism of prayer.** Prayer power can help you feel youthful energy as you age, keep your spirits up, send you out each morning refreshed and renewed, guide you in solving problems, help you react properly to situations around you, and release your inner power.

(Shortform note: A 2009 study showed that prayer has a number of mental health benefits. Subjects who prayed regularly showed better emotional states, and less severe symptoms of anxiety and depression than those in the control (non-praying) group.)

### How to Pray

Perhaps you haven’t had this kind of experience with prayer. You may associate it only with religion, and not with creating change in your life. If so, understand that there is a scientific side to prayer, with different patterns and formulas that you can apply to get better results.

Peale advises us to **experiment with prayer power methods** ; new techniques are always being discovered to help harness the power of prayer. The idea is to find the method that works for you—that helps you open your mind to God, and let God’s power flow into your life.

> There are many different ways to pray; this article from JustDisciple offers 25 methods you can experiment with. A few examples are:
> 
>   * **Prayer journals.** Write down what you’re praying about, so that you have something physical to focus on.
> 
>   * **Group prayer.** This method is especially helpful when many people have the same wish, such as asking God to help an area that was struck by a natural disaster.
> 
>   * **Inner prayers.** Instead of just reciting prayers by rote and then moving on, pray silently, and listen for what God might be saying back to you.
> 
>   * **Routine prayers.** Set aside a time each day for prayers—the same time each day, if possible. Having a routine like this will make sure that you don’t skip your prayers, as well as strengthening your focus and your discipline.
> 
> 


### A 3-Part Prayer Formula

Peale suggests another prayer formula consisting of three parts: “pray,” “imagine,” and “create.”

  * **Pray:** Make prayer part of your normal routine. When a problem arises, for example, speak to God about it simply and directly. 
    * Pray during everyday activities. Prayer isn’t just something you do at church; it’s a part of everything. 
  * **Imagine** : When you want something to happen, first pray about it, and then picture it as if it’s already happened. Hold the picture firmly in your mind, and do whatever work you need to do to make it happen. 
  * **Create** : When you hold the image firmly in mind, what you’re imagining can become real; this works because you’ve invoked God’s power and released creative energy. 



Peale says that utilizing prayer power is a practical faith technique, and it isn’t always what people picture when they think of religion and prayer. **It can be used in business or any area of life.**

> **Should You Spread Your Power, or Focus It?**
> 
> _Think and Grow Rich_ , by Napoleon Hill, advocates a similar approach of using visualization and faith to will what you want into being. However, Hill’s advice has one key difference: Whereas Peale advises you to use imagination and prayer to handle day-to-day problems, Hill argues that you should focus your mind completely on one clear and defined purpose. In fact, he goes so far as to say that your goal should border on an obsession—that it should be all you imagine or think about.
> 
> There are benefits and drawbacks to each of these ideas. Peale’s method—using visualization and prayer to tackle individual issues as they arise—is a more balanced way to approach your life. However, Hill’s method of focusing all of your time and energy on a single purpose is more effective for achieving major life goals (assuming those goals are reasonably achievable).

### Prayer and Vibrations

Peale believes that everything in the universe is made up of vibrations. Prayer is simply sending out vibrations to God as well as from one person to another.

When you pray for someone else, you are sending that person a sense of support, love, and helpfulness. This process awakens vibrations in the universe, and God responds by helping to make whatever you’re praying for come to pass.

The author has made it a habit to send out prayers all day long to the people he encounters, even briefly, letting the power of God move through him, to the people he prays for, and back again to God, creating an endless loop of prayer power.

> Rhonda Byrne’s _The Secret _uses similar imagery to Peale’s “vibrations:” Byrne says that we’re like transmission towers sending out signals to the universe. Just as a television shows a picture based on the signals it receives, the signals we send out can shape the world around us. According to Byrne, by sending the right signals, we can create whatever kind of life we want for ourselves.
> 
> Byrne’s theory is an extension of the _Law of Attraction_ , a New Thought philosophy stating that positive people bring more positivity into their lives, while negative people only attract negativity. In short, **we attract the same kind of energy that we emit.**

### Techniques for Getting Results From Prayer

  * Pray out loud, using simple language. Talk to God naturally.
  * Pray during your daily activities. When you get the chance during the activity, shut your eyes to feel God’s presence.
  * Give thanks during your prayers; it’s not always about asking. 
  * When you pray for loved ones, know that your prayers can bring God’s love and protection to them.
  * Only use positive thoughts in prayer.
  * Truly accept God’s will—it may be better than what you’re asking for.
  * Put all your concerns in God’s hands. Do your best and leave the rest to God.
  * Pray for those who have wronged you. Resentment blocks your spiritual power.



> In this chapter and with these tips, Peale gives a “quick-fix” guide to prayer. While these are helpful incremental changes, Peale’s approach overlooks the fact that **it takes time and effort to become good at praying and to feel the full effects of it.**
> 
> _The Book of Joy_ , by the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, frames prayer as a muscle that needs to be built. They caution us to temper our expectations; deep, meditative prayer doesn’t come naturally to a lot of people, and getting good at it takes work.
> 
> However, if you continually practice Peale’s techniques for getting effective results from prayer, they should become easier and more rewarding for you over time.
> 
> To make prayer or meditation a regular practice, find the joy in it, don’t expect it to be a magic bullet, and take advantage of pockets of time during which you’d otherwise be on your phone, like when you’re waiting for your turn at the DMV.
