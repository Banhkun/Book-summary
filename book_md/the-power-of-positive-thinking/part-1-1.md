## Part 1.1: Faith | Have Faith in Yourself

Much of _The Power of Positive Thinking_ is about the importance of having faith in God. However, in this first chapter, Peale discusses the importance of having faith in _yourself_. He says that self-confidence is necessary for a happy and successful life because it helps you release your inner power—he’ll explain in later chapters how worry and anxiety impede the power of positive thinking.

However, Peale continues, not everyone has the necessary self-confidence to fully harness their power. Too many people are hampered by feelings of inadequacy, often called an “inferiority complex” or a lack of self-confidence. Inferiority complexes create barriers in our personalities, stopping us from achieving our full potential. They are often the result of emotional damage done to us in childhood, or may be the result of childhood circumstances.

(Shortform note: In the 1920s, Dr. Alfred Adler coined the term _inferiority complex_ to describe a disorder wherein a person has such low self-esteem that it interferes with his or her daily life. Interestingly, he also noted that low self-esteem can cause the opposite effect—a _superiority complex_ —where the person overcompensates for those feelings with an inflated sense of self.)

### Overcome an Inferiority Complex

Peale reassures us that it’s possible to overcome an inferiority complex and start believing in ourselves. Here’s his method:

  * **Analyze the root cause of your inferiority complex.** For instance, you may believe you’ll never amount to anything. Look at your life to find the root cause of this inferiority complex. 
    * Perhaps your older brother got straight A’s in school, but you only got C’s and felt like a disappointment to your family. Thus, you end up believing that you’re destined to get C’s for your whole life, and your brother is the one who will be a success.



(Shortform note: Many people find the root causes of their self-esteem issues in their childhood experiences, such as overly critical parents or poor performance in school. However, the same problems can come from an abusive partner, life events like divorce and unemployment, or ongoing medical issues, just to give a few examples.)

  * **Develop a deep faith in God**. Peale argues that developing a deep faith in God will give you faith in yourself. **The key to acquiring faith is prayer.** More detailed prayer techniques and formulas will be discussed in a later chapter, but for now, it’s important to note that the _type_ of prayer is important—the bigger your problem, the bigger and more heartfelt your prayer should be.



(Shortform note: If you don’t want to use Peale’s concept of God (the Christian God), this would be an excellent time to decide what your Higher Power will be. It doesn’t even have to be a specific entity; some people use vague concepts like “energy” or “the universe” as their Higher Power.)

  * **Fill your mind with “confidence concepts.”** We build up our security or insecurity by how we think. When our thoughts are filled with fears of what might happen, the result is a feeling of constant insecurity. We can even create what we fear (a “self-fulfilling prophecy”).**** However, when our thoughts are filled with faith, courage, security, and confidence, all thoughts of doubt are expelled, and we allow our potential power to be set free. **You can train yourself to replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts.** This is called “thought-disciplining;” it re-educates the mind and boosts your power.



> In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, _Robin Sharma suggests a similar technique, which he calls opposition thinking: You recognize when you’re having a negative thought, and replace it with a positive thought.
> 
> For example, if you catch yourself thinking, “I messed up that presentation, that must mean I’m stupid and worthless,” you could replace it with the thought, “Everyone makes mistakes, and one presentation doesn’t define my career or my life.”
> 
> Peale’s “confidence concepts” and Sharma’s “opposition thinking” both rely on the fact that you can only hold one thought at a time; therefore, by filling your mind with positive thoughts, you leave no room for negative ones.

  * **Develop a confident and optimistic attitude.** A confident and optimistic attitude can help you overcome difficulties. Psychiatrist Karl Menninger said it best: “Attitudes are more important than facts.“ It doesn’t matter what awful thing you’re going through; your attitude about it can modify or even overcome the experience. 
    * To help develop a confident attitude, try making a list of all the things you see as positive about yourself—your assets. This helps you stop thinking about all the forces that are against you and steers your thoughts toward the forces working for you.



> Dale Carnegie’s 1948 book _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living _suggests various methods for developing the sort of positive, confident attitude that Peale suggests here. A few examples are:
> 
>   * **Recognize minor problems for what they are.** If you take a step back and think about the situation, you’ll often find that you’re overreacting to something that’s really just an annoyance or an inconvenience. For example, if you’re getting angry because your flight was delayed, ask yourself whether that’s really going to ruin your entire vacation experience.
> 
>   * **Consider probability.** If you’re worried about a particular event or outcome, ask yourself how likely it really is. For example, some people are afraid of flying, but dying while on an airplane is extremely unlikely. According to one study, the odds that you’ll die in a car crash are approximately 1 in 107, while the odds that you’ll die on an airplane are too low to calculate.
> 
>   * **Set limits.** Ask yourself how much time and energy you’re really prepared to spend worrying about something, then stick to that decision. For example, if you have a friend who always shows up 30 minutes late, next time you make plans tell him or her that you’ll only wait for 10 minutes and then you’ll leave. Either your friend will get there in time, or you’ll have only lost 10 minutes instead of 30.
> 
>   * **Let go of the past.** Remember that what’s done is done; no amount of worry or regret can change it. Learn from your past experiences, but don’t waste time and energy brooding on them.
> 
> 


  * **Know that God is with you and helping you.** This is a simple, yet powerful belief that, when practiced, can boost your self-confidence. To do this, practice saying this affirmation: “God is with me; God is helping me; God is guiding me.” Repeat this affirmation, visualize God’s presence, and **practice believing this affirmation.**



(Shortform note: Scientific studies have shown that affirmations have positive effects on people’s confidence and sense of self-worth. If you aren’t using God as your Higher Power, you may find it helpful to replace Peale’s suggested affirmation with one of your own choosing.)

### Techniques for Building Self-Confidence

Peale offers these suggestions to boost your faith in yourself.

  * Visualize yourself succeeding. Hold onto this picture and never let it fade. Don’t ever think of yourself as failing; always picture success no matter how bad things get.
  * Don’t inflate your problems in your mind; minimize them instead.
  * When you feel a negative thought about yourself creeping in, immediately stamp it out with a positive thought.
  * Don’t be impressed by other people or try to copy them. You’re every bit as impressive as they are.
  * Get counseling to understand the root causes of your feelings of inferiority.
  * Assess your own ability honestly—and then raise that estimation by 10 percent. 
  * Choose an inspirational quote that resonates with you (Peale suggests a Bible quote). Say that quote aloud ten times each day.
  * Say and feel the words, “I am putting myself in God’s hands.” Understand that you can overcome any obstacle with God’s help.



> Peale’s rules for self-confidence are a diverse array of self-help strategies, primarily falling into three categories:
> 
>   * **Visualization techniques:**Visualization is a sort of “active meditation” where you imagine what you want as clearly as you can. Practitioners believe that holding an image in your mind will spur you to turn it into reality.
> 
>   * **Affirmations:** An affirmation is an assertion of something—in this case, an assertion that you can accomplish anything. Affirmations are common techniques for building confidence and self-esteem. In essence, you repeat positive thoughts to yourself until you believe them.
> 
>   * **Professional counseling:** Peale acknowledges that there are some issues we simply can’t work through with prayer and faith alone. In those cases, we should seek professional help to truly understand our problems and how we can start to fix them.
> 
> 

> 
> However, one important thing that Peale leaves out of this list is _physical activity_ and the connection between physical health and mental health. Mental health conditions like anxiety and depression can seriously harm your physical health—both because they put you under a lot of stress and because they make it harder to take proper care of yourself. Conversely, **regular exercise can helpreduce the symptoms of those conditions.**
