## Part 3.4: Stop Fretting and Gain Peace

We often make life more difficult for ourselves by getting agitated and worked up about situations. Peale calls this “fuming and fretting.” **To gain power and live life to the fullest, he urges us to overcome that agitation; to find our calm and our focus.** Here are several ways you can do that:

### Slow Down

Peale’s first step is to reduce the frantic pace of life. Many people drive themselves too hard and too fast, and this tempo leads to overstimulation, which can cause physical and emotional sickness. Slowing down brings you back in line with God’s pace. God’s pace is unhurried; things get done when they are meant to get done. **When you slow down and practice being peaceful, you will feel a sense of quiet power rise within you.**

Another aspect of slowing your pace is to infuse the peace of God into your mind, soul, and body. By getting the peace of God into your body, you may experience less pain. To do this, relax and think of each muscle and reflect on the peace of God touching it.

> _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ explores the ways in which society constantly drives us to want more of everything, with the result that we never slow down—we’re constantly stressed, exhausted, and unhappy.
> 
> Like Peale, Manson finds this unhealthy and unsustainable. Manson suggests that we take a hard look at our lives, **determine what’s actually important, and stop giving a f*ck about everything else.** Commit yourself deeply to just a few things (for example: your marriage, charity work, or a hobby that you’re passionate about), instead of chasing every fad and passing high that advertising and social media push on you.

### Think Peaceful Thoughts

**Thinking peaceful thoughts will help you attain a peaceful way of life, teaching you to tap new resources of strength.** This is Peale’s antidote to anxiety and agitation.

Just as we have a series of daily actions designed to keep our bodies healthy (brushing teeth, exercising, bathing), we must give time and effort to keeping our mind healthy.

One method is to sit quietly and run a series of peaceful thoughts through your mind, for example the memory of a beautiful place you once visited. It’s recommended you do this once every 24 hours, preferably when you’re at your busiest, and practice being calm and serene.

> Peale suggests that we meditate once a day, but doesn’t mention how long it will take to achieve results.
> 
> In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , Sharma recommends a similar practice: Taking 15-50 minutes each day to sit quietly with your own thoughts. You’ll probably find even 15 minutes difficult at first; however, as you continue to practice, that time will keep increasing.

### The Mental Follows the Physical

Another step toward achieving calm is to control your physical reactions. Peale suggests you start by keeping physically still. Don’t move, pace, wring your hands, or let yourself get worked up. Sit, stand still, or lie down. A physical attitude can guide your mental attitude, diffusing all the emotional heat you may be feeling.

Peale says to practice being indifferent or “sluggish” if you’re too keyed up. This will bring you back to a more balanced emotional state.

> Naturally, the times when we’re stressed and overwhelmed are when we’ll find it hardest to sit quietly in prayer or meditation. However, **that’s exactly when we need it the most.**
> 
> There’s an old Zen proverb that teaches that lesson. The proverb says that you should meditate for 20 minutes every day. If you don’t think you have time for that, then you should meditate for an hour every day.
> 
> In other words, if you’re so busy that you don’t want to take 20 minutes to meditate, that’s a sure sign that you need to calm down and recenter yourself—to practice being relaxed and indifferent.

### Techniques to Reduce Your Fretting

To help you reign in your anxiety and help restore you to a peaceful, calm state, Peale suggests you picture your mind as the surface of a stormy lake and watch as the lake becomes calm. Then think about a peaceful scene you once saw. Finally, think about times in your life when you were worried and anxious, but God took care of you and everything turned out fine, and repeat this phrase from Isaiah 26:3: “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.” These words will help relieve your mind of tension.

> A more practical option that Peale doesn’t mention is to **have a fallback plan in case the thing you’re afraid of comes true.**
> 
> For example, Phil Knight (co-founder of Blue Ribbon Sports, which is known today as Nike) passed a CPA exam to become an accountant when his company's future was looking treacherous. As a result, Knight knew that he could fall back on something if his business didn't work out. That gave him the security and confidence to continue running his business, and grow it into the giant corporation it is today.
