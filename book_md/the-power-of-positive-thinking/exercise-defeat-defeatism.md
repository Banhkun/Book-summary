## Exercise: Defeat Defeatism

Understand that with faith, all things are possible.

* * *

Peale says that all the “little negatives” in our daily conversations can add up to create a negative mindset that blocks our faith in ourselves. What is a particular “little negative” you find yourself saying regularly? What can you replace it with?

One way of taking a positive approach to a problem is to attack it from the angle of least resistance—in other words, to find the easiest way to solve it. What is a specific problem you are facing now? What is the “least resistance” approach to this problem?

Write down a current problem you are facing. Crumple up the paper and throw it in a basket, imagining and believing that you’ve put the problem into God’s hands. Go back to the problem a few days later. Does it seem less insurmountable? Did you gain any insight on the problem?
