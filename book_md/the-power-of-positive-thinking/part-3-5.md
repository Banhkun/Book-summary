## Part 3.5: Stop Worrying

Worry is a destructive and unhealthy mental habit that can actually cause health problems. The word worry is derived from a word whose literal meaning is “to choke.” **Think of worry as choking the flow of your power.**

Peale adds that worry is also dangerous; when you fear something for a long time, you can actually draw that thing to you. In other words, you might cause the very thing you fear happening.

> It may help us to first get a working definition of “worrying”—what _exactly_ is Peale warning us against here?
> 
> In _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, _Dale Carnegie starts with a simple but effective definition: **Worrying is when you focus on something outside of the present moment.** Thus, the solution to worrying is simply to stop doing that; instead, take life one day at a time and be fully present in each moment, instead of thinking about the past or the future.
> 
> Unfortunately, letting go of your worries is easier said than done. This chapter will offer some practical techniques to help you get started.

### Attack the Small Worries First

Peale likens eliminating worries to cutting down a large tree. First, tree cutters snip off small branches, followed by bigger ones, and then the top. The trunk is last but is brought down more easily since it has been stripped of all branches.

Think of your worries as a big tree built up over a number of years. It’s much more manageable to make it as small as possible by **cutting off the little worries rather than trying to attack the whole thing at once**. Eventually, you’ll snip off all the smaller worries and hit the main trunk of worry, but at this point, you’ll have developed the skills to defeat worry and eliminate the worry habit entirely.

One way to cut small worries is to stop using worry words in your conversation and replace them with faith words. For example, instead of saying, “I’m worried that I'll be late,” vow to leave extra early so that there’s no chance of being late. Without worry, your mind is clearer, making it more likely that you’ll be timely.

> _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ has some useful advice on how to make major changes, such as letting go of worries. Much like Peale suggests that you attack your small worries first, Manson says that in order to make _any_ major change, the key is to start with something easy. Accomplishing a small, easy goal will then motivate you to take the next step.
> 
> For example, if you want to develop more empathy, your first goal might be to simply listen to someone else’s problem. Hearing that problem might make you want to help. Wanting to help could drive you to think of a solution, and then implement it. **Each small step drives the next, and eventually you reach your larger goal of developing empathy.**

### Let Go of the Past

**Create a ritual that will help you move on at the end of each day, without dwelling on whatever hardships you faced or whatever mistakes you might have made.** For example, as you leave your office at the end of each day, you could place your hand on the doorframe and take a deep breath. As you exhale, release all the day’s negative energy into the frame and leave it there as you walk away.

A ritual like this will provide a “bookend” to your day: a clear sign that it’s now in the past, and not worth worrying about.

> Tara Brach, in _Radical Acceptance_ , offers a Buddhist perspective on worrying: **Obsessing over the past and worrying about the future are unhealthy coping mechanisms.** They create the illusion of control in our lives but disconnect us from our moment-to-moment experiences.
> 
> We must realize that thinking about the past and the future only serves to build up walls around our present experiences. Instead, we should simply accept each experience (positive or negative) as it comes, and move on with life once the experience has passed.

### Techniques to Defeat Worry

We’ll end with Peale’s other tactics to defeat worry. Like most of the book, he focuses on overcoming worry with faith and positivity:

  * Understand that worrying is a bad habit—one that God can help you replace with a faith habit.
  * Practice faith by repeating “I believe” three times out loud first thing in the morning.
  * Say a prayer where you place the day in God’s hands, knowing that only good things can come from God.
  * Speak positively. Use only positive words in relation to anything you’ve been negative about in the past.
  * Don’t join in conversations where people are worrying about something. Instead, add faith and positivity to the conversation. Better yet, find hopeful, positive people to be around. This will help you maintain a faith attitude.



> **Defeat Worry With Reason**
> 
> As is typical of his philosophy, Peale advises us to overcome worry with faith and positivity. While positivity is an important aspect of coping with anxieties, focusing solely on positivity excludes other valid approaches to dealing with worry.
> 
> For instance, **Marcus Aurelius suggests adding reason to your toolkit.** In _Meditations_ , Aurelius contends that worrying is useless (it won’t fix anything), and he suggests that we overcome worry by approaching every situation rationally.
> 
> First, Aurelius advises us to **see things for what they really are, instead of getting distracted by the hype or the stories built up around them.** For example, if you’re stressed because you can’t afford the luxury car you want, consider what that car really is: A collection of metal and plastic that helps you get from one place to another. There’s no reason to spend so much money on it, when you could get a much cheaper one that works equally well.
> 
> Secondly, he advises us **not to concern ourselves with what other people think and do.** The only person you can control is yourself; worrying about what someone else thinks is a waste of time and energy.
> 
> Finally, Aurelius says to **distinguish between what’s really important and what’s trivial.** When we consider things rationally, we’ll realize that **a lot of what we do isn’t worth the time and effort we spend on it.** By focusing only on what’s important (Aurelius would say our duties, but your personal beliefs about what’s important may vary), we avoid exhausting ourselves worrying about things that are _not_ important.
