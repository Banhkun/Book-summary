### The Book’s Publication

_The Power of Positive Thinking_ was originally published in 1952 by Prentice Hall. The book was on the New York Times’s bestseller list for three and a half years and was the Times’s #1 nonfiction bestseller for almost a full year.

Since then, _The Power of Positive Thinking_ has been reprinted numerous times and translated into dozens of languages. We wrote this guide using the 2003 Touchstone edition (ebook).

**Publisher:**Simon & Schuster

**Imprint:**Touchstone (defunct)

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

_The Power of Positive Thinking_ came out in 1952, a time when the U.S. population—and its interest in Christianity—was growing quickly. The surging church attendance was due at least in part to the Cold War: The threat of nuclear war drove many to seek comfort in religion. Also, as the U.S. was still recovering from the Great Depression and World War II, struggling people flocked to Peale’s promises that faith and positive thinking would bring them prosperity.

#### Intellectual Context

Several notable self-help books related to positive thinking and confidence came out in the early 20th century. James Allen’s 1902 book _As a Man Thinketh _argued that we quite literally become what we think about—that a person is defined by his or her thoughts—and therefore positive thoughts will lead to a positive life.

Napoleon Hill’s 1937 bestseller _Think and Grow Rich _took the concept a step further, drawing on the ideas of the 19th century New Thought Movement: Hill believed that thoughts not only shape a person’s character, but that person’s entire life experience. In other words, if you know what you want and pursue it with single-minded focus, you can _imagine_ your perfect life into reality.

_The Power of Positive Thinking_ adds what Peale calls “faith power” to the equation. For Peale, it wasn’t enough to simply imagine what you wanted; you had to ask God (or your “Higher Power” of choice) to help you create your ideal life. According to Peale, deep meditation and earnest prayer are the keys to taking control of your mind and your life.

More recently “New Age Philosophy” has taken these ideas to the extreme with books like Rhonda Byrne’s _The Secret_ , which puts total faith in the power of belief to create desired outcomes and shape reality—for good or ill.

#### The Book’s Impact

_The Power of Positive Thinking_ is one of the best-selling non-fiction books ever written, having sold some 15 million copies at the time of Peale’s death. Readers all over the world say that Peale’s message changed their lives for the better. For example, former U.S. President Donald Trump—whose family attended Peale’s NYC church—credits The Power of Positive Thinking __ for much of his personal and business philosophy.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Many people laud _The Power of Positive Thinking_ for its depth and practicality. For example, this review from Citywire compares the book to a bag of reliable and often-used tools for clearing away pessimism and despair.

Others, however, find Peale’s heavy reliance on God and the Bible to be off-putting. Some argue that the book’s methods are shallow and outdated; that they boil down to, “Just pray enough and everything will be fine.” Readers also criticize Peale’s reliance on anecdotes instead of scientific evidence.

Even other preachers criticized Peale’s work, saying that it wasn’t in line with the church’s teachings—they argued that God decides what happens to us; we don’t ask Him for what we want. Others said that the teachings weren’t wasn’t framed in proper clerical language; Peale acknowledged that they were right, but countered that he’d written _The Power of Positive Thinking_ in simple, secular language because he meant it for everyday people.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Peale wrote _The Power of Positive Thinking_ in the hopes that everyday people would use the lessons it taught. Therefore, the book uses simple language and approachable concepts, and it includes a large number of anecdotes to illustrate Peale’s points.

While _The Power of Positive Thinking_ does succeed in presenting lessons that laypeople can understand and follow, the heavy emphasis on religion (specifically Christianity) may deter some modern readers from embracing them.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Individual chapters read somewhat like sermons: Peale teaches a lesson and illustrates it with stories about people who have benefited from that lesson. Some chapters end with lists of suggestions about how to put the lesson into practice.

However, the book as a whole is scattered, and later chapters tend to circle back to topics that Peale covered earlier. For example, the book’s final chapter is about _how_ to draw upon your “Higher Power” (that is, God) to help you through hard times—something that Peale encourages you to do from the beginning of the book.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ll compare and contrast Peale’s Christianity-based ideas with those found in other schools of thought, both religious and secular. Additionally, we’ll examine ways to put Peale’s suggestions into practice, regardless of your personal faith (or lack of it).

We’ll also organize Peale’s lessons into three categories: Faith (underlying beliefs), Positive Thinking (mindset), and Practices (good habits and practical techniques). By rearranging the book in this way, we’ll clarify what each of Peale’s teachings is meant to help you with, and make it easier for you to find and study specific topics.
