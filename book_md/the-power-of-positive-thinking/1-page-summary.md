## 1-Page Summary

In _The Power of Positive Thinking_ , Norman Vincent Peale says there is no problem or obstacle you can’t overcome with faith, positive thinking, and prayer. This self-help classic outlines the practical techniques of applied Christianity to help you take control of the events in your life rather than be directed by them. As a result of these methods, Peale says you can enjoy better relationships, a greater sense of well-being, robust health and energy, and a stronger sense of purpose in the world.

Peale was a Reformed minister who served as the pastor of Marble Collegiate Church in New York City from 1932-1984. He was also an influential author and public speaker, largely because of _The Power of Positive Thinking's success_.

Peale held a Master of Arts degree in Social Ethics from Boston University, and a Doctor of Divinity degree from Syracuse University.

> While Peale—who was a Christian minister—drew upon his faith for inspiration and strength, you don’t have to be Christian yourself to benefit from _The Power of Positive Thinking_.
> 
> In many ways, _The Power of Positive Thinking_ is comparable to _Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book. _Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was also founded based on Christian teachings and beliefs, but it has expanded to welcome people of all faiths, as well as those who don’t follow any religion.
> 
> To do so, AA reframed God and “Higher Power” (both phrases are prominent in the _Big Book_) to mean any power that you accept as greater than yourself.

Peale’s ideas fall into three categories:

  * **Faith** (underlying beliefs) 
  * **Positive Thinking** (mindset) 
  * **Practices** (good habits and practical techniques)



Those three categories form the foundation of his system for living a rich, fulfilling life and accomplishing your goals. We’ll begin with Faith, as your underlying beliefs are the basis for everything you do. Next, we’ll discuss Positive Thinking, which is about actively keeping yourself in a healthy, happy, and productive mindframe. Finally, we’ll move on to specific, practical techniques that Peale suggests for putting his ideas into practice.

In this guide, we’ll compare and contrast Peale’s Christianity-based ideas with those found in other schools of thought, both religious and secular. Additionally, we’ll examine ways to put Peale’s suggestions into practice, regardless of your personal faith (or lack of it).

### Part 1: Faith

The first part of Peale’s system is Faith—meaning both faith in the religious sense, and faith in yourself. Peale believes that both types of faith are necessary in order to achieve your goals and live your best life.

#### Have Faith in Yourself

Peale says that **faith in yourself is important to a happy and successful life.** Self-confidence leads to achievement and self-realization, helping you release your inner power.

However, Peale adds, not everyone has the power to believe in themselves. Too many people are hampered by feelings of inadequacy, often called an “inferiority complex.” To build up self-confidence, he suggests that you **understand the root causes of your sense of inferiority and develop faith in yourself through prayer.** He also suggests that you discipline your thoughts by filling your mind with “confidence concepts:” positive affirmations that remind you of your own worth and importance. Finally, he advises you to keep an optimistic attitude in the face of difficulties and remember that God is with you**.**

(Shortform note: Many people find the root causes of their self-esteem issues in their childhood experiences, such as overly critical parents or poor performance in school. However, the same problems can come from an abusive partner, life events like divorce and unemployment, or ongoing medical issues, just to give a few examples.)

#### Restore Health With Faith

Peale contends that faith can be a powerful factor in overcoming health obstacles. From his readers and listeners, Peale received numerous examples of healing in which the element of faith is present. In each of these instances, the best resources of medical and psychological science are used in combination with spiritual resources.

In the cases of faith-enhanced healing Peale investigated, he found certain factors to be present. First, the patient is willing to surrender their health into God’s hands. Second, they let go of sin and want their soul cleansed. Third, they believe in the combination of medical resources and the healing power of God. Fourth, they are willing to accept whatever answer God has for them. Finally, they have an unquestioning faith that God can heal.

> A researcher’s review of scientific studies on faith healing didn’t reach any strong conclusions about its efficacy. Some of the studies showed that faith healing had positive impacts on health, others showed no effect at all, and a few even showed that faith healing had a negative impact on the patient. Furthermore, the author of the review noted that there are a lot of uncontrolled variables, which make the outcomes of any study on faith healing suspect at best.
> 
> However, Peale isn’t advocating for faith healing alone—he repeatedly says that **faith power should be used alongside __ science-based medicine.** Whether you believe in divine intervention or think that faith healing is just the placebo effect in action (recovering because you believe that you’re getting help), Peale’s suggestion that we use every type of help available to us is a good one.

#### Use the Power of Prayer

Prayer can be a source of great power, helping to change your life positively, tapping forces and strength that aren’t normally available to you. Prayer can even restore physical health and well-being, and it’s used by therapists and other practitioners to help others.

Peale sees prayer as a manifestation of energy and says that there are ways to release spiritual energy through the mechanism of prayer. Prayer power can slow down the aging process, helping you keep youthful energy as you age. Prayer can help keep your spirits up, send you out each morning refreshed and renewed, guide you in solving problems, help you react properly to situations around you, and release power and keep power flowing freely.

(Shortform note: Studies show that there is a strong connection between mental health and physical health; each bolsters (or harms) the other. Peale suggests prayer as a way to cultivate inner peace, which in turn promotes outer health.)

### Part 2: Positive Thinking

Now that we’ve discussed the underlying beliefs that make Peale’s system possible, we’ll move on to the thought patterns and attitudes that he says will help us to live happy, fulfilling lives.

#### Decide to Be Happy

**We create our own happiness in this life.** Peale believes that one way of choosing happiness is to cultivate the habit of being happy. When you develop the happiness habit, life becomes more enjoyable every day. Because habits are something you can cultivate, you have the power to create your own happiness.

You develop the happiness habit by thinking happy thoughts. Peale recommends making a mental list of happy thoughts and running them through your mind throughout the day. If an unhappy thought pops in, eject it by substituting a happy thought.

> _Atomic Habits _by James Clear teaches you how to intentionally form a new habit, such as the happiness habit that Peale recommends here.
> 
> There are four parts to a habit:
> 
>   * **Cue.** This is what triggers the habit, the way the smell of cigarette smoke might make a smoker want to indulge. For Peale’s happiness habit, the cue might be waking up in the morning, or feeling negative emotions creeping in.
> 
>   * **Craving.** This is the emotional response that the cue triggers. In other words, it’s what prompts you to perform your habit. For someone with a happiness habit, the craving would be the desire to feel good.
> 
>   * **Response.** This is the actual behavior, like when the smoker from the previous example lights a cigarette. With a happiness habit, the response would be doing as Peale suggests: replacing a negative thought with a positive one.
> 
>   * **Reward.** This is the satisfaction you gain from performing your habit. As your brain comes to associate that satisfaction with the previous three steps, you’ll form a habit.
> 
> 

> 
> In short, you’ll remember what prompted you to do a certain thing, and that you felt better after doing that thing. Therefore, you’ll be compelled to keep repeating that behavior.

#### Expect the Best and Get the Best

Peale insists that when you expect the best in life, you get the best. When you expect the worst, that’s what you get. When you change your mental habits to a state of constant belief instead of doubt, everything becomes possible. Doing so requires faith.

Your thoughts are powerful; they dictate the type of life you lead, the kind of person you are, and the experiences you have. Positive thoughts create positive outcomes; negative thoughts lead to negative outcomes.

If you’re unhappy with your current circumstances, Peale suggests remaking your life by getting rid of your old, negative thoughts and filling your mind with new thoughts that reflect faith, creativity, love, and goodness. When you start thinking differently, the conditions around you will change.

> In _Awaken the Giant Within,_ Tony Robbins suggests beginning to break out of doubtful, self-defeating thoughts or expecting the worst with a two-step process: 1) Identify a problem (large or small) that you can fix, and 2) fix it.
> 
> It sounds simplistic, but the act of **consciously recognizing and fixing a problem** will begin to show you that you’re _not_ helpless, and that you _can_ accomplish what you set your mind to. According to Peale, your faith will give you the courage to begin this process.

#### Defeat Is Not an Option

When you think about defeat, you tend to get defeated. Instead, Peale advises, **adopt a mindset where you don’t believe in defeat.** This mindset requires faith; remember one of Peale’s favorite Bible passages, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (Philippians 4:13).

**The first step is to not be afraid of whatever obstacle you’re facing; instead, stand up to it.** Practice believing God is with you, and that together you can handle whatever the problem is. When you stand up to your obstacles, the obstacles don’t seem quite as strong.

> In this section, Peale warns against the fear of defeat. _Purple Cow_ , by marketing guru Seth Godin, offers a tidbit on the dangers of fear.
> 
> Godin says that fear creates a logical paradox:
> 
>   * When things are going badly, we think we can’t afford to take risks.
> 
>   * When things are going well, we think we don’t need to take risks.
> 
> 

> 
> In short, fear paralyzes us—we’ll always find a reason not to act. Peale is suggesting that we adopt a mindset where defeat doesn’t exist so that we don’t get paralyzed by that fear.

#### We Create Our Own Obstacles

Another reason Peale believes that positive thinking is important is that the way we handle obstacles stems from our mental attitudes.**In fact, most of our obstacles are mental in nature.** Even when there is an external problem, our attitude toward that obstacle still dictates our response.

Peale says that, if you take the mental attitude that an obstacle is impossible to overcome, you won’t get past it. **But, when you firmly believe that the obstacle is removable, you start the process that leads to the obstacle’s defeat.**

We all face difficulties and obstacles. While real, they aren’t as insurmountable as they seem. Peale advises you to keep faith, believe that God has given you the power to lift yourself out of the situation, and affirm that you have the power to do anything.

> **Use Faith or Reason Against Obstacles**
> 
> While Peale suggests that we overcome obstacles with faith, other schools of thought claim that we can do so with logic.
> 
> Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations_ is one of the definitive books on Stoicism. In it, Aurelius urges us to examine every situation rationally, instead of emotionally. By doing so, Aurelius says, we’ll realize that the only thing that can really impede us is ourselves—no external force can prevent us from doing what we know is right, or force us to do something that we know is wrong. Therefore,**the only reason we haven’t been able to overcome a certain obstacle is that we’ve convinced ourselves that we can’t do it; that the situation is too difficult or too unfair.**
> 
> In truth, all we have to do for any problem is approach it rationally, determine the solution, and then do what needs to be done. To give a simple example: If you’re about to eat an apple and you find that it’s rotten, you simply throw it away. You immediately recognize that there’s no benefit to complaining about the rotten apple, or keeping it in your house; **you just solve the problem and move on.**

### Part 3: Practices

For this third and final section, we’ll examine some of the specific, practical techniques and habits that Peale advises us to use.

#### Cultivate a Peaceful Mind

Peale points out that living with strain and anxiety is difficult, while living in a state of harmony makes for an easy, calm existence. **There are several methods by which you can gain a mind full of peace, serenity, and calm attitudes:**

  * Empty your mind of fear, insecurities, regrets, and other negative emotions; you’ll experience relief and release. After you empty your mind, refill it with positive, healthy thoughts and peaceful images. 



(Shortform note: While Peale doesn’t explain how to empty your mind of negativity, one way is the Jewish ritual of _tashlich_ (“casting away”). On the first day of Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish new year), congregants symbolically cast their sins—often physically represented by bread crumbs—into a body of running water. This ritual helps Jews to let go of their fears and regrets from the past year, and face the coming year with a fresh mindset.)

  * Use peaceful words and engage in peaceful conversations during your daily life. 



(Shortform note: What Peale calls “suggestive articulation” is a practice more commonly referred to as reciting a _mantra_ ; a word or simple phrase that you can repeat many times in a row. Doing so focuses your attention and your willpower on what you want to do, or who you want to be. For example, someone struggling with self-esteem issues might repeat, “I am strong, I am intelligent, I am worthy.”)

  * Find time to sit in silence. 



> The two exercises that Peale suggests—emptying your mind and sitting in silence—are different forms of meditation.
> 
> The first is a variation on _candle meditation_. The idea of candle meditation is to either look at a candle flame or picture one in your mind, and think of nothing else. You should acknowledge any thoughts that intrude on your meditation, and then dismiss them; as you continue to practice, those intrusive thoughts should come less frequently and disappear more quickly. This is because candle meditations help you to develop focus and mental discipline.
> 
> Peale’s second exercise is a type of _visualization meditation_ that’s designed to put you into a calm, content state of mind. Some would call this particular exercise a “happy place” visualization.
> 
> Peale’s emphasis on silence and solitude is meant to help you avoid distractions so that you can just be alone with your thoughts.

  * Stop punishing yourself for some real or imagined sin. You can find peace of mind by releasing your guilt and putting it in God’s hands.



> Peale says that if you feel guilty, it’s because you’re blaming yourself for something that you’ve done or think you’ve done. Marcus Aurelius (the author of _Meditations_ , one of the definitive Stoic texts) offers this advice about blame:
> 
>   * **Blame is pointless.** People often cause harm because of ignorance, or by accident. Blaming people (including yourself) for what they don’t know, or because they made a mistake, is pointless; it’s much better to teach them (or learn) how to avoid that issue in the future.
> 
>   * **Blame is useless.** Even if you _could_ reasonably blame someone (again, including yourself), doing so wouldn’t make the situation any better. Therefore, assigning blame is a waste of time and energy.
> 
> 


#### Stop Fretting

Peale observes that we often make life more difficult for ourselves by getting agitated and worked up about situations. Work stress, for example, is common. People have difficulty relaxing and this stops them from living a full life. Peale calls this “fuming and fretting.” To gain power and live our lives to the fullest, we have to stop this behavior.

To reduce tension in your life, try:

  * **Slowing down.** Consciously do everything more easily, slowly, and without pressure. Sitting quietly and relaxing, getting yourself in tune with God, renews your power and gives you the energy you need. 



> Mark Manson’s colorfully titled book _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ explores the ways in which society drives us to want more of everything, with the result that we’re constantly stressed, exhausted, and unhappy.
> 
> Like Peale’s advice to “slow down,” Manson suggests that we take a hard look at our lives, **determine what’s actually important, and stop giving a f*ck about everything else.** Commit yourself deeply to just a few things (for example: your marriage, charity work, or a hobby that you’re passionate about), instead of chasing every fad and passing high that advertising and social media push on you.

  * **Controlling your physical reactions.** You do this by keeping physically still. Don’t move, pace, wring your hands, or let yourself get worked up. A physical attitude of stillness can guide your mental attitude, diffusing all the emotional heat you may be feeling.



(Shortform note: Peale is correct that our bodies can convince our minds to calm down. For example, a 2020 study found that smiling—even faking a smile—can improve your mood and cause others to respond to you more positively. This effect seems to stem from a subconscious connection between the physical act of smiling and the good mood that usually accompanies it.)

#### Stop Worrying

Worry is a destructive and unhealthy mental habit. Peale warns that worry can cause health problems and even shorten your lifespan. He says worry is dangerous also because when you fear something for a long time, you can actually draw it to you, helping the fear come to pass.

The good news is that worry is a habit, and because you can change any habit, you have the ability to break the worry habit. There are three steps to this process:

  1. **Believe you can** : With God’s help, you can do whatever you believe you can do.
  2. **Empty your mind** : Think of it as emptying a bathtub after removing the stopper, or imagine reaching into your mind and plucking out the worries one by one.
  3. **Refill your mind with positive thoughts** : Since your mind won’t stay empty for long, you have to refill it with positive thoughts, such as courage, faith, and hope. 



> Tara Brach, in _Radical Acceptance_ , offers a Buddhist perspective on worrying: **Obsessing over the past and worrying about the future are unhealthy coping mechanisms.** They create the illusion of control in our lives but disconnect us from our moment-to-moment experiences.
> 
> Brach says we must realize that thinking about the past and the future only serves to build up walls around our present experiences. Instead, we should simply accept each experience (positive or negative) as it comes, and move on with life once the experience has passed.

#### Increase Your Energy

Peale promises that you can increase your energy by changing your mindset because our thoughts affect how we feel physically. When your thoughts tell you you’re tired, the body accepts this and feels tired. But when your mind and thoughts are engaged and interested in what you’re doing, you have the energy to keep going indefinitely.

Peale suggests doing the following:

  * **Get in sync with God’s rhythm.** The unnatural tempo of modern life can deplete your energy. But when we’re in tune with the natural rhythm of life, our inner tempo is flowing as it should and energy flows freely to us. 
  * **Find something that interests you.** When people are too wrapped up in their personal concerns, nothing outside of themselves moves them. To fight this, get interested in something worthwhile outside of yourself. (Shortform note: In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , Robin Sharma says that knowing your purpose in life is like having a lighthouse to guide you through dangerous waters. To find your purpose, Sharma suggests setting specific, attainable, long-term goals for yourself in key areas of your life (physical health, spiritual health, relationships, career goals, and so on).
  * **Get rid of guilt and fear.** Guilt and fear drain your energy, making you tire quickly and lose the resources to do your work, but faith can help disintegrate these blockages and reopen your channel to receive power and energy. (Shortform note: If you’re not religious, you could reframe your fear using the sentence: “I want to do (X), but I scare myself by imagining (Y),”) 



> **God’s Rhythm and Flow**
> 
> What Peale calls “God’s rhythm” is better known by another name: _flow._ Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term in his book of the same name. Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as an optimal state in which we’re both completely focused and completely happy. While in a state of flow, we can do our best work seemingly without effort, and we often lose track of time.
> 
> According to Csikszentmihalyi, reaching a state of flow requires a few conditions:
> 
>   * Y**our task must be enjoyable.**
> 
>   * Y**ou must have a clear goal.**
> 
>   * Y**our task must be challenging, but not frustrating.**
> 
> 


#### Solve Your Personal Problems

Problems are a fact of life. However, Peale says that faith-based techniques can help you solve your problems in a correct manner that brings you the best outcome.

He suggests:

  * Putting your problems in God’s hands. When two or more people pray about a problem and put it in God’s hands, often greater clarity is the result.
  * Imagining God as your partner. Talk over your problems with God, knowing he hears you and is thinking about your problem. Know that you will be guided to the right actions.
  * Developing an attitude of faith. The Bible tells us that if we have faith, we can overcome any problems and rise above any defeat.



(Shortform note: Studies have shown that meditation puts you into an open and insightful mindframe, which is helpful for solving problems. It’s also known that prayer and meditation have similar effects on the mind. Therefore, whether you believe that God is helping you find the answers to your problems, or just that you’re putting yourself into a productive mental state, the fact remains that Peale is correct: Praying and discussing your problems with God can help you find solutions to difficult issues.)

#### Cure Heartache

Grief, sorrow, and other forms of heartache and inner suffering are part of being human. Peale suggests **some concrete things you can do when you are hurting emotionally:** For example, getting back to your normal routine, being physically active, and staying busy can help you to cope with emotional pain. However, he also says that it’s important to feel your grief; it’s natural and helpful to cry when sorrow comes.

There is no greater heartache than the death of a loved one. One way to live with this heartache is to understand the deeper meaning of life and death. When you carry with you the faith that all life is connected—and when you die, you merely continue your journey in another form—you gain a deep peace and comfort about the loss of a loved one.

> **Visiting Heaven?**
> 
> People of many different faiths take comfort in the belief that there’s some sort of afterlife waiting for us. Some people even claim to have seen it; that’s the case with _Heaven is For Real_ , a book by pastor Todd Burpo, who relates his young son’s memories of a near-death experience.
> 
> When Colton Burpo was just under four years old, he became extremely sick. The doctors concluded that there was nothing they could do to save him. That night, Todd’s congregation came together to pray for Colton; by the next day, he had almost completely recovered.
> 
> Colton told his father that he’d visited Heaven while he was in the hospital. Todd was initially skeptical, but Colton’s memories of that time were so vivid that the pastor came to believe that his son had indeed seen the afterlife.
> 
> Of course, there’s no way to prove that what Colton saw was really Heaven. However, Colton’s parents—and Colton himself—found great comfort in the belief that Heaven was real and their loved ones were waiting for them there.

#### Learn How to Be Liked

Being liked has more benefits than just boosting your ego; it’s important to your success in life and in relationships. However, striving for popularity won’t work; plus, no matter what you do, you won’t get everyone to like you.

Still, Peale contends there are ways to make yourself into a pleasing person who gets along well with others:

  * Be easygoing and natural, someone other people can be around without a sense of strain. Peale calls this being a “comfortable person.” 
  * To get other people to like you, you have to like them, and this isn’t always easy. When you get to know anyone, even someone who isn’t likable on the surface, you’ll find admirable and even loveable qualities. 
  * Build up other people’s egos. Everyone wants to feel important. When you build people up, they’ll feel respected and they’ll love you for it. 



> **Counterpoint: Love Yourself First**
> 
> Peale’s advice for becoming a “comfortable person” is to develop a sincere love of others. However, he doesn’t mention that being **a comfortable person requires being comfortable with yourself.**
> 
> In _No More Mr. Nice Guy,_ Robert __ Glover discusses the so-called “Nice Guy” phenomenon. “Nice Guys” think that, if they make others happy, those people will naturally reciprocate by giving them what they want—and they can get extremely angry if that doesn’t happen. Furthermore, their people-pleasing behavior often comes off as insincere or desperate.
> 
> Therefore, Glover’s advice for how to be liked is to put yourself first**—people will find you much easier to be around.**

### Draw Upon Your Higher Power

Many people are depressed and unhappy, but they don’t have to live that way. Peale’s ultimate answer is to draw upon God or the Higher Power. The Higher Power can do everything for you.

How do we do that? **State your problem, then ask for a specific answer. Believe you will get that answer and believe that right now you’re gaining the power to deal with your problem.** An important element of drawing upon the Higher Power is to relax and rest into that power.

Remember to keep an optimistic attitude toward every problem. Peale asserts that the level of your faith is the level of power you will receive to meet your obstacles. No matter what your problem is, drawing upon the Higher Power can help you through it.

> **Counterpoint: The Power of Negative Thinking**
> 
> _The Power of Positive Thinking_ focuses on keeping a positive attitude and having faith that you can accomplish anything. However, Peale essentially encourages us to bull through our problems with sheer willpower and confidence, an approach that some critics feel is simplistic and shortsighted.
> 
> For example, famous basketball coach Bob Knight wrote _The Power of Negative Thinking_ specifically to rebut _The Power of Positive Thinking_.
>
