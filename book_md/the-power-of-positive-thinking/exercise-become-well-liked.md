## Exercise: Become Well-Liked

To get others to like you, you have to like them.

* * *

Think of a person in your life you don’t get along with very well. As Peale advises, look inward. What trait do _you_ have that may be impeding this relationship?

Building up someone else’s ego is one method to boost likeability. What are some honest things you could say to this person that might generate feelings of appreciation toward you?

One method to build up positive feelings for others is to pay attention to the people you see during the day. Is there a person you see often that you have never taken the time to get to know? What about this person can you sincerely appreciate or be interested in?
