## Part 2.3: Defeat Is Not an Option

When you think about defeat, you tend to get defeated. Instead, Peale advises, **adopt a mindset where you don’t believe in defeat.** This mindset requires faith; remember one of Peale’s favorite Bible passages, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (Philippians 4:13).

The first step is to not be afraid of whatever obstacle you are facing; instead, stand up to it. Practice believing God is with you, and together you can handle whatever the problem is. When you stand up to your obstacles, the obstacles don’t seem quite as strong.

> In this section, Peale warns against the fear of defeat. _Purple Cow_ , by marketing guru Seth Godin, offers a tidbit on the dangers of fear.
> 
> Godin says that fear creates a logical paradox:
> 
>   * When things are going badly, we think we can’t afford to take risks.
> 
>   * When things are going well, we think we don’t need to take risks.
> 
> 

> 
> In short, fear paralyzes us—we’ll always find a reason not to act. Peale is suggesting that we adopt a mindset where defeat doesn’t exist so that we don’t get paralyzed by that fear.

### Faith Provides Staying Power

According to Peale,**faith is what keeps you going when things get hard.** When facing difficulties, try to remember that—as unique as you may think your situation is—other people have experienced it before you.

People have overcome every conceivable situation, so someone has overcome _your_ situation, no matter how impossible it may seem. **There’s no difficulty you can’t overcome.**

> In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Manson approaches this same issue from a different angle, and bluntly tells us that we’re not special. In other words:
> 
>   * Your problems aren’t unique.
> 
>   * Other people have it worse than you.
> 
>   * Whatever you’re going through, it’s not an excuse to give up.
> 
> 

> 
> Manson’s suggestion is to take responsibility for your own situation, whatever it is. That doesn’t mean taking the _blame_ —rather, it means accepting that **you have the ability and the obligation to work through your difficulties and improve your life.**
> 
> Whereas Peale urges us to have faith in God, Manson’s advice is to have faith in ourselves; to trust that there’s no problem so dire that we can’t overcome it.

### We Create Our Own Obstacles

How we handle obstacles stems from our mental attitude. Most of our obstacles are mental in nature. Even when obstacles are physical or external, our attitude toward them dictates our response.

Peale says that, if you take the mental attitude that an obstacle is impossible to overcome, you won’t get past that obstacle. **But when you firmly believe that the obstacle is removable, you start the process that leads to the obstacle’s eventual defeat.**

We all face difficulties and obstacles. While real, they aren’t as insurmountable as they seem when you keep faith, believe that God has given you the power to lift yourself out of the situation, and affirm that with this power you can do anything.

> **Use Faith or Reason Against Obstacles**
> 
> While Peale suggests that we overcome obstacles with faith, other schools of thought claim that we can do so with logic.
> 
> Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations_ is one of the definitive books on Stoicism. In it, Aurelius urges us to examine every situation rationally, instead of emotionally. By doing so, Aurelius says, we’ll realize that the only thing that can really impede us is ourselves—no external force can prevent us from doing what we know is right, or force us to do something that we know is wrong. Therefore,**the only reason we haven’t been able to overcome a certain obstacle is that we’ve convinced ourselves that we can’t do it; that the situation is too difficult or too unfair.**
> 
> In truth, all we have to do for any problem is approach it rationally, determine the solution, and then do what needs to be done. To give a simple example: If you’re about to eat an apple and you find that it’s rotten, you simply throw it away. You immediately recognize that there’s no benefit to complaining about the rotten apple or keeping it in your house; **you just solve the problem and move on.**
> 
> Ryan Holiday’s book _The Obstacle is the Way _takes this concept a step further, saying that the most successful people are those who can turn apparent obstacles into advantages. For example, in the “Rumble in the Jungle” between boxing legends Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, Ali took advantage of his opponent’s immense strength and brutality: He used the rope-a-dope to trick Foreman into exhausting himself with ineffective punches, then struck back in a later round to win the match.
