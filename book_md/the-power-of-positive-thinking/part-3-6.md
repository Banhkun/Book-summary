## Part 3.6: Get Rid of Anger and Other Negative Emotions

Thought patterns have an effect on your physical state. **If you are harboring ill will or resentment toward someone, it can manifest in decreased energy or even physical illness**. Your mental and physical health are linked; if one is ailing, the other will suffer.

> Medical and scientific studies have shown that Peale is correct: Prolonged emotional stress puts a great deal of strain on the body, and it can lead to various physical illnesses. The reverse is also true—people who suffer from chronic physical illnesses often struggle with their mental health as well.
> 
> However, you can use that fact to your advantage. If you take care of your body (get enough sleep, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and so on) you’ll naturally boost your mood; you’ll find that you feel better mentally as well as physically and are less prone to anger and the other negative feelings that Peale warns against.

### Counteracting Negative Emotions

When you feel yourself getting angry at someone or a situation, Peale suggests the following methods to restore your emotional well-being.

  * When you are hurting or upset, straighten your feelings out as quickly as possible. Self-pity and resentment will make the situation worse than it really is.
  * Cool your emotions by modifying your physical reactions. For example, if you feel yourself getting angry, deliberately keep your hands from clenching. 
  * Take a deep breath. Count to 10, or repeat a mantra 10 times.
  * Remind yourself that anger won’t accomplish anything. 
  * Write down everything that’s bothering you. Discuss those things one at a time with a trusted friend or your Higher Power.
  * Pray for the people who hurt your feelings. Pray until all the bad feelings melt away, even if this takes a while.
  * Forgive everyone, no matter how many times they’ve wronged you.



> **The Buddhist Approach:_The Book of Joy_**
> 
> The Dalai Lama’s _The Book of Joy_ offers a mixture of similar advice on how to counteract negative emotions and embrace happiness, but from a Buddhist perspective. The Dalai Lama advocates a more holistic approach than Peale’s reliance on positive thinking and prayer; _The Book of Joy_ recommends that you both **strive for happiness** and learn how to **make yourself more resilient to mental and emotional pain.**
> 
> _The Book of Joy_ lays out nine obstacles to joy that we must overcome or reject within ourselves, as well as eight pillars of joy that we should embrace.
> 
> **Nine Obstacles to Joy:**
> 
>   * Critiquing oneself
> 
>   * Fear and stress
> 
>   * Frustration and anger
> 
>   * Sadness and grief
> 
>   * Despair
> 
>   * Loneliness
> 
>   * Envy
> 
>   * Suffering and adversity
> 
>   * Illness and fear of death
> 
> 

> 
> **Eight Pillars of Joy:**
> 
>   * Different perspectives
> 
>   * Humility
> 
>   * Humor
> 
>   * Acceptance
> 
>   * Forgiveness
> 
>   * Gratitude
> 
>   * Compassion
> 
>   * Generosity
> 
> 

> 
> Buddhists often confront their shortcomings and strive for happiness through meditation and faith, much like Peale urges us to do.
