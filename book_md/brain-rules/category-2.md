## Category 2: How Your Environment Influences Your Brain

The first category described how fundamental natural processes influence the brain. In this category, Medina describes how aspects of our individual environments and lifestyles influence our brain functions. Medina writes that **exercise, sleep, and stress are three key aspects of our lives which affect our cognition, brain health, and learning**.

### Rule 2: Exercise Boosts Brain Function

Medina argues that **our brain function is highly influenced by whether or not we exercise, and that more exercise results in more brain power.** He explores why we've evolved to exercise frequently, how exercise benefits our brains, and how sedentary lifestyles harm them. He then describes several important truths that illustrate exercise’s importance.

#### Our Bodies Want to Exercise

**According to Medina, our ability and desire to exercise are baked into our biology.** As we’ve mentioned before, humans had to contend with intense environmental conditions, and constant motion was necessary for survival. For example, when early humans migrated from shrinking rainforests into vast, dry savannahs, they had to walk and run long distances to find food and shelter and to fend off hostile wildlife. Early humans traveled as much as 12 miles a day. Our bodies are still designed to exert such high levels of energy.

> **Did We Evolve to Exercise or to Conserve Energy?**
> 
> Daniel Lieberman, a professor of human evolution and biology at Harvard University, argues that rather than evolving to exercise, we evolved to conserve energy. Conserving energy was important during times of limited food supplies, and allowed early humans to use more energy for physical activity when they _needed_ to, like if they were hunting for food or fleeing a predator. This is why today, many people now would rather relax than go for a run.
> 
> Lieberman does agree, however, that hunter-gatherers were more active than people now and that they walked several miles every day. He also agrees that walking regularly has major health benefits. So while Medina and Lieberman disagree on whether we’ve evolved to exercise or to conserve energy, both would agree that our brains benefit from regular exercise.

#### Our Brains Want to Exercise

**Given that we’ve evolved to exercise, we reap not only physiological but also mental benefits from physical activity.** Exercise boosts cognition by increasing blood flow to the brain. When we exercise, our bodies create new blood vessels, which allow blood to circulate more efficiently. This brings more oxygen-rich blood to the brain.

The oxygen serves two functions: It feeds our brain cells—helping neurons stay young and operational—and it removes harmful toxins. Increasing the flow of oxygen, then, immensely helps the brain carry out its essential functions, including cognitive abilities like memory, focus, and problem solving.

> **Exercise May Benefit Those With Memory Loss in an Unexpected Way**
> 
> Most people benefit when they get increased levels of oxygen to their brain. However, some people suffer from the opposite problem: _too much_ oxygen to the brain, which can _hurt_ memory function. This can happen in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), when their bodies pump excess blood to their brains in an attempt to make up for their reduced cognitive function, which ironically exacerbates that reduced function.
> 
> One study found that for adults with MCI, exercise helped regulate their blood flow, which reduced the excess flow to their brains. Participants in the study saw improved scores on cognitive tests when they exercised.

#### Exercise Versus Modern Life

**Medina argues that even though exercise has proven benefits, the structures of contemporary life often prevent exercise, which has detrimental effects on our brains.** Contemporary life has led to sedentary lifestyles: Many jobs necessitate sitting down for large portions of the day, and school requires kids to sit for hours at a time as well. Because of these sedentary lifestyles, many people suffer cognitive consequences, particularly as they age.

(Shortform note: According to a recent study, sitting for long periods of time is associated with the thinning of the MTL, a part of the brain that forms new memories. Over time, MTL thinning can lead to cognitive decline and dementia.)

Medina encourages finding ways to incorporate exercise into daily routines, even if it’s not what you’re used to. For instance, he recommends walking on a treadmill while working.

(Shortform note: Since _Brain Rules_ was published, many people have begun using treadmill desks. Like Medina, many people believe that treadmill desks can help incorporate light exercise into your work day.)

#### Several Truths About Exercise

It’s clear that we’ve evolved to be physically active, and our brains respond well to physical activity. But how much can exercise actually benefit our lives? Medina establishes several truths that determine how much exercise can impact our lives.

##### Older People Who Exercise Are Sharper Mentally

**Researchers have found that exercise can lead to heightened cognitive capabilities in older people.** Studies consistently show that older people who exercise have better skills in many different areas, including long-term memory, problem-solving, and the ability to think abstractly, when compared to older sedentary people. They are also at far less risk for cognitive issues like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.

> **Exercise Reduces The Risk of Cognitive Diseases**
> 
> Studies support Medina’s assertion that exercise reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Research shows that people who exercise in mid-life cut their risk of developing dementia later in life by 30%, and Alzheimer’s by 45%. Older people who exercise regularly also see these cognitive benefits: One study showed that, in a group of over 700 people with the median age of 82, those who exercised the least were over twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as those who exercised the most.

##### People Can Regain Cognitive Skill Through Exercise

**Studies show that people who live sedentary lifestyles can regain cognitive abilities through exercise.** Medina notes that researchers found improvements in the cognitive abilities of older people after exercise had been introduced in their lives in as little as four months. Studies show that children, too, develop stronger cognitive abilities when they routinely exercise, and that those increased abilities lessen if they stop exercising.

> **Research Shows How Exercise Improves Cognitive Skills**
> 
> Since _Brain Rules_ was published, more research has bolstered Medina’s assertion that exercise can help people regain cognitive abilities, particularly older people. A recent study of sedentary older people with mild cognitive impairment found that those who began a program of regular aerobic exercise saw benefits in executive function, planning, and decision-making. (A control group who did light stretches instead of aerobic exercise also saw improved memory and thinking, but the researchers thought that aerobic exercise helps these capacities more in the long run.)

##### Aerobic Exercise Is Best for Cognitive Health

**Medina says that research indicates aerobic exercise is the most beneficial type of exercise for cognitive health.** It also indicates that people don’t need to do too much of it to see rewards. He notes that 30 minutes of aerobic exercise two to three times a week has been shown to be effective, and that adding strength training can provide a boost to the already-strong cognitive benefits. In other words, just going on a brisk walk twice a week can benefit your cognitive health.

> **Aerobic Exercise Spurs Growth in a Crucial Part of the Brain**
> 
> According to a 2014 study, regular aerobic exercise can increase the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain most responsible for verbal memory and learning. Notably, other forms of exercise—resistance training, balance, and muscle toning—didn’t cause hippocampus growth. So if you want to improve your brain power, aerobic exercises like walking, running, or swimming are best.

##### Exercise Can Alleviate Some Mental Disorders

**Aerobic exercise can also help to alleviate mental disorders.** Since exercise helps to regulate brain chemicals, physical activity can lessen symptoms of mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. Medina notes, though, that while exercise can be a supplement to medical treatments of mental health disorders, it is _not_ a substitute.

> **How Exercise Can Improve Depression and Anxiety Symptoms**
> 
> While it does not substitute professional mental health treatment, exercise can help to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety. One reason exercise for this is that exercising over a long period of time helps neurons to grow and make connections, improving how you feel in your day-to-day life and calming depression symptoms. Exercise also promotes the production of several brain chemicals that can reduce anxiety.
> 
> Using exercise to help manage depression and anxiety symptoms has the potential to help many people, considering the prevalence of both conditions. Depression and anxiety are exceedingly common: In the United States, about 8% of adults have struggled with depression, while about 19% of adults report having a chronic anxiety disorder.

##### Exercise Can Help Children Think

**While more research needs to be done, researchers have found that exercise can improve children’s academic performance.** Medina notes that there have been few studies on how children’s cognitive performance improves when exposed to frequent exercise. But he notes that the existing studies suggest their schoolwork and classroom behavior improves, especially their focus.

> **Exercise Improves Abilities in Math and Reading**
> 
> Reflecting Medina’s assertion that exercise improves childrens’ cognition, studies suggest that children who regularly exercise see improved academic performance, particularly in math and reading. This is likely because exercise improves executive function, which allows us to focus and use our memories and is an essential cognitive capability for these two subjects.

### Rule 3: We Need Sleep to Think

In the previous chapter, Medina discussed the cognitive benefits of activities that can wear you out. Just as we benefit from exercise, we benefit from regular rest: sleep. **Sleep is an essential function of the brain which allows us to learn—and when we don’t get enough sleep, our cognitive abilities suffer.** In this section, Medina describes the biological processes that set our sleep schedules, the positive effects that sleep has on our learning ability, and the negative effects that a lack of sleep can bring.

#### Our Internal Clocks

Our sleep, and the quality of that sleep, is determined by biological processes. We’re wired to stay awake and go to sleep in predictable cycles. **If these cycles are disrupted, we can get less sleep than we need and our cognition can suffer.**

The process that keeps us awake is called the circadian arousal system, or Process C. The process that keeps us asleep is called the homeostatic sleep drive, or Process S. These two processes are constantly active and fighting against one another, leading to a predictable pattern of waking and sleeping—generally for about eight hours of sleep at night and about 16 hours of wakefulness during the day. Researchers William Dement and Nathaniel Kleitman found that the process of waking and sleeping is governed internally by these processes, rather than by external factors like whether it’s light or dark outside.

> **Light Does Affect Our Sleep Cycles**
> 
> While Medina notes that our sleep cycles aren’t affected by whether it’s light or dark outside, other evidence shows that light has a significant effect on our sleep patterns.
> 
> Our internal clocks are controlled by a part of the brain that responds to light and dark signals. So, when we see light, our brains release hormones telling us to be alert, and when we’re in darkness, our brains release hormones that start the sleep process. As a result, exposing yourself to artificial light at night, such as a cell phone or TV, can make it difficult to sleep.
> 
> However, despite its importance to our sleep instincts, scientists agree that light isn’t the _only_ reason we have consistent sleep cycles. We’ll discuss later in the chapter how Process C and Process S often make us sleepy in the middle of the day.

##### People Have Individual Sleep Types

While everyone’s sleep schedule is controlled by these processes, the timing of the processes is unique to each individual. Medina identifies three different types of sleepers, based on when in the day they naturally function best: He calls them **larks (early risers), owls (“night owls”), and hummingbirds (who are in-between the two).**

Early risers tend to wake up around 6:00 AM, and peak in energy and focus by noon. They get sleepy as the day goes on, and might want to go to sleep around 9:00 PM. They form about 10% of the population. Night owls are the opposite of early risers, tending to wake up after 10:00 AM, peaking in energy in the evening, and likely going to sleep around 3:00 AM. They also form about 10% of the population.

The remaining 80% are “hummingbirds,” or in-between sleepers. These sleepers aren’t as strongly biased toward the morning or the evening as early risers or night owls. However, all in-between sleepers will still show tendencies toward one or the other—a lark-ish hummingbird might wake up at 7:30 AM every day and feel sleepy by 10:30 PM, or an owl-ish hummingbird might get up at 9:30 AM and go to sleep at 1:00 AM.

> **Chronotypes Change With Age**
> 
> While everyone has their own chronotype (the technical term for sleep type), people’s chronotypes follow a pattern based on age. Children typically have early chronotypes, which get progressively later in adolescence, and peak around the age of 20. Then, chronotypes get progressively earlier again (though men’s chronotypes are typically slower to change than women’s).

> Chronotype, then, explains why teenagers like to go to sleep late and get up late—it’s not laziness. In fact, a “night owl” chronotype is so typical of teenagers that some researchers believe that the end of adolescence is determined by when one’s chronotype begins shifting earlier. Since most people’s chronotype gets progressively later until their early 20s, adulthood would then begin when their chronotype lateness peaks around the age of 20.

##### Contemporary Life Works Better for Some Sleep Types

Because everyone has their own sleep type, our society’s often-inflexible working hours cause many people to sleep poorly. In American society, for example, many people’s work schedules require them to work from early morning to early evening.

This works for larks, since it allows them to go to bed early and wake up early. But, if you’re a night owl, you might find that your sleep type runs against the standards of contemporary society. As a result, owls might accumulate a “sleep debt,” meaning they lose sleep so consistently that it’d take a long time to catch back up again, and can suffer cognitive difficulties as a result.

> **How to Catch Up on Sleep**
> 
> Many people live with sleep debt, often caused by demanding work schedules that don’t align with our chronotypes. If you accumulate a sleep debt over a long period of time, it can be hard to catch up, since you can’t solve it by getting one good night’s sleep. According to research, it could take up to nine days to fully catch up on a sleep debt.
> 
> If you have a sleep debt, here are a few recommendations for getting sufficient sleep:
> 
>   * Increase your sleep time gradually until you regularly feel well-rested.
> 
>   * Maintain a consistent sleep schedule.
> 
>   * Keep a sleep diary, so you can see if you have any disruptive sleep patterns.
> 
>   * Take short afternoon naps.
> 
> 

> 
> And if sleep loss is causing you difficulty in your day-to-day life, talk to your doctor.

##### How to Manage Difficult Sleep Schedules

To compensate for mismatches between sleep type and working hours, Medina suggests that you set your schedule to match your sleep type if you’re able. He also recommends that companies match employees’ schedules to their sleep types.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that, when employers match employees’ schedules to their chronotypes, employees are less fatigued, more honest, and happier.)

He also recommends that you take a mid-afternoon nap when possible. A nap at this time of day can create cognitive benefits, because Process S and Process C (the hormonal processes that send us to sleep and keep us awake) reach the same level in the mid-afternoon and each requires a lot of energy at that time, which makes us feel sleepy. Medina recommends that businesses and schools give employees or students a half-hour break in mid-afternoon or at least refrain from scheduling meetings or presentations during the “nap window.”

(Shortform note: A study NASA conducted on astronauts shows the effectiveness of taking a midday nap. Compared to astronauts who didn’t nap, astronauts who took a 26-minute-nap in the middle of the day were up to 54% more alert and improved their work by up to 34% more.)

#### How Sleep Affects Learning

**Learning is the cognitive process most affected by sleep.** Medina writes that there are a number of possible reasons for this. One is that during the stage of deep sleep called slow-wave sleep, we replay what we’ve learned over the past day, potentially helping to solidify our memories. If we’re awakened during this stage of sleep, then we’ll likely have memory trouble the next day, leading to difficulty retaining new information.

(Shortform note: In addition to deep sleep, rapid eye movement (R.E.M.) sleep, which is the phase of sleep when your brain is active and you dream, is also important for developing and retaining memories.)

Another reason sleep helps with learning is that during sleep, the brain cleans up toxic molecules that accumulate over the course of the day, creating better conditions for learning.

(Shortform note: A 2013 study provides strong evidence for this theory. Researchers found that brain cells shrink during sleep. This opens up space between neurons and allows fluid to flow more easily through the brain, so the brain can flush toxic materials.)

### Rule 4: Stress Can Hurt the Brain

Medina has explained that exercise and sleep are two factors that can benefit our cognitive health. He then turns his attention to another environmental influence: stress, which can hurt our cognitive health.**** He argues that**stress interferes with our brain’s ability to learn because we haven’t evolved to handle it over a long period of time.** Medina defines stress, distinguishes between acute and chronic stress, describes the cognitive (and physical) effects of stress, and discusses how stress can cause problems at home and at work.

#### Defining Stress

Stress can be hard to define because no single situation is stressful for everyone. Additionally, from a scientific perspective, all kinds of physiological arousal cause similar reactions in the body, whether it’s a stressful response or a pleasurable response. As a result, scientists can have a hard time distinguishing between physical manifestations of stress and other kinds of excitement.

Medina cites researchers Jeansok Kim and David Diamond, who came up with three criteria to determine if someone is experiencing stress:

  1. The person has a clear physiological response, like sweating, crying, shouting, or shaking. 
  2. The person wants to extricate themselves from the situation. 
  3. The person feels that they’re out of control. 



> **How to Shift From Stress to Excitement**
> 
> You can use the similarities between stress and excitement to adopt a positive attitude in anxiety-inducing situations. Instead of trying to “calm down,” which is incredibly difficult when your body is in a state of stress, shift your mindset to excitement. This is an easier response because you can improve your mood without changing your physical responses.
> 
> To shift from stress or anxiety to excitement, researchers recommend you begin thinking of “threats” as “opportunities.” For example, if you’re nervous about an upcoming job interview, try thinking of it as an opportunity to further your career.

##### Acute Versus Chronic Stress

Medina notes that there are two kinds of stress: short-term stress (_acute_ stress) and long-term stress (_chronic_ stress). If you’re driving and swerve to avoid an oncoming vehicle, you’d experience acute stress. On the other hand, if you experience heavy traffic every day, causing you to be habitually late to work, you’ll experience chronic stress.

Stress evolved as a survival response, since early humans faced a number of immediate dangers on a regular basis. He argues that people have evolved to manage acute stress well, because this is the type of stress that helps us avoid imminent threats. However, he argues that we haven’t evolved to handle chronic stress well.

The reason chronic stress is a problem is that the body isn’t meant to deal with stress hormones over a long period of time. When we have a stress response, our bodies produce the hormones adrenaline and cortisol, which give a burst of intense energy and focus the body on the immediate threat. If this happens over a long period of time, these hormones can depress the health and growth of neurons, and can even disable the gene that creates these cells.

> **How Acute and Chronic Stress Affect Our Bodies and Minds**
> 
> In addition to hormonal changes, acute stress causes other changes in the body that are intended to help us deal with immediate threats but that can cause harm when stress becomes chronic, affecting our ability to think and learn.
> 
> Acute stress causes muscle tension, because tensing our muscles guards us against injury. This is effective if we’re in a situation where injury is possible, but muscle tension over a long period of time is detrimental. For example, prolonged muscle tension can cause migraines and tension headaches, causing us physical pain and affecting our ability to focus, think, and learn. To improve muscle tension caused by stress, experts recommend relaxation techniques and participating in relaxing, pleasurable activities.
> 
> Acute stress also affects the gastrointestinal system. When we face a stressful situation, our digestive system slows or stops so our bodies can focus on the stressor. If we experience chronic stress, digestion can be slowed over a longer period of time, causing discomfort and pain. Notably, our digestive systems contain many neurons which are in constant communication with the brain and can affect our mood, meaning that persistent digestive problems can impede us mentally and emotionally. Because of the link between the gut and the brain, experts have found that mental health treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation therapy, and hypnosis can help ease persistent digestive problems.

#### Cognitive Health Effects of Stress

Medina discusses the negative cognitive effects that chronic stress can cause. Long-term stress can be particularly harmful to memory and our ability to solve problems.

##### The Effects on Memory

Medina writes that _short-term_ stress can actually improve memory. This is because the hippocampus, which stores memories, has a lot of receptors for the hormone _cortisol_ , which is a hormone that your body produces during acute stress. Thus, during times of acute stress, you can retrieve information and solve problems more effectively because of the additional cortisol. Medina postulates that our brains have developed in this way because of the evolutionary need to remember how to respond to stressful situations and to think on our feet.

However, _chronic stress_ can degrade memory because it sends excessive amounts of cortisol to the hippocampus, which can disconnect neural networks. This causes memory loss and can prevent new cells from being created—and thus hurt your ability to form new memories.

> **Ways to Lower Cortisol Levels**
> 
> Studies show that elevated cortisol can be particularly harmful to memory in older adults. One study of over 4,000 older people found that those with the highest cortisol levels had lower brain volume than other participants, and found that they performed worse on memory tests.
> 
> If you have a stressful life, there’s a good chance you have high cortisol levels—and therefore, that you might be at risk for memory loss later in life. To lower your stress and cortisol levels, try finding more ways to relax and enjoy yourself. For example, try watching a comedic TV show—studies show that watching funny videos can lower cortisol levels.

##### The Effects on Learning

Because of its profound effects on memory, chronic stress can severely hinder learning. Studies show that adults with chronic stress perform worse than low-stress adults on tests related to memory, math, language, focus, and the ability to use pre-existing knowledge to solve new problems.

(Shortform note: Studies have noted two particularly significant impacts stress can have on learning: It damages the ability to retrieve information, which makes testing difficult, and damages the ability to change memories based on new information, which makes it difficult to build on pre-existing knowledge.)

Chronic stress can also contribute to clinical depression, which harms many important cognitive functions. These include not only memory and language, already established to be harmed by stress, but also spatial awareness, problem-solving & abstract reasoning, and quantitative reasoning.

(Shortform note: Scientists believe that the relationship between stress and depression is “bidirectional”, meaning that just like stress can cause depression, depression can cause stress. If you find yourself slipping into a stress-depression cycle, medical professionals recommend talking with supportive family and friends, making small lifestyle changes (like getting sufficient sleep and making time for yourself), and consulting with a professional if these steps don’t help.)

##### Physiological Effects of Stress

Medina argues that the physiological effects of stress, including cardiovascular disease and immune system problems, can affect our ability to learn at school or to perform at work. Those who suffer physical symptoms of stress, especially those whose immune systems are weakened, may need to take more time off from work or school than a low-stress person. Their ability to keep up with class material, or effectively fulfill the requirements of their job, would then be lessened. In this sense, physiological symptoms of stress can also set us back cognitively.

(Shortform note: The physiological effects of chronic stress can harm your ability to go about your day-to-day life in the long term, so experts recommend managing sources of chronic stress. To do this, identify what causes of stress in your life can be changed—for example, frequently being late to work or spending less time with friends than you’d like. Then, limit the amount of stress you deal with in a given day by planning your days in advance, and start doing relaxing or pleasurable activities when you can.)

#### Stress in Our Lives

Medina describes two environments—at home and at work—where people are likely to experience chronic stress, causing damage to relationships, health, and productivity.

##### Home

Stress in our home lives, often caused by frequent conflicts in the home, can be ongoing and damaging to children. Kids have strong reactions to their parents or caregivers fighting, such as physical tension or yelling at their parents to stop.

These responses indicate that arguments among caregivers make children reach their stress limit. If these conflicts are ongoing, the negative impacts of stress on children can be long-lasting, potentially leading to poor academic performance, increased rates of teenage pregnancy, and higher likelihood of poverty.

> **How to Help Reduce Children’s Stress at Home**
> 
> Medina writes that conflict between caregivers causes children stress, but many other factors can lead to stress in childrens’ home lives: for example, moving to a new town, loss of a loved one or pet, or high expectations from family members. In addition to the reactions Medina describes, a child experiencing chronic stress in the home might also display behavioral changes like acting out or spending more time alone.
> 
> To help reduce stress in a child’s life, try listening to and acknowledging the child’s feelings about the source of stress, ensuring they have a consistent sleep schedule and healthy eating habits, and maintaining routines. Even if you can’t remove the source of stress, like if you’re moving to a new house, these strategies can help children cope with stressful situations.

##### Work

Work, too, can be a major site of stress. All jobs have moments of stress, but some jobs can become overwhelming. Workplace stress occurs when there’s a great deal expected of an employee, but the employee has little control over the quality of their work.

A job that causes frequent boredom for an employee also causes stress. Yet a completely unpredictable job is also stressful, so the happy medium would be a reliable job that offers some variety.

Finally, stress at home can cause stress at work, and vice versa. This is called a “work-family conflict”. Stress begins at home or at work, which then causes stress in the other space, leading to a vicious cycle of unabating stress in both areas of your life.

> **The Benefits of Leaving Stressful Work**
> 
> Many workers agree with Medina that work can be stressful, and some respond by leaving their jobs. Workers who do so often cite unpredictable scheduling, inflexible time off, workplace conflicts, and lack of benefits as reasons. Stressful jobs can cause you to feel tired, irritable, unmotivated, and can cause sleep loss—and leaving a job can help to ease these symptoms of stress.
> 
> Experts advise that as long as you have sufficient savings or will be able to quickly find a new job, leaving a stressful job can help your overall mental health and can allow you to find work that’s more fulfilling.
