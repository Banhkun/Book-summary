## Exercise: How Do You Use Visual Aids?

Because vision is the most dominant sense, visual aids can help us learn new information.

* * *

Describe a time when a visual aid helped you learn or remember information. For example, maybe a documentary helped you remember a historic event, or images in a presentation at work helped you learn a new concept.

Why do you think this visual aid helped you learn?

In the future, how can you use visual aids to help learn new information?
