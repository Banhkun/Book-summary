## Category 3: How a Brain Perceives Stimuli

The previous category focused on how our brains respond to our environments. This category focuses on the brain’s perception of sensory information. Medina writes that we learn best when we use more than one sense, that vision is the most important sense, and that we’re hardwired to respond to music. According to Medina, **understanding our responses to sensory stimuli helps our learning, work performance, and happiness.**

### Rule 8: We Learn Best When Using Multiple Senses

In this chapter, Medina contends that, **because we evolved to live in a multi-sensory world, using more than one sense at once improves our learning.** He describes how we take in sensory information, why our senses improve when we combine them, and how using multiple senses benefits learning specifically. He also shares ideas for incorporating multi-sensory learning into your life.

#### Sensing, Routing, and Perceiving

**When we process sensory information, our brains take us through three steps:** **sensing, routing, and perceiving**. These steps allow us to take disparate sensory information and combine it into a logical whole.

**The first step is _sensing,_ or the absorbing of sensory input. **When you, for example, stand in an amusement park, you’ll see the rides and gift shops, hear shouts, and smell funnel cakes. Your senses take in this information and send it to the brain to be converted into electrical signals between neurons.

**The second step is _routing_ , when the brain sends these signals to the parts of the brain pertaining to each sense. **

**The third step is _perceiving_ , when the brain makes sense of those signals. **There are two ways the brain processes the sensory input: assembling and interpreting. Your brain first assembles the different types of stimuli you’ve absorbed into a full picture. It then interprets this picture by adding meaning. It remembers similar experiences you’ve had in the past and connects your current experiences to those memories, so you know how to react. Interpreting is subjective, since it relies on individual experience. Therefore, no two people will perceive a stimulus in the same way.

> **How Sensory Processing Can Go Wrong**
> 
> Medina describes how our brains have evolved to sense, route, and perceive information, but he doesn’t discuss what happens when people have difficulties with sensory processing.
> 
> Some people who suffer brain damage have issues with sensory processing. Most commonly, this can manifest as a loss of sensory perception: For example, a brain injury might leave someone unable to process smell or taste. Less commonly, a brain injury can lead to _hypersensitivity_ , meaning that everyday sensory stimuli feel overwhelming. This can make it difficult for a person to interact with the world: If background noise overwhelms someone, for instance, they’ll have a difficult time determining what to focus on in a noisy environment.
> 
> Others are born with difficulties _processing_ sensory information. Sensory processing disorder (SPD) causes people to be unable to cope with everyday sensory stimuli: A pair of jeans might be painful to the touch, or the sound of a car starting could cause intense anxiety. Many children have SPD, which causes them difficulty in their education and social development. Researchers have found evidence that the brains of children with SPD are significantly different from those without SPD: The parts of the brain that integrate visual, auditory, and tactical processing are abnormal, leading to difficulties integrating sensory information.
> 
> There are numerous treatments that can help those with sensory processing issues. If someone’s hypersensitive to sensory information, whether because of brain damage or a condition like SPD, therapy can help them improve their sensory processing, as can reducing troublesome stimuli in their environments. If necessary, medications can also help with sensory integration.

#### Our Senses Improve When We Use Them Together

Because the environments we live in have multiple, simultaneous sensory stimuli, our brains evolved to absorb and make sense of numerous sources of information at the same time. Since our senses have evolved to work together in this way, when we use one sense, others are automatically activated.

Medina describes a few studies that provide evidence for this phenomenon. In one, researchers found a connection between sight and sound by showing subjects silent videos of people speaking. When watching these videos, the auditory centers of their brains lit up, in addition to the visual centers. This indicates that sight influences sound: When we see an image associated with sound, like talking, our brains automatically engage our sense of hearing.

Further, Medina notes that one sense can even improve another. One study Medina describes shows this phenomenon in action. Researchers showed subjects a flickering light that gradually grew dimmer. When a sound was paired with the flickering, they were able to see the light flickering for much longer.

> **Many People Can “Hear” Motion**
> 
> Medina describes how our senses work together, to the extent that they can activate and improve one another. While most people’s senses activate each other in predictable pairings, like taste with smell, some people’s senses go a step further: People with _synesthesia_ experience senses paired with unexpected senses. For example, they might associate numbers and letters with specific colors, or sounds might have taste.
> 
> Synesthesia is relatively uncommon, occurring in 1 in 90 people. However, research shows that one particular type of synesthesia is more common: “hearing motion”. In one study, 20% of participants heard sounds when they were shown moving images, even though no sounds were actually present. These results parallel the study Medina mentioned, where the auditory centers of participants’ brains lit up when viewing silent videos of speech. While not everyone experiences synesthesia, the prevalence of “hearing motion” indicates how our senses are hard-wired to work together.

#### Using Multiple Senses Benefits Learning

Medina argues that because we’ve evolved to process multiple senses at once, our brains learn and absorb information best when it involves more than one sense. Studies show that people who learn using multiple senses retain information better than those who used only one sense—even 20 years after first learning the information.

In addition to remembering information better, multisensory learners also showed much greater problem-solving skills than single-sense learners. Some researchers think this is because the brain retains memories better when you use _elaborative processing_ , which is committing information to memory using multiple techniques. For example, if you remember a recipe, you probably did more than just read it. You likely remember it because you engaged the senses of smell, touch, and taste by cooking it.

If you’re learning or teaching something new, then, it can be helpful to use multiple senses. For example, if you’re learning a new language, you could reinforce it by watching films in that language, in addition to reading and speaking it. Using only one sense, on the other hand, can make learning more difficult. Listening to a lecture, for instance, might leave you less likely to retain information than watching a documentary, since it only involves auditory stimuli.

> **Teaching Reading With Multiple Senses**
> 
> Since multisensory learning helps to retain information over time, many educators use it when teaching children important skills. Reading is one skill that can benefit from multisensory learning, and there are several techniques for engaging the senses of touch, sight, and sound during reading lessons:
> 
>   * **Tactile writing.** Have students write words using their hands in a soft material, like sand or shaving cream. As they write the words, instruct them to sound out each letter.
> 
>   * **Tapping out words.** Have students tap out each sound of a word using their thumb and fingers—for example, for the word “dog,” tap the thumb to the forefinger on “d,” the thumb to the middle finger on “o,” and the thumb to the ring finger on “g.” Then they can put the sounds together.
> 
>   * **Reading together.** While a student reads a book, read it aloud with them. You can also ask them to interact with the book by underlining or circling words—for example, they could circle all the verbs, or underline words they don’t know.
> 
> 


#### Ideas for Using Multiple Senses

Medina gives several recommendations for incorporating multisensory learning in education and business. If you’re giving a presentation at work or in school, Medina recommends making it a multimedia presentation. For example, Medina, as a college professor, would use the same scent in his classroom during both a lecture and the subsequent test. The practice led students to perform better. Businesses that are training employees can also use this technique to improve the employees’ memory of the new information.

(Shortform note: Some of the best teachers in the United States frequently use multisensory learning techniques. Among recent winners and finalists of the National Teacher of the Year awards, some strategies teachers use include having students create advertisements to understand scientific concepts, or using musical concepts to help students understand complex literature. These teachers’ success shows that multisensory learning is a great way to engage a class and help them learn concepts.)

Medina also recommends retailers engage in _sensory branding_ , which pairs scents with sales, as using the right scents has been shown to motivate people to make purchases. For example, if you run a candy store, you could fill the store with scents of chocolate and caramel to encourage people to buy more candy.

(Shortform note: While using scent can improve a brand’s sales, using even more senses in branding can be even more effective. For example, a brand could create a signature sound (hearing), use a distinctive logo (sight), and partner with restaurants (taste).)

### Rule 9: Vision Is the Dominant Sense

In the previous chapter, Medina discussed how the brain interprets sensory information. In this chapter, Medina focuses on arguably the most important sense: **vision. He argues that** **vision leads and influences all of the other senses, shaping our perception of the world and influencing our learning and memory.**

Medina describes how the brain processes visual information, including how it can go awry, and how it stays dominant despite its faults. Because of vision’s dominance, he also explains how we can use visual aids to improve our learning.

#### How the Brain Processes Visual Information

While it’s easy to think that seeing is simple and straightforward, it’s actually a complicated, energy-consuming process. In order to understand all of the sights around us, the brain needs to take many steps to process this visual information.

Seeing begins when visual information passes through the retina, the part of the eye that processes visual information. The visual stimuli then go on a complicated journey through the brain: from the optic nerve to the thalamus, which distributes sensory information across the brain, then from the thalamus to the visual cortex, which processes visual information, and then on to the brain’s interpretive regions.

The information eventually forms into two different streams of visual information: the ventral stream, which determines what object the visual information represents and what color it is, and the dorsal stream, which determines where the object is located and if it is moving.

Because of how complicated this process is, about half of the brain is dedicated to vision—more than any other sense. Medina notes that there’s a reason the brain jumps through so many hoops to see the world accurately. Out of all the senses, vision helps us understand the world around us the most, so the brain takes extra effort to see clearly.

> **How Does Blindness Affect the Brain?**
> 
> Medina explains that visual processing is so complex that about half of the brain is devoted to it. Yet many people are born without the ability to see but still live full lives. This is because, according to research, the brain’s visual processing center adapts to strengthen other senses. 
> 
> Researchers have found that the visual cortex has the same structure and fulfills many of the same functions in blind people as in sighted people—but does so for hearing and touch. For example, in sighted people, the visual cortex allows for the ability to understand where objects are in space. In blind people, the visual cortex does the same, but through the senses of hearing and touch (for example, understanding how far away a person is by listening to the sound of their voice).
> 
> Researchers discovered this by giving sighted and blind people tasks involving touch or hearing, and monitoring their brains as they completed the tasks. The blind subjects’ visual cortexes lit up during these tasks more than the sighted subjects’, indicating that the visual cortex is equally essential in blind people as in sighted people—though it’s unable to process visual information, it makes up for it by making other senses much stronger.

##### Everyday Hallucinations

Because visual stimuli fall on the retina in two dimensions, the brain has had to adapt to interpret a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional world. Sometimes, this means the brain has to make educated guesses about what it’s seeing. These guesses show up as minor hallucinations that we experience every day.

For example, the brain constantly fills in blind spots. A region of the eye called the optic disk has no cells that perceive sight, so that area of our vision is technically blank. However, the brain prevents us from perceiving these blind spots. Medina notes that researchers believe that the brain either makes a guess and fills in the blind spot, or it simply ignores the blind spot.

> **When Guesses Go Wrong: Optical Illusions**
> 
> The brain’s importance in interpreting optical information and giving us daily hallucinations is especially clear when it comes to _optical illusions_ —when our brain thinks we see something that isn’t really there. Examples are when we look at a black-and-white grid and think we see shades of gray, or when we look at a mural on a wall that looks 3-dimensional but isn’t.
> 
> These types of visual deceptions are often caused by the intricate wiring of your eye, in which nerves in different areas of your retina perceive light and motion with different sensitivities. They can also be caused by expectations of your brain, as when you’re accustomed to interpreting larger objects as close to you and smaller objects as farther from you, which can lead you to see a 2-dimensional illustration as 3-dimensional.

Another everyday hallucination is the merging of two visuals. Because we have two eyes, we receive different visual information in each eye. The brain then creates a single visual from the two eyes. It guesses what the most accurate image is based on past visual experiences. These two hallucinations represent how the brain processes visual information: Instead of simply receiving full, accurate images, the brain sorts through incomplete and conflicting information, and reconstructs it in order to create a complete image.

(Shortform note: In 2015, researchers found the place in the brain that integrates visual input into one image. A group of neurons in the visual cortex, called V1, process the visual information from each eye. Immediately following, another group of neurons in the visual cortex, called V2, convert them into one image. This shows that the conversion of two images into one occurs very early in visual processing.)

#### Vision Dominates Other Senses

Because it takes up so much more space in the brain than other senses, vision can overrule other sensory input. Vision shapes how we see the world more than other senses, so if we receive contradictory information from multiple senses, vision tends to win out. For example, if you eat candy that comes in an assortment of colors, you might think that they all have different flavors, even if they’re all the same.

(Shortform note: The tendency of vision to override other senses, even when inaccurate, is called the _Colavita visual dominance effect_. While most people experience this effect, research shows that people with autism spectrum disorder may experience the reverse—in one study, hearing overrode vision for autistic subjects, even though vision overrode hearing for subjects without ASD. This “reverse Colavita effect” shows that, despite established patterns, many people process information differently.)

The dominance of vision over other senses seems to be written into our DNA. Medina writes that, throughout human history, the senses of vision and scent have struggled for genetic dominance. Vision has taken the upper hand. Medina notes that our smell-related genes have lost genetic dominance at a consistent rate, leaving vision to lead the pack of the senses.

(Shortform note: Medina cites extensive evidence that visual dominance is ingrained in our brains, even being dominant in our DNA. However, some have argued that the dominance of vision may be overstated, arguing that vision is seen as dominant only because it’s been researched more than other senses, and because vision is culturally dominant in Western societies. Such critics say that more research is needed to determine whether vision is conclusively dominant or if other senses may be equally dominant.)

#### Visual Aids Improve Learning

Medina notes that vision’s dominance also extends to learning and memory. We remember just about anything better when there’s a visual component, so Medina recommends using visual aids to improve learning. Importantly, he notes that visual aids do not include _text_ , which the brain processes differently than pictures.

Medina notes that the best visual aids for learning often involve motion. Our brains evolved to detect motion, since many early threats to our survival were predators that moved quickly. As a result, we have a keen eye for moving images. Using videos or animation in presentations, then, can be an extra-effective way to use visual aids.

Other aspects of images that capture our attention are color and placement. For example, a brightly colored image placed next to important text will draw our attention, and likely help us remember the text.

> **How to Teach With Visual Aids**
> 
> Many educators agree with Medina that using visual aids is a strong teaching method, especially if the visual aid includes motion, memorable colors, and/or strategically places images near important content. However, there are numerous ways to approach teaching with visual aids. Some strategies to help ensure that teaching with visual aids is effective include:
> 
> **Explain the context for visual aids.** Visuals can’t just stand on their own without context—students need to know how an image relates to what they’re learning. To help provide context for a visual aid, you can explain why you selected the image, how it connects to the course material, and what you want your students to learn from the visual aid. For example, if you use Civil-War-era props when studying that time period, analyze how each one sheds light on the habits of people at that time.
> 
> **Discuss visual aids as a class.** Once the students understand the visual aid, ask them to discuss what they’ve learned from it. For example, if you show a documentary in a history class, you could ask them how seeing re-enactments of a historical event affects how they think about the event, and if it challenged their pre-existing knowledge. This further helps students understand the visual aid, and to develop their thoughts about the course material.

### Rule 10: We’re Wired to Respond to Music

The previous chapter focused on how the human brain prioritizes the sense of vision. This chapter focuses on an aspect of the sense of hearing: music. Medina argues that **playing and listening to music can notably improve cognition.**

Medina discusses the definition of music, the numerous cognitive benefits of music, how music can create hormonal changes that lead to shifts in mood, the positive effects of music therapy, and misperceptions about music’s effects on cognition.

#### Defining Music

While music is an integral part of most people’s day-to-day lives and exists in all cultures, researchers haven’t pinned down a single, concrete definition of it. Music is different across cultures, and what sounds like unpleasant noise to one culture may be beautiful music to another.

Medina does observe that all music has at least some common features: tempo, changes in frequency, and timbre (the tone or “color” of a sound). Music also frequently inspires movement, such as dancing.

> **How Do Experts Define Music?**
> 
> Ethnomusicologist Patrick Burke has a broad definition of music: It’s whatever sound people call music. While many people believe music is a “universal language,” people view music differently across cultures, meaning that it’s hard to pin down a single, concrete definition of music.
> 
> However, Burke does note that all cultures practice music in some way. So even if the diversity in how cultures practice music makes it hard to define, it’s still a part of all of our lives.

#### The Cognitive Benefits of Music

Medina describes several areas of cognitive function that may be positively affected by participating in or listening to music.

**Music leads to improved auditory skills.** Medina cites several studies noting that musicians score higher on tests involving identifying subtle differences between sounds—including in speech.

(Shortform note: A recent study shows that piano lessons help children to differentiate between pitches, an important part of language processing.)

**Music leads to improved language skills.** Studies show that children who study music see improvements in language skills, both spoken and written. At 10 years old, children who have been practicing musical instruments for at least three years often see improvements in their vocabulary.

(Shortform note: Since music helps language processing, it also helps children learn how to read and learn language. Studies show that music lessons may even be more effective than additional reading lessons.)

**Music leads to improved social skills.** Infants exhibit improved social skills when participating in music. Medina cites a study where infants in a parent/child music class, involving tasks like playing with instruments, developed strong social skills such as increased smiling, laughing, and waving to others. Their stress levels were also lower than infants who did not participate in this class.

(Shortform note: Studies show that, for children with poor social skills, taking group music lessons improves prosocial behaviors like sharing and helping others. Children in these lessons also show more positive attitudes toward their peers.)

**Music leads to improved emotional skills.** According to Medina, studies show that children who played musical games during school have increased empathy for others, as opposed to children who played non-musical games or no games at all. Practiced musicians are also better at detecting emotion in others’ voices.

(Shortform note: Research shows that music education helps children to recognize emotions in images and texts, and can help children to express their emotions.)

#### Why Music Affects Cognition

Medina cites several reasons why music boosts our cognition.

**Music improves our speech skills because music and speech share regions of the brain:** The brain needs a strong sense of rhythm and pitch to understand both music and speech. As a result, playing or listening to music improves our language skills.

(Shortform note: Some researchers believe that, because of its shared neural pathways with language processing, studying music may be more important for verbal communication than studying phonics. Since music training can help language processing so much, music training may help prevent literacy and language disorders in children.)

**Music improves our emotional and social skills because it increases the production of hormones that increase pleasure, lower stress, and stimulate social bonds.** Collaborative musical performance, like performing with a band or a choir, also encourages social skills because it requires cooperation and nonverbal communication.

(Shortform note: Research shows that listening to or participating in music stimulates the areas of our brain that govern social engagement, even if we do it alone. This is because music releases endorphins in the brain, pleasurable hormones that are also released when we socialize with others. So while engaging musically with others is a better way to improve social skills, participating in music alone is still helpful.)

##### Using Music as Therapy

**Because of the benefits of music, particularly its ability to improve your mood by stimulating hormones, medical professionals often use music as a form of therapy.** In music therapy, music is played to patients to improve their recovery from physical, mental, or emotional injury. Medina notes that music therapy can help patients who have experienced injuries or traumas that affect cognitive functions, such as speech, memory, and focus.

> **Music Therapy for Mental Health**
> 
> Music therapy is a common method for treating mental health issues. Here are a few ways that music therapists work with patients who are struggling with their mental health:
> 
>   * **Studying Lyrics.** By discussing song lyrics, patients can make connections to their own experiences and emotions, without needing to discuss sensitive information.
> 
>   * **Songwriting.** Songwriting can help patients to understand and express their feelings.
> 
>   * **Listening to Emotional Music.** Therapists can play music that matches their patients’ emotions, and can gradually alter the mood of the music. This can help patients reach more positive emotions.
> 
>   * **Musical Improvisation.** When working with a group, improvising music with instruments can foster connection and collaboration and can help patients express their feelings.
> 
> 


##### Debunking Some of Music’s Cognitive Benefits

Though Medina describes many cognitive benefits of music, he does argue that some benefits people commonly associate with music education are not based on evidence.

Some people believe music education is associated with higher test scores in reading and math. Medina writes that, based on studies showing the relation between music education and reading and math ability, people may see small improvements in these abilities. However, they’re probably not enough to make a major difference. Music-trained people also don’t seem to have higher IQs than others.

Though Medina notes that the popular argument that music is “good for your brain” is overstated, it does not negate the many cognitive benefits that music has. For example, music seems to improve spatiotemporal reasoning, or the ability to envision the relationship between objects and space—an important skill for professions like architecture and engineering.

> **How Can Music Best Benefit Cognition?**
> 
> Most researchers agree with Medina that music education doesn’t have a direct correlation to improved academic performance. Some studies show that music education for children confers no cognitive benefits. The researcher who conducted the study argued that, because of the lack of evidence for improved academic performance from music education, arts education advocates should focus on the social, cultural, and artistic benefits of musical education.
> 
> However, other research shows that music education can help childrens’ cognition, but only if they’re actively engaged in the class and making music. Studies show that the benefits of listening to music are negligible, but playing musical instruments with others improves childrens’ neural processing.
> 
> More research is needed to determine the exact benefits of music education. But it seems likely that music education that involves active participation can help children cognitively, and at the very least socially.
