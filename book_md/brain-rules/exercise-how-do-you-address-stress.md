## Exercise: How do You Address Stress?

Everyone experiences stress in their life sometimes. Now that you have some more knowledge about the causes and effects of stress, think about what you do when you experience stress.

* * *

Reflect on a time when you experienced chronic stress. For example, you could have been falling behind on deadlines at work, or you could have been in the middle of a difficult conflict with a loved one. How did this stress affect you, mentally and physically?

What steps did you take to counteract this stress?

How would you address this stressful situation differently now? Or if youâ€™d address it the same way, why do you think your approach was effective?
