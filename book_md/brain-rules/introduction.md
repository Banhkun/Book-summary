## Introduction

**Our brains are uniquely complex information processors, yet most people know little about how they work. By learning about core brain functions, we can improve our thinking and learning in all aspects of our lives.**

Today, our lives are at odds with how our brains are designed to function. We evolved to travel throughout dangerous outdoor environments, but the sedentary lives many people now lead don’t align with how our brains function best. We also experience much more stress than we’re built to, and don’t always engage our senses to the fullest extent. Throughout _Brain Rules,_ Medina addresses how current norms, like classrooms where children remain seated or jobs with high stress levels, work against our brains. By learning about our brain functions, we can make the most of our cognitive capabilities.

John Medina is a molecular biologist with a focus on psychiatric disorders. Medina wrote this book in order to help the public understand how brains work, and how the functions of the brain affect how we interact with the world. To develop this idea, Medina argues that our brains have evolved to increase our chances of survival by achieving these three core functions:

  1. **Solve problems.**
  2. **Function in an unpredictable environment.**
  3. **Operate in near-constant motion.**



He takes the reader step-by-step through 12 rules that he says each help fulfill these core functions. We’ve grouped these rules into five categories that correspond to recurring themes among them:

  * Category 1: How Nature Makes a Brain
    * Our Brains Have Evolved for Survival (Rule 1)
    * Our Brains are Each Uniquely Wired (Rule 5)
  * Category 2: How Your Environment Influences Your Brain
    * Exercise Boosts Brain Function (Rule 2)
    * We Need Sleep to Think (Rule 3)
    * Stress Can Hurt the Brain (Rule 4)
  * Category 3: How a Brain Perceives Stimuli
    * Our Senses Depend on One Another (Rule 8)
    * Vision is the Dominant Sense (Rule 9)
    * We’re Wired to Respond to Music (Rule 10)
  * Category 4: How a Brain Thinks, Part 1
    * Paying Attention is a Multi-Step Process (Rule 6)
    * The Brain Needs to Form, Retrieve, and Forget Memories (Rule 7)
  * Category 5: How a Brain Thinks, Part 2
    * Gender Affects Thought Processes (Rule 11)
    * We Learn By Exploring (Rule 12)



**By learning about brain functions in each of these areas, we can begin to understand how the brain works and how to carry this knowledge into our daily lives.**
