## Category 5: How a Brain Thinks, Part 2

In the previous category, Medina described some of the brain’s fundamental cognitive processes. In this category, **Medina describes two more aspects of our lives that influence our thinking and learning: gender and exploration.**

### Rule 11: Gender Affects Thought Processes

In this chapter, Medina discusses factors with more contested effects on the brain: **sex and gender.** Medina discusses evidence of differences in brain structure, behavior, and cognitive differences between men and women. **He argues that, though more research is needed, gender affects how we think, learn, and interact with others.**

(Shortform note: Since the publication of _Brain Rules,_ science has shown much more evidence that male and female brains aren’t notably different, and that behavioral and cognitive differences between men and women are primarily influenced by social expectations. Examples will be included throughout the chapter guide to provide more context on Medina’s findings.)

#### Physical Differences in Male and Female Brains

Medina notes that there are observable differences in the brains of men and women. For example, various regions of male and female brains have different sizes. The frontal and prefrontal cortex, which deal with decision-making, are larger in women. The limbic system, on the other hand, is larger in men. This system contains the amygdala, which controls the generation and memory of emotions.

Males and females also have different brain chemicals. Serotonin, which regulates emotions, is much higher in men than women. While male and female brains have differences, these differences don’t necessarily affect how men and women behave. This is because, according to Medina, neuroscientists have not found a definitive link between brain structure and behavior.

> **Brain Structure Doesn’t Strongly Influence Behavior**
> 
> Although Medina suggests otherwise, recent research indicates that gendered differences in brain structure are unlikely to shape how we behave. Researchers have noted differences in behavior among men and women and differences in brain structure—most notably that male brains are typically 10-15% larger than female brains. However, when they compared differences in brain structure with differences in behavior among study participants, they found that brain structure did not have a statistically significant impact on behavior.

#### Gendered Behavioral Differences

Medina describes numerous**behavioral differences between men and women, which he believes affect social and professional relationships.** Some research shows that women and girls are generally better at verbal communication than men and boys. Medina notes that this is likely because women tend to use both hemispheres of the brain when speaking and processing verbal information, whereas men tend to use just one.

Male and female children also form relationships differently, a pattern that extends into adulthood. Girls tend to bond by talking frequently, while boys bond through physical activities. And while girls prefer to form a consensus with another in social groups, boys prefer a social hierarchy with a distinct “leader”. When these styles of relationships persist into adulthood, they can cause social and professional difficulties. For example, a woman with a “masculine” leadership style may be seen as “bossy,” harming her ability to advance in the workplace. On the other hand, a man who does not try to compete with his colleagues may be seen as weak or unmotivated.

> **Gendered Conversational Styles in the Workplace**
> 
> Linguist Deborah Tannen has found that gendered conversational patterns can benefit men in workplace situations: For example, women may downplay their own contributions, and men may compete to have theirs heard, so people may think their male colleagues have more interesting ideas than their female colleagues. Men may also be seen as more confident than women in the workplace.
> 
> Even if gendered conversational styles don’t unfairly benefit men, they can still cause general misunderstandings. For example, men tend to raise issues directly, while women tend to do so indirectly—and if people aren’t on the same page about how to raise an issue, they’re likely to misunderstand each other.
> 
> Tannen recommends that managers acknowledge that their employees may have different conversational styles, and that these are often influenced by their gender. By understanding how conversational styles differ, they can determine how to communicate best with their employees, how to ensure participation in meetings, and how to understand their employees properly.

Medina notes that gendered communication and relationship styles are a general pattern, and that individual men and women often don’t adhere to them. He also notes that boys and girls are treated differently from one another from an early age. This suggests, then, that social differences between boys and girls at least partially result from cultural gender norms.

(Shortform note: Recent research from cognitive neuroscientist Gina Rippon bears this out. Rippon believes that male and female brains aren’t meaningfully distinct, but that the practice of treating boys and girls differently can shape their behavior—and since their brains are developing, their neural pathways.)

#### Gendered Cognitive Differences

Medina also notes several cognitive differences between men and women, which he argues affect both thought processes and cognitive health.

One cognitive difference is that men and women tend to respond to stress differently. Research suggests that, when responding to stress, men focus on the general overview of a situation, while women focus on the details.

(Shortform note: Research also shows that men respond to stress with a “fight-or-flight” response, while women respond with a “tend-and-befriend” response. This means that, when faced with a stressful situation, men are likely to either confront or avoid it, while women are likely to look for comfort.)

Men and women also tend to be susceptible to different psychological health issues. Men may be more susceptible to intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, antisocial behavior, alcoholism, and drug addiction. On the other hand, women may be more susceptible to depression, anxiety, and anorexia.

(Shortform note: Most researchers believe that a combination of biological and cultural factors explain why men and women are susceptible to different mental disorders. Men and women have different hormones, which impact our mental health. Yet aspects of culture that affect gender, like discrimination and gender roles, can also cause harm to mental health. Scientists note that much more research is needed to better understand how biology and culture can create different mental health outcomes for men and women.)

#### How to Address Gender in School and at Work

Because of the cognitive differences between men and women, Medina believes that teachers and managers should make adjustments to address gender.

In school, Medina recommends trying out same-sex classes. Because boys and girls typically have different social styles, he believes that same-sex learning environments would make participation more equal. Boys could participate competitively, and girls could participate with consensus, without either of these social styles coming into conflict.

(Shortform note: Many advocates for single-sex schools believe, like Medina, believe that single-sex schools can effectively accommodate differences in boys’ and girls’ learning. However, author Juliet A. Williams believes that there is little evidence that single-sex schools provide better educational experiences than co-ed schools, and they can actually have detrimental effects because they reinforce gender stereotypes.)

At work, on the other hand, Medina recommends pairing men and women together in teams. This is because men tend to remember the big picture of situations better, while women tend to remember the details better. Medina believes these two modes of thinking could complement each other in the workplace.

(Shortform note: One study found that workplace teams with even proportions of men and women come up with better ideas than teams with an uneven gender balance. The researchers found that this is because, when a person is in the minority in a group based on their gender, they’re less confident and less likely to share ideas. Equal representation of genders in a team seems to solve this problem.)

### Rule 12: We Learn by Exploring

_Brain Rules_ has discussed numerous aspects of cognitive science and development, ultimately painting a picture of some of the brain’s most important functions and how they impact our lives.

In the final chapter, **Medina trains his focus on a particularly important function: exploring, which helps us understand our environments and learn from our experiences.** Medina argues that we have an instinctive, strong desire to explore that drives us to learn about the world throughout our lives. He says that this desire is innate, and as such, we can observe this trait even in babies. He discusses how exploring plays a major role in early childhood development, and how we can continue to explore and learn throughout our lives.

#### Exploring and Childhood Development

**Medina notes that babies are born with intense curiosity and demonstrate early use of the scientific method**. Babies are able to explore and test their surroundings. Their explorations roughly follow the steps of the scientific method: They observe, form hypotheses, experiment, and draw conclusions.

**Almost as soon as they’re born, newborns can imitate others.** If you stick your tongue out at a baby, they’re likely to stick their tongue out in return. The baby might find that imitating something can lead to a specific result. This makes them test their hypothesis. For example, if you wave to a baby frequently, they’ll likely start waving back. Eventually, they wave at you first because they expect a wave in return. If you do wave back, they’ll learn that their hypothesis was correct.

**At around 12 months, babies experiment with objects they encounter.** Babies experiment with objects because they want to learn more about them. If a baby gets a new toy, for example, they might throw it, kick it, shake it, and put it in their mouth.

**At around 18 months, babies learn object permanence.** Object permanence is the ability to recognize that, even if you can’t see something, it doesn’t mean it disappeared. Developing object permanence enables babies to understand their environments. Babies often learn this through experiments—Medina uses a baby repeatedly covering and uncovering an object as an example.

**They also discover that others have different wants and needs from them.** Babies also discover around this age, through experiments, that others have different desires than them. Once they learn that other people want different things from them, babies and toddlers start to test the limits of others’ desires. For example, toddlers disobey their parents to test their limits, and to see how their parents will react to unwanted behavior. Through these tests, babies learn to understand the extent of others’ desires, which helps them to cooperate with others.

(Shortform note: Others have spotted the similarities between a child’s exploration and the scientific method, some going so far as to say not only are children small scientists, but that scientists are merely big children. In fact, they point out that the inventor of the modern scientific method, John Dewey, was inspired to outline the steps of the method by watching how children play.)

> **Later Stages of Development**
> 
> Medina describes how children explore, from imitating in infancy, to experimentation at 12 months, to object permanence and learning others’ feelings at 18 months. Though Medina stops there, children learn to explore in even more ways throughout childhood. These are the next steps of exploration, from 3-4 and 5-6 years old:
> 
> **At 3-4 years old, children ask questions about the world around them.** At this age, children have developed language and stronger motor skills, and they use them to explore their curiosity about the world around them. They tend to ask lots of questions of parents and teachers—for example, “why is the sky blue?” or “why do dogs bark?”
> 
> They’ll also continue to experiment with the world around them, and start to share their findings with others. For example, if a child plays in the dirt and finds a worm there, they might tell a friend that they found out where worms live.
> 
> **At 5-6 years old, children begin to use critical thinking and creativity in their experiments.** At this age, children are just as curious but have developed more cognitive skills, so their experiments become more sophisticated. They can reach concrete answers to their questions through experimentation, and apply that knowledge in the future.
> 
> For example, a child coloring with crayons might discover that red and yellow blended together make orange. They show it to a friend, and they talk about what might happen when they put other colors together. Coloring all over a piece of paper, they find out that red and blue make purple, and that yellow and blue make green. From this observation and experiment, they’ll have learned about mixing colors, and they use this knowledge to draw pictures.

#### Learning Throughout Life

While a massive amount of learning occurs during infancy and early childhood, we all learn throughout our lives. Medina writes that, while scientists used to believe the brain’s capacity for learning diminished over time, they now know that the brain’s capacity for learning stays strong as we age.

Brains also continue to change in response to new experiences. This is an evolutionary necessity. The ability of the brain to process new experiences helps us to realize when we’ve made dangerous errors and to learn not to repeat them.

Medina emphasizes that people never stop wanting to learn. While bad educational experiences can blunt the desire to learn, Medina believes that the drive to learn is strong and persists despite obstacles.

> **You Can Learn Later in Life, But You Have to Practice**
> 
> Many people assume that the capability to learn and remember information decreases with age. However, research echoes Medina’s assertion that your brain remains flexible as you age. Though some skills are still much easier to acquire in childhood, older adults actually have some learning advantages: Compared to children, adults have more developed skills in discipline and critical thinking.
> 
> To keep your memory and ability to learn sharp as you age, it’s important to stay physically fit, which helps brain health, and to practice using your memory. Some older adults assume their memory is bad, so they avoid using their memories in day-to-day life—for example, using a recipe for a dish they cook frequently. This can actually hurt the ability to form new memories and learn new information, so it’s important to frequently jog your memory as you get older.
