## Shortform Introduction

_Brain Rules_ was written by molecular biologist John Medina to explain 12 essential cognitive functions that shape the way we react to and interact with the world. Medina wrote the book for the vast majority of people who know little about the brain, to help them figure out how to use the brain’s natural instincts, desires, capabilities, and tendencies to improve their memory, ability to learn and solve problems, and other cognitive skills.

### About the Author

John Medina is a developmental molecular biologist and an affiliate professor of bioengineering at the University of Washington School of Medicine. His research focuses on the genetics of psychiatric disorders and the genes involved with human brain development.

### The Book’s Publication

_Brain Rules_ was published in 2011 by Pear Press. Through that publisher, Medina has published several follow-ups to _Brain Rules_ , including _Brain Rules for Baby, Brain Rules for Aging Well, Brain Rules for Work_, and _Attack of the Teenage Brain!_

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

John Medina summarizes some of the most important aspects of neuroscience known to researchers as of 2009. In doing so, he built on centuries of study in the field.

In ancient Greece and ancient Egypt, people believed that the heart, not the brain, controlled the _mind_ —the way people thought about and reacted to events. Ancient Rome was the first culture to believe that the brain controlled thoughts, as first theorized by the physician Galen. It took hundreds of years for scientists to develop more advanced brain science: Notably, in 1664, Thomas Willis wrote _Anatomy of the Brain_ , which introduced the term “neurology” and described neurological issues like epilepsy and paralysis. In 1837, scientist J.E. Purkinje introduced the term “neuron,” and in 1878, William McEwen conducted the first neurosurgery.

Developments came much quicker in the 20th century with the advent of technology. In 1929, Hans Berger invented the electroencephalography (EEG), which measures the brain’s electrical activity. Just a few years later in 1932, Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian and Sir Charles S. Sherrington discovered how neurons communicate with one another and won the Nobel Prize.

We now have many technologies to study the brain and its electrical activity, and we know more about the structure of the brain. These strides in knowledge provide the basis for Medina’s 12 brain rules—without knowing the functions of the different parts of the brain or how to examine it, we wouldn’t know very much about how the brain works.

#### Intellectual Context

Medina notes that each of the 12 brain rules is supported by peer-reviewed research that has been replicated. This focus on accuracy, according to Medina, helps to dispel many false ideas about the brain’s effects on behavior. If Medina’s book is about brain _rules_ , we can call these _false_ ideas “brain myths.”

One brain myth that Medina counters is that we all have individual “learning styles.” Learning styles is a popular theory that everybody learns best with one of their senses: There are visual learners, auditory learners, and kinesthetic learners (people who learn best when they can physically engage with what they’re learning). This theory is widely accepted by educators, but research does not support it. It may even cause harm in teaching, because students may try to avoid learning through methods that don’t match their “learning style.”

Another brain myth is that we only use 10% of our brains at once. This theory probably emerged sometime in the early 1900s, and is now widely accepted. However, brain scans show that we use almost all of our brains at all times, even during simple activities. 

Medina notes that part of the reason so many people believe brain myths is that people don’t understand many of the underlying principles of how the brain works. By supporting each of his brain rules with peer-reviewed, replicated research, Medina sets out to dispel myths and inform readers of how the brain’s functions shape how we learn and understand the world.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Brain Rules_ was a success: It hit the _New York Times_ best-seller list in 2009, an ebook was published in 2011, and an audiobook was published in 2014.

In November 2021, Medina presented a lecture at the National Conference of State Legislatures, an association representing the legislative bodies of the U.S. states. Medina gave advice on how to better listen and cooperate with one another, using research based on his neuroscience work. This lecture for a nonpartisan political organization indicates that Medina has developed influence as an expert on using neuroscientific principles in daily life.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

USA Today gave _Brain Rules_ a positive review, with critic Bruce Rosenstein writing that Medina’s writing style and voice make a potentially challenging topic pleasurable to read.

Reviews on websites like Amazon and Goodreads are largely positive, commenting on Medina’s lively voice and the new insights they’ve learned about the brain and daily life.

One common criticism was that the book was largely sharing intuitive, uninteresting ideas (for example, that it’s hard to pay attention to boring information). Some also found the book superficial, and others found that the principles weren’t directly applicable or actionable in their lives.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Medina synthesizes research about complex concepts and presents them to the reader simply and directly. He clearly explains each of his concepts, using interesting examples and humor, and is informed about how both science and culture inform the development of the brain.

There are, however, occasionally inaccurate concepts reported in _Brain Rules_ , and some areas have seen new scientific developments since its publication 10 years ago.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

The organization of _Brain Rules_ is simple and straightforward: Medina outlines a single rule in each chapter. This is easy to follow and intuitive, and Medina also uses the organization to his advantage by threading in ideas from earlier chapters in later chapters of the book.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve reorganized the structure of _Brain Rules_ by sorting the 12 rules into five categories organized by common themes.

Within each chapter, we’ve summarized the information to focus on the most important takeaways, removing tangential points and occasionally abbreviating scientific detail unimportant to understanding Medina’s main ideas.

When necessary, we’ve also provided commentary providing corrections or updates to scientific concepts. Other commentary provides more in-depth information on Medina’s concepts, ideas for incorporating Medina’s principles into one’s life, and scientific and cultural ideas related to the brain rules.
