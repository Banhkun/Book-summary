## 1-Page Summary

In _Coaching for Performance_ , Sir John Whitmore provides strategies to hone leaders’ skills, maximize employees’ potential, and drive performance through coaching. In a work world forever changed by globalization and the ability to exchange information instantly, leaders must shift from a command-and-control management model to a “we’re in it together” mindset that recognizes workers’ value. Performance coaches help leaders step into this new reality by revealing and capitalizing on employees’ greatest talents.

(Shortform note: In this guide, we’ll refer to “you” as the coach. We’ll also follow Whitmore’s lead of using “coach” to refer to _internal_ and _external_ coaches (those _employed_ and _contracted by_ the company) as well as leaders, whose roles require coaching. This guide will focus predominantly on 1:1 workplace coaching, which centers on maximizing the performance of employees (“coachees”) and leaders.)

Whitmore is a pioneer of workplace coaching and co-creator of the popular GROW model, a coaching framework for goal setting and performance improvement. The International Coach Federation gave him the President’s Award in 2007 to honor his lifetime of work. Published in 2017, the 5th edition of Whitmore’s groundbreaking 1992 book offers updated information on the benefits of coaching and giving feedback as well as new ways to assess and measure organizational culture and performance.

In this guide, we’ll examine what performance coaching is and why it’s important, how to create an effective coaching structure, steps you can take to maximize your coachee’s potential, and how to assess and measure organizational culture and performance.

We’ll also compare, contrast, and contextualize Whitmore’s work with the views of other coaches, psychologists, and mindfulness experts.

### Part I: The Ins and Outs of Performance Coaching

To get started, you need to know what performance coaching is, why it’s more important in the workplace than ever, and some of its key benefits.

#### What Performance Coaching Is and Isn’t

Whitmore says performance coaching is **a strengths-based, non-judgemental partnership in which coaches help business leaders and workers develop goals, strategies, and skills to maximize their potential and drive performance**. (We’ll explain how in Parts 2 and 3.) Performance coaches should view their coachee as fully capable, resourceful, and proficient in their thoughts, abilities, and skills—the coach’s role is simply to _reveal_ their best.

(Shortform note: Although performance coaches view coachees as equal partners, the reverse isn’t always true. Experts say that 70% of senior executives are alpha males who believe they’re smarter than everyone else and can be critical and resistant to change—making them difficult to coach.)

Whitmore says a performance **coach’s job is _not_ to instruct employees on how or what to do**, which can rob your coachee of the chance to absorb information they need to develop self-confidence, autonomy, and ownership of their work.

(Shortform note: Whitmore’s rationale for allowing your coachee to learn on their own is similar to experiential learning—an approach in which instructors allow students to directly engage in a task instead of showing them how to do it. For example, a welding instructor would allow students to _operate_ welding equipment instead of just talking about how it works so they know how heavy it is and how to physically operate it.)

Whitmore’s belief that a coach’s role is to help workers maximize their potential is rooted in psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Maslow believed that **all humans have the same basic needs and must satisfy each level of need to fulfill their greatest potential: self-actualization**. His hierarchy is illustrated as a pyramid with five horizontal layers:

  * At the bottom of the hierarchy are basic survival needs like food, water, and shelter. 
  * Once you satisfy these needs, you strive to meet mid-level needs for love, belonging, and esteem, respectively.
  * Upon satisfying these needs, you aim to satisfy your final need: to self-actualize. You satisfy this need when you find purpose and fulfill your potential. 



**At this point, you feel capable of functioning independently, believe that others respect your ability to do so, and don’t feel the need to prove your worthiness to anyone**. Whitmore says performance coaches should strive to help coachees reach this point.

(Shortform note: Psychologists say you can follow four science-based steps to achieve self-actualization: First, be open to new ideas and perspectives so you can learn and grow. Second, know your values so you can set goals that mean something to you and that you’ll feel good about**** when you achieve them. Third, ensure that your end goal is _self-actualization_ — _not love or esteem_ (the latter two are critical but not the end of the road in your development). Finally, be true to yourself. Pursue things that matter to you and you’ll enjoy your self-actualization journey.)

##### Why Performance Coaching Is More Important Than Ever

Whitmore says that globalization and the ability to communicate information instantly have made the workplace more interconnected and interdependent than ever. As a result, the traditional command-and-control management model—in which company leaders hold all the information and workers are wholly dependent on them for directives—is now irrelevant because leaders are no longer gatekeepers to that information.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that the command-and-control model, which emerged as World War II veterans entered business leadership roles, is dead. Research has since revealed that the approach damages worker morale and produces poor results, leading even the US military to largely abandon the model. Also, workers today are less likely to put up with it because they’re far less tied to a single company for the duration of their career than they were seventy years ago—so they’re less likely to stay in jobs where their voices aren’t valued.)

To compete in the new, dynamic work world, **leaders must embrace a “we’re in it together” mindset that values employees and their learning, growth, and autonomy**. When each team member performs at their best to achieve a common goal, the collective thrives.

> Experts call the work world that Whitmore describes VUCA: Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous:
> 
>   * **Volatility** refers to how fast an industry, market, or the world changes (the faster the change, the more volatile the world). For example, Blockbuster was the top video rental business for two decades but went bankrupt in 2010 when video-on-demand hit consumers’ homes.
> 
>   * **Uncertainty** relates to your ability to accurately forecast what’s going to happen (the more uncertain the world, the more difficult the forecast). For example, the COVID-19 pandemic came unexpectedly and dramatically altered the face of the tourism industry, shutting down attractions and resulting in mass layoffs.
> 
>   * **Complexity** refers to the number of, variety of, and relationship between factors that you analyze (more factors, varieties, and interconnection mean greater complexity—making analysis more challenging). For example, if you expand a business in another country, you have a host of new challenges you may confront, like different regulations, tariffs, and export controls.
> 
>   * **Ambiguity** is how obscure or difficult it is to interpret a situation (the more ambiguous, the harder to interpret). For example, the rise of the internet and rapid development of technology forced businesses to learn how to exist in a digital world without a “how to” manual (since one didn’t exist).

##### Other Types of Performance Coaching

Although Whitmore mainly focuses on 1:1 coaching, he also touches on three additional types of performance coaching.

**1\. Coaching for Team Performance**. Coaches work with leaders to foster a culture of openness, curiosity, and trust to maximize performance. To do this, help leaders:

  * See that each team is its own entity with unique potential that the leader can help reveal
  * Develop teams’ self-awareness, ownership of outcomes, and collaborative skills



(Shortform note: Experts warn that some teams resist coaching. Members may challenge coaches directly or not participate in meetings. If this happens to you, don’t default to unhealthy coping responses like being defensive or gossiping with team members who _are_ participating about those who _aren’t_. Instead, make honest observations like, “This meeting feels tense. I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels it. Can we talk about your thoughts on our work together?)

**2\. Coaching for Lean Performance** : Coaches work with leaders to**** engage employees in a process of continuous learning, growth, and improvement; they streamline operations, reduce waste, and create value for customers. To do this, work with the leader to:

  * Identify a big picture, organizationally 
  * Implement changes to reach the goal
  * Have ongoing conversations about what’s working, and what’s not, to assess progress
  * Standardize effective processes



(Shortform note: Some experts say that lean coaching is ineffective. They argue that 70% of lean coaching transformations fail and that within five years of starting them, 90% of organizations are in the same position or worse. The reason? Coaches’ failure to provide a level of coaching that enables leaders to see the value of a lean system. As a result, leaders don’t buy into the concept and thus don’t pursue change wholeheartedly.)

**3\. Coaching for Safety Performance** : Coaches work with leaders and workers to improve workplace safety. To do this, build workers’ awareness of unsafe behaviors and encourage ownership of outcomes.

For example, if an employee engages in an unsafe practice, immediately stop them and ask them, without judgment, to identify the unsafe practice. This raises their awareness. To deepen their awareness, ask about their understanding of the risks associated with the unsafe behavior. Finally, encourage them to take ownership by committing to**** take a different action in the future.

(Shortform note: Experts recommend some strategies to boost your coaching for safety efforts that Whitmore doesn’t mention. First, be aware of how well your coachee understands safety protocols so you can effectively track and support their progress. Second, encourage peer-to-peer safety coaching between managers and workers. This allows the latter to see the former less as punitive adversaries than partners sharing information.)

#### The Benefits of Performance Coaching

Whitmore says there are numerous benefits of performance coaching, including these four:

**1\. It maximizes employee and company performance**. The process taps workers’ and teams’ potential and fosters learning cultures that encourage risk-taking and innovation.

(Shortform note: Experts say that to encourage innovation in remote work environments, leaders must foster a culture that welcomes vulnerability and emotional honesty to make workers comfortable sharing ideas.)

**2\. It improves job satisfaction, engagement, and retention**. When coaches ask employees questions and show interest in them, workers feel valued. Workers who feel their voices matter are more satisfied, engaged, and likely to stay at their job

(Shortform note: Experts say retention is critical in a post-pandemic, VUCA work world because losing employees costs more than just money. Less tangible factors associated with worker departures can slow a company’s momentum and compound problems. For example, when an employee leaves, you have two choices: 1) Make other team members work extra to fill the void, which can lead to resentment, or 2) focus on restaffing, which can strain your HR team. Either way, your team loses time and focus needed for their regular work.)

**3\. Coaching reveals information that helps companies succeed**. When leaders meaningfully engage workers, including through coaching, employees are more inclined to share vital, on-the-ground information that can inform organizational decisions. This fosters a worker-centered culture that sees staff as integral to the company’s problem-solving processes.

(Shortform note: In _The Fearless Leader_, Amy Edmondson says that NASA could have prevented the Columbia shuttle explosion and the death of its crew members. Had it fostered a worker-centered culture and listened to the concerns of a lower-level engineer about the shuttle’s health instead of ignoring them, the explosion could have been avoided.)

**4\. Coaching balances responsibility evenly across companies**. Coaching strengthens employees’ capacities and confidence and encourages them to take ownership of their work. When workers function autonomously, leaders can focus on big-picture issues, not minutiae.

(Shortform note: In _Extreme Ownership_ , Jocko Willink and Leif Babin argue for Decentralized Command, a work delegation strategy based on the idea that leaders can only effectively manage six to ten people at a time. In this approach, teams are broken into small groups where senior leaders manage junior leaders, who directly manage teams of workers. Senior leaders lead the whole team to meet big-picture goals and empower junior leaders to make decisions that allow their teams to meet those goals. Trust, confidence, and balance are critical to senior and junior leaders’ relationships.)

### Part 2: Create a Coaching Session Structure

In the last section you learned what performance coaching is, why it’s important, and what some of its benefits are. Now we’ll look at how to effectively coach for performance, starting with how to structure sessions so you can make the most of your time with your coachee.

#### Structure Your Sessions

Whitmore says that whether you work within an organization or have been contracted to provide performance coaching services, you can maximize sessions’ effectiveness by putting a clear structure in place before you begin. This structure should include:

**1.** **The time frame over which coaching will take place**. Whitmore recommends a six-month duration, which gives your coachee time to practice building new habits and develop a good working relationship with you.

(Shortform note: A study examining the frequency of coaching conversations found that coachees who had more frequent sessions (every one-to-two weeks) experienced more positive results than those who had them every two-to-three or three-to-four weeks.)

**2.** **The preferred format and number of hours per session**. This will vary depending on whether your coachee’s company wants you to conduct sessions in person, virtually, or using a combination of the two. Typical sessions last 60 minutes.

(Shortform note: One study of coaching practices found that 30-39 minute sessions are more popular than 60-69 minute sessions. Further, coachees’ awareness can deteriorate over the course of longer sessions.)

**3\. A consultation meeting with your prospective coachee**. The purpose of this meeting is to ensure that you and your coachee are a good match for work together.

(Shortform note: Experts also suggest that before the meeting, you gather intel on your prospective client to better understand and establish common ground with them. For example, look at their social media to see their personal interests. Then, at your meeting, mention that you, too, love monster trucks.)

**4\. A follow-up meeting to set expectations**. Once you’ve agreed to work together, meet with your coachee to discuss logistics, the nature of your work, and your respective wants. To make the most of this conversation:

  * **Enter with a positive mindset**. Before the meeting, gather your thoughts by asking yourself: “If this conversation went better than I could ever dream of, what would that look like?” Then, let go of negative thoughts about yourself, the meeting, and the other person so you can focus on your, your coachee’s, and the situation’s greatest potential.
    * (Shortform note: A different way to foster positivity is to practice mindfulness to reduce stress and boost your mood. To do this, acknowledge and accept difficult thoughts and emotions with kindness and non-judgment. This creates space to focus on the positive.)
  * **Establish expectations of your work**. Clarify that coaching is a partnership in which both parties must participate equally and that it’s a practice intended to help your coachee maximize their potential, not a mentoring or counseling relationship.
    * (Shortform note: Experts offer more detail than Whitmore on what makes mentors and counselors different from coaches. Mentors typically engage with mentees in a long-term, unpaid relationship to provide career and emotional support and build networks. Counselors are paid to create safe, supportive spaces to help clients cope with challenges, solve problems, and identify what they want in life.)
  * **Be curious**. Demonstrate genuine interest in your coachee to build trust and encourage them to share information and ideas with you. To do this, ask about their expectations and needs. For example: “What does an ideal working relationship between us look like to you?” “What support do you need?” “What should we do when we hit roadblocks?”
    * (Shortform note: Even as you show interest in your coachee to build trust, they may not want to work with or open up to you. In this case, don’t judge—just consider reasons this may be true. For instance, maybe their employer mandated coaching or they don’t want to answer questions that feel personal. If their resistance is too great to reasonably make progress and their performance issues aren’t urgent, put the coaching on hold. If the issues require immediate attention, bring in HR or an outside consultant to help.)
  * **Seek permission**. When you ask permission to share observations, you cultivate trust and help your coachee buy in to the coaching process. Try asking, “May I offer a thought about what you just said?” or “Can I suggest an idea?” 
    * (Shortform note: Paradoxically, while coaches stress the importance of permission in their coaching relationships, some advise female coachees not to ask permission at work to avoid missing out on career opportunities. Successful people don’t ask for permission to do things in life—they act based on their gut and convictions and are more innovative in their work as a result.) 



### Part 3: Coach to Maximize Potential and Performance

In the last section we discussed how to structure performance coaching sessions from the outset to make the most of them. Now we’ll look at three steps to build trust with, empower, and make the most of your coachee’s potential and performance.

#### Step 1: Build Trust and Connect

Whitmore says **you have to build trust and connect with your coachee so they’ll open up and engage fully in the coaching process, which will help you maximize their potential**. To do this, listen actively to show that you care and be aware of your own thoughts and feelings so they don’t interfere with your work.

(Shortform note: In _Captivate_ , Vanessa Van Edwards suggests two different ways to establish trust upon first meeting. First, hold eye contact in 60 to 70 percent of your interactions to show interest. Then, keep your hands visible and gesture with them to demonstrate that you’re not hiding anything.)

##### Listen Actively

When you listen carefully to your coachee, you show that you care about them, making it more likely that they’ll share information that will help you maximize their potential. Whitmore outlines several strategies to be an effective listener, including these three:

**1\. Pay attention to your coachee’s tone of voice and choice of words**. This gives you an idea of what they feel strongly about and areas to explore more deeply. For example, if they say, “I _hate_ when my coworker talks over me at meetings!” in an irritated tone, probe deeper to see if they feel their ideas are regularly overlooked and want others to acknowledge them.

(Shortform note: Words and tone can take on a different life in email and text—communication forms where tone is difficult to interpret. In one study on this subject, participants only successfully deciphered sarcasm or seriousness in emails 56% of the time—but when they heard the same content on voicemail, they successfully interpreted them 73% of the time.)

**2\. Observe your coachee’s emotions and body language**. When you pay attention to your coachee’s physical cues, you gain deeper insight into how they truly feel. For example, if you ask your coachee how they’re doing and they say “Great,” but are slumped in their chair, arms crossed over their chest, they’re probably not great.

(Shortform note: In _Captivate_ , Van Edwards suggests another type of body language to keep an eye out for to assess people’s honesty: facial microexpressions. These momentary, almost imperceptible facial gestures communicate anger, contempt, happiness, fear, surprise, disgust, and sadness. Look for them to see if people’s words match their true emotions.)

**3\. Reflect back on what your coachee says**. When you reflect back your coachee’s words and thoughts, you show that you’re paying attention to and are working to understand them. There are multiple ways to reflect back what your coachee says, including these three:

  * **Mirroring**. You repeat back your coachee’s exact words
  * **Summarizing**. You offer a synopsis of what your coachee said, keeping the original meaning intact 
  * **Paraphrasing**. You translate what your coachee said into your own words, preserving their meaning 



(Shortform note: In _Coach the Person, Not the Problem_ , Marcia Reynolds says these strategies are part of the “reflective inquiry process,” which helps illuminate your coachee’s deeply held beliefs. **When you repeat back what your coachee has said—either in their exact words or another framing—you interrupt their automatic thought process and give them a chance to reflect more deeply**. This deeper level of self-inquiry expands your coachee’s sense of self and options and empowers them to make lasting change.)

##### Be Aware of Your Thoughts and Feelings

Whitmore says you should monitor your thoughts and emotions before and during sessions to connect with your coachee in an unbiased manner.**Failure to let go of negative ideas and judgments about your coachee can damage your perception of them as a partner**.

(Shortform note: Reynolds says one way to let go of negative thoughts and emotions is to consciously stay “in the moment.” Before each session, choose one or two emotions that will allow you to be present and support your coachee. For example, if your coachee is anxious and negative, choose to be calm and positive, then root yourself in these emotions in your session.)

#### Step 2: Empower Your Coachee

Whitmore says that to maximize your coachee’s potential, you must nurture three qualities: Self-confidence, awareness of self and others, and ownership of their work.

(Shortform note: In _Turn the Ship Around_ , L. David Marquet argues that for workers to perform at their peak, leaders need to not just _empower_ but free them to apply their talents, energy, and creativity—which ultimately endows them with a sense of internal power.)

##### Build Self-Confidence

Whitmore says that when you foster your coachee’s belief in themself, they function at their peak. Coaching naturally cultivates a positive cycle of self-belief in the following way: **Coachees set and achieve small goals in pursuit of a larger end goal, creating a series of successes that they attribute to their efforts**. This builds their confidence in what they’re doing and encourages them to continue forward on a positive path.

Further, these successes make coachees feel they have coaches’ trust and respect. This strengthens their sense that they’re able to make good decisions on their own and encourages them to continue to take ownership of their actions and work.

(Shortform note: In _Lean In_ , Sheryl Sandberg says that lack of confidence harms women pursuing leadership paths. Many experience “imposter syndrome,” which makes them feel undeserving and constantly on the verge of being exposed as frauds. Women are more likely than men to attribute their success to luck and to internalize negative feedback, lowering their self-confidence. To shake imposter syndrome, women should acknowledge that it’s a distortion of reality, “fake it till they make it,” and seize opportunities rather than wait for them.)

##### Build Attunement to Self and Others

Whitmore suggests you help your coachee become attuned to—or aware of—their own and others’ feelings and situations to maximize their potential. **Self-attunement helps your coachee consider their emotions and biases so they can make conscious decisions about how to act—and avoid reacting—in the heat of the moment**. This self-regulation supports their ability to act in ways that foster healthy working relationships.

For example, say your partner calls you at work and yells that you left dishes in the sink. When you get off the call, you’re aware that you’re furious and likely to snap at the next person you see. But you know that lashing out at colleagues would damage your working relationships, so you take a deep breath, acknowledge that you’re irritated, and take a walk to clear your head.

(Shortform note: Psychologists agree that practicing awareness can make you less reactive in the moment and better able to manage situations. Further, **when you _regularly_ engage your awareness when you’re fearful or anxious, you can reprogram your brain for the better**. So, if your mind is racing, focus on a single sense—like how something tastes or smells—to dampen the release of stress hormones. Also, be aware of deeply embedded, cognitive distortions that mess with your mind and well-being. For example, look for thoughts about what you “should” do (the root of perfectionism) and replace them with rational thoughts.)

**Additionally, attunement to others’ emotions and circumstances enables your coachee to gather information about conditions that impact their colleagues and their work together** , which further improves their performance.

For example, if you’re aware that a particular client annoys your boss, and that client comes to meet with your boss on a day you’d planned to pitch an idea to them, you’ll know to wait to pitch that idea until the next day when your boss may be in a better mood and more receptive to it.

(Shortform note: While there’s value in being aware of others’ emotions and situations, some coaches say there are times when you should ignore others—like when they’re struggling. For example, you may be inclined to rescue a colleague buried in work, but people often learn the most when they go through a struggle and come out the other side on their own. So, rather than rush in, be peripherally aware of their situation and jump in only if they truly need it.)

**Whitmore recommends developing awareness of self and others through meditation**.

(Shortform note: Whitmore doesn’t explain in detail how to meditate. To do a sitting meditation, follow these steps: 1) Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, hands in your lap. 2) Notice your breath flowing in and out of your nose. 3) If thoughts or physical sensations arise, mentally note them, then draw your attention back to your breath.)

##### Build Accountability and Ownership

Whitmore says coaches should help coachees develop an accountability and ownership mindset to increase their commitment to their work and maximize their potential. **When workers feel they have ownership of their goals and can decide the best way to accomplish them, they’re motivated to do their best** , which improves their performance.

(Shortform note: Research shows that leaders can also drive performance and improve outcomes by endowing employees with a different kind of ownership: financial ownership in the company. Financial ownership is linked to greater job stability, retention during recessions, and company survival, which may lead to less unemployment and greater macroeconomic stability.)

To build your coachee’s sense of accountability and ownership, follow these three tips to ask engaging questions that allow you to gather information about what’s important to them:

**Tip 1: Ask open-ended questions**. Open-ended questions yield more candid, detailed answers than yes or no questions, which typically prompt one-word answers and shut conversations down. Examples of open-ended questions include “What’s your goal?” “What barriers are limiting you?” “What resources are available to you?” and “What steps will you take?”

(Shortform note: Open-ended questions are also good if you’re trying to get a tight-lipped child to open up. When you ask them open-ended questions like, “What was the most interesting thing you did at school today?” you communicate that they and their feelings are important. This, in turn, strengthens their self-esteem and self-image.)

**Tip 2: Use non-judgmental words.** Use non-critical language to cultivate trust, create a safe space for your coachee to open up, signal interest, and gather information. Words that foster positive engagement include, “What?” “When?” “Who?” and “How many?” For example, “What are your thoughts on this issue?” and “When do you think is a good time to take action on this?”

One caveat: Whitmore recommends that you avoid “why” questions (for example, “Why did you make that decision?”) because they can make your coachee defensive. Also be cautious with “How” questions (for example, “How did you make that decision?”) because they can put your coachee into an analytical mindset, taking them out of the observational mode key to building awareness.

(Shortform note: To strengthen your practice of using non-judgmental words to create trust and a safe space for your coachee, re-evaluate your relationship to judgment. **When you regularly practice non-judgment—letting go of automatic judgments—you neutralize thoughts, feelings, and perceptions that can be toxic when left unchallenged**. In doing so, you create a more peaceful state and space in your mind to appreciate life’s beauties and see people and situations for what they are—as opposed to your _assessment_ of what they are.)

**Tip 3: Follow broad questions with detailed questions to pursue your coachee’s interests**. Once you have a big-picture understanding of what your coachee is saying, ask more in-depth questions to prompt them to think more deeply about what matters to them. The more they talk about things they care about, the more engaged they’ll be in the coaching process, and the more interested they’ll be in taking ownership of their work.

To ask more detailed questions, add a single emphasis word into sentences to deepen your coachee’s focus. For example, after they answer the question, “What do you want?” follow up with, “What _more_ do you want?” Or, follow “What could you do?” with “What _else_ could you do?”

(Shortform note: Experts say that companies can deepen employees’ connection to and ownership of their work by aligning workers’ roles and responsibilities with broader company goals. When companies explicitly communicate why employees’ work matters and how it supports the broader vision, workers gain confidence and proactively claim ownership.)

#### Step 3: Set and Achieve Goals With the GROW Model

Whitmore says you can help your coachee illuminate and achieve goals using the GROW model—a framework he and colleagues developed in the late 1980s to help employees set goals, maximize their potential, and improve performance. The model has four stages:

  1. **Goal Setting**. Identify your coachee’s immediate and end goals.
  2. **Reality**. Assess whether your coachee has chosen a realistic goal. 
  3. **Options**. Explore all possible actions the coachee could take to achieve their goal.
  4. **Will**. Determine your coachee’s determination to follow through on their goal by outlining specific steps, timeframes, and accountability frameworks for accomplishing it.



(Shortform note: The CLEAR coaching model preceded Whitmore’s GROW model and rests on the idea that managers should develop and guide workers—not just give directives. GROW takes the idea a step further, saying that managers and leaders should maximize employees’ potential by giving them ownership of their work. Another difference between the models: CLEAR focuses on coachees’ motivation and behavior, while GROW centers more on goal setting, making action plans, and reviewing goals. CLEAR stands for **Contract** (define your coachee’s work), **Listen** to your coachee’s feelings, **Explore** your coachee’s beliefs and assumptions, **Action** (make a plan), and **Review** your coachee’s progress.)

##### Step 1: Develop A Goal

Coaches and coachees should set two types of goals at the start of their session: a big-picture goal and performance goals. The first type of goal grounds and guides session, so you always know what you’re aiming for and can stay on track. The second type allows you and your coachee to assess the progress they’re making to achieve their broader goal. **Goals should be realistic, specific, tied to a clear timeframe, measurable, and agreed upon**.

(Shortform note: In _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth suggests a different way to think about and set goals: Frame goals as a multi-level hierarchy. Low-level goals are at the bottom and include daily actions like writing emails and going to meetings. These goals are a means to an end to achieve higher goals, like completing a work project. To determine each level of goals, continually ask yourself why you’re doing each task you’re doing and why you care about it. Each answer will send you to the next level until you have no answer. At that point—when you want something just because you want it—you’ve reached your highest level goal, the one you’ll dream about, fight for, and demonstrate grit to achieve.)

##### Step 2: Make the Goal Realistic

**Coaches and coachees must ensure that goals are realistic so they can reasonably be achieved**. To do this, be objective, emotionally disengaged, and use neutral language. This will prevent biases, judgments, and expectations from distorting your and your coachee’s perception of what’s realistic and their potential for success. For example, don’t say, “This is a bad**** goal.” Instead, try, “I think this goal may not be as achievable as it could be because it’s general. We can strengthen it by making it more specific.”

(Shortform note: Not everyone agrees with setting realistic goals. In _Principles: Life and Work_ Ray Dalio recommends that you shoot for the stars when setting goals. He says **the only reason you think you can’t achieve a goal is that what you know right now is limited**. But when you start working to achieve your audacious goal, paths that you couldn’t conceive of will present themselves to you. So, don’t let fear of the unknown stop you from setting bold goals.)

##### Step 3: Explore Action Options

Once your coachee has a goal, work with them to brainstorm all possible actions they can take to achieve it. **Whitmore says you should focus on quantity, not practicality, of ideas to foster creativity.** Welcome all ideas, no matter how small or seemingly silly.

(Shortform note: Experts recommend several visual brainstorming techniques Whitmore doesn’t, including mind mapping, where you generate ideas without the constraints of structure or order using colorful visuals. Bubble maps are another option: Draw three rows of three circles. Write a problem you want to solve in the middle circle and fill surrounding bubbles with solutions. When all bubbles are full, move an idea from an outside bubble to the middle and begin again.)

##### Step 4: Determine Your Coachee’s Will to Execute Their Goal

In this final stage, assess your coachee’s determination to achieve their goal to maximize their chances of attaining it. To do this, have them develop a plan with the following information:

  * **Specific actions they’ll take to achieve their goal**
  * **The timeframe in which they’ll accomplish each step**. This should be specific and carry some urgency to keep momentum going.
  * **Obstacles they may encounter and supports they might need**. This helps them prepare for and remediate potential roadblocks. 
  * **How you’ll know if they change their mind about part of the plan**.This helps ensure they remain accountable and that you’re both on the same page.
  * **How they plan to measure their progress**. This keeps them on track.
  * **Their level of commitment to their plan on a scale of 1-10**. Whitmore says that your coachee is unlikely to follow through on anything less than an eight. If they indicate a number lower than this, ask what barriers exist that keep that number from being a 10.



(Shortform note: Whitmore doesn’t go into detail about the possibility that your coachee won’t make progress. Experts say that several factors can block people’s innate motivation to perform at work, including home stressors and the feeling that their bosses don’t genuinely care about them. In the latter case, they may resent their boss and view performance pep talks as hollow. To avoid this, leaders should work with workers to understand challenges they face, assess their own role in those challenges, and take steps to resolve the problem.)

Once your coachee’s plan is set, **schedule regular check-ins to discuss their progress and give feedback.** Deliver feedback in a positive, non-confrontational way to encourage them to share openly, learn from the experience, and gain confidence in their actions.

For example, ask, “What’s going well?” “Are there things you’d do differently a second time around?” and, “What are you learning?” This will prompt your coachee to process their experience at a deeper level. It also offers a model to assess their own progress and performance, which gives them ownership and makes them more self-reliant.

(Shortform note: In addition to sharing positive feedback, experts suggest that you give feedback as promptly and specifically as possible because**the brain’s best learning occurs when it’s in action**. So, praise your coachee as soon as you identify an area of strength or progress, and be specific about what worked so they know what you’d like to see more of. The more you give feedback in this way, the more you’ll normalize the feedback process—turning performance reviews into friendly discussions rather than hot seats.)

Once your coachee has achieved their goal, have a final conversation to share feedback and wrap up. Ask your coachee how things turned out, what they learned, and how they’ll apply what they learned in the future. **This allows them to reflect on the coaching process as a whole and recognize their self-efficacy, which will further build their confidence, attunement, and ownership and maximize their potential and performance**.

(Shortform note: There are many ways to wrap up a final coaching session. One leadership coach recommends the following steps: First, ask your coachee to name their biggest insights and results from their work and what habits they’ll take away from it. Second, ask about their biggest dream in the year ahead and the first tiny step they’ll take to reach it. Third, have them pretend it’s three years in the future and they’ve achieved professional and personal success. Ask what their future self would tell you about what’s happened since you last worked together. Fourth, if you believe you can help your coachee achieve this dream, ask if they’d like to work with you on it. Finally, give them a gift card for a free session to encourage their return.)

### Part 4: Measure Organizational Culture and Performance

You just learned how to build trust with, empower, and help your coachee set and achieve goals to maximize their performance. In this final section, we’ll discuss how to assess organizational culture and measure the impact of your coaching.

#### Measure Culture and Performance

Whitmore says that to drive performance, leaders must understand their organization's culture and its impact on performance and, as the performance coach, _you_ must understand the impact of your work on company performance. Whitmore’s Performance Curve enables assessment of the former, and his Return on Investment (ROI) methodology measures the latter.

(Shortform note: Although “performance curve” and “return on investment” are common terms in many industries, here we’re referring to the specific assessment tools Whitmore developed.)

##### The Performance Curve

The Performance Curve outlines four stages of organizations’ cultural development and corresponding levels of performance that coaches and leaders should assess. Workers' motivating force at each stage in the Performance Curve corresponds to the needs that drive people at each level on Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

**Stage 1: Impulsive**. This stage is characterized by structureless chaos, inconsistency, and short-term thinking. Workers are motivated by survival. Performance is low.

At this stage, coaches should focus on raising team members’ self-awareness and awareness of others in the company and encourage them to be responsible for their work.

**Stage 2: Dependent**. This stage is characterized by a command-and-control mode of operation, low trust in authority, compliance, and risk aversion. Workers are motivated by the need to belong. Performance is low to medium.

At this stage, coaches should focus on empowering and encouraging team members to take greater ownership of their work.

**Stage 3: Independent**. This stage is characterized by structures that support individual workers’ and leaders’ goals and workers’ sense of autonomy, ownership, and drive to succeed. Workers are motivated by esteem. Performance is medium to high.

At this stage, coaches should focus on broadening team members’ perspectives beyond themselves and supporting their collaboration with colleagues.

**Stage 4: Interdependent**. This stage is characterized by teams running themselves, leaders supporting and inspiring them; strong collaboration, communication, and idea sharing; and a learning-centered culture. Workers are motivated by self-actualization. Performance is high.

At this stage, coaches should shift focus from supporting individual team members to overall team performance.

(Shortform note: Whitmore doesn’t detail how to do this kind of coaching, but experts say one way to support thriving teams is to have them regularly solicit peer feedback to enhance their performance. For example, they can informally ask colleagues, “What can we do even better in the future?” This question keeps input positive, productive, and forward thinking.)

> **The Six Stages of the Life and Death of An Organizational Culture**
> 
> Whitmore’s four-stage Performance Curve focuses exclusively on the improvement and growth of a company’s culture. In contrast, the Six Stages of Organizational Culture model envisions the full life and death cycle of company cultures, which unfolds as follows:
> 
> **Stage 1: Chaos**. This stage is characterized by unpredictable change and instability—the latter driven, in part, by impulsive behaviors of individual workers with little in common and no clear understanding of the organization’s purpose.
> 
> This stage is similar to the “Impulsive” stage of Whitmore’s Performance Curve, where individuality and inconsistency are high and performance is low.
> 
> **Stage 2: Maturing**. In this stage, workers settle into their roles. Individuals become a collective that shares characteristics, emotions, and behaviors.
> 
> This stage is similar to Whitmore’s “Independent” stage, where individual workers understand their role and care about their work. Attunement to the needs and good of the collective have yet to be developed, but performance is relatively high.
> 
> **Stage 3: Thriving**. In this stage, the group establishes a culture through a shared belief in the organization and its purpose. New traditions, beliefs, and behaviors flourish.
> 
> This stage is comparable to Whitmore’s “Interdependent” stage. Individual workers understand their relationship to and impact on the collective. The culture is healthy and self-sustaining. Performance is high.
> 
> **Stage 4: Fracturing**. In this stage, the culture peaks, innovation and success wane, and growth stops. The formerly cohesive group begins to doubt the organization and splinters.
> 
> **Stage 5: Deterioration**. In this stage, once-shared ideologies and social structures break down. The culture reverts to factioned interests of individual workers.
> 
> **Stage 6: Obsolescence**. In this stage, belief in the organization is dead. The culture reverts to chaos.

##### Measure the Return on Investment of Your Performance Coaching

Whitmore’s ROI measures the effectiveness of your performance coaching work at maximizing coachees’ potential and performance and changing organizational culture. This allows you to see the effectiveness and benefits of your performance coaching. Follow three steps:

**Step 1: When you begin work with your coachee, record—and have them record—the following information** :

  * Their short and long-term goals 
  * Actions they’ll take to achieve their goals
  * Reflections on their progress toward their goals 



**Step 2: Estimate the ROI**. At the end of your coaching relationship, take the information you gathered from Step 1 and connect them to quantitative results of your coachee’s efforts and the organization’s financial bottom line. List:

  * The coachee’s completed actions or tasks
  * The monetary impact of each action or task 
  * Your confidence (from 1% to 100%) in your monetary impact estimate
  * Multiply the monetary impact by your confidence level 
  * Divide that figure by the cost of your coaching
  * Multiply your result by 100



> **Alternate ROI Measurements**
> 
> Some experts say too much emphasis has been placed on assessing the financial ROIs of coaching work. They recommend instead examining the impact of your investment in coachees. Estimate this in the following ways:
> 
> **1\. Feedback ROI** : Measure your coachee’s response to, and application of, input from others about their performance to assess whether they’ve become more receptive to feedback.
> 
> **2\. Motivation ROI** : Measure your coachee’s drive in both their current job and pursuit of career dreams. This measure looks broadly at motivation and can reveal what traditional metrics do not: Why one coachee is highly motivated and another is not.
> 
> **3\. Happiness ROI** : Measure your coachee’s happiness in and outside of work to assess their emotional state. This information can help companies identify interventions that increase happiness and, thus, productivity.
