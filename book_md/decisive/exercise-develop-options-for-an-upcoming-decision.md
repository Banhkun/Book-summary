## Exercise: Develop Options for an Upcoming Decision

When faced with a big decision, it’s important to push yourself beyond binary thinking by developing more than two viable options.

* * *

Think of a big decision that’s on the horizon for you. (This decision might relate to your health, career, relationships and family, upcoming purchases, politics, education, finances, or leisure.) Describe that decision, and explain why it’s important to you.

List two options for that decision that represent a binary. For example: “adopt a dog” or “don’t adopt a dog.”

Next, develop an additional option by imagining you must eliminate one of the options in the binary. What option did you imagine eliminating, and what did you replace it with? For example, eliminate the option to adopt a dog and replace it with “foster a dog.”

Now, generate a both/and option that’s cautiously optimistic. For example: “Foster a dog for two months. If it works out, adopt the dog; if it doesn’t, foster another.” (If you already have a cautious option and an optimistic option in your list, you can combine them into one.)
