## The Elements of a Story

Stories consist of three things:

  * Narration: telling what happens and moving the story along
  * Description: adding sensory details to enliven the story
  * Dialogue: how characters talk



Notably, plot isn’t on this list. (Shortform note: He doesn’t define “plot” explicitly, but he implies it means “planning what will happen in the story before you actually write it.”)

We’ll cover each element, starting with why King avoids plot.

### Narration and Avoiding Plot

Arranging a plot before the story is written feels artificial. Our lives are plotless—we don’t know in advance what’s going to happen—and that gives life a constantly surprising, entertaining flavor. Writing a story shouldn’t be any different.

Instead, **King believes the story reveals itself as he writes**. He doesn’t force the action to move in a particular direction; the characters decide what to do, and he merely narrates what is happening as he observes it.

He analogizes writing like this to archaeology: The story already exists, buried in the dirt like a fossil. Your job is to unearth it delicately.

What does this mean, in practice? **King typically starts his stories with a situation, then discovers how his characters work their way out of the situation**.

Interesting situations typically start as “what if?”

  * _Carrie_ : What if a bullied girl in high school learned she had telekinetic powers?
  * _Misery_ : What if a psychotic fan kidnaps a romance writer?
  * _Cujo_ : What if a giant dog turns rabid and violent, terrorizing a mother and her son?
  * _The Dead Zone_ : What if a political assassin were the protagonist?



From there, he lets the story develop without an ironfisted demand for what should happen. He usually doesn’t know how the story will end. Instead, he watches the characters work their way through the situation. The characters may surprise him with their ingenuity or complexity; King doesn’t know what they’re going to do until they do it.

Writing this way, without plot, helps in a few ways:

  * It creates a more truthful story. If you force the arc to move in a particular way, your characters may behave unrealistically, contorted to fit the plot. In contrast, if you merely observe how characters behave, they’ll more likely ring true.
  * This style of writing maintains suspense—if you as the author are held in suspense during the writing, your reader probably will be too.



At the end of this section, **King challenges you to write a 5-6 page story based purely on a situation he gives you, with no plot**.

  * The backstory: a woman (Jane) marries a charming man (Dick) who turns out to be controlling, paranoid, and violent. After years of abuse, she divorces him and gets a restraining order, but he isn’t deterred. After a specific incident, Dick is jailed. (This is still backstory—you can include however much you want of this into your story.)
  * The situation: Jane drops off her daughter at a birthday party and returns home, happy to have a few hours to herself. When she gets into the house, she feels uneasy—she’s not sure why. She turns on the television and sees a story about three escaped convicts from the jail Dick was at. With dread, she _knows_ one of them was Dick and now knows why she felt uneasy—she’d smelled his distinctive hair tonic faintly. Now she hears footsteps coming down the stairs.
  * Now a twist: swap the genders: it’s a man who is being stalked by his ex-wife.



Write a story for this situation without plotting in advance.

### Characters

After planting the seed of the situation, King then observes how his characters respond to the situation. He believes **good stories center around the characters rather than the events**.

At the start of writing, the characters start off as relative blank slates, then develop over time. Some grow only a little; some grow so much they start influencing the shape of the story.

When you create characters, you necessarily draw from real life. One major source is yourself—as a writer, you often ask yourself how _you_ would behave in that situation. Another source is other people—the traits, habits, and behaviors you collect from the menagerie of people around you.

**Bad characters are unidimensional** —the “nice guy” or the “jilted lover” or the “evil scientist.” In reality, all of us see ourselves as the hero of our own films. Our actions are justified to ourselves, even if they seem ludicrous to other people. Portray the motivations and complexities of otherwise wooden characters, and the reader will find something to identify with.

  * For the kidnapper Annie Wilkes in _Misery_ , King showed how her motivations seemed perfectly reasonable to herself, and he helped the reader understand her obsession. This made her even more terrifying—instead of being a cardboard cutout monster, she could plausibly exist in the real world.



As always, show, don’t tell. Your characters should behave in ways that illustrate their traits without your needing to narrate them.

  * In King’s _The Dead Zone_ , the antagonist is a smooth-talking Bible salesman who later becomes a politician fated to set off World War III. King’s challenge was to show the evil underlying the public-facing charisma. In his first scene, the character stops by a farm, where he’s greeted by an unfriendly dog. He looks around to make sure no one’s home, then kicks the dog to death.



### Description

Description provides sensory texture to the story, which draws the reader in viscerally. You’ll primarily describe the environment and the characters.

**You don’t want too little or too much description.**

  * Too little description leaves the reader without a mental world to construct. 
  * Too much description feels onerous and buries the story in unnecessary detail. Some writers get carried away, describing the world in florid detail. In reality, your job as a writer is to tell the story.



Aim for the middle. **Provide enough detail to seed the reader’s imagination, but not so much that you prevent the reader from filling in her own details.**

  * For instance, King only needs to describe Carrie White as a high school outcast with bad skin and outfits that invite bullying. You automatically fill in the rest, visualizing the specific outfit, the number of pimples on her face, her outdated hairstyle, and so on. Describing her any more than this would oppress the reader’s imagery and weaken the bond between writer and reader.



Tips on writing description:

  * Visualize the scene in your head. Your job is to translate this feeling into words.
  * Choose the few details that immediately come to mind. Don’t go beyond the few key details—you need only enough to set the scene for the story.
  * Use figurative language, like similes and metaphors. When done well, they can show something familiar in a delightful new way.



How not to write description:

  * Don’t inject physical description with character, as in “fiercely intelligent eyes” or “elitist cheekbones.” This is lazy the same way adverbs are; you should reveal character through actions and dialogue.
  * Don’t use cliche figurative language, like “as tough as nails” or “as white as snow.” This makes you sound unread or lazy.



### Dialogue

Dialogue is what characters say. It defines who they are and what they’re like.

A common rule of writing is “show, don’t tell.” **Instead of narrating what a character is like, show it through their speech.** Through dialogue, a reader can tell if a character is witty or dull, transparent or sneaky, empathetic or cold.

  * For example, instead of narrating that a character is poorly educated and never went to school, show how he fumbles any word beyond a basic vocabulary, and how other characters react to that.



**The best dialogue sounds truthful—a reader believes that real people would talk that way.** King includes a conversation from Elmore Leonard’s _Be Cool_ :

  * “You doing okay?”
  * “You want to know if I’m making out?”
  * “I mean in your business. How’s it going? I know you did okay with _Get Leo_ , a terrific picture, terrific. And you know what else? It was good. But the sequel—what was it called?”



The dialogue sounds credible, and without any other description or narration you can picture the people saying these words. Good dialogue sounds like you’re eavesdropping on a real conversation.

Wooden dialogue sounds forced and grates on the ear.

  * King gives a quote from H. P. Lovecraft: “Nothin’... nothin’... the colour... it burns... cold an’ wet... but it burns... it lived in the well... I seen it... a kind o’ smoke... jest like the flowers last spring... the well shone at night.”



Writers vary in their ability to write good dialogue. Part of it depends on how writers interact with people. **Writers who write the best dialogue like _listening_ to other people, absorbing their rhythms, accents, and slang.** Recluses often don’t know how real people talk and so find it hard to make their characters talk convincingly.

People might also just be born with or without an ear for dialogue, the way some musicians have perfect pitch. Some writers are accomplished in all other parts of writing except for dialogue, which makes King think recognizing good dialogue is somewhat inborn.

When you write truthful dialogue, you might use profanity or otherwise blacklisted words. King grew up in the lower middle class and portrays how colorfully they talk. You might get criticism from pearl-clutchers, but don’t be deterred—you should never violate the promise you make with the reader to tell the truth.

### Other Literary Devices

Beyond the three basic elements of narration, characters, and dialogue, the writing toolbox contains many more tools, ones you remember from English courses—themes, symbolism, alliteration, stream of consciousness, repetition, back story, and so on.

King’s advice on these tools is to **make use of any tool that will enhance your story**. Yet don’t go too far—remember that the point of the story is to tell a story, not to show how many words you can alliterate.

Often, you’ll see opportunities to add literary flourishes after completing your first draft. Patterns that you weren’t previously conscious of may now appear. Your revision is a chance to polish these.

King focuses on two devices in particular: symbols and themes. While you might have unsavory memories of expounding on both in your English essays, they’re both natural parts of storytelling and can be quite simple.

#### Symbols

Symbolism is the use of an object or word to represent an idea other than its literal meaning. (Shortform note: For instance, the white color of the whale in _Moby Dick_ is typically a symbol of beauty and virtue (as in Italian marble and weddings), but in nature the color white often belies a terrifying destructiveness (as in polar bears and great white sharks).)

Like other literary devices, symbols enrich the story. They also become a focusing device through the story, providing yet another opportunity for telepathy.

Again, adornments merely adorn; they are not the reason the story exists. **Don’t premeditate your symbols before you write the story—it’ll feel artificial. Instead, discover the symbol as you unearth your story.** As you write or revise, if you notice the symbol, then bring it out further and polish it, as though you were excavating a gem.

King comments on two of his books with symbols:

  * While writing _The Green Mile_ , King quickly realized the story was about an innocent man being executed for a crime he didn’t commit. He changed the character’s name to J.C., a symbol of the “most famous innocent man of all time” (Jesus Christ). (Some criticized this as simplistic symbolism; King responds that he’s never trying to be an intellectual.)
  * In _Carrie_ , King noticed only after writing that blood perfused the story: at the beginning (when Carrie has her period), at the climax (a prank dousing Carrie with pig’s blood), and the ending (where a survivor of Carrie’s wrath has her own period). King wasn’t conscious of this pattern while writing, but found it meaningful when revising. He tried to connect blood to its many connotations—sacrifice, women’s coming of age, heredity.



#### Themes

A literary theme is a central topic or message within the story. It’s the big picture—**beyond the characters and story, what is your writing _about_?** What message are you imparting; what question are you answering? King believes all good writing has a theme. A theme is also inspiring to the writer—it makes the work worthwhile, more meaningful.

Like symbols, themes focus the story. They make the story feel more unified and coherent.

As with all adornments, the theme should not be premeditated. **Don’t start writing with the theme. Start with the story, and discover the theme as you go along.** King suggests figuring out what the theme is while writing the first draft or shortly after it. Then, in your revision, bring out that theme further.

Themes often come from your personal interests, what you like musing about. King has his own, which become recurring themes in his works:

  * The allure of technology and its inevitable problems (_The Stand_ , _The Tommyknockers_)
  * Why bad things happen to good people (_The Shining_ , _The Dark Half_)
  * Why God lets bad things happen to good people (_The Green Mile_ , _Desperation_)
  * The blurring of reality and fantasy (_Bag of Bones_ , _The Dark Half_)



Knowing the theme can even help you with writer’s block by showing you how the story connects together. Some writers call this “thinking above the curve” or “the over-logic.”

  * While writing his ambitious 823-page _The Stand_ , King was stuck with too many characters and plotlines and no clean way to take the story. While musing over the problem, he realized the theme was about violence being a core part of human nature, and how it’ll recur even if most of the world is wiped out and humanity has to start anew. From this theme, he found a suitable turn in the story—a bomb that kills half the major characters.
  * (Shortform note: It’s unclear when this crosses the line into planning the plot.)
