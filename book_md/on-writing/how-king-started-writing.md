## How King Started Writing

In the first part of the book, King shares vignettes of his early life, from childhood to his discovery of writing to his early career as a struggling author. While it’s full of entertaining anecdotes, we’ll focus on the events that seemed to have shaped him most as a writer.

Born in 1947, King was raised by his mother—his father disappeared when he was two. He had a brother, older by two years, who involved him in boyish hijinks. They were working class, his mother working jobs as a baker, then as a launderer as they moved around New England. Eventually they settled in Maine, living with their ailing grandparents.

### King Starts Writing

King began writing when he was six. Because of several rounds of medical issues—measles, ear infections, and tonsillitis—he spent most of his time at home and was held back from finishing first grade. With plenty of free time, King devoured comic books and fiction books.

He started writing by imitating: he copied stories from comic books word for word. He showed his masterwork to his mother, who was amused. She asked if he’d come up with the stories himself. He admitted he hadn’t, and she looked disappointed. **She urged him to write his own story—he could do better than the crude comic books.**

The idea of creating his own stories felt like an open world of possibilities. He soon wrote a four-page story about four magic animals adventuring to help children. He showed it to his mother, who laughed while reading it and declared it was “good enough to be in a book.” This remains King’s favorite praise.

He wrote four more stories, and his mother paid him a quarter for each. That’s how King earned his first dollar as a writer.

He continued writing stories and submitting them to publications. He published his first story in an amateur horror magazine; his title, before the publisher changed it: “I Was a Teen-age Graverobber.”

### Good Ideas Just Appear

**Stephen King doesn’t know where good story ideas come from. They just sort of appear.** Sometimes they come from seeing something in front of you. Sometimes two unrelated ideas collide and create something inspired and original.

**The key isn’t to sit and come up with good ideas—it’s to recognize a good idea when it does appear.**

He remembers the first time he came up with a really good idea. He was around 13, and his mother was compiling trading stamps, trying to save enough to buy his sister a Christmas gift. (Shortform note: Trading stamps were an early form of loyalty program. Companies like S&H Green Stamps would print stamps, which were bought by vendors like supermarkets to give to their customers as incentives to shop. Customers would then collect these stamps, stick them in stamp booklets, and redeem them for items.)

Frustrated with not having enough stamps for the gift, his mother stuck her tongue out in exasperation. It was colored green from licking the stamps. King thought it’d be nice if you could print your own stamps.**A story idea flashed in his mind.** It was about a money counterfeiter who discovers he could get anything with enough stamps—even a house for his mother, costing just eleven million stamp books.

The counterfeiter excitedly prints millions of stamps in his basement with a press and begins fixing them to stamp books with an adhesive machine, until he discovers a problem—the glue he’s been using discolors the stamps, rendering them worthless. He has only one alternative—affix the stamps by licking, as usual. Looking around at his millions of stamps, he dejectedly gets to work licking, and licking, and licking. His lips, tongue, and teeth have already been stained pink, but he continues licking to get his mother her house.

### Try, Try Again

King submitted the stamp story to _Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine_ , and he got a cold rejection letter telling him to use a paper clip instead of staples to bind his submission. He pinned the letter on the wall with a nail. From then on, whenever he got a rejection slip, he’d stick it onto the nail, like a stack of receipts at a diner.

By the time he was 14, he’d gotten so many rejection slips that the nail couldn’t hold up any longer. He hammered a sturdier spike into the wall and continued writing.

By the time he was 16, his rejection letters began sounding warmer. Said an editor of _The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, _“This isn’t for us, but it’s good. You have talent. Try again.”

### A Horror Fan

From his early teens, Stephen King loved movies. There were only two movie theaters in town. One theater showed only family-friendly fare—Disney cartoons and musicals. King found these wholesome, predictable, and boring. He didn’t want to see manicured actors singing happily on a stage; he wanted destruction of cities and monsters devouring humans.

He found these films in plentiful supply at the other theater. King fondly recalls a dozen movies, ranging from _I Married a Monster from Outer Space_ to _Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman_. He’d watch a movie every weekend he could and anytime he could hitch a ride.

One particular favorite was a loose adaptation of Poe’s _The Pit and the Pendulum_ (his favorite scene was one showing the corpse of a woman who had been buried alive, her mouth agape in a scream). He was so enamored of the film that he decided he’d write a novelized adaptation of it (“blissfully unaware” of the plagiarism implications), then sell the book to his classmates for a quarter apiece. The plan worked better than expected—he’d replicated the film’s horror well in words—and he sold $9 worth of books.

But the good times didn’t last. He was called into the principal’s office, where he was admonished for selling his wares in a place of education.

**Even worse, his teacher castigated him for wasting his writing talent on this kind of trash.** This comment stuck with him for years. He would review his writing with shame, wondering if he was indeed wasting his talent. In the present day, King notes that **every writer (and every creator, really) will at some point be told that they are wasting their talent and be scolded for not working on something more worthwhile**.

### King Meets a Fellow Writer

After high school, King wanted to enlist to fight in the Vietnam War. He’d get some good life experiences for a book. His mother categorically refused, quipping that with his bad vision, he’d be the first to die.

He enrolled in the University of Maine instead and majored in English. While there, he worked in the library, where he met a fellow writer, Tabitha Spruce. **They shared a passion for thoughtful, purposeful writing.** See, at the time, the young writers around King seemed to think that good writing came from sudden bursts of formless inspiration, leading to incoherent stream-of-consciousness ramblings.

During a poetry workshop, Tabitha recited a poem she wrote, carefully crafted with clever diction and imaginative imagery. As she explained in the discussion, she had a concrete message behind the poem, a commentary on mankind’s tendencies. King fell in love with her then. They married a year and a half after meeting, and had two children within 3 years after.

### Trying to Make It in Writing

After graduating from college, King continued his education to earn a teacher’s certificate, as a backup career in case his writing wouldn’t pay. This wasn’t of much use immediately—he couldn’t get a teaching job, so he worked at a laundry for $1.60 an hour. Tabitha worked at Dunkin’ Donuts.

King continued writing during his breaks at the laundry and after work. It was tough going. **He’d only occasionally sell his stories, and they were on the brink of needing to accept welfare.** He was mortified that he might simply be reliving his mother’s life (she, too, worked in a laundry to support her family), and thought that surely their lives should be going better.

In one instance, the family was returning from a trip when his daughter developed an ear infection and fever. They knew they needed amoxicillin but couldn’t afford it. Fortuitously, King found an envelope in their mailbox—it was a check for one of his stories, paying $500. It was the largest check he’d received for his writing to date. Relieved, he bought the medicine and treated his family to a dinner.

King soon found a job teaching English at a nearby high school. It paid $6,400 per year, which was a temporary relief. But it soon exacted a large cost on his writing energy. Between the teaching, after-school meetings, and grading homework, he was too exhausted to write. **He began despairing for his future as a writer** —might he become one of those disillusioned English instructors, always claiming to work on that breakthrough novel but never having the courage or perseverance to really get something real done?

Through these difficult times, his wife Tabitha was a vital source of continuous support. She never chastised him for wasting time writing stories (even horror stories sold to men’s magazines). Having someone who believed in him pulled him through.

### The Breakthrough

During summer months when school was out, King continued working in the laundry. One day, he recalled a memory from when he worked as a janitor in college. He remembered having to clean the girls’ shower and being bewildered at how oddly familiar yet different it was—there were no urinals, but there _were_ tampon dispensers.

Now, as an adult revisiting this memory, King envisioned the opening scene of a story: a group of girls showering in the bathroom, when one of them starts bleeding from her period. The girl has no idea what’s happening to her; the other girls start jeering and throwing tampons at her, and the girl starts screaming.

At the same time, he remembered reading an amazing article about telekinesis (manipulating objects with your mind). The article suggested young people might have powers, especially girls around the age when they had their first periods. Right there, **out of nowhere, from the fusion of two distant and unrelated memories, King stumbled upon the idea for _Carrie_**.

It didn’t stand out as a particularly good idea, but he thought it might be solid enough to get another check. It incubated in the back of his mind for some time until one night he typed out three pages.

He didn’t like it. The character (the bleeding girl) seemed too passive, too much of a victim. Even worse, he didn’t know much about teenage girls, and he preferred writing about subjects he was intimately familiar with. He crumpled up the papers and went to bed.

The next day, he returned from school to find Tabitha with the papers. She’d found them in the trash and read it. She thought there was something there and pushed him to keep developing the story.

As he continued writing dozens of pages, he began feeling that there was something here too. Through writing the story, **he learned two vital lessons** :

  * As a writer, you might have the wrong first impression about the characters you’re creating.
  * Don’t stop writing when it gets tough. You have to struggle through it. Even if the writing feels tough, it might actually be something good.



In 1973, he sent the manuscript off to Doubleday and forgot about it. One day, while he was teaching, Tabitha phoned the office to give him a message—they’d received a telegram from the publisher (they couldn’t afford a phone), saying **they’d buy the book and send an advance of $2,500**.

King and Tabitha were elated, and that night their minds churned through the possibilities. Could he quit his teaching? Not on a $2,500 advance—not if he couldn’t continue publishing consistently. How much would paperback rights sell for? _Maybe_ as high as $60,000—Mario Puzo had just gotten $400,000 for an advance for _The Godfather_ , but _Carrie_ wouldn’t get anywhere near that.

The book took a year to get published, coming out in the spring of 1974, and by that time King had mentally moved on. He was working on a new novel, and his mother was starting to show signs of weakened health.

One day, while alone in the house, he got a call from his contact at Doubleday. He shared the news: **_Carrie_ ’s paperback rights were sold for $400,000. **King was shocked, literally speechless. After confirming multiple times that he hadn’t misheard the number of zeroes, he rushed out to get a gift for his wife. When Tabitha returned, he announced the news. She looked at their $90-per-month rental apartment and started crying.

### Demons

From this triumph, King’s writing career took off. From that point on, King published roughly one to two novels per year, including _The Shining_ in 1977, _Cujo_ in 1981, and _Misery_ in 1987.

But his health belied the success. **He had become an alcoholic.** He’d already started drinking heavily in the early 1970s, from the beginning of his marriage. When his mother died in 1974, King remembers delivering the eulogy drunk.

Beyond just liking to drink, King also bought into the myth of the genius writer/substance-abuser, in the style of Hemingway and Fitzgerald. The excuse that someone like Hemingway might use was that writers are by nature sensitive people, but being sensitive isn’t manly; alcohol dulls the sensitivity and helps the writer cope with the existential crises and lonely despair that writing brings.

By the 1980s, King began using drugs regularly—cocaine, Valium, even cough syrup and mouthwash. He tried to hide his habits, but his struggle surfaced through his writing.

  * _The Shining_ features an alcoholic former teacher and writer; King didn’t realize until later that he was writing about himself. 
  * _Misery_ (written in 1985, published in 1987) shows a writer imprisoned and tormented by a psychotic fan. The writer has no choice but to indulge his kidnapper’s requests. 
  * _The Tommyknockers_ (written in 1986, published in 1987) was a sci-fi horror story about humans unearthing an alien spaceship. The ship gives them genius inventive powers, but it makes them deranged and sacrifices their soul. This was his metaphor for drugs and alcohol.



Around the time he wrote _The Tommyknockers_ , his wife staged an intervention. She gathered friends and family, dumped his drug paraphernalia from a garbage bag onto the floor, and demanded that he get better or leave the family. It was too painful watching him slowly poison himself to death.

Initially resistant (as many addicts are), he came around to it. **He didn’t want to be the tormented writer in _Misery_ , a captive of his own destructive habits.** Most of all, he didn’t want to lose his family. He quit the alcohol and drugs.

King was scared that his creativity and writing energy would disappear with the alcohol, but this wasn’t the case at all. His writing wasn’t always perfect, but he began rediscovering a sober joy in his writing. Through his recovery, he never stopped writing.
