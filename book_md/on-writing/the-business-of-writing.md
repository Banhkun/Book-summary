## The Business of Writing

Now you know how to produce writing that tells the truth. How do you survive on this writing? King ends his advice with practicalities of getting an agent, getting published, and writing programs.

### Getting an Agent and Getting Published

Novice writers think that getting an agent is their golden ticket to getting published. Complementary to this is the idea that getting an agent is difficult, and that publishing is just an exclusive old-boys’ club.

King thinks this is totally fiction. The writing world is always looking for the next bestselling author they can make money off of. **These writers can come from anywhere** , from the struggling single parent of J.K. Rowling to Frank McCourt, who was 66 when he published _Angela’s Ashes_. There is no secret club.

In turn, it’s not that hard to find an agent. But not all agents are good, and getting an agent is not a magic wand.

Here are tips on publishing and making your way in the business:

  * **Start by building up your writing credentials.** Get published wherever you can and work your way up. You need to be your own advocate before anyone else becomes your advocate.
  * Study the places where you want to publish. 
    * Read magazines to understand what they like. 
    * Buy the book _Writer’s Market_ , a thorough guide to publishers, magazines, awards, and agents. You’ll find their pay rates and thumbnails of what they’re looking for.
  * Polish your submission to look professional. Include a brief but meaningful cover letter, print double-spaced copy on good paper, and show the word count clearly. Make it easy for them to like your submission.
  * Submit your pieces to your target publications. You might have to aim lower at first, such as your college literary journal or small magazines that only pay issues (instead of paying money, they’ll send you contributor’s copies of the issue).
  * As you build up your resume, consider getting an agent, particularly if you’re targeting a bigger work like a novel. Agents will take you more seriously if you write a professional letter and have a publishing record.
  * **Vet agents who reply.** Ask agents for a list of places they were able to get their clients published. Be suspicious of any agents who ask for a fee for the privilege of reading your work. 



### Writing Classes, Workshops, and Seminars

King is often asked whether writing classes, workshops, and seminars are worth it. (These are formal programs where writers dedicate time to write and critique each others’ work.) King has mixed-to-negative feelings.

Let’s start with the positives:

  * If you find yourself too distracted to write in everyday life, it might provide the formal structure and freedom you need to get off the ground.
  * If people around you don’t take your writing seriously, a writing program gives you a safe place where everyone takes the craft of writing seriously.
  * Writing programs expose you to talented writers. Only a tiny fraction of authors can make a living with just writing; others need to teach to survive. This is a good chance to meet very capable writers.



Despite these benefits, there’s plenty to dislike about organized writing programs.

**Writing programs turn writing into an obligation.** If you pay money to attend a writing program and force your day to revolve around it, writing becomes less of a spontaneous joy and more of a labor. In contrast, if you make time to write in everyday life, you’re more likely to feel that you’re doing it for joy.

**The critiques tend to be useless.** King’s experience is of writers sitting in a circle, nodding and smiling complacently, offering only inarticulate blandishments.

**When you know you’ll get immediate critiques on your writing, you won’t be able to write with your door closed.** You’ll constantly be thinking about answering to other people, perhaps with the previous night’s feedback still stinging. You’ll keep questioning yourself instead of writing for yourself.

Novice writers often see formal writing programs as a permission slip to write. **You don’t _need_ permission to write. **No one needs to anoint you as a Writer for you to work. King wrote his early work as a teenager, then developed his craft while working in a commercial laundry.

Novice writers also often see writing programs as the secret sauce to getting their lucky break.**** Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts. **The best way to learn to write is to read a lot and write a lot. You often learn the most important lessons all by yourself.**
