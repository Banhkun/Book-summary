## Writing Fundamentals

Improving as a writer requires hard work. There are no shortcuts.

### Talent and Hard Work

**One sign of talent is enjoying the hard work.** What seems like labor to other people is pleasure for you.

Stephen King reads 80 books a year, despite professing to be a slow reader. He doesn’t read to learn, he reads because he likes reading. And when he writes (2,000 words a day), it typically feels like playtime to him—it’s the rest of life, with the errands and the bills and the “relaxing” that feels like work to him. He categorically denies ever having written for money—it’s all out of pure joy.

For King, writing is fun on a few levels. On a mechanical level, he relishes the feeling of arranging words in just the right order. On a higher level, he’s inspired by the idea of enriching the lives of his readers and how writing enriches his own life.

If you don’t feel the joy, you might not have the talent. King tells a story about his son getting inspired to play the saxophone. King gave him a saxophone and a teacher, and waited to see what would happen. His son became technically competent, but he didn’t show the exuberant spontaneity of talent. He diligently met his prescribed half-hour practice sessions, but never went beyond them. He mastered the scales, but he didn’t riff the way people who love music do. Ultimately they all agreed he should stop and find somewhere else he might be more talented.

If you don’t enjoy reading and writing, then you won’t become a good writer. But **“if you can do it for joy, you can do it forever.”**

### Read a Lot

To be a good writer, you need to recognize what good and bad writing is. **Reading exposes you to good and bad writing. The more you read, the more you learn.**

Often the bad writing is more instructive than the good writing. It teaches you what not to do—what’s cliche and needs to be avoided, how characters act unrealistically, how writers ruin the pacing of a story with plodding description. It might even be inspirational—if you think a bestseller is terribly written, then you might start thinking you could easily do better.

Good writing teaches you what to do. It has style, believable characters, and good plot pacing. It shows you what is possible with the written word. Good writing can be intimidating, but it can also be inspirational—even if you fear you’ll never reach Steinbeck’s level, you can still labor to brush up against it.

Through thousands of hours of reading, you sharpen the tools in your toolkit. You absorb other people’s writing rhythm, how they develop their characters and plot, and how they wield language. You take what you like and forge your own style.

At the end of the book, King covers hundreds of books he’s enjoyed through the decades since _On Writing_ was published. They cover a wide range of genres and time periods, from classics of Charles Dickens and Joseph Conrad to contemporary bestseller authors like Peter Abrahams and Lee Child.

#### How to Read More

**Bring a book with you and read wherever you can.** If you have a dull moment—waiting in a line, in traffic, eating alone—read. Audiobooks make it even easier to absorb a book while otherwise occupied.

**Stop watching television.** It’s intellectual junk food, and it’s not going to help you become a better writer. Quitting it will probably make you happier. (Shortform note: Today, he’d likely extend this to aimless Internet browsing and social media.)

### Write a Lot

How much should you write everyday? It depends on the writer.

James Joyce was a famously slow writer. There’s a (possibly apocryphal) story about him moaning to a friend that he’d only written seven words that day—and he didn’t know what order they went in! Harper Lee wrote only one book, _To Kill a Mockingbird_ —King wonders how she spent her time and why she didn’t do more with her talent.

On the other hand, prolific writers, naturally, write a lot. Anthony Trollope, producer of tomes like the 848-page _Can You Forgive Her?_ , wrote for two and a half hours every morning before he went to his day job in the postal service. English writer John Creasey wrote 600 novels under 28 pseudonyms in his lifetime.

King is famously prolific, which isn’t a surprise given his personal working schedule:

  * **He writes ten pages a day, or 2,000 words.** Every three months he produces about 900 pages, a good-sized novel.
  * He dedicates his morning to writing time. He doesn’t move on to his errands and reading until he finishes his writing goal.
  * He writes every day of the year, even holidays. He doesn’t like taking a break from a story once he starts, otherwise it starts feeling cold and he loses the rhythm of the story.
  * He believes a first draft of a book shouldn’t take more than three months, or else the story starts feeling foreign.



#### Where to Write

Your writing location should be a dedicated place where you block out the rest of the world, because you’re creating your own world.

Most likely, you’ll work best in a place that’s yours, not a coffee shop or a park bench.

**Eliminate all distractions possible** —your phone, the view out the window, alarms. Shut your door so people know not to disturb you. This doesn’t have to mean silence—King listens to loud hard rock while writing, but his music is another way of blocking out the rest of the world.

#### How to Get Started

If you’re a new writer, it’s asking too much to adopt King’s demanding daily process. Here’s how he suggests you get started:

  * Set a habit: define your writing location and carve out a daily time when you’ll be writing. 
  * During that time, shut your door.
  * Set your daily goal low and achievable. He suggests 1,000 words a day. Until you meet this goal, your door stays shut.
  * Take no more than one day off a week.



### What to Write About

You can write about anything. **The only requirement is that you tell the truth.**

Good writing pulls readers in by telling the truth. The characters seem real and behave in recognizable ways; the reader sees herself and her beliefs embedded in the story. In contrast, you likely stop reading a book when you can’t identify with any of the characters and find them implausible.

It’s common advice for starting writers to “write what you know.” Interpret this liberally. It’s not what you literally know (otherwise you couldn’t write about going to Mars) but rather about the truths you understand—what life feels like, how romance and friendships develop, the details of your work. Don’t take “write what you know” to artificially limit what you feel capable of writing about.

Before becoming a writer, John Grisham was a lawyer, and he took what he knew about law (details of whitecollar crime, the savagery of law firms) to write his breakthrough novel _The Firm_. The world and characters are believable, because they came from John Grisham’s truth.

You’ll probably start by writing in the genres you like to read—if you’re a science fiction fan, you’ll write science fiction. You might even emulate the style of writers you like, which is nearly unavoidable for novice writers until they develop their own voices.

**What you _shouldn’t_ do is write what you think other people will like—friends, colleagues, critics, book buyers. **Don’t try to emulate the form, plot and style of bestselling authors. All this takes you away from authenticity, and your readers will know.

So write what you know and like, and bring your truths into the story. You know some unique truths about the world, which will make your writing unique.

### Don’t Wait for a Muse

Some writers wait for inspiration to strike from the heavens, and in its absence they putter about not producing any work. This is not how you get better.

King says his muse isn’t an angel who bestows wonderful ideas with a wand; his muse is a gruff, surly guy living in the basement who wants to see labor before he awards inspiration. Your muse _will_ visit, but you need to have an “Open for business” sign on your door. The best way to show this is to write.

**The hardest time during writing is usually at the beginning. Once you start, it gets better.**
