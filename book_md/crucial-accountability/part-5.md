## Part 5: How to Discuss Ability Barriers

If we’ve determined that the accountability issue is due to an _ability_ barrier, the authors assert that **we can help the other person overcome that obstacle by making our request both _possible_(by removing ability barriers) and _easy_ (by removing extraneous or arduous steps)**.

We can accomplish this and enable the other person to meet expectations by:

  1. Involving the other person
  2. Identifying the root cause of the ability barrier



We’ll explore each of these in the sections below.

### Involving the Other Person

The authors explain that there are three primary benefits of involving the other person in the process of identifying ability barriers:

  1. It makes it much easier to identify the primary barrier because the other person is likely to know better than you whether it’s personal, social, or structural.
  2. Jointly brainstorming ways to solve the problem will likely produce more effective solutions because the other person is closer to the problem than you are, therefore they will likely have a more complete view of the issues and how they can be fixed.
  3. People are generally more motivated to enact a solution when they are involved in developing it.



To effectively involve the other person in the process of identifying barriers and creating solutions, genuinely ask them to share their ideas: “Since you’ve been spending time thinking and working on this problem, I value your opinion greatly. What do you think needs to be done to solve it?”

> **The Five Styles of Conflict Management**
> 
> The author’s recommendation to collaborate embodies the most effective style of conflict management of the five styles outlined in the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Model Instrument (TKI), a tool used by communication experts and human resource specialists worldwide to identify a person’s style of handling conflict.
> 
> A collaborator approaches conflict by being both assertive and cooperative, and by working with others to identify problems and solutions. Many psychologists agree that this is the ideal strategy because it indicates that the initiator has a high concern for both self and others, allowing all parties to get what they want while minimizing negative feelings.
> 
> The remaining conflict styles, in order from most to least effective according to the TKI are: compromising (indicating a medium concern for both self and others), accommodating (indicating a low concern for self and high concern for others), competing (indicating a high concern for self and low concern for others), and avoiding (indicating a low concern for self and low concern for other). When we choose silence over voicing our concerns, as the authors note often happens, we’re enacting the worst approach to conflict—avoiding.

However, inviting the other person to participate can be tricky when you either don’t have the authority to do so, or when you think it may make the other person feel unsafe.

#### When You Don’t Have the Authority

The authors note that while asking the other person to brainstorm with you is pretty straightforward, it can be tricky when you don’t have the authority to require the other person to get involved.

  * For example, if your boss never helps out on projects that you’re meant to collaborate on, it can be awkward asking your superior why they're constantly slacking off. 



**If this is the case, ask permission:** “Since we both agree that there’s an issue here, do you think it would be possible to talk about what might be causing the problem and how we can solve it? I’d like to come up with a solution, and I think you would have good ideas and valuable input.”

> **Gaining Authority**
> 
> In _The Practice of Adaptive Leadership_ , Ronald Heifetz argues that there are two types of authority, formal and informal. While your formal authority (aka your title or position) might not be enough to make you feel comfortable asking your superior to have a chat, your informal authority might give you a confidence boost _and_ make your superior more likely to heartily agree to your suggestions. You can increase your informal authority in a few ways:
> 
>   * Use your formal authority (whatever it may be) to gain access to people with more authority. These people might be able to “lend” you authority.
> 
>   * Improve your relationship with others in your environment. This might give you more credibility and support from others.
> 
>   * Gain credibility by creating small successes over time. People will then be more willing to listen to your good ideas.
> 
>   * Help other people achieve their goals, even if they’re unrelated to you. Others will be more likely to support your endeavors in the future and you will gain social clout.
> 
> 


#### When Safety May Be at Risk

The authors advise that if you think the other person may feel uncomfortable getting involved, you can broach the topic by:

**1) Introducing the discussion by asking if there’s anything you’re doing to cause the problem:** “My ultimate goal is to solve the issue at hand. I’m especially interested in knowing if there’s anything I’m doing that contributes to the barrier you’re facing.”

**2) Making it clear that you’re not trying to fix something that’s wrong with the other person, but instead trying to fix the issue.** To do this, try starting with your best guess at the root issue: “I think we both agree that there’s some underlying cause that’s impacting your ability to complete this task. I’m not blaming you for this issue, but I think it would be helpful to explore it together to come up with the best solution. Is it possible that you’re missing some knowledge required to complete the project? If so, let’s talk about what we can do together to solve the problem.”

> **Another Use of “I” Language**
> 
> When you’re trying to involve the other person but safety may be at risk, the authors recommend focusing on the problem and your role in it, rather than the other person. This is another situation where using “I” language can help achieve the authors’ recommendations. Focus on and take ownership of your own emotions and behaviors. If you use too much “you” language, the other person is likely to feel even more unsafe and become defensive. By keeping the focus of the discussion on the problem rather than the other person, you’ll lessen feelings of criticism or judgment.
> 
> This mirrors the authors’ earlier recommendations on how to establish mutual respect and shared purpose. In this way, the authors’ advice on how to _set up_ a successful conversation can help you when you’re _in the midst_ of the conversation as well.

### Identify the Root Cause of the Ability Barrier

The authors contend that the best way to solve an ability-based accountability issue is to work with the other person to identify the root cause.

Sometimes, the other person will be able to pinpoint the issue right away. For example, maybe the reason the employee couldn’t complete the article on time is that they were missing the data from the analyst.

Other times, the ability barrier might not be as obvious, or the other person might feel uncomfortable revealing it. In these situations, **we need to analyze the personal, social, and structural barriers that could be impacting the other person’s ability; once all the possible barriers are on the table, we can work with the other person to identify the _root_ barrier**.

(Shortform note: When discussing ability barriers, psychologists note that the phrases used by the other person to explain the ability barrier can help us determine whether the root cause is an internal barrier (personal) or external barrier (social/structural). Phrases such as “I’m trying,” “I don’t understand,” and “I thought” indicate that the root barrier is internal, or personal. Phrases like “I’m waiting for,” “I’m stuck at this step,” “I need,” or “I don’t have enough time” can indicate that the root barrier is external—either social or structural.)

#### Discussing Personal Barriers

**Personal barriers are the trickiest to discuss with the other person because people often mask their inabilities**. To make the person feel comfortable discussing personal challenges, keep the conversation upbeat. Calmly ask if they feel comfortable doing the job and if they feel they have the skills and knowledge necessary for this particular task.

(Shortform note: In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves explain that relationship management in the workplace can make it much easier to discuss personal barriers with employees. They note that difficult conversations become easier when you have a positive relationship with employees because people are less likely to take things personally and more willing to open up to you when they know that you respect and support them.)

#### Discussing Social Barriers

Consider how other people might be disabling the other person from completing the task or fulfilling the commitment. People might feel just as uncomfortable “ratting out” other people as they do exposing their personal shortcomings, so again, make it safe for them to do this. Be sure that you’re not implying the need to expose the guilty party, rather that this is about finding and removing barriers.

> **Toxic Employees**
> 
> If the social barrier is a coworker who’s preventing the other person from completing their tasks, you might be dealing with what management experts call a _toxic employee. _Toxic employees exhibit bad behaviors that not only diminish their own work quality or efficiency but also rub off on others and prevent them from meeting expectations. When a leader is faced with this type of person, experts emphasize that they must hold them accountable for the sake of the work environment and all the employees therein.
> 
> Expert recommendations on how to confront these types of people closely mirror those in _Crucial Accountability_ —identify the specifics of the issue (find the key issue), provide specific feedback (succinctly explain the issue), and explain the consequences (how the issue impacts you and others). Many add a few additional recommendations not mentioned in _Crucial Accountability_ : Isolate the person until the problem is solved so they don’t impact the ability of others or spread their bad behaviors, and document their actions—both what they do well and don’t do well.

#### Discussing Structural Barriers

Structural factors usually cause the most invisible barriers, but they’re typically the easiest to discuss with the other person because they usually don’t reflect on a person’s character or relationships.

We tend not to notice or consider how elements of our environment could be barriers because we see them as rigid and unchangeable. As such, be sure to ask the other person about things like systems, policies, procedures, and work layouts—these could be the underlying factors of their inability.

> **Home Life as a Structural Barrier**
> 
> In this section, the authors explain the importance of discussing structural ability barriers with the other person. However, the book’s discussion sticks to fairly obvious structural barriers like lack of tools or the work environment. It’s also important to consider that the other person’s home life may be causing a structural barrier.
> 
> It can be difficult to know how someone’s home life is impacting their ability to uphold commitments. If the other person has an abusive spouse or sick child, for example, this might impact their concentration throughout the day or their ability to remember deadlines. While this is something that most people will not openly discuss, we can look for signs that this might be the root cause by examining their behavior. Psychologists explain that the following behaviors are signs that someone may be struggling more than they let on:
> 
>   * Communicating less with friends/coworkers
> 
>   * Being less productive
> 
>   * Constantly tired or sleepy
> 
>   * Impaired judgment or reduced inhibitions
> 
>   * Neglecting hygiene or dressing differently (usually dressing down more frequently)
> 
> 

> 
> If you notice these patterns in the other person and think it may be time to discuss their home environment or mental health, you should
> 
>   * Choose an appropriate time and place where you can have an uninterrupted one-on-one conversation
> 
>   * Ask encouraging, non-judgemental questions that let the other person know you support them and want to help. Ex “is there anything going on at home that might be affecting your concentration or how you’re feeling? If so, I want you to know that you can talk to me and I will do what I can to support you without judgment.”
> 
>   * Be honest and straightforward, explain to the other person that you’ve noticed the above patterns and the accountability issue, and that you wonder if it might be because of issues at home.
> 
> 


Now that we’ve mastered the techniques to start an accountability discussion and have the skills to identify the root cause and solution, it’s time to move on to troubleshooting. What do we do if we’re having an accountability conversation and an entirely new infraction arises?
