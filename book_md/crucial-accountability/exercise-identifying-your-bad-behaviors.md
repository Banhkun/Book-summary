## Exercise: Identifying Your Bad Behaviors

During accountability conversations, there are a handful of common mistakes that people make which could negatively affect the outcome. Often, we don’t realize that we're making these mistakes because they happen unconsciously. By looking at our past failed conversations, we can identify what went wrong so we can avoid making the same mistake in the future.

* * *

Think about the last time you had an accountability conversation that didn’t end well—for example a sibling or partner blew off the agreed-upon solution or an employee became annoyed at you. Now consider the above mistakes. Did you do anything either consciously or unconsciously that caused the adverse consequences?

Now that you’ve identified what you might have done that resulted in the unsatisfactory outcome, reflect on other exchanges you’ve had in the past (consider not only accountability conversations but other exchanges such as making a request of someone or giving them feedback). Have you repeated this behavior in other contexts? What was the other person’s response to the behavior and what was the outcome of the exchange?

If you find that this is a repeated behavior that results in a negative outcome during exchanges with others, consider that it might exist in your blind spot. In other words, you might not realize that you’re doing it. Brainstorm some techniques or alternative behaviors that might help you avoid making the same mistakes in the future.
