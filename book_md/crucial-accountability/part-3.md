## Part 3: Initiating the Conversation

The authors assert that**the first step in initiating an accountability conversation is creating a safe space.** To do this, you’ll need to establish both _mutual respect_ , so the other person doesn't feel you’re belittling them, and a feeling of a _shared purpose_ , so they understand that you’re working toward a common goal rather than trying to point out their faults.

### Establishing Mutual Respect and Shared Purpose

The authors explain that to begin your conversation with mutual respect and a shared purpose,**you must explain the issue succinctly and respectfully.** If we fail to do this, we could risk overwhelming the other person with information, compromising their feeling of safety.

To accomplish this:

  1. **Lay out the facts of the situation.** Explain what your expectations were and how the other person broke them. Remember to focus on facts rather than emotions. For example, if you’re discussing the issue of someone constantly interrupting you, you could say, “It’s important to me to allow other people to finish speaking before chiming in to show respect and consideration for what they have to say, but at dinner last night, I noticed that you frequently cut me off mid-sentence.” 
  2. **Share how the situation impacted you**. To do this in a way that ensures the other person feels respected, use tentative language and highlight the fact that you could be wrong. For example, you could continue the conversation with, “I could be wrong, but this makes me feel like you don’t respect what I have to say, or don’t think that it’s important.”
  3. **Ask for their side of the story**. Open the floor by asking, “I know you may not be aware that you’re doing this, but I’d like to hear what you think about the situation.” Ask this sincerely and listen to the answer carefully. Once the other person has answered, reestablish the key issue by determining if it was a motivation or ability issue, and whether personal, social, or structural factors were at play. 



When you approach the conversation by laying out the facts, expressing your feelings, and asking for their perspective, you lay out the issue succinctly while letting the other person know that you’re not accusing them, rather informing them of the problem you’re facing and asking to work together to solve it, benefiting both of you in the long run.

(Shortform note: In _Difficult Conversations_ , Stone, Patton, and Heen recommend a similar approach to bring up the issue while maintaining a safe environment. While they essentially recommend taking the same steps, they combine the first two steps from Crucial Accountability into one, recommending that you lay out the facts and explain how the situation impacted you in the same statement. They add that you can most effectively do this by taking a third-party stance—in other words, focus on the facts and consequences and avoid emotional explanations. Their next step lines up with the third step presented by the authors: Invite the other person to respond.)

> **The Second of the Four Horsemen: Stonewalling**
> 
> If we fail to heed the authors’ advice in this section, we might cause the other person to fall prey to another of the “four horsemen” of Gottman’s theory: _stonewalling_. Gottman explains that stonewalling is when the listener becomes overwhelmed and tunes the speaker out by ignoring, acting busy, turning away, or engaging in obsessive behaviors, ultimately building a wall between themselves and the other person. He adds that stonewalling is a common reaction when a person feels overwhelmed—as they might if we don’t explain our problem clearly and succinctly as outlined above.
> 
> Stonewalling is a dangerous behavior for relationships because it ultimately closes off communication between two people and indicates that the listener has checked out of the conversation—and possibly the relationship. When one person checks out of the relationship by stonewalling, the other is likely to check out soon after, and relationships can’t exist without open communication.

### Maintaining Mutual Respect and Shared Purpose

The authors explain that sometimes we may unintentionally say or do something that makes the other person sense a lack of mutual respect or shared purpose. When this occurs, we must be able to identify the issue and re-establish safety immediately.

**To ensure that safety is maintained throughout the conversation, the authors explain that we must continually monitor the other person’s perception of mutual respect and shared purpose by looking for indications that they’re feeling anxious or defensive**.

In the below sections, we’ll discuss how to re-establish mutual respect and shared purpose when we sense they’re in jeopardy.

(Shortform note: While the authors suggest monitoring safety by looking for indications that the other person is feeling anxious or defensive, they don’t specifically state what these indicators are. Psychologists explain that we can pick up on aggression or defensiveness by looking for behaviors like placing hands on hips, clenching fists, rolling eyes, repeating motions like tapping fingers or feet, or closing posture with crossed legs or arms. Behaviors that can indicate anxiety or discomfort are avoiding eye contact, rapid blinking, biting or pursing lips, and closed posture.)

#### Mutual Respect

**The authors write that if you think the other person is feeling unsafe due to a perceived lack of respect, you can use a technique called _contrasting. Contrasting_** is when we reassure the other person that their negative perception of our intent is inaccurate by contrasting it with what our (more positive) intent actually is.

To use contrasting, first**** try to understand why the other person might feel disrespected. Next, explain to them that this is _not_ what you mean. Last, tie in the contrasting point by explaining what you _do_ mean.

For example, if your business partner is habitually making decisions without you, they might assume that you’re bringing up the issue because you think they make _bad_ decisions. You can use contrasting to put them at ease by saying: “I don’t want you to think I’m unhappy with the decisions you’ve made. They’re good decisions and I support them. But, I’d like to be more involved in the process to ensure we both agree on decisions before they’re executed.”

> **Using “I” Language**
> 
> Experts explain that another way to establish mutual respect is by using “I” language. “I” language is when we focus the issue on our own emotions, feelings, and problems by using the pronoun “I.” Using “you” language, on the other hand, puts the focus of the discussion on the other person’s shortcomings and frames them as _personally responsible_ for the issue. This can make them feel disrespected, embarrassed, or belittled.
> 
> An example of “you” language would be “ _you_ were supposed to hand in that project on Monday, and now _you’re_ holding up the presentation.” This sounds like you’re blaming the other person and intentionally making them feel bad. Instead, we could phrase the same issue using “I” language: “ _I’m_ getting stressed that _I_ don’t have that project yet. _I’m_ going to have to reschedule the presentation if _I_ don’t get it soon.” In the second example, you avoid blaming and accusing the other person while also owning your feelings and addressing your concerns. It’s an effective way to bring up the accountability issue while ensuring the other person feels respected rather than blamed.
> 
> The authors don’t specifically mention using “I” language, but their examples and discussions consistently use this technique. For example, contrasting models using “I” language by redirecting the conversation away from blaming or accusing the other person (which is what they think you’re doing) and back to focusing on _your_ intent and perspective.

#### Mutual Purpose

The authors explain that if the other person begins to feel like the purpose of the conversation is only serving you and that you’re not considering their best interests, they are likely to feel unsafe. They might think that you brought up the issue with ulterior motives: to embarrass them, force them into something they don’t want, take away their authority, or cause them distress.

To reestablish mutual purpose, clarify your intent: solving a problem that impacts both of you while maintaining a positive relationship.

  * For example, you might say, “The reason I wanted to discuss the decision-making process is so we both feel more comfortable with the final decision. If only one of us is making decisions, that person holds more responsibility and stress than the other. If we work together, we can share the burden and have an extra set of eyes checking our ideas for flaws.”



(Shortform note: Establishing a mutual purpose or goal shouldn’t _only_ become important when you’re having an accountability conversation. Establishing a mutual purpose in workplaces and personal relationships fosters productivity and can actually prevent accountability issues from occurring in the first place. In _The Oz Principle_ , Craig Hickman, Roger Conners, and Tom Smith explain that when people within a company aren’t on the same page about shared goals, it can lead to a lack of focus and unity, likely resulting in accountability issues or at least a decrease in productivity. So, to avoid accountability issues in the first place, make sure everyone in your unit, whether it be your family or workplace, is working towards a clearly defined and acknowledged purpose or goal.)

> **The Third Horseman of the Apocalypse: Criticism**
> 
> In this part, the authors emphasize the importance of starting your conversation by establishing mutual respect and a shared purpose, and by maintaining these throughout. This is because without a shared purpose of improving the relationship, we could easily let our heated emotions get the best of us and end up venting our complaints about the other person during the conversation. If this happens, we’re ultimately falling prey to Gottman’s third horseman of a relational apocalypse: _criticism._
> 
> Criticism happens when, rather than entering the conversation with the goal of working together to better the relationship, our goal is self-serving—to make the other person feel bad for their actions and having wronged us. When we criticize the other person, there is no mutual purpose or respect involved.
> 
> As one of the Four Horsemen, criticism has the potential to end a relationship. To avoid criticizing the other person (and possibly causing relationship termination) be sure to enter the conversation with, and maintain, mutual respect and shared purpose—this will help you avoid falling into the realm of criticism.
