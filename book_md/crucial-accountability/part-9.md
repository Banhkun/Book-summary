## Part 9: The Truly Tough Situations and How to Handle Them

**While the steps laid out above are sufficient to solve most accountability issues, the authors note a few situations where extra steps or precautions may be necessary.** The section below will discuss these novel situations and how to handle them.

### Dealing With an Obstinate Person

When the other person is _impossible_ to hold accountable because they either refuse to have an accountability discussion or refuse to change their ways, your options are unfortunately limited. **When you’ve done your best to converse and it seems the situation is a lost cause, you have two options: endure or end the relationship.**

> **Are You Dealing With a Narcissist?**
> 
> People who refuse to be held accountable or to change their behaviors tend to have narcissistic tendencies and could even have narcissistic personality disorder _—_ a condition that causes __ people to lack empathy for others and to struggle to see their own faults. Because narcissists are masters at making people like them, it can sometimes be hard to tell when you’re dealing with one. The traits below are common to narcissists and can help you determine whether you may be dealing with one, and might need to follow the advice in this section.
> 
>   * They monopolize conversations (talk over or interrupt others and dominate the topic).
> 
>   * They flaunt rule-breaking or going against social conventions.
> 
>   * They’re fixated on their appearance and always need to look good.
> 
>   * They tend to be an envious or jealous person.
> 
>   * They lack empathy and disregard others.
> 
>   * They have a deep need for praise.
> 
>   * They don’t take responsibility and blame others (this one might be obvious).
> 
>   * They’re terrified of being abandoned or left out.
> 
>   * Their view of reality seems much different from yours and others.
> 
> 


**Enduring a relationship:** When the issue isn’t big enough to end the relationship, we can learn to endure the issue by trying to see the other person’s story. This entails empathizing with the other person and coming to reasonable conclusions about their behavior.

(Shortform note: Experts note that in addition to the authors’ recommendations on how to cope, you should also know your triggers and avoid them when possible. If you do become triggered, take deep breaths and try to ground yourself in the present moment rather than your thoughts and emotions.)

**Ending a Relationship:** If you find that you cannot empathize with the other person and you remain upset over the issue, you’re not enduring but _wallowing_. Wallowing is when we remain in a situation but constantly complain, either internally or externally. In these situations, the authors say that you must end the relationship.

(Shortform note: Experts second the authors’ argument that persisting, unsolvable issues that cause distress warrant relationship termination. While it might be extremely difficult to end a relationship, experts explain that staying in a relationship where problems persist can be unhealthy for you and the other person, leading to paranoia, avoidance of intimacy, self-doubt, sense of doom, and cynicism. Further, the longer you stay in a toxic relationship, the more likely you are to carry these trauma symptoms into your next relationship.)

### When You’re Changing the Rules or Breaking Standard Practice

**When you change the rules or break standard practice,** you may be changing or contradicting previous accountability expectations—such as holding people accountable in a previously accountability-free environment. In this situation, it’s common for people to resist a change to their routine, especially when they don’t understand why the change is necessary.

(Shortform note: Psychologists explain that neurobiologically, humans resist change because it disrupts homeostasis, the state of steady chemical conditions within our brain. Our basal ganglia, a cluster of nerve cells in the primitive part of our brain, is responsible for wiring habits—automatic or routine behaviors. Enacting these routine behaviors releases feel-good chemicals. When we’re forced to change these routines, it disrupts the release of these chemicals that we normally get. Hence, we’re hard-wired to resist these changes and maintain a steady chemical balance.)

To get people on board with significant change:

  1. Inform influential people and ask them to spread the message that the standard practice is going to change and people will be held accountable for following the rules.
  2. Describe the current rules/practices and their natural consequences so people understand why things need to change.
  3. Describe your vision of how things should be instead, and then explain the rules and practices that should be enacted to materialize that vision. 
  4. Contrast past practices and the new change so people can connect what they used to be doing to what they should be going instead.



> **Encouraging Others to Change**
> 
> Many experts second the authors’ suggestions on how to effectively enact change within an organization. Some of their recommendations correspond to the _Crucial Accountability_ authors’ ideas:
> 
> **1\. Activate peer pressure to mobilize the crowd.** Having peer leaders serve as role models by being early adopters of the changes and calling out people who break the rules highly motivates others to meet expectations. This corresponds to the authors’ first suggestion above, to enlist influential people to help enact the change.
> 
> **2\. Tweak the situation.** Explain the current practices and why they don’t work, then introduce the new practices and explain why they will be better. This combines steps two and four of the authors’ recommendations.
> 
> **3\. Paint a vivid picture.** To get people to realize why the change is needed, paint a picture of the negative outcomes of current practices, and then how much better things will be once the change you’re proposing is enacted. The stories and images are powerful vehicles for change. This mirrors the authors’ third point above.
> 
> Other suggestions add on to the authors’ recommendations:
> 
> **4\. Embrace the power of one.** Make sure you stick to one new rule or practice at a time. If people are overwhelmed by 5 new rules at once, they’re likely to either resist all of them or forget some of them.
> 
> **5\. Make it sticky.** Make your proposed changes concrete and measurable so that people can meet expectations without having to guess if they’re doing things right.
> 
> **6\. Subtract distractions.** One of the most effective ways to change behavior is to remove enablers, triggers, and barriers.
> 
> **7\. Link to carrots and sticks.** While this shouldn’t be the first move, introducing punishment and rewards can be helpful.

### When You’re Asked to Address an Issue You Didn’t Witness

Another difficult situation would be if you’re a person of authority and you’re asked to address an accountability issue that you didn’t witness firsthand. For example, an employee might complain about another employee talking down to coworkers.

The authors explain that if someone makes a complaint about another person, you must first observe the behavior yourself before approaching the other person. Without first observing the behavior with your own eyes, you’re unable to see the full picture. As the authors mentioned earlier, entering the conversation seeing only one perspective spells disaster.

**In these cases, before having a discussion, put yourself in situations where you may be able to witness the problem behavior. Once you have witnessed the behavior yourself, then you can discuss it.**

(Shortform note: The authors don’t address what happens if you can’t witness the accountability issue firsthand. If this is the case, experts recommend that you hold a mediation between the complaining and offending parties. In doing this, try to focus on the outcome (eliminating the issue or its underlying consequences), give each side an equal chance to share their perspective, and identify a plan that will resolve the issue.)

### When Acknowledging the Issue Would Devastate the Other Person

You might also run into trouble if you’re dealing with**** someone who thinks they excel in an area and you must tell them that they aren't meeting standards. In this situation, you run the risk of greatly damaging their self-esteem.

In this situation, prepare for the discussion by breaking the issue down into smaller parts: What smaller pieces can the person work on that will ultimately improve the issue as a whole? Rather than addressing the issue upfront, consider holding multiple conversations where you address a smaller issue each time. In the long run, the small improvements will fix the overall issue.

For example, if the other person is a terrible writer, don’t start with “your writing needs a lot of work to meet expectations.” Instead, break the big problem into smaller, workable pieces. First discuss improving sentence clarity, then once that has improved, work on grammar, and so on.

> **Breaking Down Big Requests**
> 
> Experts second the authors’ argument that we can accomplish a major change (like helping an employee improve their writing skills) by breaking it down into smaller parts. To do this, we should:
> 
>   * Make sure we identify exactly what the end goal looks like and what it entails.
> 
>   * Determine the smaller parts of the whole. What individual things need to be accomplished before the overall goal can be met?
> 
>   * Create a logical order. Which part of the process makes the most sense to address first, second, third, and so on?
> 
>   * Create a timeline. Lay out exactly when you think each part of the process should be started and completed. While this might change once you get started, be sure to adjust your plan accordingly and stick to it.
> 
>   * Review the results once you think the goal has been met to ensure that all the important components you identified in the first step are there.
> 
> 


### If You Think You’re Nagging

**If you’re constantly having accountability conversations about the same issue and the other person never changes, you can start to feel like a nag.** In this situation, you have two options:

1) If the issue is small, like your spouse leaving their shoes by the front door rather than putting them on the shelf, consider expanding your comfort zone. If the issue causes you a minor inconvenience but is something you can cope with, then do so.

2) If the issue is important to you, have another accountability conversation and really focus on the pattern of the problem.

(Shortform note: The authors recommend that if we feel like we’re nagging and can’t cope with the issue, we should alter the key issue of our next discussion to address the pattern of the behavior. While not discussed in this section of the book, we can further strengthen our key issue by tying in the impact of the pattern on our relationship with the other person, as the authors discuss in Part 1. If these attempts fail to solve the issue, we’re now falling into the first section of this Part, “Dealing with an Obstinate Person.” Based on the authors’ recommendations, if we can’t adjust our expectations and they can’t adjust their behavior, our only remaining option at this point would be to leave the relationship.)

### Your Only Relationship With the Other Person Is Discussing Accountability

**If you’re in an authority position and only talk to the other person when you’re having an accountability conversation, it can be hard to enact effective solutions.** For example, if you’re a manager who only speaks with a certain employee when they make a mistake, you might have difficulty getting that employee to change.

It can be hard to connect with another person in this situation because you might not know them well enough to see their side of things. Additionally, they might not take as well to constructive criticism if this is the only interaction they have with you.

In these circumstances you can do two things:

1) Make time to get to know the person. Schedule check-ins where you can build rapport and hear some of their own concerns

2) Praise the person when they do things well. This will help them see you in a more positive light.

(Shortform note: While building a personal connection with employees makes accountability conversations easier and more effective, psychologists note that this isn’t the only benefit; in fact, you should be forming a rapport with employees regardless of how it impacts accountability. In _Radical Candor, _Kim Scott explains that caring personally about employees and building a culture of sincere and helpful guidance boosts employee satisfaction at work as well as boosts the quality of deliverables in ways you couldn’t imagine.)
