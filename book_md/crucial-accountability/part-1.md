## Part 1: Identifying the Issue and Whether to Discuss It

**The authors argue that the effectiveness of an accountability conversation largely depends on the preparation we do ahead of time.** To prepare for your accountability conversation, you must identify and fully understand the _key issue_ that underpins the problem. Then, you must decide whether or not the issue is worth addressing. In Part 1, we'll explore how the authors recommend you approach each of these steps.

### Identifying the Key Issue

Accountability grievances often come in bundles, so that instead of just one problem, there are a whole host of issues that make up the grievance as a whole**.** However, there is usually one _key issue_ at the root of the grievance—the underlying problem causing all the other issues.

The authors argue that**when you identify and target the key issue, you’ll likely resolve the remaining issues as well**. However, if you fail to identify the key issue, you risk either pursuing the wrong issue or trying to address too many issues at once, neither of which will result in a positive outcome.

  * For example, imagine you’re upset with your spouse because they promised to wash the dishes and take the dogs out before leaving for the day. You could discuss the issue of having no dishes for dinner, or the fact that the dogs wrecked the house, but the _key issue_ to discuss is responsibility: Your spouse needs to complete their commitments before leaving the house. When this key issue is solved, the other issues shouldn’t happen again.



> **Gunnysacking**
> 
> Sometimes, when trying to identify your key issue, you’ll find that you end up with more than one fundamental issue that’s bothering you. This may be because you’re actually dealing with several key issues, which are independent of each other, rather than linked to a single accountability grievance—in other words, a set of longstanding issues that have built up over time because you haven’t addressed or resolved them.
> 
> Harboring small resentments over time and neglecting to address them is called gunnysacking. Gunnysacking is considered by psychologists and communication specialists to be one of the main relationship killers. If we fail to address the issues within our gunny sack, we will eventually experience a “last-straw” situation which will result in an emotional explosion where all the issues will spill out at once. This can greatly damage the relationship.
> 
> So, if addressing the key issue doesn’t resolve the bundle, consider that you might be gunnysacking and may need to hold multiple accountability conversations to completely resolve your bundle.

To effectively examine the problem so that you can boil it down to a concisely stated key issue, the authors recommend asking yourself the following questions:

#### How Many Times Has the Issue Occurred?

**When determining the key issue to center your discussion around, the frequency of the behavior in question can indicate what you should focus on.**

  * If the issue has only occurred **once** , the key issue is probably the _specifics_ of the behavior (the authors call this a “content” issue).
  * If the issue has occurred **more than once** , your key issue could be that the behavior is becoming a _pattern_.
  * **If the behavior persists even after it’s been addressed** , the key issue could be the impact that the behavior has on your _relationship_ with the other person.



> **Do the Authors Make Artificial Distinctions Between Types of Issues?**
> 
> While the authors make a distinction between specifics (“content”) issues, pattern issues, and relationship issues, the three are often interconnected and tend to ultimately boil down to a relationship issue at the core. For example, even if you identify the issue as a pattern problem, your discussion is still going to focus on how the pattern is affecting your _relationship._ Furthermore, specifics issues are also frequently indicative of a relationship issue—while you might not like the _specifics_ of the behavior, the reason you don’t like it is likely because of what it indicates about your _relationship_.
> 
> Experts explain that when you get upset with another person over little things, like when they always leave the cap off the toothpaste (pattern issue) or put an empty container back in the fridge (specifics issue), the small issue itself might not be what’s making you upset. Instead, you’re probably upset about a problem within the relationship that these smaller issues indicate, like partner negligence or their lack of respect for your wishes.

#### What’s Really Bothering Me?

The authors contend that the **_key issue_ is often one of two things: either the _consequences_ of the other person’s behavior or your perception of their _intent_.**

To figure out which it might be, consider that what’s really bothering you is not the person’s actions themselves, but the _consequences_ those actions have on you and others involved.

  * For example, imagine you carpool to work with a friend that consistently runs late, making you late as well. Consequently, you struggle to complete your tasks by the end of the day, hold up the team meeting in the morning, and have lost a promotion due to your tardiness. Your accountability grievance might not be that she’s typically late in her personal life, but rather the _consequences_ that you face under these circumstances.



Alternatively, it may be the other person’s _intent_ that’s bothering you, or at least what you _think_ is their intent.

  * Maybe your issue with your tardy best friend is that you think that she’s abusing your friendship and using you for rides without considering how her tardiness might impact you.



Sorting out which aspect of the behavior is ultimately bothering you will help you figure out how to steer your accountability conversation.

> **Differentiating Between** **Consequences and Intent**
> 
> Experts explain that determining whether the key issue is about consequences or intent can be a confusing and high-stakes decision. Sometimes you might focus on the other person’s intent, when in reality, the other person intended well but didn’t understand the consequences of their actions. For example, maybe they told a joke that they thought was funny but was actually offensive, without intending to offend. In this scenario, you may have misunderstood their intent because your own insecurities or sensitivities led you to take offense to the situation.
> 
> As a result, the other person might be shocked and offended to discover that you assumed the worst of them. So, not only can it be hard to _truly_ identify when the issue is with ill intent, but choosing to bring up this assumption puts the relationship at risk as well. Psychologists recommend asking the following questions to help better differentiate between consequences and intent so we can avoid jeopardizing the relationship with false accusations.
> 
>   * How else can I understand what happened and why?
> 
>   * Might the other person have meant well but been unaware of how this would make me feel?
> 
>   * Do they possibly have a different definition of right and wrong, acceptable and unacceptable?
> 
>   * Might I feel hurt due to my own insecurities and sensitivities, and not because the other person was trying to hurt or disregard me?
> 
> 


#### What’s My Ideal Outcome?

The authors write that you can further narrow down the key issue by considering your ultimate goal: What _do_ you want to happen and what _don’t_ you want to happen?

  * For example, what _do_ and _don’t_ you want to happen with your best friend? You _do_ want to help her get to work. You _don’t_ want to be late. You _do_ want to maintain a positive relationship with her, but you _don’t_ want to feel taken advantage of.



Use your dos and don'ts to determine what’s most important to you and if solving one issue might also resolve the others. In the above example, your dos and don’ts point to the fact that you should probably first address the recurrence of the tardiness issue and discuss the consequences that you’ve been facing as a result. If the issue persists after this discussion, then you can address the negative impacts that it’s starting to have on your relationship.

> **Don’t Let Revenge Be One of Your “Dos”**
> 
> Experts explain that when considering our dos and don'ts, people often prioritize their desire for revenge over their desire to solve the issue. In fact, it’s human nature to do so—behavior specialists explain that when we’re harmed or threatened by others, our primal instinct is to exact revenge, and this clouds our rational judgment on how to handle the issue.
> 
> When we feel the red-hot desire for revenge swell within us, experts explain that we should acknowledge the feeling, and then simply let it go. As the authors explain, the only way to effectively handle an accountability issue is to address it—exacting revenge will give you temporary gratification but will leave the problem unresolved and ultimately damage the relationship.

### Determining Whether or Not the Issue Is Worth Addressing

After identifying the _key issue_ , the authors explain that we must determine whether or not the issue is worth addressing. In some situations, like **when there are clearly broken rules, promises, and commitments, it’s easy to recognize that we need to speak up**. In other situations, like when someone breaks an unspoken rule, it can be difficult to determine the right course of action.

When we find ourselves in one of these situations, we often choose not to speak up because we want to avoid negative backlash. However, the authors explain that **when people choose silence over speaking up, it’s often because they either downplay the costs of silence, exaggerate the risks of speaking up, or consider themselves helpless.**

In the following sections, we will explore how to recognize when you’re making invalid excuses to remain silent, and when it’s actually best not to address the issue.

> **Making Excuses for Silence**
> 
> In addition to the excuses mentioned above, experts explain that people commonly make the following excuses to avoid conflict. If you find yourself thinking any of the following, you should probably start planning your accountability discussion.
> 
>   * I’m not upset about it anymore, so it probably doesn’t matter: Just because the intense emotions have passed doesn’t mean they won’t crop up again next time the infraction occurs.
> 
>   * I have other, more urgent priorities that need my attention: Conflict doesn’t have to be urgent to poison your relationship or its productivity. Letting the issue fester will just make it worse.
> 
>   * It’s not my problem to solve _their_ issues: If the issues occur within your relationship, or within an environment that you’re in charge of (for example if you’re the manager or parent) then it’s _your_ problem too.
> 
>   * I don’t r _eally_ care enough about this relationship to go out of my way to fix it: If you truly don’t care about the relationship, then there are bigger decisions that need to be made. You either need to leave the relationship or permanently leave the environment where the relationship exists (such as your workplace). If you’re not willing to do this, then this isn’t a valid excuse.
> 
> 


#### Downplaying the Costs of Silence

The authors explain that when we choose to remain silent rather than address an issue, it’s often because we downplay the negative consequences of letting the issue stew. But, silence can lead to a number of bad outcomes, the first of which is that **when we stay silent, the original accountability issue will likely persist and possibly get worse**.

Furthermore, when we stifle our emotions through silence, we can unintentionally cause _more_ problems. The authors explain that **when we stifle our emotions, we think we’re suffering in silence, but how we _really_ feel is leaking out through our body language, tone of voice, and passive-aggressive behaviors**. These passive-aggressive behaviors cause new problems because when others pick up on them, they’ll likely become offended or uneasy. Consequently, they’re likely to behave badly toward you in return, which will continue or even exacerbate the original problem.

> **The Four Horsemen of a Relational Apocalypse**
> 
> The authors use original research and insights throughout _Crucial Accountability_ to explain how we can make problems worse by not properly addressing them, but it’s likely that their argument was inspired by John Gottman’s interpersonal communication theory, “The Four Horsemen of a Relational Apocalypse.” Gottman’s theory asserts that there are four primary toxic communication behaviors that lead to relationship termination— _contempt, criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling._ This theory is the foundation of the majority of modern interpersonal communication research on relationship maintenance, which is the basis of _Crucial Accountability._
> 
> The authors’ discussion adds to Gottman’s research by addressing each of the four horsemen in different places throughout _Crucial Accountability—_ either encouraging the reader to avoid the behaviors or explaining how we might unintentionally cause the other person to engage in them.
> 
> In the section above, the authors explain that choosing silence over speaking up can result in passive-aggressive behaviors that leak out unintentionally, such as snarky comments, a rude tone of voice, or rolling your eyes. These behaviors indicate Gottman’s second horseman, contempt _,_ which is a loss of respect for the other person that results from long-simmering, unspoken issues. Gottman makes the same argument as the authors: These contemptuous forms of communication can seriously damage relationships, but they can be avoided by effectively voicing our concerns instead of trying to stifle them.

#### Exaggerating the Risks of Speaking Up

The authors explain that people also may choose to remain silent because they exaggerate the risks of speaking up—that is, they imagine severe negative consequences that are unlikely to actually materialize. For example, people tend to think that if they bring up an issue, the other person will get angry, resent them or look down on them for speaking their minds.

When we focus on these possible negative outcomes, we often remain silent in order to avoid confrontation.

> **How to Avoid Exaggerating the Risks**
> 
> The authors explain that people tend to choose silence because they imagine the worst-case scenario occurring—experts refer to this as catastrophizing. We do this because our brains categorize uncertainty as danger.
> 
> Psychologists recommend avoiding catastrophizing by first focusing on the present moment rather than the past or future, second considering the facts of the situation (like that the other person is rational and supportive), third thinking about the best and worst-case scenarios, and then finally rationalizing that the most likely situation is somewhere in the gray area between the two.
> 
> Once you’ve gone through this rationalization process, create a plan that will help you exact the outcome you desire. In the context of _Crucial Accountability,_ that would be determining the key issue, whether or not to address it, cooling your emotions, and then following the steps later on in this guide that will lay out how to best execute the conversation.

#### Feeling Helpless

The authors explain that a third reason why **people choose silence is that they feel helpless, as if bringing up the problem won’t resolve it.** This can be especially true when the problem involves difficult people or circumstances. If the people or circumstances seemingly make the problem unsolvable, why bother bringing it up?

**People tend to fall into this belief because of failed accountability conversations in the past**. If we’ve had past conversations where the other person was resistant or we failed to achieve the desired change, we’re likely to become discouraged, thinking the same outcome will happen every time.

The reality is that we’re not completely helpless when someone refuses to change. In fact, **the authors contend that _the other person’s_ inflexibility is likely the result of _our_ ineffective communication.** For example, you may have brought up the conversation in a way that made the other person aggressive, or failed to plan the discussion and identify the correct key issue.

Ultimately, the authors argue that we always have the ability to effectively handle accountability issues. With effective communication, we have much more control over the situation and the other person than most people think. Consequently, feeling helpless is never a sufficient reason to put off having an accountability conversation.

(Shortform note: The authors explain that people tend to consider themselves helpless due to past failed accountability conversations—psychologists call this phenomenon learned helplessness. This mindset often arises due to situations from our childhood. For example, if your parents responded aggressively or ignored you every time you expressed a concern or a desire for change, you will likely enter adulthood with the belief that you are incapable of enacting changes or solving problems in your relationships.)

#### When the Issue Isn’t Worth Addressing

The authors assert that **sometimes, what we perceive as serious accountability issues aren’t actually worth bringing up**. Sometimes, what you think is a justified accountability discussion might actually be an unnecessary complaint.

To determine whether or not you’re jumping the gun, consider (1) your _intent_ for the conversation and (2) _the consequences_ the conversation will have on your relationship with the other person.

Your intent should be to maintain a positive and productive relationship with the other person. If your intent for the conversation doesn’t match this definition, or you expect that the consequences of having the discussion won’t achieve this goal, you probably shouldn’t bring up the issue.

  * For example, if you’ve had a problem with someone but you don’t expect to ever work with them again, there’s no benefit to bringing up the issue. In this situation, your _intention_ won’t be to improve the relationship—since the relationship won’t continue anyway—and thus the _consequences_ of the conversation don’t justify having the discussion.



> **How to Let Go When the Issue Isn’t Justified**
> 
> The authors argue that sometimes what we think is an accountability issue isn’t actually justified, and instead, we need to simply expand our comfort zone; however, they don’t offer advice on how exactly to do this. If we’re not justified in bringing the issue up but are still upset by it, we could end up damaging our relationship with the other person by unintentionally acting out our feelings (as we discussed earlier in this section). In _Difficult Conversations_ , Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen explain that when we find ourselves in one of these situations, we can help get over the issue by:
> 
>   * Releasing the negative feelings we have about the situation, the other person, or ourselves.
> 
>   * Telling ourselves a different story to explain what happened. For example, your daughter isn’t irresponsible because she dyed her hair, rather she’s expressive, creative, and proud of her identity.
> 
>   * Accepting who we were when we got upset and who we are now, after the fact. Being upset by the situation may have been a reaction we couldn’t control; however, after reflecting, we’re in a different mindset and can recognize that our previous impulses weren’t justified.
