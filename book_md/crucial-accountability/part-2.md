## Part 2: See the Whole Story

The authors assert that in order to have an effective accountability discussion, **we must first consider the other person’s side of the story. Otherwise, we’re likely to charge into the conversation with unfair assumptions that will cause us to handle the situation poorly.**

When someone fails to meet our expectations, the authors explain that the following process subconsciously unfolds in our heads:

First, we _see and hear_ what the person did. Second, we _tell ourselves a story_ (make assumptions) about why they did it. Third, we _develop a feeling_ based on the story we imagined. And fourth, we _act_ based on that feeling.

  * For example, we _see_ that our roommate didn’t wash their dishes. We _tell ourselves a story_ that they didn’t wash the dishes because they’re lazy. This causes us to see the roommate as a villain and _develop aggressive feelings_ towards them. When they get home from work, we _act_ by accusing them of never helping out.



Unfortunately, **because the stories we tell ourselves are typically negative stories, we tend to then handle the situation poorly by either acting aggressively or avoiding the issue altogether.** Either way, these approaches create more problems and solve nothing.

In this part, we'll learn why we make these assumptions, and what to do instead.

> **Past Experiences and Present Assumptions**
> 
> In _Difficult Conversations, _Stone, Patton, and Heen echo the authors’ idea that we tell ourselves stories and explain that these stories can be impacted by two factors: (1) our past experiences and (2) the rules we learned about how things should or shouldn’t be done. In sum, our past experiences cause us to form our own set of rules regarding what’s right and what’s wrong.
> 
> It’s important to note, however, that these rights and wrongs are subjective. The other person has different past experiences than us, therefore their rights and wrongs are probably a little different than ours. Consequently, they make the same assertion as the authors of _Crucial Accountability_ : we can’t make an accurate judgment of someone’s ethics or character by simply observing their behavior.

### Why Do We Make Negative Assumptions?

The authors explain that the reason why we automatically assume the worst about another person's actions is because of the _fundamental attribution error.****_ The _fundamental attribution error_ states that**when other people make mistakes or act out, we assume that they do so because of their character. Contrastingly, when _we_ make a mistake or act out, we attribute our actions to outside factors.**

In other words, when we make a mistake, we are quick to consider all the factors that led us to that decision; however, when others fail to meet our expectations, we immediately assume the worst of them personally.

  * Let’s go back to the above example with the “lazy” roommate. We assumed that not washing dishes was a manifestation of one of her character traits, laziness. Now imagine that _you_ were the one who didn’t do the dishes. You would likely blame it on the fact that you didn’t get home from work until 10 p.m. and had to be out the door the next morning at 6 a.m., and therefore had no time to wash the dishes. 



**When we enter a conversation seeing the other person negatively, it’s extremely difficult to keep the discussion professional, under control, and heading toward a satisfactory solution.**

(Shortform note: In _A New Earth,_ Ekhart Tolle argues that the fundamental attribution error exists because of our ego. Tolle defines ego as the part of our mind that seeks to inflate our self-image, particularly by deflating the image of others. The ego compels us to view other people’s behavior negatively, which is why we attribute their mistakes to a flaw in character. We do this because seeing the other person as “less than” makes us feel “more than,” and consequently inflates our ego. Tolle asserts that the more we become aware of our ego-driven behaviors, like the fundamental attribution error, the easier it is to avoid them and recognize the egoic behaviors of others.)

### Consider the Other Person’s “Why”

To avoid making the fundamental attribution error, we must try to see all the possible reasons why the other person broke our expectations.**** The authors assert that **there are two primary reasons why people fail to meet expectations: They are either _unmotivated_ or _unable_**.

They further explain that both motivation and ability are influenced by three factors:

  1. _Personal_ : how inherently willing or able we are to complete the task 
  2. _Social_ : the influence of others on our motivation or ability
  3. _Structural_ : the impact of our external environment on motivation or ability



**Thus, to understand all possible reasons _why_ the other person let us down, we must consider the personal, social, and structural factors that could have impacted their motivation and ability.**

(Shortform note: In this section, the authors warn us not to enter a conversation with mistaken assumptions. In _The Four Agreements, _Don Miguel Ruiz similarly cautions against making wrong assumptions and explains how they can lead to a cycle of conflict: Assumptions lead to misunderstandings, which cause us to be offended, at which point we lash back, which creates more negativity and leads the other person to treat us badly again. Thus, when we make negative assumptions, we can both damage our relationship with the other person and leave the original issue unsolved.)

#### How to Consider Motivational Factors

When considering the personal, social, and structural factors that could impact the other person’s motivation, the authors suggest asking the following questions:

**When considering personal motivation, ask:** Is this person intrinsically motivated to complete the task, keep the promise, or uphold the commitment they made to us? Do they enjoy this action, or is this action taxing for them? However, the authors caution that _only_ considering personal factors is the root cause of fundamental attribution error.

(Shortform note: Psychologists explain that intrinsic motivation is motivation that’s driven by internal rewards, like meeting a personal goal. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is driven by the desire for external rewards, like money or gratification, or the fear of consequences.)

**When considering social motivation, ask:** Could the other person’s motivation be influenced by anyone else? Consider the impact of friends, family, customers, bosses, or coworkers. Were they peer pressured to put a task off or asked by someone to put another task first? Finally, consider your role in the social formula—is it possible that the way you made your request to this person came across as rude, and that’s why they did not follow through?

> **Peer Pressure Among Adults**
> 
> While most people think the forces of peer pressure largely disappear once we grow up, psychologists note that this is far from accurate. In fact, our friends and family have a huge impact on the decisions we make. So, how can we free ourselves from the grips of peer pressure?
> 
>   * Reflect on your core values. If your actions or behaviors don’t represent these values, change them.
> 
>   * Be assertive with peers by using “I” phrases such as “I want,” or “I think.”
> 
>   * Develop relationships with a wide demographic of people.
> 
>   * Seek advice from people who affirm your values.
> 
> 


**When considering structural factors, ask:** How might external elements like money, data, work space, equipment, or even temperature be impacting the person's motivation? Are they being underpaid for the job being asked? Is it difficult for them to acquire the time or resources necessary to complete the task? Is there a more financially motivating task that they’re choosing to complete first?

(Shortform note: Experts second the authors’ argument that external factors of the work environment like lighting, temperature, air quality, and noise can impact motivation. They note specifically that open open-plan offices, temperatures above 25℃, and frequent noises like phones, keyboards, and copiers, can dramatically decrease motivation and productivity in employees.)

#### How to Consider Ability Factors

The second part in completing the story is considering whether or not the other person was _able_ to keep their promise or uphold their commitment.

**When considering personal ability, ask:** Did the other person have the mental and physical ability to complete what was necessary? To complete the story, we need to consider that maybe this person _tried_ to live up to their commitment but ran into a barrier.

  * For example, you asked your spouse to create a spreadsheet of their weekly expenses for your family budget but they don’t ever get around to it. Consider that they don’t actually know how to make a spreadsheet. Maybe they tried, but they ultimately needed help to complete the task.



(Shortform note: A common personal ability barrier that often gets overlooked in the workplace is anxiety. Experts note that many people who suffer from anxiety have “high functioning anxiety” which means that their anxiety usually helps them accomplish tasks, but can become detrimental in certain scenarios. For example, someone with high functioning anxiety might get sick but be too afraid to call in, and instead, their work performance will be impacted and no one will understand why. Signs you can look for that may indicate that someone has high functioning anxiety are being a people pleaser, nervous chatter, nervous habits like biting their lip or fingernails, overthinking, getting “lost” in a project and losing track of time, and procrastination after long period of high productivity.)

**When considering social ability, ask:** Who else might be involved in successfully upholding the commitment or completing the task? Is it possible that they’re waiting on someone else to deliver tools, information, or permission before they can complete their commitment to you?

(Shortform note: In an article written for Psychology Today, co-author of _Crucial Accountability_ , Kerry Patterson, explains that social ability barriers are an extremely common occurrence in the workplace, with 93% of employees reporting that they work with people who don’t pull their weight. Surprisingly, only 10% of these employees report having actually held the slacker accountable. So when considering social ability barriers, keep in mind how prevalent this issue is and how few employees actually manage the issue themselves.)

**When considering** **structural factors, ask:** Are the materials easily accessible? Is the environment conducive to completing what’s required? Structural factors can make or break a commitment, sometimes leaving the outcome out of the other person’s hands.

  * For example, if an employee’s desk is in a high-traffic area that prevents them from focusing, they may have trouble meeting deadlines because their work environment is an obstacle.



> **Valid and Invalid Structural Barriers**
> 
> The authors don’t explore where to draw the line between valid structural barriers and barriers that the other person _could’ve_ worked around, but didn’t. What if they didn’t want to complete a task and named a barrier as an excuse? Such a scenario would entirely change the key issue, making it either a motivational barrier or a matter of intent, and would consequently change how you approach the discussion and solution.
> 
> For example, if a person comes up against a barrier that prevents them from doing their job and they don’t inform their supervisor of the problem in a timely manner, the real barrier might be motivational. In that case, we’d have more long-term success addressing their lack of motivation or reluctance to take initiative rather than the ability barrier that prevented them from completing that specific task.
