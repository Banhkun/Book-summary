## Exercise: Become a Clock Builder

Clock building seems like a daunting task, so start small by determining how processes you’re _already_ involved in can continue to work without you.

* * *

List all of your responsibilities in your organization. Of these responsibilities, which ones would create a bottleneck in your organization’s workflow if you were to get promoted or go on leave?

Choose one of these responsibilities. Describe how being absent or otherwise unable to fulfill this responsibility can affect the overall organizational workflow.

What are two or three steps you can take today to ensure that your absence won’t cause a disruption in your organization?
