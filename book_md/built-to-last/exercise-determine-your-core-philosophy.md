## Exercise: Determine Your Core Philosophy

Knowing your core values and your purpose is fundamental to building a visionary company because it gives you a philosophy that will guide all your decisions. If you’re a CEO, you can form your group of five to seven people to articulate your core. If you’re a non-CEO, you can do this for your group, department, or division. If you’re an entrepreneur, you can verbalize it now and use it to guide you as you grow your business.

* * *

List down your core values—what’s most important to you, what brings you fulfillment. You can write as many as you can think of, no need to limit yourself at this point. (For example, reliability, consistency, efficiency, and so on.)

Which of these values would make a solid foundation for an organization, even 100 years into the future? Explain your reasoning.

Which core values should someone have in order to fit in with your organization? Explain your reasoning.

Determine your purpose: Start with a descriptive statement of your business, then ask “Why is this important?” five times. Write out your five responses and the final purpose they reveal.
