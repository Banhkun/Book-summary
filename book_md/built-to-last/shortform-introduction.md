## Shortform Introduction

In _Built to Last_ , bestselling author Jim Collins and Stanford professor Jerry I. Porras embarked on a six-year research project to 1) identify the characteristics that distinguished the _very best_ companies, and 2) use these insights to create a framework for those who want to build visionary companies of their own. To this end, the authors identified and analyzed 18 visionary companies that performed exceptionally well over a long period of time.

The book became an instant classic. However, it’s important to note that it was published in 1994. Since then, some of the visionary companies have faltered.

  * For example, Motorola has seen its market share dwindle with newer or revitalized companies like Samsung and Apple pulling ahead. Ford is once again behind General Motors in terms of market share. Nordstrom has closed many of its stores.



It’s possible that many of the companies were greatly affected by the advent of the internet and other huge shifts in technology over the last 25 years. It’s also possible that the companies have become less successful because they veered away from the concepts presented in this book. We at Shortform won’t discuss whether the changes in the visionary companies’ status undermine the authors’ research findings. We do believe that the authors’ findings are still an insightful look at the keys behind companies’ enduring success, even if it was during a previous era.
