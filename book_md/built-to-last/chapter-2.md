## Chapter 2: A Change in Focus

In this chapter, we’ll examine two myths of visionary companies. First, we’ll discuss and debunk the myth that a company requires one great idea to get started. Then, we’ll look at why visionary companies _don’t_ need a high-profile, charismatic leader to achieve enduring greatness.

### A Big Idea Isn’t Everything

**Business schools espouse that you need a great idea backed by a solid marketing plan before starting a company. But visionary companies show that this simply isn’t true**.

Out of the 18 visionary companies, only three had a specific product or service in mind when they began: Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, and Ford. All the others tried one thing after another, getting both hits and misses and refining their offerings along the way. Many limped and stumbled before finding their footing and eventually becoming a great success.

  * For example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) began in 1937 _without_ a product. Bill Hewlett and David Packard used their engineering backgrounds to create various contraptions, from bowling lanes to telescopes to urinals, many of which didn’t produce great results. They didn’t let their failures dissuade them—kept creating and experimenting until they acquired profitable war contracts in the 1940s. 



#### The Product Isn’t the Point

A great idea shouldn’t be the be-all and end-all of a company, and is actually detrimental in three ways:

  1. If it fails, you might get discouraged and abandon the company altogether.
  2. If it succeeds, you might become too attached to it, ignoring other avenues for growth. 
  3. Any product, no matter how innovative, will eventually become obsolete. If you pin organizational success to that one great idea, then you won’t have what it takes to find lasting success.



**When building a visionary company, the product isn’t the point—the company is.** You can only build an enduring company if you never give up, even if your products keep failing. Instead of focusing all your attention on designing a great product, shift your focus to designing a great organization.

  * For example, General Electric (GE) used Edison’s direct current system, which proved inferior to their competitor Westinghouse’s alternating current system. But one product didn’t dictate GE’s fate. They established the General Electric Research Lab, which created many more products that helped propel GE to greatness. 



### A Superstar CEO Isn’t Everything

Companies don’t become visionary through one product—nor through one charismatic leader. **While a high-profile leader who fits the mold of the superstar CEO isn’t necessary,_good leadership_ is. **After all, it’s highly unlikely for a company to last long with one mediocre head after another.

#### What Makes a Good Visionary Leader?

Though their personalities vary from larger-than-life and charismatic to quiet and unassuming, visionary leaders are driven by a common purpose: **They recognize that their job is to build something that will endure even after they’re gone.** They know that, just as one great idea and one great product can become obsolete, so too can a great leader. Rather than being driven by making one product successful or building their own personal brand, they focus on building an organization that lasts.

  * For example, William McKnight didn’t fit the usual image of a superstar CEO. By all accounts, he was modest, quiet, and thoughtful. He was more interested in leaving behind an enduring company than in being mentioned in history books. He was at the helm of 3M for over five decades as general manager, chief executive, and then chairman. Not a lot of people know his name, but people the world over know 3M, even long after McKnight’s time.



(Shortform note: Read our summary of The 5 Levels of Leadership to learn how to become a strong leader that builds a legacy instead of a brand.)

### A Paradigm Shift: From Time Telling to Clock Building

The fact that visionary companies don’t rely on one great idea or one superstar CEO represents one of their distinguishing characteristics: **Rather than focusing on “time telling,” they focus on “clock building.”**

  * **Time telling:** You**** rely on one person’s unique ability to tell the exact time by looking at the sky. Once that person is gone, everyone else will be lost. Letting one great idea or leader carry a whole company is time telling.
  * **Clock building:** You make a “clock,” or system, that can tell everyone the time, even after you’re gone. Creating an innovative company and strengthening your leadership culture so that the company will continue to thrive is clock building.



For example, Walmart’s Sam Walton had the stereotypical superstar CEO charisma, but also had an essential characteristic of a visionary leader: He was an architect. He empowered people to run their departments, gave incentives to encourage creativity and productivity, and democratized the sharing of ideas. He also groomed his successor to ensure that Walmart stayed true to what it stood for.

Once you shift your focus from time telling to clock building, you’ll be better able to understand the concepts in the succeeding chapters.
