## 1-Page Summary

In _Be Your Future Self Now_ , Benjamin Hardy argues that achieving true success requires living up to your full potential—that is, becoming the highest version of yourself (what Hardy calls your “future self”). Anything short of this is a form of failure. However, becoming the person you want to be is one of life’s most difficult challenges—it requires knowing exactly _who_ your higher self is, identifying the _big, life-changing goals_ that will get you there, and dedicating yourself to those goals _above everything else._

Hardy is an organizational psychologist specializing in entrepreneurial courage, transformational leadership, and exponential growth. While working on his Ph.D., Hardy ran an online training program and was a blogger with a readership of over 100 million. Since his graduation in 2019, Hardy has published multiple books, including _Personality Isn’t Permanent, Willpower Doesn’t Work, _and _Slipstream Time Hacking. _Hardy has also co-written several books with entrepreneurial coach Dan Sullivan, including _The Gap and The Gain, Who Not How, _and _10x Is Easier Than 2x._

In this guide, we’ll present Hardy’s argument for why you should commit to becoming your higher self _now_. Then we’ll discuss how to identify your higher self and Hardy’s recommendations for adopting the mindset and dedication needed to become this person. Throughout the guide, we’ll supplement Hardy’s ideas with those of other success experts including Daniel Walter (_The Power of Discipline), _Gary Keller (_The One Thing), _and Darren Hardy (_The Compound Effect_).

### The Importance of Your Higher Self

Hardy argues that **the true measure of success in life is reaching your full potential** , or in other words, becoming the _highest version of yourself._ To attain this goal, _all_ of your present actions must move you toward becoming your higher self in some way, big or small.

As a result, **it’s crucial to identify your higher self _as soon as possible_** **because your goals and desires for the future drive your present actions**. Furthermore, if you have a clear, ambitious vision of the person you want to become, you’ll take _productive_ actions in the present that will benefit you over time and move you toward becoming that self. By contrast, if you lack a clear, ambitious vision of your higher self, you’ll take _unproductive_ present actions that will harm __ you over time and prevent __ you from becoming your higher self.

> **Self-Discipline: The Crucial Element for Success**
> 
> In _The Power of Discipline, _Daniel Walter reiterates that success is defined by your ability to attain your goals and reach your full potential. And like Hardy, he believes that having clear goals and a detailed vision of your desires is crucial for success—this element of the equation allows you to create a structured plan of action that will guide your daily behavior and help you achieve your full potential. However, Walter argues that there’s a third crucial element in the formula for success that Hardy doesn’t discuss: self-discipline.
> 
> Walter explains that self-discipline is crucial because we tend to opt for instant gratification (unproductive behaviors) over long-term rewards (productive behaviors). This means that even if you have a clear vision of your goals and the actions you must take to achieve them, your brain will still urge you to engage in unproductive behaviors. The only way to fight these urges and take the action necessary to achieve success is to develop strong self-discipline.
> 
> We’ll elaborate on Walter’s argument and how to develop self-discipline in later commentary.

#### When You Lack a Clear Vision, You Become Unproductive

Hardy explains that lacking a clear, ambitious vision of your higher self causes two main types of unproductive behaviors that prevent you from reaching your full potential: engaging in instant gratification and non-crucial activities.

(Shortform note: The urge to engage in unproductive behaviors like instant gratification and non-crucial activities isn’t the only downside of lacking clear goals. Psychologists explain that setting ambiguous goals is linked to depression. People who are depressed are more likely to set ambiguous goals, which makes them more likely to fail and consequently worsens their depression. Essentially, a lack of clear goals can lead to depression and vice versa.)

**_Instant gratification_ is when we choose to do things that are enjoyable in the moment but have _no_ long-term benefit or a _negative_ long-term effect.** For example, playing video games instead of working on becoming a professional graphic designer (your higher self) might be enjoyable now, but will be detrimental in the long term by detracting from the time you should spend on practicing graphic design.

(Shortform note: While Hardy explains that the urge to give into instant gratification is increased when you lack clear goals, experts explain that there’s a deeper, biological reason why we crave instant gratification. Giving in to instant gratification was initially an evolutionary advantage because resources like food were scarce—so, for example, eating as much as we could while food was available gave us the best chance for survival because no one knew when the next meal would be. Consequently, psychologists argue that we’re predisposed to give into instant gratification because of our biological tendency to seek pleasure (instant gratification) and avoid pain (delayed gratification)—this is called instant gratification theory.)

**_Non-crucial activities_ feel rewarding (often temporarily), but don’t move us toward becoming our higher selves.** Hardy says we tend to engage in these behaviors when we either lack a future goal or haven’t fully committed to one yet—they feel good because they give us a sense of accomplishment, but they’re really just taking up time that we should be dedicating toward becoming our higher selves.

For example, instead of focusing on _beneficial activities_ and _big goals_ that will help you become your higher self, like taking a graphic design class and designing logos for local businesses, you might focus on _non-crucial activities and goals,_ like improving your chess skills and painting your house.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Discipline, _Daniel Walter explains that engaging in non-crucial activities is a common form of _procrastination_ , and that one of the most common forms of procrastination (non-crucial activity) that people fall victim to is over-planning _._ This is because planning out a goal makes you _feel_ like you’re making progress, when in reality, your progress doesn’t start until you _execute_ that plan. Further, the longer you plan, the less likely you are to actually start executing. To overcome this procrastination trap, Walter recommends executing your plans when you’re 70% sure you’ll succeed—perfection doesn’t exist, so if you aim for a perfect plan, you’ll never get anywhere.)

As discussed in the previous section, Hardy argues that the best way to avoid unproductive behaviors and ensure that your present actions are benefiting you in the long term is to _clearly identify your higher self_ —your future goals and desires. The following sections will discuss Hardy’s recommendations for how to do this.

### How to Become Your Higher Self

In the following sections, we’ll discuss Hardy’s four main recommendations for becoming the highest version of yourself and how to implement them.

#### Recommendation #1: Clearly Identify Your Higher Self and How to Become Them

Hardy says the first step in shaping your present actions to benefit you long term is to **determine _who_ you want to be. **Imagine the happiest, smartest, most productive and successful version of yourself. Hardy emphasizes that your higher self must be based on what _you_ desire most in life _right now_ —not what society deems “successful” or what you _think_ you should do.

To make your vision even clearer, **identify the _big, life-changing_ _goals_ that your higher self has accomplished**—these are what you must attain.

For example, imagine you’re an unemployed student who gets good grades and designs graphics in your free time. Your higher self is a renowned graphic designer who earned undergrad and graduate degrees, got stellar grades, has an impressive portfolio, has designed graphics for major companies, and has numerous contacts in the industry. These accomplishments are the goals you must achieve to become your higher self.

(Shortform note: While Hardy recommends envisioning your higher self and the goals that will get you there, he doesn’t specify how to do so. However, Russ Harris provides detailed guidelines to help you envision your higher self and your goals in _The Happiness Trap. _Harris contends that you must consider your values and desires in 10 distinct areas of your life: family, romantic relationships, friendships, work and career, education and personal development, spirituality, citizenship and community, environment and nature, health and wellness, and leisure. This will help you identify what’s important to you in each major area of your life so you can create the _clearest_ image of who your higher self is and what their life is like.)

##### Principle #1: Identify Your Five-Year Priorities

Once you’ve identified your higher self and accomplishments, Hardy’s next step is to **identify three goals to prioritize over the next _five years_ that will help you start to become your higher self**. They should be priorities that you can _realistically achieve_ in five years: It might not be possible to entirely embody your higher self in this relatively short time, but you can at least make progress. After the five years are up, you can set new priorities to bring you even closer to becoming your higher self.

For example, you might not be able to become a renowned graphic designer in five years based on your present circumstances, but you can make progress by getting your degrees with stellar grades and building an impressive portfolio. To accomplish this in five years, your top three priorities might be: (1) Complete your undergrad degree, (2) start a graduate program, and (3) begin freelance work designing logos for local businesses.

> **Focus on One Thing at a Time**
> 
> In _The One Thing, _Gary Keller agrees that to achieve your _purpose_ (or higher self) you should identify what needs to be done in the next five years. However, while Hardy recommends identifying _three_ five-year priorities, Keller emphasizes that you should only select one. This is because focusing on one thing at a time and taking actions sequentially to achieve your purpose (rather than working on multiple sub-goals at once, as Hardy recommends) is more effective in maintaining motivation and productivity.
> 
> Further, Keller argues that after identifying your five-year priority, you should identify a one-year goal (whereas Hardy recommends setting _multiple_ one-year goals), a one-month goal, a one-week goal, and a one-day goal. Doing so will help you break down the actions you need to take to ensure you’re making progress every day.

##### Principle #2: Identify Your 12-Month Goals

Next, Hardy notes,**get more specific by setting 12-month goals for each of your three priorities along with clear “success” or “fail” conditions.** This will ensure that you’re meeting the benchmarks necessary to accomplish your three priorities in five years _._

For example, your 12-month goals for your first priority, finishing your undergrad degree, might be to find a professor who can mentor you, make a plan for which courses you need to take, and get a minimum grade of a B in each class. These are clear-cut goals—you can easily identify whether you’ve achieved them, and as a result, how well you’re progressing toward becoming your higher self.

(Shortform note: In _First Things First,_ Stephen Covey recommends taking things a step further by creating weekly goals and plans that will help you work toward your long-term goals (like your 12-month goals). He explains that weekly plans are effective because they’re more actionable than long-term goals—they lay out what needs to be done on a weekly basis so you can plan out your days and ensure you’re making incremental progress. For example, your goal for the week might be to meet with your mentor for one hour to discuss the upcoming exam—this will work toward your 12-month goals of having a professor mentor you and receiving good grades in your classes.)

#### Recommendation #2: Prioritize Your Higher Self Daily

Next, Hardy argues that you should**prioritize the actions that will move you toward becoming your higher self _on a daily basis._** This will ensure that you make consistent progress toward becoming your higher self and don’t get distracted by other _urgent and important tasks_ , _non-crucial activities_ , and _instant gratification._

The following sections will explain how to prioritize your time and quit your unproductive behaviors.

> **Habits to Increase Self-Discipline**
> 
> In _The Power of Discipline_ , Daniel Walter agrees that to succeed, you must incorporate habits and actions into your daily routine that move you toward your goals. However, Walter focuses specifically on developing habits that increase self-discipline so you can resist the urge to engage in unproductive behaviors __(including non-crucial activities, other urgent and important tasks, and instant gratification). Developing the habits Walter suggests alongside Hardy’s recommendations will arguably make it easier to prioritize your higher self because you’ll be able to resist unproductive behaviors. Following are a few habits that Walter says are crucial to developing self-discipline:
> 
> **Create morning and evening routines. **This will help you wake up refreshed and make it easier to resist temptations like sleeping in, eating poorly, or staying up late—behaviors that will impede progress toward your goals.
> 
> **Control your impulses. **When you feel like giving up, push yourself 40% harder. And when you feel like giving in to instant gratification, resist the urge for 10 minutes to overcome it. Developing these habits will help you work more productively.****
> 
> **Create positive associations. **People often want to avoid doing hard work that moves them toward their goals because it's not enjoyable. However, you can counter this urge by incorporating enjoyable aspects into your work routine so it becomes something you like. For example, make yourself a cup of tea before starting work, take a break midway through to have your favorite snack, and reward yourself afterward by making a nice dinner.

##### Principle #1: Disregard Non-Crucial Activities

**The first way to prioritize your higher self is to disregard _non-crucial activities_ that don’t help you become your higher self.** For example, painting your home won’t help you progress toward a higher self who’s a renowned graphic designer and will only detract from the time needed for your 12-month goals.

(Shortform note: In _Someday Is Today, _Matthew Dicks recommends identifying which activities are crucial and non-crucial by considering how important they’d be to you in 100 years—if your 100-year-old (higher) self would want you to do it, then it’s probably important; if it wouldn’t matter to them, then it’s probably not. For example, it probably won’t matter to your 100-year-old self whether you painted your house, so this is a non-crucial activity you can disregard. However, if you plan on painting the house as a _family activity_ , your 100-year-old self would probably encourage you to do it—your family won’t be around forever, so you should take advantage of family time while you have it.)

##### Principle #2: Schedule 12-Month Goals _Before_ Other Urgent and Important Tasks

Next, Hardy recommends**scheduling time each day to work toward your goals**. Although your higher self is your _top_ priority, you’ll likely have other _urgent and important tasks_ to complete each day, such as doing your job. To balance your higher self and your present life effectively, schedule time each day to work toward your 12-month goals _before_ you complete any other urgent and important tasks.

For example, your higher self might be a graphic designer, but your present self still needs to carry out their sales job to make money. So, schedule an hour each morning to work on your graphic design portfolio _before_ work to ensure that you’re progressing toward becoming your higher self every day despite other responsibilities.

(Shortform note: In _The One Thing, _Keller reiterates the importance of scheduling time to work toward your goals on a daily basis, and he agrees that you should get this work done as early in the day as possible—preferably _before_ other urgent and important tasks like your job. Keller adds to Hardy’s advice by recommending that you dedicate at least four hours a day to work on your goals. This will ensure you make significant progress.)

##### Principle #3: Replace Instant Gratification With Beneficial Habits

Finally,**replace** **_bad_ habits that provide instant gratification with good habits that will move you toward your goals. **For example, rather than engaging in _instant gratification_ by playing video games, make it a habit to open your Goodreads app to check out different book cover designs. Swapping this for video games will give you insight into trends around book cover design, which will help you excel in your graphic design career later.

> **Make New Habits Stick**
> 
> While Hardy recommends replacing bad habits with good ones, this can be difficult because habits are so automatic that you might not notice them. In _The Success Principles, _Jack Canfield adds a few recommendations that will make it easier to develop and stick to good habits:
> 
>   * Once you’ve identified your bad habits and the good habits to replace them with (as Hardy recommends), make a plan to implement the good habits. For example, make sure you have everything you need _before_ starting work to avoid your bad habit of leaving your office to retrieve something and getting distracted.
> 
>   * To stay committed to your good habits, write them down on sticky notes and place them around your house as visual reminders.
> 
>   * Hold yourself accountable for practicing good habits by working with a friend. Tell each other your bad habits and how you’re trying to replace them, then share your progress at least once a week.
> 
> 


#### Recommendation #3: Seek Out Beneficial Environments

Next, Hardy recommends putting yourself in environments that will help you become your higher self. This is because **we’re products of our environments** —the situations we put ourselves in and the people we surround ourselves with impact who we are and what we achieve.

As a result, Hardy says you should **step _out of your comfort zone_ and associate with people who are _better than you are_** so you learn to overcome challenges and acquire the skills and habits necessary to progress toward becoming your higher self. The following sections will explain why these two recommendations are important and how to follow them.

(Shortform note: In _The Compound Effect, _Darren Hardy reiterates that we’re products of our environments—the people and situations we surround ourselves with shape how we think, feel, and act. He adds that the content we consume also has a major impact on us, including the news we watch, books and magazines we read, music we listen to, and so on. So in addition to spending time with people who are better than you and pushing yourself outside your comfort zone, ensure that you’re consuming content that’s educational and inspirational rather than negative and unenlightening. For example, watch BBC News rather than E! News.)

##### Principle #1: Step Out of Your Comfort Zone

**Hardy recommends stepping out of your comfort zone by doing things that your higher self would succeed at but your present self might not.** This is crucial because, although you might fail, people make the most progress by learning from their failures. Failure forces you to confront your insufficiencies and identify how you can become stronger in those areas.

For example, imagine that your higher self is a professional graphic designer who designs images for major companies; however, your present self is regularly designing logos only for small, local businesses. Continuing to design logos for these small businesses won’t help you become your higher self because you’re simply practicing something you're already good at—designing the types of logos that small, local businesses like. But applying to design graphics for larger businesses, even though you’re likely to be turned down at first, will teach you what they’re looking for and what you need to improve on.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that stepping outside your comfort zone is crucial for personal growth and success; however, it's difficult to reap the benefits if you’re too intimidated. A few steps can make the process less daunting and more useful. For example, rather than comparing yourself to others, which can make you feel vulnerable, focus on your personal growth. Also, remind yourself that other people are outside of their comfort zone as well—you’re not the only one exposing your weaknesses.)

##### Principle #2: Surround Yourself With People Who Are Better Than You

To surround yourself with people who are better than you, as Hardy recommends, **look for people like your higher self** ; they’ll have achieved goals similar to yours, or at least be __ closer to achieving them than you are. Their habits and behaviors will compel you to emulate them and be more like your higher self.**** Further, they can give you advice and strategies to overcome obstacles you might face because they’ve already overcome similar obstacles _._

(Shortform note: In _The Compound Effect, _Darren Hardy argues that the first step in surrounding yourself with better people is to sort your current associations into three categories. The first is _dissociations—_ people who exhibit the behaviors you’re actively avoiding. Cut ties with them immediately. The next category is _limited associations_ —people who possess some negative traits, but won’t immediately impact your behavior. It’s OK to spend some time with them, but limit your contact. The final category is _expanded associations_ —people whom you aspire to emulate. Go out of your way to spend more time with them.)

#### Recommendation #4: Have an Empowering View of Life and Fate

Finally, Hardy argues that **many people fail to become their higher selves because they have a disempowering view of life and fate.** Specifically, they believe they lack autonomy over who they are and who they can become because of three factors:

  * Their past
  * Their current circumstances
  * An inability to control their fate



(Shortform note: Hardy argues that having a negative view of life and fate will prevent you from achieving success in life. Similarly, Rhonda Byrne argues in _The Secret_ that your mindset _directly impacts_ your reality and what you’re able to accomplish. This is because, according to The Law of Attraction, your thoughts have a certain energy frequency that attracts similar energy frequencies. A negative mindset attracts negativity back to you while a positive mindset attracts positivity. So if you truly believe that you can __ and will accomplish your desires (hallmarks of a positive mindset), the universe will make this your reality.)

Let’s explore the roots of these three disempowering beliefs and the empowering beliefs to adopt instead.

##### Principle #1: Don’t Let Your Past Dictate Your Future

Hardy explains that many people falsely believe their traumas and past shape who they are and what their future holds. For example, if you got poor grades in art class as a child, you may believe that you lack the potential to become a graphic designer. However, Hardy argues that **regardless of what happens in your life, you _always_ have the power to choose what happens next**.

If you look at negative past experiences and _believe_ they’ve limited your future, this will become your reality. However, if you tell yourself that your negative past experiences have helped you grow—for example, by teaching you an important lesson, reminding you what’s important in life, or redirecting you down a better path— _this_ will become your reality. Adopting this perspective will empower you to overcome your doubts and keep striving for your goals.

**So rather than letting your past control you, control your past** by reframing the meaning and impact it has on your present life. Use it to propel you forward rather than hold you back.

> **The Impacts of Trauma on the Mind and Body**
> 
> While Hardy argues that allowing past trauma to control your future is a _choice_ , and one you can take control of by reframing your narrative, some medical experts suggest that things aren’t so clear-cut. Traumatic events affect more than just your mindset—they can permanently alter your body and brain.
> 
> People who suffer from PTSD experience shrinkage of the hippocampus (which decreases emotional control and memory), increased amygdala function (making you more likely to develop anxiety), and decreased prefrontal/anterior cingulate function (like planning and self-development). Further, the emotional and physical reactions to trauma can make you more prone to serious health conditions such as diabetes, heart attack, stroke, cancer, and more.
> 
> In _The Body Keeps the Score, _Bessel van der Kolk elaborates that there are three primary treatment strategies to overcome the effects of trauma. Hardy’s recommendation to reframe the meaning of your trauma and the impact it has on your current life exemplifies one of the treatment strategies van der Kolk details: a top-down trauma treatment called autobiographical self-awareness.
> 
> However, van der Kolk warns that for this strategy to be effective, you must _also_ practice _moment-to-moment self-awareness_ —confronting the deep and often painful physical sensations (like bodily tension, fear, or anxiety) that your trauma causes. Reframing your narrative without _also_ engaging in moment-to-moment self-awareness may cause you to suppress the negative effects of your trauma rather than confront and overcome them, worsening the impacts of trauma in the long run.

##### Principle #2: Take Ownership of Your Circumstances and Ability to Change

While some people fixate on their past, others believe that their present circumstances are beyond their control and are limiting their ability to change. For example, if you don’t currently have the skills to be a professional graphic designer, you may feel like you’ll never be able to do so.

However, Hardy argues that, as with your past experiences, **it’s your responsibility to determine how your current circumstances impact you and to acknowledge your potential and opportunities for growth despite them.** To do so, find at least one way in which any given event can benefit you. For example, being turned down for a graphic design gig is a perfect way for you to identify which skills you need to improve on to become a better graphic designer. Further, if you don't like your present circumstances, identify actions you can take to change them.

(Shortform note: Hardy’s recommendation to interpret every event, good or bad, as an opportunity for growth is a core component of ancient Stoic philosophy. Experts recommend nine exercises based on Stoicism that can increase your ability to glean positives from seemingly negative situations and determine how to take action to alter your circumstances. For example, practice _the dichotomy of control_ —differentiating between what you _can_ change and what you _can’t._ This will help you take control of your situation to change it for the better _when it's possible,_ and prevent you from dwelling on negative situations when there’s nothing you can do to change them.)

**Hardy contends that adopting a _growth mindset_ is crucial for taking ownership of your circumstances and ability to change. **A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve your present state through hard work and determination. Hardy recommends adopting this mindset by identifying the differences between your past and present self and the anticipated differences between your present and higher self. This will help you recognize that, as your past self has learned and grown into your more knowledgeable present self, your present self can similarly learn and grow into your higher self.

> **Develop a Growth Mindset**
> 
> Carol S. Dweck developed and popularized the concept of a growth mindset in her book _Mindset_. Her recommendations for how to develop a growth mindset are more detailed and may be more effective than Hardy’s because they focus on overcoming your _fixed_ (negative) mindset first. A fixed mindset is the belief that your abilities are unchangeable, and it causes people to avoid challenges, get defensive, give up, see effort as pointless, reject feedback, and more. Without first overcoming your fixed mindset, Dweck says that you’ll struggle to develop a growth mindset. She recommends accomplishing both feats by doing the following:
> 
>   * Accept that you have a fixed mindset so you can realize that your negative beliefs aren’t reflective of your true ability to change.
> 
>   * Learn what triggers your fixed beliefs. For example, maybe your fixed mindset becomes active in situations where someone outperforms you. Understanding your triggers can help you resist your fixed beliefs.
> 
>   * Name your fixed mindset persona to differentiate it from you. This way, when fixed beliefs try to take control of your mind, you can remind yourself that these thoughts don’t reflect reality and that this isn’t who you want to be.
> 
>   * Talk down your fixed mindset persona. When your fixed beliefs arise, talk to the persona you developed in the previous step and explain why their beliefs aren’t rational. This will help you overcome your negative responses and adopt a more positive outlook.
> 
> 


##### Principle #3: Believe That You’re the Creator of Your Own Fate

Many people believe a higher power controls our fate; therefore, no matter what we do, our outcome will always be the same. Others believe that a higher power created us and that we’re inferior beings with no true purpose. Hardy explains that both of these perspectives take autonomy away from us and prevent us from reaching our full potential.

Instead,**Hardy suggests we think of ourselves as children of a higher power—we’re just a less advanced version of our creator**. As such, our purpose as humans is to learn and grow over time and across generations until we reach the level of this higher power. Hardy asserts that our purpose under this framework is to achieve fulfillment—to do what we most desire and become the highest version of ourselves. With this belief, we can feel empowered to take control of our lives and choose our fate.

> **Create Your Own God Concept**
> 
> In _Seeking Wisdom, _Julia Cameron agrees that many people have a disempowering view of God or a higher power and that this reduces their ability to reach their full potential. However, rather than recommending that people take on a specific belief, as Hardy does, Cameron says that the most effective higher power to believe in is one that’s created by you, for you. Cameron calls this your “God concept.”
> 
> To create your God concept, Cameron recommends first envisioning what your ideal God looks like—for example, maybe it’s the face of your great-grandmother, or maybe it’s an amorphous blob. Choose an image of God that seems the most empowering and supportive to you.
> 
> Next, brainstorm the characteristics a caring, supportive, and benevolent God would have. For example, maybe this God loves to dance to disco music, has endless love and understanding, and is always listening.
> 
> Finally, envision your God as your best friend—someone who’s always there to listen to you, encourage you, and provide you with help and support when you need it.

Finally, Hardy says to **adopt a firm belief that you _will_ become your higher self—that this is your fate—and express gratitude for being this person**. When you _know_ that becoming your higher self is a __ definite outcome __(your fate)_,_ your actions will match that perceived reality—you’ll be more confident and more likely to do what’s necessary to achieve your goals without fear of failure. Further, expressing gratitude for things you don’t yet have as if you _already have them_ reinforces your belief in yourself.

(Shortform note: In _The Secret, _Rhonda Byrne agrees that expressing positive belief and gratitude are two of the best actions you can take to achieve your goals. This is because, in addition to altering your actions, expressing positive belief and gratitude also attracts positivity through The Law of Attraction. Byrne also adds to Hardy’s argument, explaining that avoiding negative feelings like ingratitude, lack, envy, resentment, and so on is just as important. If you express negative emotions alongside positive belief and gratitude, they’ll overpower your positive expression and attract negativity into your life.)
