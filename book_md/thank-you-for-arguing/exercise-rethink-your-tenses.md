## Exercise: Rethink Your Tenses

Ensuring that you’re using the right tense in an argument can help the argument move in a productive direction rather than devolving into a fight.

* * *

Describe a recent argument you had with someone, such as a partner, family member, or colleague.

Describe how either party used the _past_ tense to create _blame_ in the argument. (For example, “You didn’t wash the dishes, so I had to do it.” )

Describe how either party used the _present tense_ to attack _values_ in the argument. (For example, “You’re always nagging me about the dishes, but you never walk the dog when it’s your turn.”)

How could this argument have been more productive if either party had concentrated on using the _future tense_ to create _choices_? (For example, “Going forward, will you please put your dishes directly into the dishwasher? That way, I won’t have to clean them up.”)
