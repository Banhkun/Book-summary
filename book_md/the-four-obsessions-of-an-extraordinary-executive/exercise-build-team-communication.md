## Exercise: Build Team Communication

Build stronger relationships with the other members of your team.

* * *

Open debate is a necessary part of productive meetings. Think back to your teamâ€™s most recent meeting. Did you disagree with your team members on any key points? How did you handle it?

Think back to the last time you failed to speak your mind about something important. Consider how this failure could affect your organization. When is your next chance to share your thoughts with the rest of the team, and what specifically would you like to say to them?

Consider how the other members of your team handle conflict. Some of them are probably stronger communicators than others. What steps can you take to encourage even the more soft-spoken members of your team to speak up?
