## Exercise: Adopt a Positive Money Mindset

Work on adopting a positive money mindset that empowers you to make changes and take action to earn more money.

* * *

First, reflect on your current money mindset. What’s one limiting belief you have about money? How does that thought make you feel? For example, you might think that making money takes time away from more important things in life, which makes you feel unmotivated to earn more.

What’s a more empowering thought about money you can have instead? For example, you might tell yourself that making money actually _allows_ you to enjoy the things that you value because you have more resources at your disposal.

Once you've transformed your negative belief, improve your financial confidence by assuming responsibility for your money. What's one thing you can do to proactively take more responsibility for your finances? For example, you might make a habit of checking your bank accounts every morning.

Strengthen your new money mindset by upgrading your lifestyle. Describe your ideal, wealthy self. What is one behavior you can adopt to start acting like your ideal self?
