## 1-Page Summary

Think about all the images, messages, and stories you’re confronted with throughout the day. Open the newspaper in the morning, and you’ll see photos of wars, profiles of political candidates and entrepreneurs, and reports on the latest stock prices. Scroll through social media, and you’ll encounter a barrage of photos, videos, ads, and memes, all communicating some message. Go to the store, and products will catch your attention—consciously and subconsciously—with designs and slogans.

According to Roland Barthes, an influential 20th-century French philosopher and literary critic, these objects and images that we consume throughout the day are filled with _myth_. He says on a broad level, myth is a mode of communication—a myth conveys a message.**Myths occur when society’s dominant institutions (for example, the government, the advertising industry, or Hollywood) imbue an image, object, or phrase with meaning.** These meanings then serve to shape the way people in society view the world. By creating these associations, **these dominant social institutions essentially create and reinforce cultural beliefs and values that are adopted unconsciously by the masses.**

In _Mythologies_ (originally published in 1957), Barthes analyzes a number of such myths from France in the 1950s. Part 1 of the book is a series of essays from a monthly column he wrote for the literary magazine _Lettres Nouvelles_ between 1954 and 1956. Each essay discusses a myth from French society, exploring the nuance behind it and explaining how it conveys certain values. In Part 2, Barthes provides a more theoretical discussion of myth.

In this guide, we’ll discuss Barthes’s theoretical framework behind myth, examine some of the examples he gives from 1950s French culture, and consider whether they’re still present in contemporary culture today.

(Shortform note: The content of this book draws heavily from the social and political context of the time and place in which it was written, as well as being a product of Barthes’s political leanings. France in the 1950s had recently emerged from World War II and was in a time of rapid social change. The middle class was rising and conservative political forces were promoting an anti-intellectual, populist, and anti-immigrant agenda in order to hold on to what they promoted as “traditional” values. Barthes was a progressive and a Marxist and was invested in calling out the propaganda he saw around him, to raise awareness.)

### Part 1: Understanding Myth

Before discussing where myth appears in society, let’s first define myth as Barthes presents it. Barthes explains that a myth is a message that’s conveyed when an object, image, or phrase becomes associated with a concept or value, and thus takes on a symbolic meaning. For example, a national flag may be associated with the concept of freedom, conveying a message about that nation to its citizens. **Myths shape the way we view the world and hold power over us when society’s dominant institutions—for example, the government, the advertising industry, or Hollywood—craft these messages for us.**

In this first section, we’ll discuss the process of mythmaking. First, we’ll look at the basic components of myth to better understand what it is and how we interact with it. Then, we’ll discuss how myths come into being. Finally, we’ll explain why Barthes believes that myths can pose dangers to society.

> **The Use of Imagery to Reinforce Power Structures**
> 
> In his 1972 book, _Ways of Seeing_ , art critic John Berger discusses the ways that art can be used to influence public perceptions and understandings of the world. He refers to this manipulation of the public by the powerful as _mystification_ , a term drawn from Marxist rhetoric. In Marx’s view, the ruling class intentionally _mystified_ the concept of capitalism by creating mythologies around the merit of hard work and free enterprise, and obscuring the realities of the vast economic and power inequities it created.
> 
> Similarly, Berger says throughout Western history, art has been associated with the wealthy elite, who have used it to promote specific perspectives and obscure others, in order to reinforce class distinctions. Berger includes discussion of the use of advertising imagery in service of capitalism, which we will see is a focus of Barthes’s as well.

#### The Components of Myth: Form and Concept

Barthes argues that **myths have two basic, interrelated components: a _form_ and a _concept_.** The _form_ of a myth is concrete: It is the actual object, image, or phrase that we perceive with our senses. Anything can become the _form_ , or raw material, of a myth—it could be a song, a photo, or an everyday object such as a car or an article of clothing.

Barthes explains that on their own, these materials have a literal meaning. When we see a car, we recognize it as a vehicle of transportation. When we listen to a song, we understand its words. However, **the power of myth is that it imbues these things with _additional_ meaning**. Myth occurs when society connects the raw material of _form_ to an abstract _concept_.

As an example, consider a fictional political candidate. At rallies, she always plays a specific song as she walks onto the stage to get the crowd excited. Over time, voters begin to associate the song with the candidate: her supporters play it at marches and her opponents stop listening to it. The song comes to represent the candidate’s particular brand of politics (for example, nationalism). When the candidate pairs the song with these abstract concepts, the song becomes the material for a myth. It is no longer just a song, but also a political message.

Barthes suggests also that myth doesn’t just _add_ new meaning to the raw material—it also _distorts_ the original meaning. In our example of the political candidate, the song itself has a set of meanings, including the meaning of the words and the melody, the history of the artist, and the historical context. These original meanings help create the myth. For example, perhaps the song already had nationalist undertones, making it an ideal choice for this candidate’s campaign.

However, once the candidate co-opts the song for her campaign, the purpose of the song changes. Its primary function is no longer to be a complex piece of music with its own words, melodies, and historical context. Rather, the song becomes a _tool_ for the candidate to convey a particular political message. In this way, while the original meanings do not disappear entirely, they recede into the secondary role of supporting the myth.

According to Barthes, this receding of the form’s meaning is important because it allows myth to appear as perfectly natural. In other words, it hides the fact that the relationship between the form and the concept is a construction. In the following section, we’ll discuss how this works.

> **The Form, Concept, and Myth of Nude Paintings**
> 
> In Berger’s _Ways of Seeing, _nude portraits of European culture serve as a historical example of this dynamic between form and concept. In this case, oil paintings of nude women were used as status symbols by wealthy men. The **form** is the painting—an image of a nude woman. The **concept** is the objectification and ownership of the woman’s body by the man. By capturing the woman in the painting, she becomes an “object” meant to serve the man’s desires. And the myth created by this form and concept is the reinforcement of the man’s social status—it serves as a reminder to the man and others that he is wealthy and powerful enough to have this woman on display for his (and others’) objectifying gaze.

#### The Creation and Function of Myth

Now that we understand what Barthes means by myth, we’ll turn to a discussion of how myths are created and utilized in society. It’s important to recognize this because **myths are being employed every day to influence our thoughts and perceptions of the world.**

According to Barthes, myth is essentially a means of culture creation. But more specifically, he argues that it’s the creation of an “ideal culture” that obscures reality and diversity. And particularly in the examples he analyzes, from 1950s France, he says myth is created _by_ the “bourgeois” (upper-middle class) _for_ the “petit bourgeois” (lower-middle class) and “proletariat” (working class). So, although Barthes doesn’t use the word, **he’s essentially arguing that** **myth is propaganda.**

He suggests that institutions in society (for example, the government, the fashion and advertising industries, and the media) create associations between certain signs and concepts, and the general population internalizes these associations and comes to see them as natural. For example, a Jeep is associated with outdoor adventure—this association is conveyed in all Jeep advertisements, and therefore a Jeep will appeal to people who think of themselves as outdoor adventure types.

Barthes specifically aims to critique the class constructs that underlie the myth in his own culture (1950s France). He says **myth is like a mask that presents a falsehood and shields people from harsh realities, which serves to sustain the social order and reinforce class distinctions.** As examples of this, he points to examples of the way children’s toys are geared toward conformity to a world of work and social expectation, rather than toward creativity. He describes such toys as hammers and trucks for boys and dolls and tea sets for girls, to show that children are socialized into the roles they’ll be expected to play in society. He says that very few toys actually encourage free thought and creative expression.

(Shortform note: This is the reasoning behind the toys created for Waldorf schools—an alternative educational institution founded in Germany and now established throughout the world. Waldorf schools use simple toys that encourage the use of imagination, including faceless dolls. Excluding facial features from dolls serves the purpose of allowing the children to use their imaginations, and removes as much social “myth” as possible.)

> **What Is Propaganda and How Can You Recognize It?**
> 
> Propaganda is defined as “ideas, facts, or allegations spread deliberately to further one's cause or to damage an opposing cause.” Myth as propaganda, as Barthes describes it, may be an even more insidious and ubiquitous fact of life today, with the use of the internet to spread (mis)information. Both social media and news outlets are used to spread political propaganda, swaying public opinion and creating greater political division. This reinforces social inequalities by pitting groups of people _within the same socioeconomic classes_ against one another. When working and middle class people are focused on blaming other working and middle class people for their problems, they fail to unite to challenge the power structures dominated by the wealthy elite.
> 
> To avoid falling prey to this, it’s important to think critically about the information you encounter online and from media outlets, and to learn to spot propagandist narratives when you encounter them. According to the Civil Liberties Union for Europe, you can recognize propaganda by some of these tell-tale features:
> 
>   * **It’s fear-based, creating an “us vs. them” narrative.** Discourse that involves demonizing a group of people, such as immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, a religious group, or an activist group, for example, may have propagandist motives. Be wary of any discourse that characterizes a whole category of people as “bad” or “the enemy.”
> 
>   * **It’s sensationalist.** This may involve promoting an exaggerated narrative of a “threat” from some “outsider” group. For example, the idea that there’s a “war on Christmas” is sensationalized discourse in reaction to an attempt to be more inclusive with holiday greetings. Use of the term “war” implies violence and greatly exaggerates the threat.
> 
>   * **It appeals to popularity.** This kind of narrative is called the “bandwagon technique,” because it’s an attempt to get people to jump on the “bandwagon,” meaning it promotes the idea that a cause, ideology, or candidate is so popular, you’ll be left out if you don’t support it. It convinces you that “everyone is doing it” so if you don’t get on board, you’re weird or different.
>

#### The Dangers of Myth

Barthes suggests that a defining characteristic of myth is its ability to appear as “natural,” even though it is constructed. This means that people don’t question the myth and instead accept it as fact. **When society’s dominant institutions utilize mythology to influence the population’s thoughts, this can serve to perpetuate and reinforce social inequalities. In this way, by not questioning the mythology around us, we participate in our own subjugation**.

(Shortform note: For example, sociologists and psychologists analyze the ways that women participate in their own oppression by supporting the norms and values associated with patriarchy. This often comes in the form of “benevolent sexism”—that is, the belief that women need to be protected and cared for by men. By adopting this belief, women relegate _themselves_ to a lower-status position in the social hierarchy.)

Barthes argues that **myth is both necessary and problematic**. It’s necessary to some degree, he says, because it creates a simplified and comfortable world for people in the face of harsh realities. For example, he discusses magazine advertisements for cleaning products as promoting an idea of cleanliness and purity that’s comforting and aspirational to people, while disguising the dirt and drudgery of domestic life. These ads typically depict a happy homemaker in a spotless, beautiful home—the reality women aspire to—while never revealing the hard work and sacrifice of caring for a home and children—the reality women actually live.

This example may seem relatively harmless, but Barthes points out that when myth disguises the “dirt” of more serious issues like racism, sexism, or fascism, then we enter into dangerous territory, where people can come to accept these as natural and normal, and not challenge them.

According to Barthes, myths are everywhere in our society, and most people go through their days without recognizing them for what they are. Myth always has a motivation, however, and Barthes says it’s the perfect vehicle for promoting political agendas. **This has the dangerous implication that people can be manipulated into supporting social and political agendas that go against their own interests or values and uphold oppressive social structures.**

> **The Mythology of the MAGA Hat**
> 
> An example of mythmaking from recent US politics is Donald Trump’s use of the red baseball cap, which includes his campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.” This is arguably one of the most iconic and powerful symbols in American political history. There are multiple layers of myth here. The slogan itself is an example of a myth designed to appeal to a nostalgia-based conservative political agenda. This myth is layered with the recognizable object, the baseball cap, an item most strongly associated with the American rural working class—a demographic that Trump courted aggressively. Since Trump’s presidency, the red baseball cap in America has taken on a whole new meaning, symbolizing not only support for Trump, but many other assumptions about the wearer’s political beliefs and identity.

### Part 2: The Myths That Create Social Reality

Now that we understand what myths are and how they’re created, we’ll look at concrete examples of how myths are used to reinforce cultural norms and values. Since _Mythologies_ includes 53 essays describing examples of myths Barthes collected from French magazines, we’ve identified the most common _themes_ among them—namely, class, race, gender, and beauty constructs—and picked out one of Barthes’s examples to illustrate each theme. We’ll then illustrate the same concepts with contemporary examples.

#### Class Constructs: “The Blue Blood Cruise”

In his essay “The Blue Blood Cruise,” __ Barthes examines myths that perpetuate class distinctions. He describes a news segment about members of European royalty taking a yacht cruise of the Greek islands in 1954. As part of the media covering this event, Barthes says a King was pictured wearing a short-sleeved shirt, and a Queen was wearing a print dress, both of which would be unacceptable and unimaginable in any other context. The reports made mention of such details as the participants waking at 6 a.m., and the men shaving themselves, as if these daily minutiae were worthy of public press.

Barthes says the myth here lies in the presentation of royalty pretending to be regular people. But the deeper message conveyed by this spectacle is that they’re by definition _not_ regular people. Otherwise why would short sleeves and shaving be newsworthy? So, Barthes says, this kind of myth creates and reinforces notions of class distinction, and in fact deifies the nobility, presenting them as more than human. He compares the scene with the Biblical story of Noah’s ark, pointing out that these kings and queens might be likened to animals that have been hand-selected by God. So, Barthes concludes,**this form of myth serves to uphold the idea of monarchy as divinely decreed, and to remind the reader that these distinctions are natural and necessary.**

> **Class Mythology in Spaces of Entertainment**
> 
> In Barthes's example here, we see class distinction mythologized by contrasting the upper-class expectations with lower-class behaviors and items. The wealthy elite are only further enshrined in their superior status by their adoption of elements and behaviors associated with the “inferior” classes.
> 
> We can see the same myth in contemporary American culture, in the form of spaces designed for upper-middle class citizens to have an entertaining taste of working-class life for a short period of time. For example, The Trailer Park Lounge & Grill in New York City, which describes itself as a “good-natured parody with questionable taste,” allows affluent residents of Manhattan to have the experience of a working-class atmosphere. Customers are surrounded by a carefully-curated collection of items associated with poor, rural life, such as neon signs, “kitschy” plastic decor, and bowling-alley imagery. Meanwhile, the menu includes $17 hamburgers and $60 margarita pitchers, indicating that the target clientele is clearly not poor rural folk.
> 
> Such spaces convey a subtle sense of mockery of working-class culture, and by diverting themselves in such a space, the privileged classes simultaneously participate in this mockery and remind themselves that they are distinctly _not_ members of this culture.

#### Gender Constructs: "Novels and Children"

In his essay “Novels and Children,” Barthes explores gender inequality myths as he describes a segment from _Elle_ magazine about women writers. In this article, a number of female writers are featured, and for each of them, the magazine reports how many novels she’s written, along with how many children she has. He points out that the article spends as much time discussing the women’s roles as wives and mothers as it does discussing their careers.

This myth is layered with meanings, as myths tend to be, Barthes says—there is the surface-level meaning which is about celebrating women’s achievements and purportedly showcasing women’s equality. And then there’s the deeper meaning, which according to Barthes, is that a woman is never complete without children. He says that this article conveys the message that women are allowed to indulge themselves with careers only if they’ve also done their primary duty and had children. He says women are essentially told to "compensate for your novels by your children."

Barthes also points out here that the intended audience for this myth is not just women but men as well. It reinforces to men that even if their wives have careers, these should be balanced out by also having children. Which, in essence, Barthes argues, really conveys a message of _inequality_. **This myth serves to reinforce and uphold a patriarchal structure in society, and this is done most effectively when men _and women_ buy into it. **

> **The Myth of Women as Objects**
> 
> Gender-reinforcing mythology continues to surround us on a daily basis. Filmmaker and activist Jean Kilbourne’s decades-long project examining harmful gender stereotypes in advertising has resulted in four documentary films on the topic. _Killing Us Softly 4_ , the most recent version, highlights the ways that ads objectify women’s bodies, encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and promoting violence against women.
> 
> For example, Kilbourne shows a collection of television and print advertisements that combine women’s bodies with physical objects (a beer bottle for example), show only disembodied portions of women’s bodies, and depict scenarios in which women are in compromising or threatening-looking positions (see some examples here).
> 
> Like Barthes’s example, **these kinds of ads promote a cultural myth that relegates women to a social position in which their major role is in service to men.** Kilbourne argues that many of these ads even subtly suggest that women are less than human, which can lead to a culture where violence against them can be justified.

#### Racial Constructs: "Bichon Among the Blacks"

As an example of a myth constructing racial ideologies, we’ll look at Barthes’s essay “Bichon Among the Blacks.” In this essay, Barthes describes a story from a French magazine called _Match_ about a young white couple who visited Africa with their toddler son, Bichon, to pursue artistic inspiration. The featured photo of the article shows the blonde toddler with three dark-skinned African tribespeople. The article, he says, places a heavy emphasis on the “courage” of the family.

To begin with, Barthes notes that if there were any real danger to Bichon, the parents most certainly wouldn’t have placed their child in this position. So, the implication that this took courage is disingenuous at best. The myth presented here is a narrative about race, with the white couple being presented as heroic in their willingness to be among the “savage” Africans. So, he says, what on the surface tells the heartwarming story of racial groups mingling peacefully conceals the deeper message of racial difference, promoting an insidious myth of white supremacy.

This is an example of why myth can be so dangerous. **With this kind of mythology, the dominant culture promotes a narrative that keeps them dominant by obscuring the problematic power dynamics at play.** Barthes contends that the uneducated reader of an article like “Bichon Among the Blacks” __ wouldn’t have the ability to consciously detect the meaning—a subtle message of white supremacy—but that it would influence their perception of the world nonetheless.

> **White Saviorism as a Racist Myth**
> 
> The example Barthes describes here relies on a narrative of white people as “heroic” actors because of their friendliness toward African tribespeople. If we look beneath the surface, we’ll see that only an implication of inferiority and superiority would make such an association even noteworthy, let alone admirable. This is similar to the common “white savior” narrative that appears frequently in Hollywood movies.
> 
> **Thewhite savior complex refers to a narrative in which a white person (or white people as a group) must “rescue” people of color from their own situations**. This narrative rests on the assumption that the white savior knows best what the non-white people need. In films, it usually manifests in white actors being more active and complex characters while actors of color play more passive, supporting roles—even when people of color are a central focus of the story.
> 
> The _Avatar_ films, for example, have been accused of employing this plot device, since the Na’vi symbolically represent the minority-oppressed culture that must be saved by the heroic protagonist—a white man. Some other well-known examples include _The Help_ and _The Blind Side._ On the surface, like Barthes’s example of “Bichon,” these stories appear to be feel-good narratives that portray positive relationships between characters of different racial backgrounds. But lurking beneath the surface is a damaging message—a cultural myth that reinforces notions of racial inequality by presenting people of color as shallow, lacking agency, and as tangential even to their own stories.****

#### Beauty Constructs: "Garbo's Face"

Next, we’ll look at an analysis of a myth that reinforces idealized beauty standards. Here Barthes analyzes the depiction of actress Greta Garbo’s face in film and photos. He points to lighting, makeup, and editing techniques meant to make her face appear perfect, without ever revealing a blemish or wrinkle. He says her face represents a cultural ideal of beauty, purity, and youth that is both unattainable and unforgettable.

Barthes calls Garbo’s face “an idea” in that it conveys a message about what he calls “amour courtois”—the concept of a noble and chivalrous kind of love. The population is meant to perceive her as something of a divine being, having a kind of beauty they should aspire to, yet can never attain. He points out that this is true of other celebrities as well, and that women so fervently idolized the legendary film star Rudolph Valentino that some were driven to suicide after his death in 1926.

Again, we can see here the notion that the **myth is both appealing and dangerous in the way it conceals the ugly truth of reality.** In this case, the film industry benefits from creating mythological imagery surrounding their stars and films that draws people into a dreamlike escape from reality. The public becomes intoxicated with the imagery and is drawn to the entertainment produced by the industry. Additionally, constructs of ideal beauty are the foundation of the beauty and cosmetic industry. Promotion of an unattainable ideal is the perfect setup for drawing people into buying cosmetic products and procedures.

> **Self-Image and the Myth of Ideal Beauty**
> 
> With the development of more sophisticated photo editing technology and the pervasiveness of social media in our lives, **the myth of ideal beauty is amplified in modern society.** Like Barthes’s example of Greta Garbo, retouched images portray a standard that’s unattainable, and yet we compare ourselves to those unrealistic ideals. The perfect face is flawless and ageless, which also conveys a cultural myth about the idolization of youth.
> 
> Not only do we compare ourselves with an ideal of beauty seen in celebrities, as people did during Barthes’s time, but we now compare ourselves to the photo-edited version of ourselves. Psychological research has shown that this can negatively impact our self-image and self-esteem. A 2018 study showed that when women had to post an unedited “selfie” to social media, they experienced increased anxiety, decreased mood, and lower confidence.
> 
> But, just like in Barthes’s day, the beauty industry profits from our low self-esteem. Demand for cosmetic procedures is at an all-time high—this particular myth is so pervasive in our lives now that over $16 billion was spent on cosmetic surgery in the US in 2020.

#### Political Constructs: "Billy Graham at the Vel' d'Hiv'"

Finally, we’ll look at the way myth can reinforce political agendas through Barthes’s critique of Billy Graham at the Vel’ d’Hiv. Barthes describes a televised event in which the American Evangelist Billy Graham delivered sermons at the Vel’ d’Hiv stadium in Paris in 1955. He analyzes the way Graham’s performance, as myth, contained theatrical elements and concealed political messages.

Barthes views Graham as another version of a hypnotist or seance performer, and suggests that the crowd is mesmerized by what is essentially a calculated formula for cult-like indoctrination. He says Graham is viewed as a prophetic figure even though he says little to nothing with any intelligence or depth to it. Barthes goes as far as to argue that “if God is really speaking through Dr. Graham’s mouth, it must be acknowledged that God is quite stupid.” It is, according to Barthes, the _performance_ which sways people, not Graham’s message. But the subtle message is there, and Barthes says that the message is anti-communist propaganda.

On this issue, Barthes’s analysis is ruthless in his criticism of Graham, as well as of those who fall prey to such myths. He explains that Graham’s visit to France was clearly motivated by the American fear of atheism and the simplistic association of atheism with communism. He accuses the working-class consumer of this myth of being “mentally fragile” and argues that this intellectual weakness is specifically the reason charlatans like Graham target this audience. Creation of an oversimplified association of atheism with communism is exactly what this myth is designed to do.

This example most clearly illustrates why Barthes is so strongly motivated to bring awareness to the way myth is used to manipulate people. He says**this kind of myth can cause masses of people to think illogically and fall prey to dangerous suggestions, and this can potentially have disastrous sociopolitical consequences.** Of course, those consequences that Barthes would consider disastrous are exactly what’s _intended_ by the myth creators—the powerful political elite—since this kind of myth, again, is designed to keep power structures intact. Powerful religious and political forces align here to persuade the masses to fall in line and not question their authority.

> **The Myth of the Prosperity Gospel**
> 
> Following in Billy Graham’s footsteps, televangelists in the 1980s, like Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker, began promoting an ideology now known as the “prosperity gospel.” This manifests most clearly today in “mega-church” pastors like Joel Osteen, who, like Graham, tend to be theatrical and charismatic performers.
> 
> The message at the heart of this gospel is that God rewards his devout followers for their faith with material prosperity. Some conclusions that follow from this include:
> 
>   * Prayer and faith are tools for obtaining wealth.
> 
>   * Poverty indicates a lack of faith and devotion.
> 
>   * Successful pastors _should_ be very wealthy, since God has chosen and blessed them.
> 
>   * One can increase their own prosperity by demonstrating faith via giving money to the church.
> 
> 

> 
> Like the anti-communist message embedded in Graham’s sermons, the message of material prosperity is infused into the doctrine and lifestyles of these religious (largely Evangelical) leaders, intertwining Christianity with a pro-capitalist message. So, in this way, **through the performance of these religious leaders, the myth being conveyed is that capitalism is inspired, or at least sanctioned, by God.**
