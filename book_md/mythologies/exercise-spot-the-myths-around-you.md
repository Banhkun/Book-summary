## Exercise: Spot the Myths Around You

Barthes says that the most insidious thing about our cultural myths is their invisibility—the fact that we don’t notice them allows us to accept them without question. See if you can spot the myths you encounter today.

As you scroll through the internet today, take note of any advertisements you come across. Stop and contemplate a few of them. Can you decipher any hidden messages in the images or phrasing used? Are any subtle messages being conveyed about race, gender, class, beauty, or politics? Describe one in as much detail as possible.

Who do you think is benefitting from the myth you described, and how?

Do you think this advertisement could eliminate the myth you perceived and still be effective in its job to sell the product or service? Why or why not?
