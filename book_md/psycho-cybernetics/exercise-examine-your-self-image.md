## Exercise: Examine Your Self-Image

Each person has a unique self-image that determines how they interpret and interact with different people and situations. Use this exercise to better understand your self-image.

* * *

Describe a recent situation in which you and another person disagreed because you interpreted the situation differently. This could be an interaction you were both involved in, or your response to some newsâ€”you both had access to the same information.

Now that you understand more about how your self-image impacts your perception, why do you think you interpreted the situation in the way that you did?

Think about the conclusion your interpretation led you to form about the situation. Do you think your self-image helped you in this situation or worked against you?
