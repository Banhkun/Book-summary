## Exercise: Identify Your Fears

According to Maltz, your fears are a sign that you haven’t prepared yourself to meet challenges. Investigating your fears will help you to plan specific ways to overcome them.

* * *

What’s one thing you want to do but are too afraid to take action on?

Why are you afraid to take action? Try to be as specific as possible.

Now that you’ve identified your fears about taking action, pick one fear to investigate. Ask yourself if there are any rational reasons for believing that this fear could happen in reality.

If this fear did come true, what specific steps could you take to take control of the situation?
