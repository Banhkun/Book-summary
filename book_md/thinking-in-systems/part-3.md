## Part 3: Changing Systems | Chapter 6: Twelve Leverage Points

Leverage points are places to intervene in a system. It’s important to 1) find the right leverage point, and 2) push it in the right direction.

Counter-intuitively, **people often find a good leverage point, but push it in the wrong direction**. Remember the car lot, where reducing delays actually worsened the oscillations.

The author presents 12 leverage points in order of increasing effectiveness.

#### Shortform Notes on Leverage Points

Before we dive in, some themes to keep in mind:

  * Lower leverage points tend to be harder to change or have less influence on the behavior of the system. Changing a system’s flows may do little to change how its feedback loops work.
  * In contrast, higher leverage points are so influential that small changes can have vast effects on system behavior. Change a system’s ability to self-organize, and you influence its stocks, flows, and feedback loops.



In addition, at a high level, we group the leverage points into three major categories, also in increasing order of effectiveness:

  * The physical system structure: the stocks, flows, and how they connect
  * System information and control: how the system regulates itself, such as through feedback loops and information flow
  * The meta-system: the goals and mindset of the system



### System Elements, Stocks and Flows

#### 12: Parameters

Parameters are numbers described in the system. These include the level of the stock, the quantity of the flows, and more generally it includes swapping individual elements in the same system.

**We spend the vast majority of our time worrying about parameters, but the author argues this is definitively the _least_ effective place to intervene.** For example:

  * When concerned about the national debt, politicians spend much of their time negotiating incremental changes to budgets and tax rates. Yet the national debt continues growing, regardless of who’s in power.
  * The Federal Reserve tinkers with interest rates, but this hasn’t ever stopped economic cycles from happening.



Adjusting parameters doesn’t work well because there are stronger system effects at play, such as feedback loops, incentive structures, and delays. If a system is described by a runaway loop, tweaking linear parameters does not meaningfully change the system’s behavior.

A minority of parameters _can_ become effective leverage points when they affect higher leverage points in this list, such as the growth rate in a reinforcing feedback loop or the time delay. But the author argues these are rarer than most people think.

#### 11: Stocks

We’ve learned that stocks are buffers that can stabilize the system over fluctuating flow rates. Your bank account is a stock of money that helps you withstand volatility in your income and expenses.

Changing the stock changes the behavior of the system. You can stabilize a system by increasing the stock, but this comes at the cost of efficiency—larger stocks cost more to build or maintain. In contrast, you can increase efficiency by decreasing the stock, but this comes at the cost of lower robustness.

  * For example, just-in-time manufacturing decreases the size of the inventory while relying on more frequent deliveries. This makes it more agile to shifting customer demand, but makes it more vulnerable to supply disruptions.



Stocks can be effective leverage points, but they are often slow to change, especially when they’re physical in nature.

  * Once a dam is constructed, the stock capacity is fixed - it would take a lot of effort to change the stock.



#### 10: Stock-and-Flow Structure

Changing the stock-and-flow structure means changing which flows are connected to which stocks. This can change the behavior of the system:

  * In constructing new highways, roads, and parking lots, urban planners reconfigure how traffic flows the stock-and-flow structure.
  * (Shortform example: A government could change how money flows—currently it receives taxation from citizens and allocates budget to departments, which then returns to citizens. Changing the structure of this could lead to different system behaviors.)



However, the stock-and-flow structure is hard to change once it’s set, especially if it’s physical. It’s better to design it well first—understand the structure’s limitations, and prevent fluctuations that exceed the structure’s capacity.

#### 9: Delays

As we’ve seen, delays in feedback loops tend to cause oscillations. In turn, oscillations worsen the effectiveness of your decisions, because you’re making decisions with delayed information. Furthermore, the results of your actions are delayed—by the time your actions have results, the situation may have changed so that your actions have become inappropriate.

Changing the length of delays affects system behavior:

  * Delays that are too short cause overreaction, leading to higher-frequency oscillations.
  * Delays set just right can dampen oscillations and introduce stability.
  * Delays that are too long can lead to exploding oscillations, or push a system past a breaking point beyond which it cannot return (such as overfishing to extinction).



Changing delays can cause big changes to system behavior. Just make sure you change delays in the right direction—decreasing delays may seem intuitively good, but they can lead to unwanted overreactions.

However, many delays can’t be changed—a baby takes a certain number of years to grow to become an adult; fish can only reproduce so quickly. In these cases, you’ll need to intervene elsewhere in the system.

### System Information and Control

This category of leverage points moves from the concrete layer of the system’s physical structure to a higher layer of information and control.

#### 8: Balancing Feedback Loops

A balancing feedback loop keeps a stock at a setpoint. It can be broken down into components and parameters:

  * The speed and accuracy of monitoring
  * The speed and intensity of the response
  * The flows by which the response achieves its goal



Each of these can be leverage points for changing how the balancing feedback loop works.

**The balancing feedback loop should be designed to be strong enough to regulate whatever it’s regulating.** If the feedback loop is too weak for the system changes, it will fail to keep the stock at its desired setpoint.

  * The economic market uses price transparency to route resources to where they are most effective. However, obfuscation of prices can distort markets, as when governments provide subsidies or externalities like pollution are not priced in. Balancing feedback loops can restore transparency, such as reducing subsidies and regulating pollution.
  * In a well-functioning democracy, voters act as a balancing feedback loop—if the government behaves in unwanted ways, the voters vote new people into office. This requires information transparency between the government and the voters. Obfuscating information, such as in private lobbying and government secrecy, weakens this feedback loop. In contrast, transparency laws such as the Freedom of Information Act strengthen the feedback loop.



It’s also common to ignore the value of balancing feedback loops and to remove seemingly unnecessary ones. Some loops exist to protect against rare emergency cases and may rarely or never be activated; thus, they might seem useless. **Removing these can be a grave mistake** , analogous to removing emergency shutdown systems in nuclear power points. A system may have multiple feedback loops operating at different timelines and under different conditions, and they may all be necessary to ensure a resilient system.

#### 7: Reinforcing Feedback Loops

Reinforcing feedback loops grow exponentially; left unchecked, they can cause serious, irreversible damage.

The leverage point for reinforcing feedback loops is its gain, or its growth rate.

Often, reinforcing feedback loops are countered by balancing feedback loops. An intuitive response to controlling a reinforcing feedback loop is to strengthen the balancing feedback loop. But **it’s often easier to simply _reduce_ the growth rate of the reinforcing feedback loop**, to keep it more manageable.

  * Economic growth and population growth are both reinforcing feedback loops; as they accelerate, they can cause worsening problems of poverty, inequality, and resource scarcity. Rather than strengthen the balancing feedback loops (such as welfare systems and technology), the author argues that slowing growth rates would be more effective.
  * (Shortform example: In the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than counter a fast infection rate by building up medical supplies, it was more effective to reduce the growth rate in cases through social distancing.)



#### 6: Information Flow

In a system, decisions and well-functioning feedback loops often require information. The car lot manager requires information about current inventory; a democracy requires information about the government for voters.

In contrast, **missing information can lead to system malfunction**. People without information cannot make decisions to meet the system goals. The leverage point is then to **provide the right information in the right form**.

  * Individual fishermen may not have enough information to prevent them from overfishing to extinction. Pricing isn’t enough feedback—prices actually increase as the fish get more scarce, causing even more fishing. Instead, fishermen need information about the fish population, as well as information about how the population affects their long-term livelihood.
  * Industrial polluters might dump waste into a river, which carries it downstream. The polluter thus lacks the “information” about the effects of its population. Consider instead if the polluter were forced to drink water downstream of itself.



Create new information flows, and you can create new, powerful feedback loops that can keep the system functioning and resilient.

#### 5: System Rules

A system’s rules define its boundaries. These include national constitutions, laws, incentives, punishments, and contracts.

In a well-functioning system, good rules are set that achieve the system’s goals. (Recall from the last chapter that bad rules invite counterproductive evasion or cause actors to chase the wrong goal.)

Changing the rules can dramatically change behavior.

  * Imagine a university where the teachers paid the students to attend class.
  * Imagine a nation that suppressed the constitutional right to free speech.



**To figure out why a system is dysfunctional, look at who’s setting the rules.** The rules may be self-serving and contradictory to the purported goals of the system.

  * The author was skeptical of the global trade system, since the rules were designed by corporations for their own benefit. Nations would instead compete with each other at a pricing race to the bottom to attract foreign investment.



### The Meta-System

Beyond the system’s information and control layer—how it regulates itself—is an even higher level of abstraction—how a system defines its purpose and changes its purpose.

#### 4: Self-Organization

Self-organization is the ability of a system to change itself, and possibly reinvent itself. This leads to impressive resilience, as the system can adapt to changing circumstances. It’s also more powerful than any leverage point we’ve discussed so far, because a self-organizing system can improve its rules, information flow, and feedback loops.

As previously explained, vastly complex self-organization can result from a few simple rules:

  * Biological evolution results from 1) the encoding of life in DNA, 2) the ability to generate mutations in DNA, and 3) the pressure of natural selection to select for the more successful mutations.
  * Likewise, human technology develops with 1) the knowledge of existing science and technology, 2) the human creativity that generates new innovations, and 3) the market forces that select for more useful innovations and reward creators.



The leverage point is therefore to modify a system’s ability to self-organize. On one hand, **you can improve a system’s resilience by enabling self-organization**.

(Shortform note: Taking the technology example above, this can mean:

  * Preserving and spreading human knowledge (as in education)
  * Enabling more creativity and generation (as with less restrictive patent laws and capital investment in entrepreneurship)
  * and efficient market forces (as in preventing monopolies from destroying new enterprises, and lowering subsidization of failed startups))



On the other hand, **you can make a system brittle by quashing self-organization**. Invert any of the enablers above, and you reduce self-organization—this may mean eliminating biological diversity by killing species; suppressing access to human knowledge; or crushing new experiments as they arise.

Any system that becomes so calcified it can no longer self-organize, or that deliberately suppresses self-organization, is doomed in the long run.

#### 3: System Goals

A system’s goals determine its behaviors. **Changing goals can mutate every lower leverage point to suit the system’s new goals.**

Usually changing elements in a system has little effect, except if the element can change higher leverage points, such as system goals.

  * Put Hitler in charge of 1930s Germany, and you create a Nazi Germany with Nazi goals and very different system behaviors.
  * Put Gorbachev in charge of the Soviet Union, and you create goals of _glasnost_ and _perestroika_ , in turn changing the society’s information flows and ability to self-organize.



Therefore, the author argues that any technology or system isn’t inherently good or bad. It depends on the goals of who’s using it.

#### 2: System Paradigm

A system’s paradigms are its implicit beliefs about how the world works. They’re often so deeply ingrained in our minds that we don’t consciously articulate them—there’s no need to, because we believe everyone else believes them too.

In Western societies, we have these paradigms:

  * Money represents value. Someone who has more money is more valuable than someone who has less of it.
  * It’s possible for someone to “own” land on this planet.
  * Growth is good. Continuous improvement is good, and stasis is bad.



These paradigms are so natural we don’t often think about them, yet they govern much of what we do. These paradigms drive every lower leverage point—the system goals, the information flows, and so on. These paradigms govern how we set up rules around property ownership, how we set up systems for social welfare, and how we reward system actors that produce growth.

Yet these paradigms can be completely foreign to other societies, either traditional societies that exist today or historical ones from just thousands of years ago.

It can seem harder to change system paradigms than stocks and flows. But a single person with a single idea can generate a paradigm change, which can in turn overturn the entire system:

  * Copernicus introduced the paradigm that the Earth orbits the sun, and that we weren’t the center of the universe. This in turn strengthened the societal influence of science and weakened that of religion.
  * Adam Smith introduced the paradigm that countless individual actors acting in selfish motives can create a surprisingly functioning economy. This in turn strengthened the role of free markets and weakened that of top-down control.



Outside of the originator of the paradigm, getting a _whole system_ to shift a paradigm can take considerable time and effort. But ultimately, a paradigm shift can completely revolutionize every element of a system.

#### 1: Transcending Paradigms

The highest leverage point, even beyond system paradigms, is to free yourself from fixed paradigms. A paradigm is just an idea. No paradigm is absolute truth, and it contains just a small slice of understanding an endlessly complex universe. To transcend paradigms is to prevent yourself from being fixed to any particular paradigm, and to be flexible.

(Ironically, the idea that there is no true paradigm is itself a paradigm, and the author finds this hilarious.)

To let go of paradigms is to be comfortable with not knowing, not having certainty. This is empowering—if you are no longer enslaved by paradigms, then you can choose whichever one you please, or none at all.

### Notes on Using Leverage Points

These 12 leverage points are just a guideline. The exact order is less important than which leverage points are more or less changeable in the system you’re studying.

Understanding leverage points in theory is just the beginning. Now you need to deeply analyze a system—understand its structure, its rules, its paradigms—to begin to know where you can push and prod. To get an accurate understanding, you may need to discard your own prior assumptions and paradigms about how the world works.
