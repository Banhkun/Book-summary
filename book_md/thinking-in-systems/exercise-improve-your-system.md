## Exercise: Improve Your System

Think about how to improve your system with the three main reasons they perform well.

* * *

What’s a system you care about? If you need ideas, consider your employer, a group you belong to, yourself as an individual, or a physical system.

Is this system resilient? What is the range of conditions in which the system can perform naturally? How can you improve the system’s resilience?

Is the system capable of self-organization? Does it freely allow experiments that allow it to adapt? How could you improve its self-organization?

Does the system have a capable hierarchy? Can the subsystems work independently with minimal communication with other systems? Does the larger system function to support the subsystems in pursuit of a larger goal? How can you improve the hierarchy?
