## Chapter 7: Improving as a System Thinker

Learning to think in systems is a lifelong process. The world is so endlessly complex that there is always something new to learn. Once you think you have a good handle on a system, it behaves in ways that surprise you and require you to revise your model.

And even if you understand a system well and believe you know what should be changed, actually _implementing_ the change is a whole other challenge.

The author ends with advice that she and other systems thinkers have learned over their lifetimes. (Shortform note: We’ve organized her points into three sections:

  1. Understanding systems
  2. Intervening in systems
  3. Systems in society)



### Understanding Systems

Before you eagerly dive in and try to repair a system, make sure you understand it well first.

#### Stop and Watch

We all have our favorite assumptions about how things work, and how problems should be fixed. To truly understand a system, we have to discard these and start from scratch.

To understand a system, first watch to see how it behaves. Get a sense of its beat.

This doesn’t necessarily mean stopping and watching it in real-time. Rather:

  * Research its history. How did this system get here?
  * Get data. Chart important metrics over time, and tease out their relationships with each other
  * Ask people in the system what’s happened (while being wary of accepting anyone’s beliefs too quickly)
  * Ask questions. What’s working well in the system? What’s working poorly?



#### Appreciate the Unquantifiables

Our modern industrial society obsesses over things that are quantifiable. Find how to express things in numbers, then make the good numbers go up. (Shortform note: This is another paradigm we tend to accept without thinking about it.)

In your system model, don’t ignore the unquantifiables. These might drive actors in the system as strongly as the quantifiables, and omitting them will lead to an incomplete model. These unquantifiables might include things like:

  * Human dignity
  * Contentment in life
  * Hope and inspiration
  * National pride



If you want to build a quantitative system model, you may need to put your unquantifiable onto a quantitative scale (such as measuring human dignity on a scale of 1 to 10).

#### Expand Your Boundaries

As discussed earlier, we are prone to drawing artificially narrow boundaries when understanding systems. To really appreciate a system’s complexity and guide it to a good outcome, you’ll need to relentlessly expand the boundaries by which you perceive the world.

The author focuses on three boundaries in particular.

##### Expand Your Boundaries of Time

As a society, we tend to fixate on the short-term. In how few years can this investment pay off? How do we get faster growth, sooner?

Systems, of course, can persist over decades, centuries, and much longer time scales. Focusing on the short-term is like hiking a treacherous path by staring down at your feet.

Instead, try thinking in centuries. How will this system behave 10 generations from now? System behavior 10 generations in the past affects your life today; system behavior today will affect lives 10 generations from now.

##### Expand Your Boundaries of Intellectual Disciplines

To make sense of a complex world, you’ll need to understand more disciplines beyond your major in college, your current profession, and what you’re comfortable with. You’ll need to seek wisdom in psychology, economics, biology, the arts, religion, and more.

As you learn from these other disciplines, be aware that its practitioners see the world through their own lenses and draw their own boundaries. As an interdisciplinary thinker, you will need to hurdle these boundaries.

##### Expand Your Boundaries of Caring

Push yourself to care about more than you naturally do. The system is a cohesive whole and requires its parts to function properly. Your liver wouldn’t succeed if your heart failed, and vice versa. Likewise, the rich wouldn’t succeed if the poor failed; your country wouldn’t succeed if its neighbor failed; the world wouldn’t succeed if its natural ecosystems failed.

#### Articulate Your Model, Get Feedback, and Improve

As you understand a system, put pen to paper and draw a system diagram. Put into place the system elements and show how they interconnect. Draw the feedback loops (both balancing and reinforcing), find the delays. Articulate the system’s goals and paradigms.

**Drawing your system diagram makes explicit your assumptions about the system and how it works.**

Next, expose this model to other credible people and invite their feedback. They will question your assumptions and push you to improve your understanding. You will have to admit your mistakes, redraw your model, and this trains your mental flexibility.

You will get many contradictory ideas. Be able to hold these in your head at the same time, rather than fixating on your favorite one. Rule out ideas only until you have enough evidence to do so.

#### Understand the Limits of Understanding

The allure of systems thinking is to gain a superpower to predict the world and to control it. Believing this is a great mistake. The world is complex, and many parts of it elude understanding.

But you can still play a role. You can’t predict a system exactly, but you can guide it to a good direction. You can’t control a system, but you can influence its design and evolution. The author describes this as “dancing with the system.”

### Intervening in Systems

For many systems thinkers, the goal of understanding a system is to fix a problem or make it work better. But even if you understand a system and believe you know the best intervention for it, actually implementing that change is another, possibly greater, challenge.

#### Question the Intervention to the Deepest Layers

When probing a system and investigating why interventions don’t work, you may bring up deep questions of human existence.

For example, you might think, “If these boneheads were only to open their eyes and accept this data, then they’d see the value of the solution, and we could fix the system.” But this raises deeper questions: How does _anyone_ process the data they receive? How do people view the same information through different cognitive filters? Why can the same data lead to two completely different conclusions from two different people?

Likewise, you may think a system needs to reorient its values. But where do values come from? Why does someone arrive at the values they have? Why does it seem easier to orient around quantitative values than qualitative ones?

Social systems are driven by deep human needs and emotions, and that’s why they can be so resistant to change. This complexity can be maddening, but understanding it is necessary to appreciating why systems fail and how to improve them.

#### Empower the System to Do More Internally

As an intervenor, resist the tendency to bring in outside solutions that cripple the system’s ability to take care of itself (this is the system trap of addiction). Instead, try to empower the system to do more internally, to solve its own problems.

For instance, to nurture a developing economy, don’t bring in foreign corporations to build factories to “create jobs.” A more internally-empowering solution would be to issue small loans to local entrepreneurs and teach business skills.

#### Tighten Feedback Loops on Responsibility

Actors in a system can behave poorly when they evade accountability for their actions. Tighten the feedback loop between the actor and the consequences of its behavior. Examples include:

  * Limit health insurance payouts to car drivers who don’t wear seatbelts.
  * Prohibit Congress from legislating laws that it gives itself immunity from.
  * Require decision-makers who start a war to participate in the war.



#### Make Interventions Dynamic and Nonlinear

Intervenors can issue rules, laws, and policies to influence systems. These policies are often static—change this parameter in perpetuity, regardless of what changes in the world.

However, systems behave dynamically, and a fixed policy that was appropriate at one stage of its development may be inappropriate in another. Instead, consider **dynamic, flexible policies that can operate nonlinearly over a range of conditions, and that is open to changing over time**.

For example, consider a law to reduce a new pollutant, based on preliminary, uncertain data that the pollutant is harmful. Instead of a static policy of a fixed tax, consider a dynamic policy:

  * For a single polluter, the tax scales up as the polluter generates more pollution.
  * System-wide, the tax scales up as pollutant levels increase.
  * The data should be monitored, and the policy revisited in 3-year intervals in case the interpretation changes.



With a dynamic policy like this, the policy can continue to achieve its goal even if if the situation turns out to be better or worse than currently understood.

### Systems in Society

More generally, systems thinking can be applied at a societal level to improve how people think and behave.

#### Talk in Systems Terms

The language we use affects our thinking, and how we think affects how we behave. If we use systems terms in our discussions, we can make everyone a better systems thinker.

For example, we use the terms “productivity” and “growth” pervasively. In contrast, we talk much less often about “resiliency,” “feedback loops,” and “self-organization.” You can see how using these terms can make us aware of systems, which can in turn guide us to improve the ones we belong to.

#### Make Information Transparent

Information is vital in making good decisions. Bad system behavior can result with delayed, biased, or hidden information. In contrast, presenting accurate, transparent information can cause magical changes.

The author notes that in the 1980s, a new US law required companies to report their level of pollutions. Reporters then published lists of top local polluters. Within a few years, reported pollution decreased by 40%. This was done, not through stringent penalties or enforcement, but merely by opening access to information.

Information is power. Be aware of who controls the information and how they may mold it to suit their own purposes.

#### Maintain Moral Standards

We previously learned about the system trap of progressively declining standards, where the standards bar is pegged to recent performance, and so the bar can slip progressively lower.

The author notes that society’s morals are caught in this vicious cycle. Bad behavior might be shocking at first, but it goes unpunished, and over time we become desensitized.

  * Elected politicians act immorally, and we aren’t surprised any longer by scandals.
  * Pessimism and angry tirades abound in our media. Optimism, idealism, and earnest collaboration are ridiculed.



Instead, we should maintain absolute moral standards and refuse to let them slip. The further our society deviates from these standards, the harder we should push to recover.
