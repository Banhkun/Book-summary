## Part 1: What Are Systems? | Chapter 1: Definitions

**A system is composed of three things:**

  1. Elements: The individual things in the system
  2. Interconnections: The relationships between the elements
  3. Purpose or Function: What the system achieves



To define it more cohesively, **a system is a set of elements that is interconnected in a way that achieves its function**.

Many things in ordinary life are systems. Let’s define how a professional football team is a system:

  * Elements: The players, the coaches, the field of play, the ball
  * Interconnections: The rules of football, the way players in specific roles interact with each other, how the coaches instruct the players, how the laws of physics govern how the ball moves
  * Purpose: To win football games, to have fun, to make money



As you look around the world, you’ll see systems everywhere. **So what is _not_ a system?** A set of elements that are not interconnected in a meaningful way or overall function is not a system. For example, a pile of gravel that happens to be on a road is not a system—it’s not interconnected with other elements and does not serve a discernible purpose.

In this chapter, we’ll dive deeper into understanding the three attributes of a system. We’ll then understand how systems behave over time, and how the interconnections can drive system behavior.

(Shortform note: in this chapter we’ll develop an extended example of a football team beyond what’s contained in the book, but in a way that’s consistent with its ideas. You should actively apply the ideas to develop your own examples of systems, such as a corporation, a university, a tree, or the government.)

### Describing a System

Let’s go deeper into understanding the three attributes of a system.

#### Elements

Elements are usually the most noticeable. They are the things that make up the system. The football team consists of players, coaches, and a ball. If you zoom out a bit further and define a larger system, the elements can also include the football fans, the city the team resides in, the staff that supports the team, and so on.

Elements don’t need to be tangible things. The system of a football team also consists of intangibles like the pride that fans have for their team, the reputation of players in the league, or the motivation to practice.

You can define an endless number of elements in any system. Before you go too deep down this rabbit hole, start looking for the interconnections between elements.

#### Interconnections

Interconnections are how the elements relate to each other. **These interconnections can be physical in nature.** Take the football team again:

  * The players line up in a particular formation, with specific roles in specific places
  * The individual players pass the football to each other
  * The players maneuver themselves against and around the opposing teams’ players
  * The team’s fans surround the players in a circular arena to watch the game



**Interconnections can also be intangible, often through the flow of information.**

  * During a game, the coach receives information from the field, then decides on a strategy and communicates that strategy to the quarterback
  * A television broadcaster communicates the information about the game to an audience nationwide
  * Outside of games, the training staff uses information from the game to decide how to develop the players
  * A player receives information from his agent about openings at other teams



The information interconnections may be harder to see at first, but they’re often vital to how the system operates.

#### Purpose

The purpose or function is what the system achieves.

Of the three elements, the purpose is often the hardest to discern. It’s not often made explicit, such as in the case of a tree.

**The best way to figure out a system’s purpose is to see what it actually does.** The way a system behaves and its result is a reflection of the system’s purpose.

  * A football team’s purpose is often to win games. But looking at its performance of individual players, you might find that their purpose is to make more money or attract attention.
  * A national government may communicate that its purpose is to take care of the poor and reduce inequality, but if it makes little effort toward this goal, it’s not actually a function of the system.
  * Many systems don’t have explicitly stated purposes, so, once again, you can observe what it does. What is the purpose of a tree? To grow as large as it can within its lifetime; to spread seeds and reproduce itself; to compete against other plants for limited resources.



**A vital purpose of most systems is to perpetuate itself.**

### Which Aspect Is Most Important?

Which of the three aspects of a system is most important? The elements, interconnections, and purposes are all _necessary_ , but they have different relative importances.

To think about this, consider changing each item in a system one by one.

**Changing elements:** You can change the individual players and coaches, but if you keep the same interconnections and purpose, it’s still clearly a football team. Likewise, you can change the members of the US Senate or a corporation, but they still maintain their identities. Thus, the specific elements are usually the least important in the system. (Shortform note: This is related to the Ship of Theseus thought experiment.)

**Changing interconnections:** Changing the interconnections can dramatically change the system. Imagine changing the rules of the game from football to rugby, while keeping the same players. Or imagine a system where the players paid money to watch the fans. These are certainly not recognizably football teams, even if all the elements remain the same.

**Changing purpose:** Changing the purpose can also be drastic. What if the goal of the team were to lose as many games as possible? What if the purpose were to make news headlines? The system would be very different, even if the elements and interconnections stayed the same.

Therefore, typically, the purpose is often the most important determinant of a system, followed by interconnections, then by elements.

**However, sometimes changing an important element can also change the interconnections or the purpose.** Changing China’s leadership from Mao to Deng Xiaoping dramatically changed the nation’s direction; even though the one billion people and millions of organizations were exactly identical, their interconnections and their purpose became very different.

### How Systems Relate to Each Other

Because you can now see systems everywhere you look, you might have seen that systems can be composed of other systems, and so on in a fractal-like pattern.

For example:

  * Each player on a football team is himself a complex system, consisting of his organ systems, his thinking, his own motivations.
  * The multiple players together form a system of the playing team on the field.
  * The players with the coaching staff form an overall system at a team level.
  * The team combines with its fans and the overall city to form another system.
  * The team combines with the other teams in the sport to form another system at the league level.
  * The league combines with the other sports leagues in the world to form another system.



The systems can thus get quite complex, as we’ll explore throughout the summary.

**The individual subsystems may have conflicting purposes from the overall system purpose, which can lower function of the system.** For example, if the individual players on a football team care more about their personal reputation than the success of the team, the overall team system will perform poorly. For a system to function effectively, its subsystems must work in harmony with the overall system.
