## Chapter 1-2: System Behavior

Next, we’ll understand how systems behave over time, by considering stocks and flows. This forms the basic foundation that lets us build up into more complex systems.

### Stocks and Flows

A stock represents the elements in a system that you can see, count or measure. It can be commonly thought of as an inventory, a store, or a backlog.

**Flows are the means by which the stocks change over time.** Inflows increase the level of stock, while outflows decrease the level of stock.

Let’s take a simple system: a bathtub.

  * The stock is the amount of water in the tub.
  * The inflow is water coming from the faucet into the tub. This raises the stock.
  * The outflow is the drain that removes water from the tub. This decreases the stock.



This can be drawn on a stock-and-flow diagram, as here:

![thinking-in-systems-stock-flow.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/thinking-in-systems-stock-flow.png)

The clouds signify wherever the inflow comes from, and wherever the outflow goes to. To simplify our understanding of a system, we draw boundaries for what’s important for understanding the system, and ignore much of the outside world.

Many systems are analogous to the bathtub:

  * In fossil fuels, the stock is the reservoir of fossil fuels. Mining lowers the stock, while natural processes increase the stock.
  * The world population is a stock of people. The population grows with births and shrinks with deaths.
  * Your self-confidence is a stock. It grows with compliments and personal triumphs. It shrinks with project failures and insults.



#### System Dynamics

Systems like bathtubs and world populations are usually not static. They change over time—the inflows and outflows change, which causes the stocks to change.

Let’s consider how you can change the flows in a bathtub, by manipulating the inflow and the outflow:

  * The bathtub starts off empty. You plug the drain and turn on the faucet. This causes the water level (or the stock) to rise.
  * When the bathtub is full, you turn off the faucet. The water level stays the same, because water is neither flowing in nor out.
  * You open the drain. The water level starts decreasing.
  * At some point halfway, you turn on the drain again. The water is flowing in at the same rate that it’s leaving, so the water level stays the same.



This behavior can be put on a graph, which visualizes the system over time.

![thinking-in-systems-bathtub.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/thinking-in-systems-bathtub.png)

Systems thinkers use graphs to understand the **trend** of how a system changes, not just individual events or how the stock looks currently.

The bathtub should be an intuitive model, and it’s simple as it represents just one stock, one inflow, and one outflow. But from this basic example you can find a few general properties of systems:

  * If the inflows exceed the outflows, the stock will rise.
  * If the outflows exceed the inflows, the stock will fall.
  * If the outflows balance the inflows, the stock will stay the same, at a level of “dynamic equilibrium.”



#### Where We Focus

As humans, when we look at systems, we tend to focus more on stocks than on flows. (Shortform note: This might be because the stock is much more obvious and tangible than the flows. This is also related to how elements in a system are more easily recognizable than the Interconnections.)

Furthermore, **we tend to focus more on inflows than on outflows**.

  * When thinking about how the world population is growing, we naturally think about how increasing births must be driving the trend. We think less about how preventing death through better medical care also grows the population.
  * Likewise, a company that wants to increase its headcount does so instinctively by hiring more people. It doesn’t often think as hard about how to reduce the outflow of people who quit or are fired. 



Changing the outflows can have very different costs than changing the inflows.

#### Properties of Stocks and Flows

**Stocks take time to change.** In a bathtub, think about how quick it is to change the inflow or outflow. It takes just a second to turn on the faucet. It takes minutes to fill the tub.

Why do stocks change so gradually? **Because it takes time for the flows to flow.** As a result, stocks change slowly. They act as buffers, delays, and lags. They are shock absorbers to the system.

From a human point of view, this has both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, **stocks represent stability**. They let inflows and outflows go out of balance for a period of time. A stock buys you time to solve the problem and experiment.

  * A car’s gas tank gives the car operational stability. The engine can draw gas from the tank as it needs it. In contrast, imagine if you had to provide gas every second to the car at exactly the moment it needed it, or the engine would shut down. The storage tank gives the car system stability.
  * Your bank account stores money and gives your life stability. If you get fired from your job, the inflow of money will stop, but you can take money from your stock to continue living and figure out how to solve the problem.
  * Likewise, inventories for retail stores help them deal with different rates of buying. Water reservoirs help farmers deal with fluctuations in rainfall.



On the other hand, a slowly-changing stock means things can’t change overnight.

  * If we cut down all the trees in a rainforest, they can’t be planted overnight. They can only be replenished as quickly as the inflow of new trees.
  * If a population’s skills become meaningless because of technology, you can’t re-educate the workforce instantaneously. It takes time for the information to work its way through the system and to flow to the population.



If you understand that stocks take time to change, you’ll have more patience to guide the system to good performance.

#### Decisions Influence Stocks

As agents in a system, we make decisions to adjust the level of a stock to where we think it should be.

  * Your financial decisions depend on the stock of money in your bank account. If you feel you have too little money, you decrease spending and increase earnings to increase the stock of money. 
  * If a store has too much inventory, it runs sales or increases ads to decrease stock.



If you look at the world through a systems lens, you’ll see a large number of stocks, and flows that adjust the levels of stocks.

### Feedback Loops

Systems often produce behaviors that are persistent over time. In one type of case, the system seems self-correcting—stocks stay around a certain level. In another case, the system seems to spiral out of control—it either rockets up exponentially, or it shrinks very quickly.

**When a behavior is persistent like this, it’s likely governed by a feedback loop.** Loops form when **changes in a stock affect the flows of the stock**.

#### Balancing Feedback Loops (Stabilizing)

(Shortform note: Balancing feedback loops are also known as negative feedback loops or self-regulation.)

In balancing feedback loops, there is an acceptable setpoint of stock. If the stock changes relative to this acceptable level, the flows change to push it back to the acceptable level.

  * If the stock dips below this level, the inflows increase and the outflows decrease, to increase the stock level. 
  * If the stock rises above the acceptable level, the inflows decrease and the outflows increase, to decrease the stock level.



An intuitive example is keeping a bathtub water level steady.

  * If the level is too low, plug the drain and turn on the faucet. 
  * If the level is too high and the water spills out of the tub, open the drain and turn off the faucet.



Your bank account is another example of balancing feedback loops.

  * If the stock of money is below what’s acceptably comfortable to you, you’ll likely work more and spend less money. 
  * In contrast, if you have a windfall and money rises above your acceptable level, you’ll likely work less and spend more.



**Balancing feedback loops** tend to create stability, and they keep a stock within an acceptable range.

In a stock-and-flow diagram, balancing feedback loops look something like this:

![thinking-in-systems-balancing-loop.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/thinking-in-systems-balancing-loop.png)

A property of balancing feedback loops is that **the further away the stock is from the desired level, the faster it changes**.

  * A boiling cup of water cools its temperature more quickly than a lukewarm cup of water.
  * For your personal finances, you would behave much more extremely if you suddenly became bankrupt, than if you lost $100.



#### Reinforcing Feedback Loops (Runaway)

(Shortform note: Reinforcing feedback loops are also known as positive feedback loops, vicious cycles, virtuous cycles, flywheel effects, snowballing, compound growth, or exponential growth.)

Reinforcing feedback loops have the opposite effect of balancing feedback loops—they amplify the change in stock and cause it to grow more quickly or shrink more quickly.

  * As a stock level increases, the inflow also increases and the outflow decreases, causing the stock level to further rise.
  * As a stock level decreases, the inflow also decreases and the outflow increases, causing the stock level to further decrease.



Here are examples of runaway loops in the positive direction:

  * The more people there are in the world, the more they reproduce, which increases the stock of the world population.
  * A healthy national economy grows in a reinforcing loop. In a nation, the more factories and people you have, the more you can produce. The more you produce, the more you can invest back in more factories and educating people.



In a stock-and-flow diagram, reinforcing feedback loops look something like this:

![thinking-in-systems-reinforcing-loop.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/thinking-in-systems-reinforcing-loop.png)

> **Rule of 72**
> 
> Since we think about compound growth a lot, there’s a rule of thumb called the **Rule of 72** that lets you calculate the time it takes a stock to double. Take the current growth rate in percent, divide 72 by that number, and you’ll get the number of periods it takes to double.
> 
> For example, if your annual growth rate of investments is 4%, it will take 72 / 4 = 18 years to double. If it grows at 6%, it will take 72 / 6 = 12 years to double.
> 
> (Shortform note: The book cites the rule of 70, but 72 tends to be more commonly used, since more numbers divide evenly into 72 than 70.)

Here are examples of runaway loops in the negative direction:

  * In agriculture, plant roots help retain soil. The more that soil is eroded, the less roots can grow, which causes more erosion.
  * In a natural emergency, a store may have a sale on its goods. The lower the stock of a good like toilet paper, the more fervently people want to buy it, which causes the stock to shrink further.



### Systems Thinking

As you continue looking at the world through a systems lens, you’ll see feedback loops everywhere.

In fact, here’s a challenge: **try thinking of _any_ decision you make without a feedback loop of some kind**. Can you think of any?

You might start finding that many things influence each other in reciprocal ways. Instead of pure cause and effect, **you might see that the effect actually influences the cause**.

  * If population growth causes poverty, does poverty also cause population growth?
  * If the government makes a bad decision for the nation, did the nation do something to cause the government to make that bad decision?



**Invert your thinking. If A causes B, does B also cause A?**

This type of systems thinking makes blame much more complicated. It’s not an easy cause and effect relationship. It’s a system of interconnected parts and complicated feedback loops.
