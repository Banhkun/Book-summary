## Notable Quotes

“We need more fucking cars!” - Kalanick to Matthew Kochman on New York City’s driver shortage.

“He came to us and said, ‘Look, we are internationalizing and launching in Paris,’ and every single engineer was saying, ‘That is not possible, there is so much work, we will never be able to do it.’ But we got it done. It wasn’t perfect. But that was one of those moments where I was like, ‘This Travis guy, he is really showing us what is possible.’” - Conrad Whelan, Uber’s first engineer.

“I’m going to literally flip this table if anyone says one more time they are worried about destroying the brand. The luxury of Uber is about time and convenience. It’s not about the car.” - Kalanick, in response to concerns about bringing taxis into Uber and diluting the brand.

“The great companies, the PayPals of the world, don’t get scared by regulation.” - Kristin Sverchek, Lyft’s counsel.

On meetings between Chesky and Kalanick: “Brian would come back saying, ‘We have to be tougher!’ and Travis would come back saying, ‘We have to be nicer!’”

“The minute your car becomes real, I can take the dude out of the front seat. I call that margin expansion.” - Kalanick, on Google’s self-driving car.

“Grow really, really fast. You either want to be below the radar or big enough that you are an institution. The worst is being somewhere in between.” - Chesky, on how to combat regulation.

“When this community is empowered to be a movement, we cannot be beat.” - Airbnb head of policy Chris Lehane, at Airbnb open, to hosts.

“We could tell from the way they looked at us that they thought of us as just another local taxi app from Sichuan. Foreign companies see China as a territory to be conquered.” - Cheng Wei, Didi founder, on meeting with Kalanick and receiving his offer to cede China for a 40% stake

“If we fail, we will die.” - Cheng Wei to Didi employees

“The things that people are going to feel are still to come. The kind of impact this is going to have on our cities—ninety-five or ninety-eight percent of it is still yet to happen. What if I said there’s going to be no traffic in any major city in the U.S. in five years?” - Kalanick
