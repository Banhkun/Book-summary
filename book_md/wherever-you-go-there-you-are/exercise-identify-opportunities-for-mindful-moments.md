## Exercise: Identify Opportunities for Mindful Moments

Kabat-Zinn asserts that every moment and activity is an opportunity for mindfulness. Mindfulness doesn’t require any specific activity or environment; it can happen anywhere at any time. That being said, it’s impossible to remain mindful at all times, so it can be helpful to find specific moments in your day to start building a habit of mindfulness.

* * *

List two or three activities that are part of your everyday routine. They can be anything from making tea to taking the dog for a walk or commuting to work.

Choose one of these activities as an opportunity to practice mindfulness. Write down one thing you can do to help you remember to remain mindful during this activity (for example, sticking a post-it note by the refrigerator, or taking three deep breaths before starting your car).

Now write down one thing you can do to help you remain mindful during this activity (for example, leaving your phone on silent, or walking more slowly).
