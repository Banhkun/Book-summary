## Exercise: Commit to Values That Support Mindfulness

Kabat-Zinn explains that anyone can become more mindful but that mindfulness is a practice that requires ongoing commitment. He explains that there are values you can embody on a daily basis that help support your practice. These values include simplicity, patience, vulnerability, and perseverance.

* * *

Choose one of these four values (simplicity, patience, vulnerability, or perseverance), and think about one example of how you already embody this value in your daily life.

Choose another value (or the same one) and think of one example of how you can be more intentional about practicing this value in your daily life.
