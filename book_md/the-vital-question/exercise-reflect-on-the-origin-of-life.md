## Exercise: Reflect on the Origin of Life

Lane describes the process by which the very first life may have evolved in alkaline hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. He later discusses how all complex life descends from a single union of two microbes that led to a revolution in how cells function. Think about whether you agree with Lane’s assertions and consider what their implications might be.

* * *

What do you find most surprising or counterintuitive about Lane’s description of the origin of life? In what way does his depiction of the process contradict or agree with your understanding of evolution?

How likely or unlikely do you find Lane’s assertion that all complex life descends from a single instance of microbial chimerism that’s never been replicated in the 2 billion years since it occurred? Why do you think so?

If Lane’s ideas about the origin of life and the extreme rarity of the event led to the evolution of complex forms like ourselves, what does that say about the possibility of finding life beyond our planet? Does that change your attitude toward the value of our world in any way?
