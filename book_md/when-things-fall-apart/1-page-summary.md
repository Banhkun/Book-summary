## 1-Page Summary

Life naturally cycles through easy, enjoyable times and difficult, painful times. When life becomes challenging—when we endure significant losses, grapple with conflict, and witness our loved ones suffer—it can feel overwhelming, disorienting, and unfair.

In _When Things Fall Apart_ , Pema Chödrön argues that pain and suffering are inevitable parts of life but that these experiences can also be opportunities for growth and transformation. She draws on ancient Buddhist wisdom and practices to offer a path through life’s most challenging moments, writing that when things feel unbearably difficult, we can navigate them by staying in the present moment, cultivating compassion for ourselves and others, facing our fears, and accepting reality as it is.

Pema Chödrön is an American-Tibetan Buddhist nun who studied under the Tibetan Buddhist meditation master, Chögyam Trungpa. She is a teacher, public speaker, and author of 20 books on Buddhism and mindfulness, including How to Meditate: A Practice Guide to Making Friends with Your Mind. In her teachings, she stresses the importance of embracing our experiences, rather than trying to avoid them or escape them, as a way to cultivate inner strength and resilience.

_When Things Fall Apart_ is a collection of talks by Chödrön from 1987 to 1994. In this guide, we will first explore Chödrön’s views on why we suffer—what causes emotional pain and perpetuates it during challenging times—and then outline what you can do to turn these experiences into opportunities for growth and healing. Along the way, we’ll compare Chödrön’s teachings to insights from other Buddhist teachers and mental health experts, as well as provide additional context about Buddhism so you can better understand and apply these concepts to real-world challenges.

(Shortform note: Some argue that Tibetan Buddhism is uniquely positioned to offer lessons on navigating suffering because Tibetans have endured immense suffering, including forced labor camps, torture, and the destruction of their cultural and religious institutions at the hands of the Chinese government since their invasion of Tibet in 1949. Despite this, many Tibetans, strengthened by their Buddhist beliefs, have maintained a commitment to non-violence and have potent insights into enduring suffering with compassion and grace.)

### Why We Suffer

Navigating hardship, loss, and uncertainty is something we all must do at some point in our lives. Many things can fall apart with or without notice—our images of ourselves, our beliefs, our health or the health of a loved one, important relationships, and so on. When things change for the worse, we can become overwhelmed by negative emotions like worry, doubt, anger, fear, and despair.

Challenging times may be inevitable, but is it inevitable that we suffer because of them? Chödrön argues no. She explains that we suffer because **the strong beliefs we hold are in conflict with reality**.

(Shortform note: Chödrön doesn’t clarify if people are generally aware of the beliefs she addresses above, though they’re likely unconscious beliefs for many. Many psychology experts contend that we hold strong beliefs consciously and unconsciously—each driving our behaviors and attitudes towards the world and shaping our experiences. Our languages, personal experiences, cultural norms, education, upbringing, religion, and social interactions form our beliefs. Fortunately, you can change your beliefs over time with conscious effort.)

The incorrect beliefs we hold that make difficult times so painful include the following:

#### False Belief #1: Suffering Is Unacceptable and Should Not Exist

We believe the presence of suffering is unnatural and unacceptable and it signals that there’s something wrong with us and the world. Therefore,**** we’re convinced that emotional discomfort and pain should be avoided and fixed. Our most overwhelming and painful emotions can feel like personal demons that come in many shapes and sizes—fear, shame, jealousy, rage, loneliness, and the need to place blame.

However, Chödrön explains the Buddhist teaching that suffering is an innate part of life—all living beings on the planet experience pain, loss, confusion, sickness, and death. Emotional discomfort and pain are natural and inevitable, and they aren’t a sign that anything is going wrong. Because we’re not taught to accept suffering and difficult emotions as a natural part of reality, we resist suffering and put tremendous effort into avoiding it, denying it, and trying to fix it. In doing so, we miss out on the beauty and joy of life.

(Shortform note: Many worry that accepting the Buddhist teaching that suffering is a natural part of life will perpetuate suffering. However, in _The Art of Happiness_ , the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler argue that we can't escape suffering unless we first accept it because ignoring it adds to our suffering (this is similar to Chödrön’s explanation). The Dalai Lama and Cutler add that if we work to accept the inevitability of suffering, we can potentially free ourselves from suffering entirely.)

#### False Belief # 2: We Can Achieve Lasting Security

We believe that if we do all the right things—work, plan, and pray hard enough—we can achieve _lasting_ security, consistency, and predictability in our lives. We feel that what we have and who we are right now are not good enough and that contentment and safety are always just around the corner.

However, Chödrön explains that clinging to the hope that circumstances will last is the root cause of suffering, according to Buddhist teachings. In reality, nothing lasts forever—life is inherently uncertain and always changing. Chödrön says we live in denial of the fundamental uncertainty and insecurity of life, and when we’re confronted with our lack of control, we try to escape the discomfort by avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. In doing so, we inevitably become frustrated, disappointed, and exhausted because we are working against the nature of reality.

(Shortform note: Cognitive psychologists explain _why_ we believe that security and predictability are possible and work so hard to achieve them. We crave predictability and security because it’s hardwired into our bodies. As mammals, we have evolved innate survival instincts. These instincts bias our desires, thoughts, and behaviors toward avoiding pain, seeking pleasure, and finding safety, which usually entails circumstances and environments that are predictable, stable, and where we have some measure of control. Despite our hardwiring, Chödrön teaches that we can learn to tolerate and embrace uncertainty to achieve greater peace.)

### How to Ease Suffering and Navigate Difficult Times

Chödrön writes that the key to getting through difficult times with less suffering is **to let go of the idea that there’s a cure for pain and uncertainty and recognize these are constant and ever-present parts of life** —you will experience constant change, and to live fully, you must stop trying to make things permanently ideal. Learn to relax and accept the instability and the fundamental uncertainty of being alive.

Chödrön also writes that you can turn negative experiences into opportunities for growth. Doing this can help you cultivate more inner peace, which benefits you, those around you, and the whole planet.

You can let go of unhelpful beliefs, relax, and remain steady amidst chaos by learning to stay in the present moment. Chödrön explains that in the present moment, we can drop the painful and unhelpful stories we tell ourselves about who we are, what is happening to us, and what is true about the world. In this state, we can experience more courage, strength, and appreciation for reality. And we can live more fully without constantly seeking pleasure and striving to avoid and eliminate pain.

(Shortform note: Embracing uncertainty, giving up on trying to make our lives permanently ideal, and staying in the present moment are examples of what other Buddhist teachers and mental health professionals call radical acceptance. Radical acceptance is a strategy for coping with suffering that involves acknowledging and accepting the reality of a situation rather than trying to resist or avoid it. This means accepting both the positive and negative aspects of life, which can help you break free from negative thought patterns, learn and grow from challenges, cultivate emotional resilience, and develop a more compassionate attitude towards yourself and others.)

According to Chödrön, you can develop the ability to stay present by learning and following the teachings of Buddhism: practicing meditation and mindfulness, cultivating compassion for yourself and others, turning towards fear and releasing hope, and accepting reality as it is.

#### Practice Meditation and Mindfulness

Chödrön asserts that **cultivating mindfulness through meditation is the first step in learning how to cope with difficult times**. **It also allows you to use painful experiences as catalysts for experiencing peace in your life.**

In meditation, practice being with your experience in the present moment—whether it's painful, enjoyable, or a mix of both—and accepting it. Notice without judgment whatever thoughts and feelings come up, then let them go and return to the present moment. The purpose of meditation is not to rid yourself of unpleasant thoughts or feelings, which is impossible. Because mindfulness leads to clarity and spaciousness around your thoughts and feelings, it helps you to not get swept away by your hopes and fears in hard times.

Additionally, you can see your habit of escaping certain emotions because you’re paying attention to your experience. You can then develop the ability to let your emotions be present without indulging them or repressing them. Chödrön explains that this mindful awareness can translate into your daily life if you practice meditation regularly. You’ll develop inner acceptance and peace, despite how your outer life may look.

> **What Meditation Is and Isn’t**
> 
> In _Mindfulness in Plain English_ , Bhante Gunaratana addresses some misconceptions about mindfulness and meditation in Buddhist traditions. He clarifies what meditation is and what it isn’t, which expands upon Chödrön’s description above.
> 
>   * **Meditation isn’t about achieving deep relaxation.** As Chödrön explains, it’s about cultivating nonjudgmental awareness of your thoughts and sensations.
> 
>   * **Meditation isn’t about going into altered states of consciousness.** As Chödrön describes, its purpose is to help you be more present in the moment, not escape the present.
> 
>   * **Meditation doesn’t give you supernatural abilities, like knowing the future.** It is, however, a tool for getting to know yourself better, as Chödrön asserts.
> 
>   * **Meditation isn’t a self-centered practice.** Cultivating an inner sense of stability, peace, and self-awareness supports you in having more kindness, patience, and compassion for others, which Chödrön also teaches.
> 
> 


Chödrön teaches that only the present moment is real—the past and future are illusions. We all think about the past and future to escape the discomfort of everything we don’t know and can’t control. Therefore, as you learn to be more present, you may feel vulnerable because you have nowhere to escape to mentally. And Chödrön explains that when you have nowhere to hide from reality, your heart will open more fully to yourself, others, and the world.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle agrees with Chödrön’s description of the illusory nature of the past and future and elaborates that when we try to escape the present, we only find more suffering. He explains that thinking about the past can cause us to feel remorse, anger, resentment, melancholy, and nostalgia. Thinking about the future causes anxiety, fear, powerlessness, and worry. He argues that learning to keep our minds in the present moment is the most powerful way to find peace.)

##### How to Meditate

Chödrön teaches a form of mediation called Shamatha-vipashyana and outlines the basic steps:

  1. Find a flat, level seat and sit with your torso upright, legs crossed comfortably in front of you or with your feet on the floor. With your eyes open, gaze softly at the floor ahead of you and relax your jaw.
  2. Lightly focus your attention on your exhaled breath without trying to change it.
  3. Relax and accept whatever arises in your mind and body, even unpleasant thoughts and feelings. As thoughts come up, gently label them as “thoughts” with an attitude of kindness and understanding toward yourself. 
  4. When you feel distracted, come back to the sensation of your breath and scan your physical posture to reconnect with your body.
  5. Keep trying to notice your thoughts, label them “thoughts,” let them pass, and focus your attention on your breath.



(Shortform note: Shamatha-vipashyana is one type of mediation among many. Some types involve sitting still, as described above, but others, like the Zen Buddhist tradition of walking meditation or the Chinese martial art of Tai Chi, involve moving your body. These movement meditation practices have the same goal (developing mindfulness) as sitting meditation. Like Shamatha-vipashyana, these forms of meditation include focusing your attention on the present moment and on your breath and noticing your thoughts and sensations without judgment. Tai chi, however, adds choreographed movements while walking meditation allows you to walk freely outside.)

#### Cultivate Compassion For Yourself and Others

Chödrön teaches that one of the most powerful ways to stay afloat during difficult times and transform your pain into a positive force is to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. In Tibetan Buddhism, the path of cultivating compassion for yourself is called _maitri_ , which translates from Sanskrit to _loving-kindness_. By practicing maitri, you can make friends with yourself—trust and lean on yourself—and feel more connection to and belonging with others.

(Shortform note: Maitri is one of four key qualities, _[The Four Sublime States (or Brahmavihāra in Sanskrit)](http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/4sublime _states.pdf)_ , cultivated in Buddhist meditation. The other three qualities are compassion (_Karuna_), the practice of wishing to relieve the suffering of all beings, empathetic joy (_Mudita_), the practice of rejoicing in the happiness and success of others, and equanimity (_Upekkha_), the practice of developing a balanced and impartial state of mind toward all beings. According to Buddhist teachings, this set of practices can help you develop a more peaceful and harmonious relationship with the world around you.)

##### Self-Compassion

The first step in learning Maitri is to develop compassion for yourself. For many people, it’s easier to feel loving-kindness toward others—they instead feel hostility, hatred, and shame toward themselves. But Chödrön asserts that it's never too late to start practicing self-compassion and become your own friend.

(Shortform note: In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach discusses the power of compassion and defines it as “to feel with.” She further explains that _feeling with yourself_ —acknowledging your suffering with loving-kindness—is difficult for many people because they don’t feel they _deserve_ care and compassion. Fortunately, feelings of unworthiness are among the painful emotions that radical acceptance and self-compassion can heal.)

Not to be confused with self-improvement or building confidence, self-compassion is about learning to accept yourself unconditionally, not fixing or changing yourself. The first step toward self-compassion is understanding that your thoughts, emotions, and memories are all impermanent and not representations of who you really are. You can think of yourself as the sky and your thoughts, emotions, and memories as different kinds of weather passing through—we don’t look up and think the clouds _are_ the sky. We understand that the sky is much bigger than all the weather it holds. In the same way, you are much more than the emotions and thoughts you experience, and remembering this can help you be more patient and kind to yourself.

(Shortform note: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a widely used, evidence-based counseling approach that can teach people that our thoughts, emotions, and memories are not who we are. In _The Happiness Trap_ , Russ Harris explains that in ACT, we separate ourselves from our thoughts and emotions in a process called defusion. Through defusion, we learn to observe and distance ourselves from unhelpful thoughts, beliefs, and emotions rather than getting entangled in them or trying to suppress them. ACT has been shown to help people develop a more flexible and mindful relationship with their internal experiences, which can lead to greater psychological well-being and a more fulfilling life.)

When you encounter instability, uncertainty, and fear in your life, self-compassion and mindfulness can help you slow down and experience your feelings with kindness and care. Chödrön teaches that it's important to be kind to yourself during difficult times because this helps you develop a trusting relationship with yourself that you can lean on. Additionally, when you develop self-compassion, you’ll be able to have compassion for others and you’ll discover that you are just one small part of a greater whole.

> **A Practice for Self-Compassion**
> 
> Although Chödrön presents meditation and mindfulness as tools to cultivate self-compassion, Tara Brach teaches an additional useful practice called RAIN, which can help you develop loving-kindness for yourself. An acronym that outlines each step of the process, RAIN can and should be practiced whenever and wherever you find yourself overwhelmed with harsh thoughts toward yourself or any painful emotion. Brach recommends pausing, placing a hand on your heart, and doing the following:
> 
> **R** : Recognize and name the emotion or feeling you’re having.
> 
> **A:** Allow and accept how you feel without judgment.
> 
> **I** : Investigate what your feelings may be trying to tell you or what might be causing them.
> 
> **N** : Nurture yourself with a kind thought like, “I care about this pain, and I am here for you.”

##### Compassion for Others

When we suffer, we can get stuck in only caring about protecting ourselves, which leads to isolation and more suffering. But if we can connect our struggles and pain to the struggles and pain of others,**we can transform negative experiences into an experience of open-hearted connection and kinship with all life on this planet**. Chödrön explains that when our suffering is at its peak, if we deliberately try to feel tenderness for the suffering of other living beings, we can break through our self-absorbed isolation. In this way, compassion can heal us.

(Shortform note: Tara Brach also touches on the common experience of feeling isolated and absorbed in our own concerns when we are suffering and adds an explanation for _why_ this happens. She says when we suffer and are engrossed in our pain, we start to see everyone else as a separate “other.” We do this because painful experiences make us feel unsafe, and it’s our hardwired biological response to look for safety in those most familiar and similar to us while rejecting everyone else. We invent imaginary differences between ourselves and others, labeling them and putting them into boxes, which, in turn, shuts down our ability to feel compassion for _their_ suffering.)

Chödrön teaches that the most powerful way to experience peace and joy is to connect with others in mutual suffering and pain. You can do this through a meditative practice called _Tonglen,_ which means “giving and taking.” In Tonglen, your personal suffering can become a path to compassion.

To practice Tonglen, breathe in and imagine you’re inhaling the suffering of others. Then, breathe out the wish that all beings experience freedom from suffering. You can also practice this by noticing and naming the negative feeling you’re having as you breathe in and breathing out compassion for everyone who’s currently experiencing the same emotion or feeling. For example, if you feel lonely, first acknowledge the feeling to yourself and as you inhale and imagine breathing in the feeling of loneliness. Then as you exhale, breathe out kind and loving thoughts to everyone in the world who also feels lonely in that moment.

(Shortform note: Practicing Tonglen is one way to tap into the compassion for others that Chödrön describes, and Tara Brach offers several other practices to open your heart. She says one useful way of cultivating compassion for others (and ourselves) is simply asking, “what do they need?” Being curious and open to other people’s needs can dissolve feelings of isolation and help you be more loving toward others. You can also practice imagining yourself in other people’s situations to feel how it might feel to be in their situations, which is the essence of compassion. These techniques may be more straightforward ways of being compassionate if the visualization in Tonglen doesn't work for you.)

#### Turn Toward Fear and Let Go of Hope

Chödrön writes that **it’s impossible to be liberated from fear without turning toward it, experiencing it fully, and letting go of hope for an ideal life**. Avoiding or covering up any negative emotion, including fear, only strengthens it. And grasping onto hope for something better only makes us resist reality.

As you grapple with difficulty and uncertainty, you will inevitably experience longing for things to improve and fear that things will not improve or even worsen. One way to have a relationship with fear is to pause before you distract yourself from it or try to fix it. Instead, become familiar with how fear feels and don’t try to change it. Letting yourself feel your fear is an opportunity to learn more about yourself, become your own friend, be humble, and tap into your courage.

(Shortform note: Emotions, including uncomfortable ones like fear, are a natural and necessary part of the human experience. When we try to suppress or distract ourselves from them, we create a sense of inner conflict that can cause physical and mental health problems. Many psychology experts agree that avoiding or suppressing emotions is unhealthy because when we don’t process and release them in a healthy way, they can cause chronic and toxic stress responses in our bodies. Conversely, acknowledging and accepting our emotions can help to reduce stress, promote emotional well-being, and improve overall health.)

According to Chödrön, turning toward fear is helpful but not enough. To find true freedom from fear, you must rethink _hope_ and let it go. She explains that hope—carrying a desire and vision for something better—can be just as detrimental to peace as fear because it keeps you from accepting reality and living in the present moment, where you can find all your wisdom and strength. Holding onto hope sets you up for disappointment and more suffering. However, when you release hope that pain and insecurity can be eliminated from your life, you’ll stop trying to achieve lasting security and comfort (which is unattainable) and gain the confidence to relax and accept uncertainty.

We tend to see hope __ as the antidote to fear. But Chödrön explains the people of Tibet see fear and hope as two sides of the same coin: They understand that the fear of loss and pain comes from having hope that circumstances can be ideal. The root of hope and fear are the false beliefs we have about reality—we feel we lack something, things are going wrong, suffering is unacceptable, and someone or something is to blame.

Cultivating mindfulness and compassion can help you turn toward fear and release hope. To build compassion for yourself and better understand your emotional responses, accept that fear and hope are natural responses to suffering. When we go through hard times, Chödrön believes there is an enormous possibility for renewal and positive change, but we overlook the potential in hardship because we are too attached to our false beliefs about suffering. Cultivate mindfulness and compassion and you will gain confidence in your ability to embrace reality with acceptance.

> **Reframing Hope: Understanding the Buddhist Perspective on Letting Go of Desire**
> 
> For many, giving up hope to cope with difficult experiences will likely seem counterintuitive and counterproductive. This may be especially true if you are from a predominantly Christian country like the United States, as hope is one of the most cherished Christian values, along with love and virtue.
> 
> Mental health research also shows the many benefits of having a hopeful and optimistic outlook, including living longer and avoiding many chronic health conditions. From this Western perspective, giving up hope in the face of adversity is a sign that you aren’t coping well and may need help. Therefore, the language that Chödrön and other Buddhist teachers use to discuss the benefits of giving up hope could be confusing.
> 
> It may be helpful to think of the hope Chödrön talks about as _desire_ —the desire for things to be different than they actually are—which is born out of our fear of suffering. Chödrön encourages us to let go of this form of desire (hope) which causes more suffering. Tara Brach approaches desire differently: She explains that the best way to relate to desire of any kind, including the desire for something to be different and better, is to be mindful of how desire feels, have compassion for our feelings, and radically accept them.

#### Accept Reality as It Is

Chödrön’s final recommendation for coping more gracefully with difficulty is to accept reality as it is. When you stop resisting reality, you can relax and accept whatever is happening in your life and experience more peace, even if your circumstances are painful and stressful.

(Shortform note: Accepting reality as it is doesn’t mean that you resign to or approve of the way things are. Like giving up hope, accepting reality may seem like a counterproductive approach to achieving peace if your reality is difficult, overwhelming, and unjust. However, many leaders in psychology assert that if you don’t accept reality, you waste a lot of mental and emotional effort on resisting it—feeling angry and cheated, for example—that could be used toward cultivating compassion and making positive changes. A common saying in the mental health field is “what you resist persists.”)

Chödrön says to accept reality, you must acknowledge the limited knowledge and control you have in life. In doing so, you can accept the present moment as it is without trying to predict or control the future. Our minds confidently develop inaccurate ideas about ourselves and reality all the time, and we tend to cling to our ideas, even when they’re negative, because they provide us with a sense of familiarity and security. However, this sense of security is false, as everything, including ourselves, is in a constant state of change. Chödrön explains that when you accept how little you know about the present and future, you open more to the possibility that your challenging circumstances may have a positive outcome that you can’t yet imagine.

Develop a regular meditation practice and practice mindfulness in your daily life to learn how to stop resisting reality and fighting with yourself and your circumstances. Every time you acknowledge your thoughts, let them go, and return your attention to your breath, you’re strengthening your ability to compassionately accept yourself and reality. Chödrön argues that there is nothing so big or overwhelming that mindfulness and compassion can’t help.

> **The Wisdom of Surrender in Spiritual and Mental Health Contexts**
> 
> Another way that spiritual traditions and mental health programs talk about letting go of our ideas about the world and acknowledging the little control we have over our lives is in the practice of _surrender_.
> 
> In Hinduism, the term _ishvara pranidhana_ refers to the practice of letting go of the ego's need for control and recognizing that there is a greater power at work in the universe. It’s a way of acknowledging and surrendering to divine will rather than trying to impose your own will on the world. Ishvara pranidhana is a powerful approach for cultivating acceptance, inner peace, and connection to the present moment and can be achieved through prayer, meditation, and yoga.
> 
> In a mental health context, 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) often encourage surrender as a part of recovery. One of the first steps in AA states that you should  surrender your will and life to the care of a higher power. This step is seen as a key component of recovery from addiction, as it involves recognizing the limits of your control over your life and seeking guidance and support from something greater than you.
