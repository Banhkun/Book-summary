## Exercise: Be Authentic and Credible at Your Next Presentation

Using Maxwell’s recommendations, strengthen your authenticity and credibility as a speaker and better connect with your audience.

* * *

Think about an upcoming speech or presentation you need to make. Briefly jot down what it’s about.

Describe the audience you plan on speaking to. What might their primary needs be? How can you connect with your audience and show you care about them and their needs?

How can you strengthen your credibility so audience members are more receptive to your message? Consider adapting your message so it matches your true beliefs, backing up your words with actions, and learning more about your topic.

How can you expand your reference base to better understand your topic? Maxwell suggests you study others or grow your knowledge by exploring topics and having new experiences.
