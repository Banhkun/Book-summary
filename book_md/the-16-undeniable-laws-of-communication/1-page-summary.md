## 1-Page Summary

In _The 16 Undeniable Laws of Communication_ , internationally renowned speaker John C. Maxwell shares his secrets to becoming a confident and effective communicator capable of delivering any message to any audience. According to Maxwell, anyone can master public speaking by following the 16 laws he’s developed from a lifetime of public speaking. When you follow his advice on how to craft a powerful message and connect with your audience, you’ll be able to influence others and make a lasting impact with your words in all areas of your life.

Maxwell is an acclaimed speaker, leadership expert, and a _New York Times_ bestselling author. Since discovering his passion for speaking as a pastor, Maxwell estimates that he’s spoken over 13,000 times throughout his career. He has founded several leadership training organizations, such as the Maxwell Leadership Foundation and EQUIP Leadership.

In this guide, we’ve organized and consolidated Maxwell’s 16 laws into three parts. First, we’ll cover the key characteristics you need to become an authentic and credible communicator. Next, we’ll explore Maxwell’s strategies for preparing for your presentation and crafting your message. Lastly, we’ll discuss methods to engage and connect with your audience when delivering your message. Along the way, we’ll compare Maxwell’s techniques with those of other communication experts and provide actionable tips for improving your speaking skills.

### Part 1: How to Become an Authentic and Credible Speaker

According to Maxwell, effective communication starts with the speaker: **Your identity, actions, and values affect the way you speak and how others view you.** Before you can sway your audience with your words, you must first win them over with your character. According to Maxwell, effective speakers have three characteristics: They focus on connection, develop their credibility, and pursue constant learning. In this section, we'll look at how to develop these three characteristics.

(Shortform note: It may be easier than Maxwell implies to win someone over with your character. In _How Highly Effective People Speak_ , Peter D. Andrei explains that the cognitive bias called the halo effect makes people like you if they only perceive one positive trait of yours. This bias occurs because people tend to form impressions based on the first traits they notice. If people notice something positive about you first, they naturally assume you have other good qualities too. Perhaps, then, you may win your audience over by demonstrating even one of Maxwell’s characteristics of an effective speaker.)

#### Communicate for Connection

According to Maxwell, **your primary goal when communicating should be to connect with your audience and to provide them with valuable and meaningful content.** Connection is crucial because it breaks down barriers that prevent people from listening to you, which makes them more receptive to you and your ideas. To build a connection with your audience, Maxwell suggests you give them your full focus when speaking—pay attention to their needs instead of trying to make yourself or your message appear flawless. People won’t care about your words if they don’t believe you care about _them_.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest you start connecting with your listeners before your presentation begins. As audience members enter the room, talk with a few of them and learn their names. That way, you can address some members of the audience by name during your presentation to make your message more personalized. This may also make your audience feel cared about and thus more willing to listen to you.)

To show the audience that you care, actively put yourself in their shoes: Consider what they feel, think, and desire, and make them feel valued in ways that are important to them. You can do this by interacting with them, expressing your gratitude, or celebrating their accomplishments. Maxwell suggests you make your audience more receptive to you by removing mental and physical barriers. For instance, be friendly and create a comfortable atmosphere so that your audience feels at ease. Or, instead of standing behind a large podium, try sitting by the edge of the stage.

(Shortform note: You may find it easier to put yourself in your audience’s shoes if you first work on developing your empathy, which Daniel Goleman defines as your ability to understand and relate to the emotions of others. In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Goleman says that your empathy level largely depends on how your parents raised you. However, other experts say you can still improve your empathy in numerous ways, like by reading fiction, exploring diverse media, and challenging your assumptions when you make automatic judgments.)

When you focus on your audience and make them feel good, you make a positive first impression, Maxwell writes. When your audience feels positively about you, they will naturally like you more and be more open to your ideas.

(Shortform note: Maxwell’s advice focuses on how to use your attention to make a good impression, but other experts say that you should also use your body language to appear approachable to your audience. In _How to Talk to Anyone_ , Leil Lowndes argues that nonverbal signals play a big part in how people judge you. Before you start speaking, make sure your body’s sending positive signs: Stand up tall and keep your arms at your side with your palms facing up.)

#### Strengthen Your Credibility

To become a compelling speaker, you must **establish your credibility—your trustworthiness and believability.** When audiences view you this way, they’ll take you more seriously and will be more willing to consider your message. Maxwell suggests several ways to make yourself more credible.

**1\. Ensure your message matches your true beliefs.** To be credible in the eyes of others, you must genuinely believe in the message you’re delivering. Learn to understand and accept your authentic self so you can communicate your true beliefs with consistency and sincerity. When you’re confident in your message, you naturally use more powerful language and convey more emotion. When your audience believes your words are sincere, they’ll be more open to listening to you.

**2\. Support your words with your actions**. Follow your own advice before giving it to others. Otherwise, you risk people viewing you as a hypocrite, and they may be less likely to listen to you. For example, if you argue that organization is key to productivity, but you display an obvious lack of organization, your audience won’t be receptive to your message.

**3\. Develop the necessary expertise to speak about your subject.** Maxwell writes that you must first learn, build skills, and become knowledgeable in the area you want to discuss. By dedicating time and effort to becoming competent in your field, people will perceive you as more trustworthy and credible when you present your ideas.

> **An Appeal to Ethos: Use Your Credibility to Be Persuasive**
> 
> While Maxwell suggests you strengthen your credibility by being committed to your message, others recommend you use ethos, or the rhetorical appeal to character, to _demonstrate_ your credibility to your audience. In _Thank You For Arguing_ , Jay Heinrichs explains that a strong ethos is essential for establishing your audience’s mood and making them open to listening to you. Let’s compare his suggestions on how to use ethos to _appear_ more credible with Maxwell’s suggestions on how to _become_ more credible.
> 
> **1\. Your message and your beliefs.** Maxwell advises you to be your authentic self to establish credibility, but Heinrichs suggests that you should focus, instead, on reflecting your _audience’s_ beliefs, values, and appearance. He claims that your audience will trust and like you more if they see you as similar to them.
> 
> **2\. Your actions and your words.** Maxwell says that you must back your words with actions to be more credible, but Heinrichs says that audiences tend to be skeptical of speakers who seem _too_ sure of their message. Instead, he suggests you add a level of disinterest or hesitation to your message. For instance, you might discuss how you were eager to never read another book after finishing your education, but that you’ve now taken it up again because of overwhelming evidence that it’s so beneficial. Disinterest makes your audience think that you’re concerned about what’s best for them, writes Heinrichs.
> 
> **3\. Your expertise.** Heinrichs agrees with Maxwell that a key component of ethos is to demonstrate your expertise. He offers more specific tips on how to do this during your presentation: Share examples of how you tackled a problem with an unconventional method that a beginner would never think of and, as a result, achieved great success. Your audience then has the impression that you notice things others don’t notice because you know your topic so well.

#### Be a Lifelong Learner

Many of us assume that good communicators simply have a natural gift. Maxwell argues, however, that this isn’t true: **Speaking well in front of an audience requires dedicated practice, and you must treat it as a lifelong learning endeavor.** Effective speakers know that there are always better ways to connect with their audiences and deliver more engaging messages.

(Shortform note: In _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth advises you to hone a skill like communication through _deliberate practice_. This process requires you to set a stretch goal—one specific, challenging aspect of your main goal to focus on improving—and to give that goal your full attention. For example, your goal might be to give a presentation without using filler words. As you pursue that goal, ask for and reflect on feedback until you’ve reached your goal. Then, set a new stretch goal. This form of practice is goal-oriented and challenges you to go beyond your current skill levels, unlike undirected learning.)

To continually learn and improve your communication skills, Maxwell offers two tips:

**1\. Learn from others.** Good communication takes time and experience. By watching other speakers, you can learn from their experiences and gain new ideas more quickly than if you practice your speaking skills through trial and error alone. Make use of a variety of resources—attend a TED Talk, watch YouTube videos, or read transcripts of historical speeches, for instance.

(Shortform note: Make sure that learning from other speakers doesn’t turn into an excuse to stay inside your comfort zone. In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young argues that the best way to strengthen a skill is by practicing that skill in similar situations in which you plan on using it. To take it one step further, you could even try practicing your skill in a high-stakes environment. The added pressure helps you absorb what you’ve learned on a deeper level. For example, if you’re training to be a teacher, you can improve your lecturing abilities by making guest presentations in front of real classes.)

**2\. Grow your knowledge.** Maxwell suggests you continually research new topics and try new experiences to gain fresh perspectives and ideas that you can speak about. Collect quotes, stories, facts, and other information that resonate with you in your daily life. This ensures you have a well of good content that you can draw upon when needed.

(Shortform note: In _Big Magic_ , Elizabeth Gilbert proposes a mindset that may help you grow your knowledge: View every occurrence in your life (such as coincidences, dreams, or interesting things you hear people say) as a clue left by “big magic”—the creative energy of the world. If you view your world as full of creative clues, you’ll naturally be inspired by more facts, quotes, or stories and find it easier to grow your knowledge. For instance, you might see a billboard with a message that inspires you for an upcoming presentation.)

### Part 2: How to Prepare For Your Presentation

Now that you know the three characteristics of an effective speaker, let’s discuss how you can prepare for your presentation and create a strong message. According to Maxwell, even experienced speakers prepare extensively before speaking in front of an audience. Being well-prepared not only improves your ability to connect with and bring value to your audience, but it also helps you develop your communication skills as you reflect on your ideas and plan your approach. Maxwell presents several ways to create a compelling message and prepare for your presentation.

(Shortform note: What does it mean to be well-prepared? Some experts argue that you should know your script “cold”—that is, to know it like the back of your hand. When you deeply familiarize yourself with your presentation, you’ll not only have the opportunity to enhance your communication skills through practice, but you’ll sound more natural and be able to better connect with your audience. To know your script “cold,” craft your presentation at least four to six weeks beforehand and spend some time each day memorizing part of it. Memorize your presentation in random sections so you won’t get derailed if you forget a line.)

#### Team Up With Others

Maxwell suggests you **gather a team of people to help you brainstorm ideas for your message and prepare for your presentation.** He recommends finding people who are open to new ideas, are flexible when tackling problems, and believe that there are many different ways to solve a problem. Maxwell argues that groups often come up with better ideas than individuals. When you brainstorm by yourself, you can only work from a single perspective. When you collaborate with others, you have access to diverse experiences and insights, which can help you recognize blind spots in your thinking.

(Shortform note: Maxwell seems to imply that any group is composed of people with diverse experiences and insights, but this isn't always the case. In _Rebel Ideas_ , Matthew Syed writes that some groups are _homogenous_ in that members think similarly and therefore don't bring fresh perspectives. Not only that, but members of homogenous groups tend to reinforce one another’s viewpoints, which makes them overconfident about flawed ideas. It might therefore be a good idea to ensure your team is cognitively diverse. To assemble a group with cognitive diversity, Syed suggests you find competent people who have many different perspectives and thought processes so you can avoid collective blindspots and generate innovative ideas.)

When brainstorming, encourage people to come up with as many ideas as they can. Maxwell argues that there are no bad ideas—every thought can be a springboard for greater ideas. You can also have your team ask you challenging questions so you can identify and address potential flaws in your arguments from the beginning.

For example, if you want to speak about the value of lifelong reading, gather a team of people to help you brainstorm ideas related to your topic, such as the benefits of lifelong reading that may be relevant to your audience. Team members might have unique perspectives to offer: A person who grew up in a different country might share how their culture approaches and values reading, while someone who has struggled with mental illness might share how reading comforted them during difficult times.

(Shortform note: In _Tools of Titans_ , Tim Ferriss echoes Maxwell’s suggestion to generate a lot of ideas, adding that you can do so by asking basic or “dumb” questions—for example, “Why do kids hate to read?” Although Maxwell argues that there are no bad ideas, you’ll still need to decide which ideas are the best to use for your presentation. To do this, Ferriss suggests you stress-test your ideas. Ask your team to poke holes in each proposed idea. If an idea holds up to the rigorous scrutiny and attack, you can feel confident that it’s one you can use.)

#### Identify Your Natural Strengths

Before you write your message, it may be helpful to**identify your natural speaking strengths so you can build them into your presentation.** While learning from other speakers can give you techniques and methods to experiment with, you should write your message in your own voice. If you try to take an approach that doesn’t come naturally to you, like revealing a personal story that you’re not comfortable sharing, you risk losing your connection with your audience.

(Shortform note: While you may _write_ your message in your own voice, if you’re anxious about public speaking, you may find it difficult to express yourself with authenticity once you’re on stage. In _Talk Like Ted_ , Carmine Gallo argues that to overcome your anxiety and uncover your natural strengths, you must force yourself to practice public speaking. The more you succeed in delivering your message, the more confident you’ll become. You’ll also find it easier to be authentic and use your strengths to your advantage.)

Maxwell writes that there are four primary strengths you can leverage. Identify which ones come most naturally to you and emphasize them in your presentation:

**1\. Sincerity:** You communicate with authenticity and vulnerability. This might mean sharing stories of your personal struggles and expressing your true emotions. When you open yourself to your audience, they’ll find it easier to trust you.

(Shortform note: Authenticity and vulnerability don’t come naturally to many people. In _The Power of Vulnerability_ , Brené Brown explains that people often struggle to express their true selves because they feel pressure to fit in. If you want to be more sincere and show more of your authentic self to your audience, consider creating a mantra—a short statement that reminds you to be authentic that you can repeat to yourself before stressful situations like your presentation.)

**2\. Humor** : If you’re naturally funny, try incorporating jokes into your message. Laughter increases feelings of intimacy in your audience and makes them more receptive to your words.

(Shortform note: Some experts recommend using humor in specific places in your presentation. For instance, telling a joke at the beginning of your presentation either makes your audience laugh or alerts you to prepare for a tough audience. You can also use humor to smooth over mistakes or transition out of a difficult topic to help yourself and the audience relax.)

**3\. Helpfulness** : If you’re motivated to help people, focus on offering more practical advice. People appreciate and think more highly of you when you give them the tools to improve their lives.

(Shortform note: Helping others not only makes your audience happy, but it makes you happy too. Some evidence suggests that your brain releases chemicals like dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin when you help others, which elevate your mood and make you feel more connected with people. Helping others can also boost your self-esteem, reduce stress, and help you live longer than people who don’t. These mood-boosting effects may be a good reason to incorporate helpful advice into _any_ presentation: Doing so can make you more connected with your audience and feel less stressed, helping you deliver a better presentation overall.)

**4\. Inspiration** : If you tend to see the best in others, you can use your words to inspire them. When you help others envision a better life and show them that it’s achievable, they’ll feel better about themselves and be more willing to hear what you have to say.

(Shortform note: Believing in others not only helps them feel like their goals are attainable, but it makes them more likely to achieve them. In _Give and Take_ , Adam Grant refers to this as the _Pygmalion effect_ : People perform better when others have higher expectations for them. As this psychological phenomenon suggests, simply expecting your audience to take your message to heart and change their lives for the better may inspire them to do so.)

#### Write Your Message

Once you've prepared for your presentation with your team and identified your strengths, **write your ideas into a clear and engaging message** that will make a lasting impression. Maxwell describes several steps for turning your research and preparation into a memorable message:

**1\. Develop your thesis.** This should be a single sentence that sums up your message. Maxwell writes that you must clarify your thesis before communicating anything—if you don’t know your thesis, your audience will have an even harder time understanding it.

(Shortform note: Once you have an idea of what your thesis is, refine it by considering four criteria: clarity, coherence, consistency, and credibility. To improve clarity, replace or remove confusing or vague words from your thesis statement. To check for coherence, evaluate whether your thesis clearly connects to the main points you wish to present. To have consistency, adjust your thesis to match the purpose and tone of your presentation. And lastly, to ensure credibility, assess whether you have the evidence to back up your thesis statement.)

**2\. Research and plan out your talking points.** Create a basic outline of your main points and gather supporting material such as data, stories, and ideas. Maxwell recommends you experiment with ways to organize your main points so that the audience sees how they’re all connected: Consider numbering them, arranging them in an acrostic (a word that has each of its letters spelling out a new word or sentence), or using a common word in each of your major points. Once you have your basic organization, you can then sort the supporting material you’ve gathered under the relevant points.

(Shortform note: In _Talk Like Ted_ , Carmine Gallo recommends you use a message map to plan out your presentation. This one-page template helps you visualize and structure your content in a way that’s clear and easy for your audience to follow. To create a message map, first draw an oval at the top of a piece of paper and write down the main point of your presentation as a concise headline. Then, draw three arrows extending from your main point and write your sub-points beneath the arrows. Under each sub-point, jot down supporting information such as stories or quotes. According to Gallo, you should include no more than three sub-points because the human brain can only process three ideas at once.)

**3.** **Plan your transitions.** Once you have your main points in order, plan out how you can shift smoothly from one point to the next. At the start of your presentation, don’t just jump into your thesis, but find a way to lead into it. Consider using a quote, telling a story, asking a question, or simply taking time to connect with the audience. As you progress through your presentation, Maxwell suggests using various cues to indicate when you’re transitioning to a new point. Make a note to pause, walk to a different spot in the room, change your facial expressions, or vary the volume, speed, or tone with which you speak.

(Shortform note: Other experts explain the importance of transitions: They help your audience relax and focus on your message. Unlike when reading, people can't go back and review the previous points you made in your speech. If you don't signal topic changes with transitions, your listeners will focus more on keeping up with you than truly listening to what you have to say. Eventually, they may get tired of trying to follow along and stop listening. If instead, audiences sense that your presentation is well-structured, they can relax, trust that you’ll effectively guide them through your points, and become more attentive to your message.)

##### Engage Your Audience With Visuals and Stories

When creating your message, Maxwell suggests you **use visual imagery and storytelling to keep your audience engaged as you speak**. These strategies make it easier for your audience to grasp your arguments and remember them.

First, incorporate visuals into your presentation. You can use body language, metaphors, or actual visual aids like physical props and imagery to help illustrate your ideas. Maxwell explains that people remember images better than words and that most people are visual learners.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that you should engage multiple senses in addition to vision. In _Talk Like Ted_ , Carmine Gallo argues that activating multiple senses makes a presentation more memorable to audiences than engaging just one of their senses. He suggests you aim to engage your audience’s hearing and touch as well. To engage their hearing, consider incorporating other voices apart from your own by playing a video or having a guest speak. To engage their touch, if you don’t have anything physical to pass around, ask your audience to imagine what something feels like, such as the tickle of a grassy field.)

Second, Maxwell suggests you tell the audience a story to make your points more accessible and engaging. He explains that people remember stories because we naturally use stories to make sense of our lives. You can tell stories from your personal life or share the stories of others, but make sure that they’re relevant to your audience and the points you’re trying to make.

(Shortform note: In _How Highly Effective People Speak_ , Peter D. Andrei specifically recommends telling a story about a single person. This allows audience members to better imagine themselves in the person’s shoes, which engages them emotionally. After you share a story about one person, you can then explore the broader implications of your topic, like how it affects your audience. For example, if you’re discussing the importance of mental health among college students, you could talk about the struggles of a single student before introducing statistics about how prevalent the issue is.)

##### Simplify Your Message

When writing your message, Maxwell recommends you simplify your ideas to be **clear, concise, and memorable so that your audience can better understand and remember them.**

First, to simplify your message, use language that an eighth grader can understand, and trim excess information that might distract from your main points.**** Many speakers are afraid of being simplistic, but Maxwell argues that simple doesn't mean you're watering down your ideas or glossing over complex topics. Instead, simple means making your content practical and easy for your audience to understand rather than trying to sound impressive.

> **Additional Tips on Simplifying Your Message**
> 
> Other experts agree that being simple is key to making an effective presentation. In _The Bezos Blueprint_ , Carmine Gallo shares additional tips on how to simplify your message.
> 
> **Use simple words and sentences.** Gallo recommends you choose words of Anglo-Saxon origin over those of Latin or Greek origin because Anglo-Saxon words tend to be shorter and more direct—for example, use “help” instead of “facilitate.”
> 
> **Use active language.** Gallo suggests you write your speech in an active voice rather than passive because active language tends to be more concise and assertive. For example, you should say: “People should give compliments more often” rather than “Compliments should be given more often.”
> 
> **Avoid hedging and qualifying language.** Gallo suggests you not only cut unnecessary information as Maxwell suggests, but he also advises you to eliminate hedge words and qualifiers. These are words or phrases that soften your statements, making them sound more hesitant. For example, instead of saying, “In general, our product was rather successful,” you should say, “Our product was successful.”

Second, make your message memorable by coming up with unique and catchy phrases. Try putting a spin on well-known sayings, such as changing "Practice makes perfect” to “Practice makes character.”

(Shortform note: Daniel Pink suggests another way to make your message memorable: Boil your message down to a single word. When people associate a single word with your message, anytime they hear that word, they’ll be reminded of your presentation.)

### Part 3: How to Deliver Your Message

Now that you know how to prepare and create your message, let’s shift our focus to speaking in front of an audience. Maxwell offers suggestions on how to connect with your audience, maintain their attention, and make a lasting impression.

#### Believe in Yourself and Your Audience

According to Maxwell, your mindset, energy, and feelings affect how your audience receives you and your message. **The more you believe in yourself and your speaking ability, the more your audience will.** To be a more powerful communicator, Maxwell encourages you to adopt two beliefs:

**1\. Believe in your ability to communicate.** Your self-confidence affects how you perform in front of an audience. If you show that you’re nervous, your audience will be more concerned about you than your message. Maxwell suggests you start small and develop a mantra: a short affirming statement to remind yourself that you’re able to communicate well and make a difference with your words.

(Shortform note: If public speaking makes you nervous, it can be hard to feel confident by stating mantras and affirming statements alone. In _The Charisma Myth_ , Olivia Fox Cabane suggests you practice visualization and powerful body language to change your mental state and make you feel more confident. When you feel anxious, imagine that you’re being hugged. This releases chemicals in your brain that help calm your nerves. To feel more confident, stand tall and puff out your chest. As this posture becomes a habit, you’ll naturally feel more confident.)

**2\. Believe you can help your audience.** When you believe your message can positively impact people’s lives, your audience will sense your passion and become more excited about your ideas. Maxwell also suggests believing that your audience _wants_ to learn from you. If you approach your speech with the mindset that people are eager to listen, your words will be more encouraging. On the other hand, if you doubt anyone’s interested in what you have to say, your words may lack conviction and be less persuasive.

(Shortform note: In _Talk Like TED_ , Carmine Gallo offers some evidence that may help you believe that your audience truly is eager to learn from you and that your message will have a positive impact on them: The human brain is wired to love learning. When we learn new things, our brains release a chemical that makes us feel good. When you present information to your audience, they’ll associate their positive feelings with you and be more engaged as you speak.)

#### Read the Room and Adapt

As we discussed earlier, preparation is essential to communicating your message to an audience. However, this doesn’t mean sticking rigidly to a script. Situations change and unexpected obstacles arise. To communicate well, you must**measure how the audience is responding to you and adapt on the spot to engage audiences that are indifferent or distracted.**

(Shortform note: Experts suggest you look for three things when measuring your audience’s response to you: attentiveness, engagement, and sentiment. First, check how attentive your audience is by looking for signs of boredom or distraction (yawning, multitasking, moving around). Next, look for signs of engagement (asking questions or taking notes). Lastly, get a sense of how your audience is feeling—whether they’re enjoying the presentation (smiling or sitting relaxed) or unhappy (rolling their eyes or sighing). If these signs indicate that you’re losing your audience, consider adapting by asking an open-ended question to get them involved or offering them a quick break.)

Before you’re scheduled to speak, Maxwell recommends you get a better sense of how your audience might respond to you by inspecting the location ahead of time and considering the type of event you’re speaking at. Look at factors such as lighting, sound, the location of projector screens, and the overall setup and size of the room. This allows you to rearrange or correct anything or, at the very least, get clues as to whether the audience will be comfortable and engaged or reluctant and unresponsive.

(Shortform note: Some experts offer suggestions on how precisely to assess and change your speaking environment before your presentation. If you have the choice, arrange the room so that audience members are seated as closely together as possible while still being comfortable. This helps you form a closer connection with your audience. Additionally, try to give your presentation at a distance from distracting areas of the room, such as doors or windows, as outside movement may distract your audience.)

If, during your talk, you read the room and notice that the audience is unengaged, here are a few suggestions on how to recapture their attention on the fly:

**1\. Interact with the audience.** Get the audience to interact by asking questions that require them to shout out answers or raise their hands. You can also encourage them to say or share something with a neighbor.

(Shortform note: If you have an audience that seems too shy to raise hands or hesitant to interact, you can use technology to allow people to engage more anonymously. Consider using a live polling tool that allows audience members to respond to questions on their phones or laptops. You can even create a hashtag for your presentation on Twitter and broadcast your audience member’s tweets at strategic moments in your presentation.)

**2\. Do something unexpected.** If you notice your audience is losing interest, Maxwell suggests you be spontaneous and do something that the audience didn’t anticipate to grab their attention. For example, you could bring your pet or young child on stage if they inspired one of your ideas.

(Shortform note: According to Carmine Gallo in _Talk Like Ted_ , when you do something your audience doesn’t expect, you increase the magnitude of their emotional response. When people’s emotions are heightened, they pay attention to things more and form stronger memories of the experience. This is because their brains release a chemical called dopamine which creates pleasurable feelings and also improves the brain’s ability to process information.)

**3\. Use pauses strategically.** Pauses can help emphasize your point and give audience members time to process your message. You can also pause to recapture people’s attention. When you stop talking, people naturally return their focus to you as they wonder what caused the sudden silence.

(Shortform note: While Maxwell suggests you incorporate more pauses into your presentation, some experts suggest there are times when pauses work against you: Pausing for too long after you’ve been asked a question can make you seem insincere. They recommend that, apart from questions that are clearly difficult, you should try to fill the silence following a question immediately. If you’re not sure of the answer, buy time by repeating the question, asking for clarification, or even resorting to some filler phrases. However, don’t let this fact scare you away from answering questions from your audience. Trust in your preparation and compose some backup phrases to say beforehand.)

#### Inspire People to Take Action

Maxwell writes that**the ultimate goal of a speaker is for your audience to take action after hearing your message.** Speaking to people doesn’t _directly_ change their lives—your words must drive them to make a change. Maxwell recommends several ways you can convince your audience to take action:

(Shortform note: While Maxwell argues that persuading people to take action is the ultimate goal of public speaking, other experts discuss some other goals you might have when talking in front of an audience. You might be delivering an explanatory speech, where your goal is to simply teach or explain something to your audience. In that case, you should focus on clarity and on translating difficult concepts into layman’s terms. You might also be delivering an imaginative speech, where your goal is to delight people, for instance, with an art project or an invention. Instead of getting people to act, you may be more motivated to create an enjoyable experience for your audience.)

**1\. Tell personal stories.** Encourage people to take action by sharing stories about how _you_ acted upon your advice. Your personal stories can act as proof of how your message works in real life. For example, if you tell your audience to meditate for an hour every day and explain how you came up with your lucrative business idea during one of your meditative sessions, people will be more motivated to heed your advice.

(Shortform note: Researchers analyzed what made TED Talks popular and found that personal stories made up 65% of the content of the most viral presentations. Their research also supports Maxwell’s argument that personal stories spark action: In his TED Talk about the injustices of the criminal justice system, Bryan Stevenson incorporated stories about the lessons he’d learned from a courtroom janitor, activist Rosa Parks, and his grandmother. His TED Talk motivated the audience to donate $1 million to his non-profit organization.)

**2\. Help them visualize the positive change.** Paint a picture of what their lives will look like if they act on your message. This gives your audience a glimpse of how they might feel if they take your advice and motivate them to take action.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that visualization is more effective when people visualize the steps needed to reach their goal rather than visualizing themselves achieving the goal itself. People who picture themselves accomplishing their goals often become _less_ motivated to take action because their brains believe that they’ve already succeeded. Instead of painting a picture of an end result, then, it might be better to help your audience visualize the steps toward that end result.)

**3\. Show them the first step.** Maxwell suggests you make it clear how audience members can take the first step, whether it’s practicing better financial habits or improving their relationships. If you only provide the end result, people can feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to reach it. Encouraging people to take the first step is important, Maxwell argues, because action breeds confidence, which empowers people to take further action to improve themselves and their lives.

(Shortform note: In _Eat That Frog!_ , Brian Tracy explains why it helps your audience to show them the first step toward a larger goal: Humans have a need for closure. When you complete something, your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good. If you present your audience with a daunting end goal that takes time (like becoming a masterful communicator, for instance), they may gradually feel discouraged by a lack of achievement. Instead, by breaking the journey up with milestones—for example, having your first meetup with your team to discuss your message—you give people more opportunities to feel a sense of progress.)
