## Part 2: Stages 1 and 2

So far, we’ve explained the “what” and “how” of tribes and tribal leadership. In Part 2, we’ll discuss Stages 1 and 2. For each in turn, we’ll characterize the stage, describe its three key markers, and explain how the authors recommend coaching individuals to the next stage. Last, we’ll describe the indications of a successful stage transition.

### Stage 1: A Dog-Eat-Dog World

The authors explain that at Stage 1, individuals see the world as a harsh dog-eat-dog environment. Their lives are generally cruel and punishing, and they become both miserable and tough.

**For the individual at Stage 1, things have never been easy**. He likely grew up in poverty and was exposed to crime early in life. That early exposure kicks off a downward spiral that often leads to gang membership or a life of crime. Struggling with the practical and psychological hardships of poverty, he comes to see life as fundamentally unfair. In turn, according to the authors, he realizes that values are worthless—instead, he should do what it takes to survive, regardless of the rules.

Since he lacks experience fitting in with “proper” society, he’ll struggle to hold down a job—you’ll rarely see Stage 1 individuals in the workplace. In fact, the authors say that they make up just 2% of the workforce. Because of this, Stage 1 _group culture_ seldom exists outside of gangs; thus, the authors’ description focuses primarily on Stage 1 _individuals_.

> **Spiral Dynamics’ “Beige” Level**
> 
> _Tribal Leadership_ ’s Stage 1 corresponds to the “beige” level or “value meme” from _Spiral Dynamics_. At beige, a person’s primary concern is survival, and he lives largely from instinct. In general, he aims to meet his physiological needs—food, water, shelter, sex—and has little thought of self-development.
> 
> Critically, the authors of _Spiral Dynamics_ emphasize that no level is “right” or “wrong.” Instead, they simply exist. In this sense, there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with people at Stage 1—they’re simply operating in a way that meets their immediate needs and keeps them alive.
> 
> Maslow’s hierarchy of needs also sheds light on Stage 1. Maslow suggests that if meeting your physiological needs is a constant daily quest, you simply can’t concern yourself with “higher” activities, such as personal or spiritual development. When living in the cycle of poverty, things such as food, water, and shelter are daily concerns—so it only makes sense that Stage 1 individuals feel unable to imagine that life could be bright, open, and full of potential.

#### Three Key Markers of Stage 1

As we explained in Part 1, each stage has three markers: a view of values, a way of speaking, and a relationship style. According to the authors, Stage 1’s markers are as follows:

  * **Marker #1: Values are meaningless.** To people at Stage 1, values hold little sway. Stage 1 individuals view anything positive as fake or fraudulent, and they view values as lies to keep people disadvantaged and weak. Since values are lies and the system is broken, Stage 1 individuals take an anything-goes attitude to survive—cheating, violence, and crime are fair play. In addition, the lack of values causes many Stage 1 individuals to give in to their vices. Given such hard lives, drugs or alcohol provide a temporary escape from a hellish world.
  * **Marker #2: Language centers around the idea that life is _fundamentally unfair_** —that the game is rigged. In fact, the only real view is that life is actually awful—unjust and cruel. Given that, you have to do whatever it takes to make it through. 
  * **Marker #3: Relationships are strained or broken.** At Stage 1, many individuals are alienated from friends, family, and work relationships. Their anything-goes behavior and recourse to addictive vices means that they often break down or cause problems. For individuals at higher stages, such behavior is often too much to deal with—so the Stage 1 individual easily loses friends and work.



Where relationships do form, Stage 1 individuals form Stage 1 tribes—which, most often, are gangs or prison cliques, the authors say. In such groups, individuals have an intense loyalty to the tribe, yet they struggle to form real relationships due to the hostile and alienating environment. Additionally, these tribes tend to commiserate and reinforce the Stage 1 attitude that life fundamentally sucks.

> **The “Faustian” Value Meme**
> 
> In _The Listening Society_ , Hanzi Freinacht builds on the Spiral Dynamics model by distinguishing four dimensions of each stage: Cognitive complexity, symbolic world or worldview, psychological depth, and states of being. These four dimensions can vary in their level of development at each stage, allowing for a more nuanced view of the individual.
> 
> Freinacht’s “Faustian” value meme corresponds roughly with _Tribal Leadership_ ’s Stage 1. At the Faustian value meme, people operate according to “might makes right”—that is, those who can dominate with physical violence are in charge. Survival is still a main concern, and historical societies at this stage—such as the Vikings—spent time farming and time pillaging. As the authors of _Tribal Leadership_ say of gangs, the ethics is honor-based. You must maintain your honor, even if that means doing violence or killing.
> 
> One shortcoming of the _Tribal Leadership_ model is that it suggests that people at Stage 1 are incapable of forming meaningful relationships. In contrast, Freinacht suggests that at any stage, you can develop “depth”—a quality of emotional maturity that lends itself to forming healthy relationships. So, even under adverse conditions, people can learn from painful experiences and find ways to help one another. For instance, prisoners trapped in Nazi concentration camps bonded and cooperated as a survival mechanism and as a way to preserve their humanity.

#### Paths to Stage 2: Overcome Despair

The authors explain that a tribal leader can coach an individual from Stage 1 to Stage 2 using the two core coaching opportunities:

  * **Opportunity #1: Adopt Stage 2 language.** Encourage the Stage 1 individual to use Stage 2 language, which acknowledges that life works out for some people. In time, he’ll recognize that life isn’t universally awful, though he’ll still believe that _his_ life sucks. According to the authors, this is progress.
  * **Opportunity #2: Build relationships with a higher-stage tribe.** While transitioning to Stage 2, the Stage 1 individual is at risk of spiraling downward due to a lack of support. Encourage him to build relationships with a higher-stage tribe, such as a Stage 2 workplace tribe. 



**When coaching Stage 1 individuals, always listen and empathize**.**** According to the authors, they often feel discarded and abandoned by society. Expect some hostility and defensiveness, and understand that such individuals are unused to receiving genuine care or help. In addition, emphasize that in every moment, we all have the choice to change our lives.

> **Develop a Coaching Habit**
> 
> The authors don’t explain in-depth how to coach your team members. For a reliable method, consider Michael Stanier’s advice in _The Coaching Habit_ : Develop a simple daily habit of coaching your team members, and in that way help them to level up.
> 
> Specifically, Stanier recommends _asking good questions_ and _listening more than you speak_. By listening, you get to know your team members and help them feel heard and respected. By asking good, informal questions, you can help them develop and avoid coming off as overbearing or intrusive. Stanier offers seven questions that open and progress a conversation, and three of them apply best to Stage 1:
> 
>   * **“What’s on your mind?”** —This gently opens the conversation.
> 
>   * **“Anything else?”** —This encourages people to say things that might be difficult to say.
> 
>   * **“How can I support you?”** —This communicates that you hear, see, and want to help this person.
> 
> 

> 
> By using these questions well, you can build a relationship with a Stage 1 individual who’s likely never had support, and you can guide him to a healthier way of living.

According to the authors, three changes mark a successful shift from Stage 1 to Stage 2:

  * **Change #1: Shifting language.** The Stage 1 individual stops expressing that life is fundamentally unfair, and he starts to say that _his_ life specifically is bad. This reflects his changing attitude that life can work out for _some_ people, and he might express envy about others’ skills, privileges, and social lives.
  * **Change #2:** **Tired resignation.** While this might look like a step backward, the authors explain that the Stage 1 individual often “deflates,” becoming less angry and more passively tired, when he reaches Stage 2. In fact, this is progress: It reflects that he now sees that life can work out, and he is unhappy that his life so far has not.
  * **Change #3: Social shifts.** When he moves toward Stage 2, the Stage 1 individual leaves behind relationships with people at Stage 1. This helps him to drop Stage 1 behaviors and adopt new Stage 2 behaviors.



> **Keep Your Models Updated**
> 
> Above, the authors describe a specific sequence of changes that describe a standard shift from Stage 1 to Stage 2, regardless of the individual. However, note that like any model, developmental stage models have limitations. As Shane Parrish and Rhiannon Beaubien explain in _The Great Mental Models Volume 1,_ reality is complex and constantly changing, while models are static and can become outdated.
> 
> Given this, note that the authors of _Tribal Leadership_ provide only anecdotal evidence for the shifts they describe. However, anecdotes don’t necessarily prove that everyone will experience these stage changes in the same ways. According to Parrish and Beaubien, we need to constantly update our models according to what actually happens. To do so, start with the insights from _Tribal Leadership_ , put them into action, and update your understanding based on what you experience. You might discover that people develop in various ways, and you’ll come to see each stage with more nuance.

### Stage 2: Resigned Mediocrity

At Stage 2, an apathetic and disinterested mood prevails. According to the authors, Stage 2 _individuals_ are typically passive, disinterested, and disconnected from their work. Because of this, they rarely produce creative ideas or innovate solutions to tough problems. Further, Stage 2 individuals avoid accountability: When a few good ideas _do_ arise, people rarely get around to executing them.

**Stage 2 individuals allow their circumstances to define them** , and they often fixate on a tangible problem that supposedly prevents them from improving. For example, they might complain that the budget is too small, they lack enough time, or that there’s a bad apple spoiling the bunch. However, the authors explain that resolving Stage 2’s problems won’t fix the complaints because Stage 2 individuals have committed to feeling trapped by their circumstances, and they’ll constantly look for more reasons to complain.

**Stage 2 _cultures_ are common at public-facing government offices such as the post office and among low-ladder workplaces like chain retail stores**. These jobs, the authors say, give employees little creative license or autonomy, and higher-ups generally treat the employees as replaceable. This causes Stage 2 workers to experience work as a dehumanizing daily grind. Given this demotivating experience, Stage 2 tribes survive by bemoaning their circumstances and working for the weekends.

> **Robert Kegan’s Developmental Stages**
> 
> Stage 2 of _Tribal Leadership_ corresponds to Robert Kegan’s model of ethical, social, and cognitive development. For clarity, we’ll refer to it as “the communal mode” when comparing it to _Tribal Leadership_ ’s Stage 2 throughout this section.
> 
> Stage 2 exists in the communal mode: Individually, people understand themselves based on how others see them. Collectively, everyone follows the group’s norms while avoiding taboos. People form reciprocal relationships, giving and taking more or less equally, and people generally empathize with each other by default.
> 
> Since group norms are paramount, people in a Stage 2 office show solidarity when someone complains about work. (Think how uncommon it is that someone would rebuke another who prompts him to agree about “how crappy work is.”) Adding Kegan’s model illuminates why Stage 2 cultures perpetuate a low bar of mediocrity—in the communal mode, it’s very difficult to break the status quo. Doing so would mean losing many of your relationships and being ostracized.

#### Three Key Markers of Stage 2

The authors explain that like Stage 1, Stage 2 has three key markers: a view of values, shared language habits, and a characteristic relationship style, as follows:

**Marker #1: Apathetic disregard for values.** Since Stage 2 individuals let their circumstances define them, they have little integrity. According to the authors, they feel that values have failed them in the past and are therefore worthless.

Often, this happens because management introduces “values” to the workplace in a heavy-handed way. For instance, many organizations pay lip service to values, printing them out and producing the trappings of a values-driven workplace. At the same time, the higher-ups ignore their supposed values and treat employees like cogs in a machine. As the authors explain, this makes**** employees feel used and unvalued, and it reinforces the notion that “values” are simply a meaningless corporate ploy.

(Shortform note: Another reason values often fail is that top-down plans don’t account for the actual boots-on-the-ground situation. Put another way, planned values reflect leadership’s ideas, but they might completely miss how employees actually feel or behave on a day-to-day basis. This disconnect between espoused values and how people actually behave causes people to doubt the values. To counteract this, support the people who _do_ live your company’s values and don’t be afraid to let go of those who don’t.)

**Marker #2: Commiserating language.** A Stage 2 tribe acts as an echo chamber for complaints about the workplace. Tribe members fixate on how the higher-ups mistreat them and on similar gripes: the oppressive “system,” getting a bad start in life, or lacking the skills to move up. According to the authors, this commiseration reinforces the tribe’s passive, disinterested mood.

In addition, Stage 2 tribes trash talk their bosses, as in the cartoon “Dilbert,” which captures the relationship between Stage 2 tribes and their “evil bosses.” These bosses treat employees callously, and that reinforces the unmotivated, unhappy Stage 2 atmosphere.

(Shortform note: Psychologists have studied the science of commiseration, which they refer to as co-rumination: problem-focused talk that rehashes and dwells on problems without seeking solutions. While we commonly believe that venting anger over workplace stresses is healthy, research has found that it leads to increased cortisol, a hormone related to stress, and that dwelling on negative thoughts increases your risk of mental illness. Instead of commiserating, find ways to point out the positives and focus on problem-solving rather than griping.)

**Marker #3: Tenuous relationships.** Since Stage 2 tribes subsist on commiseration, tribe members form tenuous relationships. Without something deeper to unite people, such as meaningful and inspiring work, these relationships don’t grow beyond the shallow support offered by mutual disenchantment with work. According to the authors, since no one quite knows each other, a Stage 2 workplace often feels gloomy and tense.

(Shortform note: If you find yourself in an unhappy Stage 2 workplace, there are several options that might help. The _Harvard Business Review_ suggests that you first face how you feel; by experiencing the feeling of unhappiness instead of avoiding it, you can gain clarity on the problem and why you feel that way. Then, face up to whether or not you can change your circumstances. If you can’t, try finding the positives and practice “radical acceptance” of where you are now, for now. Finally, make a plan to either improve your current situation, or find a new one.)

#### Paths to Stage 3: Cultivate Individual Ambition

The authors explain that coaching a Stage 2 individual to Stage 3 centers on sparking her ambition by helping her to see and cultivate her strengths. When she realizes that she can achieve more and become a successful individual, she’ll begin to level up her work and her life.

When coaching individuals to Stage 3, look for those who seem ready to leave Stage 2 behind. Often, these are younger employees who haven’t sunk too deeply into Stage 2’s miserable mire. **Work with one employee at a time and use the authors’ two steps:**

  * **Step #1: Help her recognize her strengths.** To gain her trust and kindle her ambition, give her feedback that highlights her strengths and accomplishments. With a positive tone, encourage her to explore skills that she could develop further, and give her small projects that allow her to exercise these skills. 
  * **Step #2: Encourage her to form relationships with Stage 3 individuals.** To reach Stage 3, she’ll need to learn from Stage 3 individuals. Encourage her to build relationships with Stage 3 individuals who have a propensity to mentor up-and-coming prospects. According to the authors, this helps her to see her own potential and strive upward.



> **Encourage Nonlinear Development**
> 
> While we’ve long operated on the notion of linear career development, Tania Luna of Lifelabs Learning writes in the _Harvard Business Review_ that today, a linear career path doesn’t always make sense. Instead, today’s workers must learn to navigate an unpredictable, ever-changing landscape of opportunities, finding a less direct path to career success and fulfillment.
> 
> So when using _Tribal Leadership_ ’s coaching tactics, help your mentees understand that they don’t necessarily need to pursue a linear career. For young workers without clear career goals, it can be liberating for them to hear that they can instead develop their skills and find a less traditional path to success. In addition, encourage them to develop transferable skills, such as writing or productivity, so they have more options when searching for roles. Last, use “small experiments” to help employees try out new skills and explore areas in which they might want to develop.

Two main changes mark the individual’s transition from Stage 2 to Stage 3, according to the authors:

  * **Change #1: She starts using Stage 3 language.** Instead of expressing that her life sucks, she’ll start to recognize her own potential—and she’ll express that with language like, “I’m awesome,” or “I can do this.”
  * **Change #2: She takes on the Stage 3 attitude.** She’s begun to recognize her abilities and develop her confidence, so the individual will start to feel and express the competitive, ambitious attitude characteristic of Stage 3, often by talking a big game. 



(Shortform note: To further kindle an employee’s ambition, find what motivates them and give frequent feedback. By finding what’s intrinsically motivating to an employee, you can assign her to projects or tasks that excite her the most. And by giving frequent, supportive feedback, you help her clearly see how she’s doing and stay on track.)
