## Part 4: Stages 4 and 5

In Part 4, we’ll describe Stages 4 and 5, the most effective stages that the authors recommend striving toward. As before, we’ll describe Stage 4 and explain the three key markers. We’ll then break down the authors’ discussion of the _three routes_ into Stage 4, as well as the _three key activities_ that stabilize a tribe at Stage 4. To end, we’ll briefly characterize Stage 5, for which the authors include only speculations.

### Stage 4: Unified Teamwork

According to the authors, just under a quarter of the modern workforce operates at Stage 4. At Stage 4, the tribe comes together around shared values and pursues a well-crafted mission. They explicitly recognize themselves as a tribe, and they unify under a strong leader to pursue ambitious goals.

Stage 4 _individuals_ have high energy, enthusiasm for their work, and positive relationships with their peers. They often express gratitude or appreciation for their jobs, and they respect and value effective tribal leaders.

On the collective level, Stage 4 _cultures_ or _tribes_ have much the same characteristics. The tribe cooperates effectively, and tribe members often resolve day-to-day conflicts by remembering their shared values. Leadership and staff respect each other, so they work together effectively and enjoy doing so. Altogether, Stage 4 tribes get more done with less effort, and they do it with a contented enthusiasm you won’t find at earlier stages.

The authors explain that Stage 4 tribes often have mature and creative cultures that attract the best talent, and their teamwork empowers them to innovate and achieve great things. Much like a sports team,**a Stage 4 tribe needs a foe to compete against** —usually an industry competitor. Competition spurs the tribe to innovate, stretch their abilities, and become better.

> **Collaboration Isn’t a Panacea**
> 
> After the challenging natures of Stages 1 through 3, the authors describe Stage 4 with an optimistic, idealized tone. However, even collaborative work cultures have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include those described above—greater employee satisfaction, a happy workplace, and a creative culture. However, the authors don’t provide any quantitative proof of the benefits of Stage 4; on the other hand, recent research shows that overfocus on collaboration lowers productivity in measurable ways. The study found that:
> 
>   * Employees spent around 80% of their time on administrative tasks, such as emails and meetings.
> 
>   * 3% to 5% of collaborators provide upwards of 20% to 35% of the value.
> 
>   * The few employees who contribute the most become overinvolved and begin to cause bottlenecks, wherein work can’t proceed until they’ve contributed. At the same time, they stretch themselves too thin to work effectively.
> 
> 

> 
> To counteract these effects, the researchers suggest identifying two people—the overinvolved “helpers” and the “help requesters”—and encouraging behavioral change that redistributes the workload. For instance, you might encourage helpers to say no to projects that don’t play to their unique strengths, and you might show help requesters how to find what they need elsewhere, such as from other employees who aren’t as known for willingness to help.

#### Three Key Markers of Stage 4

Like the previous stages, Stage 4 has three characteristic markers: its stance toward values, its language, and its relationships.

**Marker #1: A strong and explicit commitment to shared values.** Unlike the previous stages, a Stage 4 tribe develops shared values—the tribe members and leaders discuss and articulate their values together. With values made explicit, the members of a Stage 4 tribe recognize their shared identity, and they begin to see each other as kin and allies.

According to the authors, **an organization dominated by Stage 4 tribes finds creative ways to express and embody their values.** For instance, it might replace cubicles with modern co-working spaces to encourage teamwork. Or it might reimagine how meetings work, allowing anyone from anywhere in the hierarchy to contribute equally to the conversation.

(Shortform note: In addition to their importance to businesses, psychologists recognize values as a key to finding personal well-being. Your “core values” are what you stand for, through thick and thin—such as reliability, passion, or rationality. There are several ways to find your core values, including by using a “values inventory” tool, reflecting on the best and worst experiences you’ve had, and observing your behaviors to find out what drives them.)

**Marker #2: Tribe-centered language.** In a Stage 4 culture, the prevailing mood is one of camaraderie and authenticity, and the language reflects this. Both tribe members and leaders often praise one another, expressing how great it feels to be part of such a strong, collaborative organization. According to the authors, they use “we’re great” language.

(Shortform note: The authors’ description of a Stage 4 tribe evokes the camaraderie of a sports team, wherein the team’s success explicitly depends on how good the team members feel about themselves and each other. In this same vein, some collaborative companies use sports-themed retrospectives to review their work and stay aligned, since sports offer a rich array of team-building exercises and wisdom to draw from.)

**Marker #3: Strong, networked relationships.** In a Stage 4 tribe, individuals form networked relationships—that is, they always interact with at least two other individuals. To the Stage 4 individual, the tribe comes first, so he’s always looking to build strong relationships or introduce people he thinks might work well together. Given this, multi-person networking dominates Stage 4 social occasions, and everyone works to strengthen and expand the tribe’s relationships.

(Shortform note: The McKinsey Institute suggests that successful organizational change often comes from focusing on the informal networks within your company, rather than trying to restructure the various departments and teams of a typical organizational chart. Much like the authors of _Tribal Leadership_ , they argue that these networks—which disregard the boundaries of departments and hierarchies—determine what gets done. Networked relationships help information flow more smoothly between those who need it, and they prevent bottlenecks wherein many subordinates rely on one higher-up who makes the key decisions.)

### How to Create a Stage 4 Tribe

To create a Stage 4 Tribe, the authors explain three strategies. Strategies #1 and #2 apply to building a Stage 4 tribe from scratch, while Strategy #3 works to create a Stage 4 tribe within an existing organization.

**Each strategy hinges on creating a core tribal team that gives rise to the tribe’s culture.** Create this core team from individuals who have “owned” Stage 3, as we explained in Part 3. Having played and gotten their fill of Stage 3, these individuals are ready for the collaboration and teamwork of Stage 4.

**Strategy #1: Bring together like-minded friends.** Get together with a group of like-minded friends—people with whom you share values and a general outlook—and figure out how you could make money. By starting with the friendship and camaraderie of a solid group of friends, you place a strong culture at the foundation of this new organization. And as the authors explain, culture is more important than anything else—so long as the culture is strong, business success will come as a byproduct of that group’s love of working with one another.

(Shortform note: Starting a business with a group of friends has advantages and disadvantages. As the authors explain, it provides a solid basis for strong, amiable relationships. On the flip side, you and your friends might share the same blind spots, especially if you come from similar backgrounds. To counteract this, aim to find recruits who demonstrate different perspectives and skills, and be sure to clearly define the strengths and roles of each co-founding friend you start with.)

**Strategy #2: Grow an alliance within your company.** Within your organization, look for others who sense the need for greater teamwork and collaboration. Help these others through the Stage 4 insights, as we described in Part 3, and build your relationships by speaking to shared values. The authors suggest creating a formal declaration of values and asking aspiring Stage 4 tribe members to commit to those values. This filters out people who lack genuine interest and ensures that aspiring Stage 4 individuals form the core tribal team. With this tribe formed, do your best work and demonstrate the superiority of Stage 4 tribal teamwork.

(Shortform note: For this second strategy, the authors note that a Stage 3 boss can hinder or dismantle Stage 4 efforts. If this occurs, focus on keeping your emotions in check and dealing with the boss in a clearheaded way. Then, identify what kind of bad boss you have and use the right strategy to neutralize the threat. For instance, you might find that your boss is a “tyrant,” in which case giving him some credit for your Stage 4 ideas could assuage his ego and get him on board.)

**Strategy #3: Create a tribe through networking.** By aggressively networking, you can find like-minded people who see the value of Stage 4 teamwork. Look for others who’ve seen the limitations of individual ambition, and bring these people together to build new relationships.

With this strategy, a tribe comes together around a leader who has exceptional people skills. Treat tribe members with respect and warmth, and listen more than you command. This kind of Stage 4 tribe is often flatter than a typical corporate hierarchy, and its business runs on the power of social networks.

(Shortform note: As a real-world example of this third strategy, consider styled shoots, a type of simulated wedding event that gives hairstylists, makeup artists, florists, models, planners, and photographers a chance to collaborate and network. Through these events, the various vendors and artisans build relationships and establish lightweight business networks—for instance, a planner might meet a handful of makeup and hair stylists on whom she can rely for real weddings, too. In this sense, they’re an informal tribe that supports one another in their business efforts.)

### Stabilize the Tribe at Stage 4

According to the authors, a tribe must perform three tasks to stabilize at Stage 4:

  * **Task #1:** Establish shared values and a worthy purpose. 
  * **Task #2:** Create a business strategy based on your values and purpose. 
  * **Task #3:** Expand your network through three-person relationships to strengthen the tribe and spread your purpose.



#### Task #1a: Establish Core Values and a Worthy Purpose

**First, establish shared values and unite under a worthy purpose**. These act as the foundation and the direction of the tribe’s work, respectively. When the tribe has that solid ground to start from and an inspiring purpose to pursue, they come together and become more effective and innovative at work.

If you neglect values, the authors say, your company culture will lack a strong foundation. Think of values as the principles you follow no matter what. Without a set of principles to live by, you might do anything to succeed, such as resorting to unethical business practices that prioritize profit over humanity or meaningful work. (Shortform note: An article in the _Harvard Business Review_ describes values as “guiding principles,” and they say that you must stand for them through fair and foul weather alike. Throughout this section, we’ll compare _Tribal Leadership_ to their model of collaborative culture-building, termed “collective ambition.”)

To create and establish your tribe’s values, use these tactics:

  * **Tactic #1: Involve the whole tribe.** Organize a tribe-wide discussion to figure out what _everyone_ holds dear, not just management. The authors recommend brainstorming with as many tribe members as possible.
  * **Tactic #2: Regularly converse about values.** This encourages tribe members to continue thinking about the values, and they’ll often suggest nuances, clarifications, and corrections to your definitions. Conversing about values also helps the tribe recognize itself, which gives tribe members a palpable sense of belonging. 
  * **Tactic #3: Encourage tribe members to problem-solve with values.** Values give everyone a shared reference point from which to evaluate options and act. With this, tribe members can make decisions without managerial oversight, because they’re acting from values. This makes your team more agile, which matters in highly competitive environments where there’s little time for debating every decision.
  * **Tactic #4: Uphold your values no matter what.** Once you’ve established them, avoid flouting the tribe’s values at any cost. If you do, they lose their power: If leadership isn’t accountable to the values, the whole enterprise will seem hollow and fake. Even when challenging circumstances strain your values, hold fast and uphold them. 
  * **Tactic #5: Hire for values.** To maintain your Stage 4 tribe, the authors recommend hiring according to your values. Do so by asking questions that prompt an interviewee to express his values, or tell a story that contains your values and ask him for the key takeaways. If he sees your values in the story, you’ve found a good match. 



According to the authors, establishing values is not a one-time task to check off a list. Instead, view values**** as essential principles to continually live, refocus, and hold yourself accountable to. Return to them as often as you need to, and develop them over time.

> **Values Form a Core Philosophy**
> 
> In _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins explains that companies that achieve lasting success operate on a core philosophy—the set of values that guide the company through years, even decades, of business. For more ways to find your values and develop a core philosophy, consider Collins’s steps, which reflect and complement _Tribal Leadership_ ’s steps:
> 
>   * Craft your core philosophy with five to seven employees who already exemplify it, as opposed to working with the whole tribe.
> 
>   * Keep it concise. Stating your values plainly and concisely clarifies them for everyone.
> 
>   * Limit yourself to three to six core values. Any more, and it’s no longer an essential core so much as a loose list.
> 
> 

> 
> Collins explains that with a core philosophy established, many top companies create a “cult-like” atmosphere that promotes adherence to those values. Employees who embody the values fit in and find success, while employees who don’t might find themselves asked to leave. While this might seem intense, Collins says that it’s simply part of creating and maintaining a purposeful, values-driven workplace—the benefits, including employee loyalty and commitment to the company’s mission, are well worth it.

#### Task #1b: Unite With a Worthy Purpose

**After establishing shared values, a Stage 4 tribe must find a _worthy purpose_ —the tribe’s North Star, or overriding direction**. The authors say that a worthy purpose should be inspiring and ambitious rather than rational or realistic, since an audacious mission unites people better than an easy, uninspiring aim. There are two methods to create a worthy purpose:****

  * **Method #1: Ask what the tribe works in service of.** Dig past people’s surface-level ambitions and find the deeper, shared ambitions. This helps you strip away profession-specific aims—being a great doctor, being an innovative designer—to more universal aims. For instance, you might find that beneath surface-level aims, your tribe members all want to work toward a saner, kinder world.
  * **Method #2: Ask four key questions**. The authors suggest asking, “What’s working well?” “What’s not working?” “What can we do to make the things that aren’t working work?” “Is there anything else?” These questions prompt the tribe to review their current situation and work out where they want to head next. (Shortform note: These questions follow a common logic for self- or group-review: Reflect on the positives, then the negatives, then figure out what to change. For instance, James Clear uses much the same method for his annual review: He asks, “What went well? What didn’t? What am I working toward?”)



To keep your purpose alive, the authors recommend conducting regular check-ins.**** Tribe members often need to express grievances, rearticulate their values, and recommit to the tribe’s work. Again, use the four key questions: _What’s working, what’s not, how can we do better, anything else?_ This prompts the tribe to reflect on and resolve any outstanding issues, and it allows them to examine and adjust their actions as needed.

> **Starting From Purpose**
> 
> In contrast to the authors’ assertion that _values_ come first and a purpose derives from them, an article in the _Harvard Business Review_ asserts that a company’s purpose comes before all else. They define “purpose” as “your company’s reason for being,” and in their model, it acts as the center of a “compass” that guides a company’s values, strategy, brand, and vision.
> 
> They note also that a purpose need not be the grandest—providing an excellent shopping experience, they say, can be just as meaningful as improving access to essential services, like health care, as long as it authentically represents the company. A purpose should differentiate the company and suggest its values: For instance, a minimalist, sustainable footwear brand might stand for “healthier feet and a healthier planet.”

#### Task #2: Develop A Values-Aligned Strategy

**As you build your tribe, create a business strategy that further unites the tribe.** According to**** the authors, a tribal leader must balance the tribe’s needs and the business’s needs—accounting for human well-being as well as making good business decisions. If you don’t account for both, you risk alienating the tribe or struggling to find business success. So when creating your strategy, always listen to feedback and adjust accordingly. This helps tribe members feel heard and valued.

(Shortform note: In _Good Strategy Bad Strategy_ , Richard Rumelt explains that an effective strategy uses your strengths against an opponent’s weaknesses. With this in mind, consider both the strengths of your tribe and your business’s unique strengths. Taken together, they’ll help you craft a strategy that can direct great power against your obstacles.)

The authors recommend using their three-part approach to business strategy: Develop your strategy by meeting to discuss**** your desired results, your resources, and the actions you’ll need to take.

**Discussion #1: Decide on your desired results.** In a conversation with as much of your tribe as possible, figure out what specific results you want to achieve. Listen for shared ambitions and articulate what you hear. When you put this underlying ambition into words, tribe members will often have an “aha” moment and feel you’ve put your finger on just the right thing.

In addition, the authors explain that _results_ are distinct from _goals_. Aiming for a goal implies that at present, you’re already failing and need to stop. In contrast, assume that you’re already on the path to success and simply not there yet—this is what the authors call a result or “outcome.”

(Shortform note: Rumelt also explains that a bad strategy fails to name the problem. In _Tribal Leadership_ , the authors focus on desired results rather than the main challenge. To complete this approach, consider the main obstacles you face _and_ the results you want to achieve. For instance, a startup founder might need to secure funding, position and differentiate her company, and build a strong team. With these challenges identified clearly, she can then aim toward her desired results more accurately.)

**Discussion #2: Gather your resources.** In a separate conversation, brainstorm what resources you have at your disposal. Resources are everything from material assets—buildings, tools, technologies—to skill sets, connections, and intangibles like brand recognition or past successes. The authors recommend considering two types of resources:

  * **Type #1:** **Foundational resources.** These are things such as unique skills, connections, or qualities that are a core part of your tribe’s nature. For instance, your tribe might be full of experienced innovators, and that’s a valuable skill. Since these resources are easy to take for granted, ask outsiders who can see your tribe’s blind spots.
  * **Type #2:** **Reciprocity.** This intangible resource refers to whether you and your customers understand one another. When a business and its market acknowledge that they mutually need each other, that sense of reciprocity bolsters your business. Test for reciprocity by asking people outside your tribe to describe how they see it.



(Shortform note: Once you’ve gathered your resources, Rumelt recommends directing them toward a focused, well-defined goal, such as overtaking a competitor in a key marketplace. By focusing all your resources in one direction, you direct your strengths toward the competitor’s weaknesses. Rumelt suggests doing this at “pivot points,” or areas where you can leverage your strengths to create an imbalance in your favor. For instance, a video game studio might have strong foundational resources, such as innovative product designers, and strong reciprocity with their fans; by launching an ambitious, long-awaited game announcement at a pivotal point in the year, they could shift attention away from competitors and toward them.)

**Discussion #3: Plan action steps.** To make your strategy actionable, the authors suggest that you brainstorm the individual actions or efforts the tribe must undertake to achieve its desired results. Consider everything from smaller-scale plans—such as gathering marketing data—or tribe-wide behavioral changes, such as developing a more productive workflow. To compensate for mistakes, devise a plan A and a plan B, in case things go awry.

(Shortform note: When planning action steps, don’t stop at making a list. Rumelt suggests that an action plan should integrate all sub-plans into one well-crafted design—a dynamic whole, like a car engine, where many parts work in tandem to produce something more than the sum of the parts’ actions. To do this, consider how your steps fit together—for instance, how a marketing team’s tasks fit with the product designers’, the software engineers’, and so on.)

##### A Strategy Must Pass Three Tests

Until your strategy passes the authors’ three tests, they contend it’s incomplete. By validating the strategy, you ensure that it’s worth committing time and money to, and you motivate the tribe to action.

  * **Test #1:** **Do you have enough resources to achieve your desired results?** If you lack sufficient resources, brainstorm ways to obtain what you need and get those resources before trying to execute your strategy.
  * **Test #2: Do you have enough resources to implement your necessary actions?** If yes, move on to the next test. If not, try to identify any resources you may have overlooked. Otherwise, the authors recommend looking for ways to optimize your operations—for instance, by helping reliable employees to develop new skills as opposed to hiring to fill that same need.
  * **Test #3: Will the action steps accomplish your desired results?** Scrutinize whether the actions you’ve outlined are realistic enough to work. Encourage your team members to share their doubts by giving specific concerns, and if necessary, brainstorm additional actions to take. 



**Once you’ve built and validated a strategy, the tribe will often ascend to Stage 4**. According to the authors, building a viable strategy unifies the tribe and creates enthusiasm. Now you can begin to implement your action steps. Focus on executing your behaviors. In the face of setbacks, stay resilient and reorganize the tribe around a readapted strategy.

> **Avoid Excessive Planning**
> 
> In _Nine Lies About Work_ , Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall contend that strategic planning, like the above method, doesn’t always lead to success. They explain that leaders often devise large, top-down strategies based on inaccurate assumptions about how things will play out. Because such strategies are based on ideals rather than reality, teams inconsistently execute them—that is, they simply don’t work.
> 
> To avoid foundering with a large, clunky strategy, Buckingham and Goodall recommend staying agile. Agile companies use a flexible, lightweight strategy that centers on adaptation and communication. By taking action every day and staying attuned to what information a team needs and how they’re doing, an agile leader guides her company via quick, frequent pivots. This allows the company to navigate the complex world of business and competition, and it saves time and energy otherwise spent coordinating the various parts of a complicated and demanding strategy.

#### Task #3: Build Interconnected Relationships

The authors explain that **at Stage 4, three-part relationships prevail**. This looks like three people or three entities—such as a person, a tribe, or an organization—forming a relationship.

A tribal leader actively builds relationships between potential tribe members by speaking to two things: _who each person is_ and _what they have to offer_ —in other words, their values and their work. As he connects people, they speak well of him to their own networks, and he benefits from this word-of-mouth networking. Imagine the head of a startup incubator who introduces various founders, speaking of their values and their skills. By connecting people, he spreads seeds for collaboration and tribal success.

(Shortform note: In addition to business-oriented networking, informal, social networking can help workers develop friendships, grow more comfortable with their coworkers, and learn from each other. However, research finds that in social networking, women may be less apt to participate in after-office gatherings than men, since they often have families or children to take care of in addition to work. To counteract this, try introducing more social time, such as open collaboration time or group lunches, during the day.)

**Three-part relationships have three main benefits:** They’re stable, they’re easily expanded, and they enable creativity.

  * **Benefit #1: Three-part relationships are stable.** Since they’re based on shared values, people can resolve their own conflicts by remembering that they agree on what matters most. This saves time, allowing leaders and tribe members to minimize issues.
  * **Benefit #2: Three-part relationships easily expand networks.** Since three-part relationships are so stable, a tribe can easily expand its network by incorporating additional people and organizations into their already-stable relationships. For instance, a founder with a small tribe might reach out to a college friend, who then connects him to some coders he knows, and so on.
  * **Benefit #3: Three-part relationships enable creativity.** The authors explain that groups of three facilitate cross-pollination of ideas and skills that lead to interdisciplinary learning. When three people with distinct backgrounds come together, each exposes the others to perspectives and questions that they’d never asked. Imagine a systems-thinker, an environmental activist, and a digital artist all coming together—innovative, visionary thinking would arise in the confluence of their unique expertises. 



> **Mapping the Networks**
> 
> In a paper on the power of informal networks, the McKinsey Institute recommends mapping your organizations’ networks of relationships and using them to better understand how information flows and work gets done. Some of these relationships are three-part relationships (triads) as the authors suggest, yet research shows that dyads and tetrads are also common structures.
> 
> The informal, cross-departmental networks within an organization do function as creative catalysts, as the authors suggest. The _Harvard Business Review_ writes that when urgent deadlines or difficult tasks arise, it’s not a business’s formal structures but these informal work networks that drum up the resources and morale to get things done.
> 
> However, informal network mapping shows these networks aren’t entirely made up of triads—instead, their relationships take various forms and networks form spontaneously, often without triads or a tribal leader. Relationship types include dyads, where two people might relate with a one-way information flow, or an incomplete triad with one person in charge and the other two as subordinates (like a “v” shape). Often, someone sits within a matrix of connections while another is all but disconnected on the outskirts. This suggests that triads are just one kind of network relationship, and that they aren’t strictly necessary to create work networks.

#### Markers of Success

The authors explain that undertaking the above three activities will stabilize your whole _tribe_ at Stage 4. When this happens, you’ll see three main changes in _each individual_ , as well. These changes indicate that the individual has also adopted the Stage 4 view of values, language, and relationship style.

  * **Change #1: Tribe-focused language.** At Stage 4, a tribe member will use language that reflects her focus on the tribe. She’ll credit the team with successes, she’ll praise her fellow tribe members, and she’ll express pride in the team she belongs to. 
  * **Change #2: Commitment to the tribe’s values.** When faced with decisions, the tribe member will choose according to the tribe’s values and purpose. She’ll prioritize the tribal strategy by living according to it as much as possible.
  * **Change #3: Proactive teamwork.** The tribe member will take on difficult work that requires teamwork and go out of her way to build new relationships. She’s seen that collective action goes far beyond individual action, and she embraces teamwork. 



> **All Models Are Limited**
> 
> While the development of a given individual might unfold just as the authors describe, it also might not. This is because any given model—an abstract representation of reality, such as the _Tribal Leadership_ model of development—is inherently limited. As the authors of _The Great Mental Models Volume 1_ explain, we create models with limited information from limited points of view. Because of this, any model will reflect just one perspective on an issue.
> 
> Given this, allow room for error when looking for these markers in your team. A given tribe member might express all the specific behaviors the author describes, or she might express just a few. Likely as not, no one will transition to Stage 4 in exactly the same way.
> 
> In addition, the authors seem to neglect _individuation, an important aspect of psychological growth_ wherein the individual matures into an autonomous, self-determining person. An update to the _Tribal Leadership_ model might acknowledge individuation, whereas the current model suggests that tribe members conform almost religiously to the will of the tribe. In some ways, conformity is good—it promotes harmony and easy interactions. At the same time, some individuals might fall out of sync with a tribe that can’t honor their uniqueness, and this could strain the fabric of the tribe over time.

### Stage 5: World-Changing Innovation

Finally, the authors mention a fifth stage, while acknowledging they hadn’t envisioned it until just before publication and therefore hadn’t developed their thinking on it. They speculate that **Stage 5 is the next level of effective and meaningful work,** and**** they assert that Stage 5 is where top-level companies are heading. The authors suggest that Stage 5 has the following qualities:

  * **A transcendent mission:** Building on their values and purpose, a Stage 5 tribe takes on a mission that goes beyond mere business success—such as stopping deforestation or ensuring that the whole planet has clean water to drink.
  * **The leaders have global reach:** Stage 5 tribal leaders recognize the limitations of their single tribe, and they strive to unite various tribes to coordinate globe-spanning projects. Such a leader connects multiple Stage 4 tribes that have compatible values—values that are different, yet complementary. 
  * **Near-religious commitment to the tribe:** Given their transcendent, world-changing mission, the authors describe that tribe members have a “religious” or spiritual light in their eyes. They experience “humble awe” at the grand mission they’ve pursued.



(Shortform note: In an interview with Gallup, Logan gives a few examples of companies within which some tribes reached Stage 5, including Apple, IBM, and Pixar. The distinguishing attribute of Stage 5 tribes is that they produce world-shaking innovations, like Apple’s creation of the iPhone or the graphical user interface (GUI) pioneered by Xerox PARC. These innovations, Logan says, are hard to quantify, but they’re undeniably world-changing—just try to imagine life without smartphone technology or visual, user-friendly computer interfaces.)
