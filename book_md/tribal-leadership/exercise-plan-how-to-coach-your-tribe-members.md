## Exercise: Plan How to Coach Your Tribe Members

As the authors explain, a tribal leader upgrades her tribe by coaching one tribe member at a time. To practice your understanding of the techniques, plan how you could implement their coaching methods.

* * *

First, recall the two key coaching opportunities: helping a tribe member upgrade her language and her relationships to the next Stage. When coaching a tribe member at Stage 2, what kind of language would you encourage her to adopt? List a few changes you could help her make—for instance, shifting away from commiserating language.

Continuing with the second coaching opportunity, how could you help that Stage 2 individual upgrade her relationships? Think of how to move beyond Stage 2’s tenuous relationships, and consider a few individuals that might support her growth toward Stage 3.

Next, consider how you could coach a Stage 3 individual to Stage 4. The authors recommend helping Stage 3 individuals learn the value of teamwork and collaborative relationships. What kind of work could you assign to a Stage 3 individual to help him work toward Stage 4? Briefly reflect below.

The authors also recommend mentoring, since mentors can model effective Stage 4 behavior. Last, think about who in your organization might make a good mentor for Stage 3 individuals—someone who values open communication and respectful relationships. Briefly, how might you work with this person (if it’s not you) to coach Stage 3 individuals with the _Tribal Leadership_ methodology?
