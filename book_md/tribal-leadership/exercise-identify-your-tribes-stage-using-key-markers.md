## Exercise: Identify Your Tribe’s Stage Using Key Markers

The authors emphasize that tribal leaders must learn to recognize the key markers of each stage. To practice this skill, consider your immediate colleagues’ values, language, and relationships to identify the stage of tribe that you work within.

* * *

Recalling the “three key markers” of each stage—relationship to values, characteristic language, and relationship style—consider your current workplace tribe. First, how do your immediate colleagues relate to values? Briefly describe any shared attitudes you’ve noticed.

Secondly, think about your workplace’s shared language—how do you and your colleagues tend to speak about work? For instance, you might use generally upbeat language but still love the weekends. Or, people’s language might be less cheerful.

Third, consider how your close colleagues form relationships. Do you see primarily two-person or three-person relationships, or a mixture of the two? Describe the typical structure(s) you see.

Now that you’ve reflected on how your tribe displays the three key markers, identify your tribe’s stage. Recalling the two key coaching opportunities (helping someone to level up their language and their relationships) and the authors’ recommendation to work with one person at a time, how might you begin to upgrade your tribe’s current stage?
