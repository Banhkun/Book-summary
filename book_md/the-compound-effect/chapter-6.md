## Chapter 6: Breaking Through to Greater Success

The Compound Effect can spur you to greater heights of success faster than you ever thought possible, but on your journey you will face moments of truth—times when you’re up against the wall. What you do next defines both who you are and who you will be. In such a moment of truth, growth and true improvement can occur.

### Hitting the Wall

Hitting a wall is inevitable. Whether you’re riding a bike up a steep hill or facing a long day of work, there will be times when quitting is a very attractive option. **These moments of truth, however, are defining moments—the turning points for your success and progress.**

For example, famed football coach Lou Holtz inspired his team to come back from a halftime deficit of 42-0 by showing them a highlight reel of second efforts—the extra effort _after_ you’ve already done your best. That extra effort is the difference-maker in a football game and in life.

**Hitting the wall is an opportunity for greatness, not an obstacle.** When things are easy and going well, everyone can do great. But when an obstacle appears, it’s a chance for you to rise above the pack and give the extra effort others are unable to give. Your response to obstacles is what sets you apart and spurs you to great achievement.

### Doing a Little Bit More Yields Big Results

We’ve learned that because of the Compound Effect, your small actions, habits, decisions, and behaviors, compounded over time, can lead to powerful improvements in your life. But adding just a smidge more effort can speed up and greatly improve your results.

Since true growth occurs because of what you do _after_ you’ve hit a wall, pushing through that wall can multiply your results. For example, if you’re weight training and your exercise program says to do 12 repetitions, doing 12 will satisfy the requirement. This is great and will yield good results if you stick to the program consistently. But if you push through and do a few more reps, you can multiply the effect of your workout.

Another example is running. If you set a goal for your run, but go a little longer after you’ve hit your wall, you’ve extended your personal limits; the results of that single run are multiplied.

Remember the magic penny that doubled in value every day for 31 days? What if it doubled just one extra time per week? You’d have $171 million instead of $10 million!

To motivate yourself to do just a little bit more than expected, think of yourself as your own toughest competitor when you hit a wall and fight to go above and beyond your limits.

### Blow Away Other People’s Expectations

Another great way to multiply your results is to focus on rising above what other people expect of you, surprising them with what you’re truly capable of.

You can do more than people expect of you in every aspect of your life. Oprah is a great example of this. When she launched her 19th season in 2004, she called 11 people to the stage and gifted them with a car. Then she gave the rest of the audience boxes, saying one of them held the key to a 12th giveaway car. But when the audience members opened their boxes, everyone had a key. “Everybody gets a car!” she screamed. In that moment, she fully surpassed everyone's expectations. She did this often, changing lives for many people.

Hardy did more than anyone expected when he proposed to his wife. Instead of simply asking his fiance’s father for her hand, he learned his speech in Portuguese and delivered it to her father, who wasn’t completely comfortable conversing in English; he also asked each of her five brothers for their blessing, and some took a little convincing. All of this extra effort and attention paid off in his relationship.

A little bit of extra effort can exceed the expectations of others _and_ propel your own results.

### The Wow Factor

Doing the unexpected separates you from the pack, makes a bold statement, and multiplies the impact of your efforts. **Doing what’s expected is fine, but yields only expected results.** **Adding extra effort to create a wow factor gets attention and boosts your chances of success.**

For example, Hardy doesn’t send out the expected Christmas cards; instead, he sends out Thanksgiving cards with handwritten personal sentiments. This unexpected behavior has a huge impact on family and friends for just a little more effort.

Another example is Richard Branson. Every time he launches a venture, he grabs attention with bold, audacious, and often scary stunts, not a boring press conference or launch party.

But you don’t have to spend a lot of money to show extra effort. For example, when he worked in real estate, Hardy would show up at expired listings and hand the owners a “sold” sign, telling them they’d need it if they gave him the listing. This greatly increased his odds of getting the listing.

> **Example:** **Doing More Than Expected**
> 
> Hardy’s friend, Alex, was up for his dream job across the country. The local applicants were interviewed in person while the out-of-town applicants were interviewed via videoconferencing. Hardy advised Alex to get on a plane and show up unexpectedly for his interview in person. He told Alex to research the company and the decision-makers, finding out their interests and hobbies. He advised Alex to send them resources or gifts they’d appreciate. This was over-the-top behavior, but it would get their attention and respect.
> 
> Unfortunately, Alex didn’t take this advice and did the expected—and didn't get the job.

There are many small ways to do better than expected. For example, Hardy always goes one step above the dress code for events. When doing keynotes, he learns all about the organization and prepares tirelessly, aiming to exceed their expectations for his talk and continue a reputation for excellence.

Nordstrom is famous for its “wow factor” in customer service, knowing that exceeding expectations builds customer loyalty. Another example is a CEO Hardy worked with; he always paid contractors early, knowing that getting paid early would create surprise and delight—and goodwill.

In all areas of your life, find the opportunity to multiply your results—prepare better, push harder, last longer and put more of your time, energy and thoughts into your endeavors. Your results will multiply, not just improve.
