## 1-Page Summary

The key to success in anything in life is harnessing the power of the Compound Effect, which means the effects of small, everyday choices will compound over time, leading you to success—or disaster, depending on your choices.

As a student of success and a leader in the personal development industry, author Darren Hardy has tested thousands of different philosophies and came to realize that whatever success strategy you employ doesn’t matter—it all comes down to the Compound Effect.

### The Premise of the Compound Effect

As you may know from finance, compound interest can lead to surprisingly large returns. A penny that doubles in value each day for 31 days ends up being worth over $10 million.

Similarly, in our personal life, **small changes maintained consistently over time lead to unexpectedly dramatic results**. Eating 100 fewer calories per day for an entire year would cause you to lose 10 pounds. Spending 30 minutes reading each day could, over a year, lead to dramatic self-improvement and new ideas.

Importantly, **changes in one area of life can compound with other areas** , what Hardy calls “the ripple effect.” For example, eating slightly more healthily might lead to feeling more energetic, which promotes a little more exercise, which improves your mood and personal relationships. One small change can lead to a host of other benefits, which together form a snowball of dramatic personal change.

The Compound Effect also works in reverse - one small bad habit leads to a large problem over time. And that small habit can ripple into other areas, leading to a giant snowball of bad problems. For example, eating a little too much each day could cause surprisingly large weight gain, which leads to loss of self-esteem, which leads to less energy and worsened relationships, and so on.

The idea of small changes compounding over time can be contrasted with big, sudden changes. When people try to start exercising, they often declare a big goal and start with extreme changes like going to the gym daily. But this is often unsustainable - once you miss a few appointments, you get discouraged and end the whole effort. In contrast, small changes build consistency and momentum - they form new habits that you can maintain for decades.

The concept is simple, but simple doesn’t mean easy. Each chapter in this book explores a fundamental tenet of the Compound Effect that will help you generate new behaviors and habits to propel you toward success.

### Chapter One: Putting the Compound Effect Into Action

From an early age, Hardy learned the power and importance of positive habits applied consistently. He attributes his success to believing in and living the Compound Effect every day. But people face hurdles becoming a true believer in the Compound Effect because:

  * **They haven’t experienced it**. The Compound Effect means reaping big rewards from a series of small, good choices, but the results don’t come immediately, which discourages many people from trying. To succeed, you have to be able to stick to your small, smart choices consistently over time.
  * **It’s a lot of work**. The Compound Effect is a challenging system because it’s not about instant payoffs. Real success requires a lot of hard work with consistency, despite the shortcuts you may hear about in the media or from self-help gurus. 
  * **They expect quick fixes**. The Compound Effect dispels the idea of a quick fix. Success comes from continued effort—daily hard work and discipline compounded over time. You can create the life of your dreams, but it won’t happen overnight.



The Compound Effect is always working. Whether it’s working to bring you success or failure is up to you. Using the Compound Effect to create a better life is a matter of making simple, positive changes—and sticking with them.

### Chapter 2: You Make Your Choices, and Your Choices Make You

When you’re aware of your choices, you can make a series of small good decisions that lead to the behaviors and habits that support a happy, successful life.

The real problem for most of us isn’t massive mistakes; it’s repeated small, poor choices that seem to be inconsequential. These continued small, _poor_ choices, made mindlessly, help the Compound Effect work against you. Here are tips for making good choices:

  * **Gratitude.** While focusing on the negative qualities of others is easy, it’s a bad habit that leads to a cycle of _compounded_ negativity. In contrast, focusing on what you are thankful for, creates a Compound Effect of _positivity_.
  * **Take responsibility.** When you take full responsibility for yourself, you hold unlimited power to control your destiny—you are completely responsible for what you do and don’t do, as well as your response to what happens to you. 
  * **Take advantage of luck.** The kind of luck we associate with success is a combination of preparation, a good attitude, finding an opportunity, and taking action.
  * **Tracking**. When you track your behavior, you can take control of the choices you make throughout the day; your habits begin working _for_ you, with positive results. 



When it comes to the Compound Effect, the sooner you make small, positive changes, the better. But don’t use the excuse that it’s too late to start; it’s _never_ too late to use the power of the Compound Effect. Starting _now_ is the key, no matter how old you are.

### Chapter 3: Habits and Goals

Habits are acquired behaviors that have become nearly involuntary. At their worst, habits can run you in the wrong direction without you even realizing what’s happening. Good habits, however, take you in a positive direction. The goal is to gain awareness and change the habits that are holding us back. We can prepare ourselves to do this by:

  * **Resisting the lure of instant gratification**. Often, instant gratification obliterates any concern in your conscious mind for long-term results. The first step is to wake up and realize the true ramifications of the bad habits we indulge in.
  * **Finding your “why.** ” You've got to figure out what you want and _why_ you want it or you’ll give up too easily.
  * **Defining and calibrating your “core values.”** When you have clearly defined core values, making decisions is easier because you can simply ask yourself which choice aligns with those values. If something doesn’t align, you can forget about it. 
  * **Finding out who and what you’re fighting**. We all have the ability to take hurtful experiences from our past and use them to fuel constructive change.
  * **Setting and achieving goals**. When you clearly define your goals, you experience the world differently, attracting the opportunities you need to achieve that goal. 
  * **Become the person you want to be**. Strive to gain the attributes you need to achieve your goal. Without these, you can do all the right things but still never succeed.



There are five strategies to help get rid of bad habits:

  * **Know your triggers**. What situations trigger bad habits? (Do you drink too much with a certain group of friends? Do you crave chocolate at a certain time of day?)
  * **Get rid of it**. Throw out the objects enabling your bad habits. 
  * **Find replacements**. Find something healthy that can replace the bad habit. 
  * **Take it easy**. You don’t have to go cold turkey. Since they are so entrenched, you may need to take small steps toward unwinding your bad habits. 
  * **Or don’t take it easy**. While it’s probably the exception and not the rule, some people actually do better changing a lot of bad habits at once. 



There are six strategies to help craft new, positive habits:

  * **Help yourself succeed**. Make your new habit easier to instill by setting yourself up for success. (If you want to eat healthier, keep healthy snacks available.)
  * **Focus on what you _can_ have or do**. Instead of feeling deprived, focus on the new things you are bringing into your life. 
  * **Accountability is key**. Becoming accountable is a sure way to cement a new habit. 
  * **Find a partner**. A partner in your endeavor, whether it’s losing weight, exercising, or improving your career, boosts your accountability and lends support. 
  * **Friendly competition**. Competition can help you immerse yourself in a new habit.
  * **Enjoy**. Instilling new habits doesn’t have to be drudgery. Find rewards along the way to keep you motivated and help you celebrate your success.



### Chapter 4: Finding Momentum

Momentum (Hardy calls it “Big Mo”) is a powerful force for success. Momentum doesn’t come easily, but once it kicks in, your ability to achieve success compounds quickly.

Momentum can work for good or bad. Momentum kicks in to help you when you:

  * Make good choices that help you reach your goals and that align with your values.
  * Engage in positive behaviors based on those good choices.
  * Make those positive behaviors into habits of behavior and routine.
  * Remain consistent with your new positive habits and routines.



**Why Routines and Rhythms Are Important to Momentum**

When you have set a goal and created good new habits to support that goal, you must have daily, weekly, and monthly routines in place to reinforce your positive new direction. The greater your challenge, the more stringent your routine should be. Mornings and evenings are great times to implement healthy, positive routines.

When you make your habits a routine, you can get into a rhythm—your routine feels easy and natural. Once you’re in a rhythm, momentum gets a chance to work its magic.

**Consistency Is Critical to Success**

When you want to change your life for the better, doing too much too soon can set you up for failure. Instead, set up a rhythm for success that you can stick to because this is about improving the rest of your life. Aiming for improvements you can make _consistently_ is critical for success. A lack of consistency is a momentum-killer.

### Chapter 5: Understand What’s Influencing You

Our choices are influenced by three main types of powerful outside factors:

  * **Mind input.** Whatever you allow into your brain is influencing your thoughts. You are the gatekeeper of your mind, and you must be vigilant about protecting it from worrisome and destructive input—and be very particular about what you allow in.
  * **Associations.** Our friends influence us subtly yet powerfully, and that influence can be negative or positive. If you want to possess certain traits, the best way to start is by hanging out with people who already possess those traits. 
  * **Environment.** Your goals and ambitions may be bigger than your current surroundings, and sometimes it takes getting out of your current environment to see your dreams fulfilled. Keep your physical and mental environment clutter-free.



### Chapter 6: Breaking Through to Greater Success

Because of the Compound Effect, your small actions, habits, decisions, and behaviors, compounded over time, can lead to powerful improvements in your life. But adding just a smidge more effort can speed up and greatly improve your results.

True growth occurs because of what you do _after_ you’ve hit a wall; pushing through that wall, even when you think you can’t go any further in your endeavor, can multiply your results.

To motivate yourself to do just a little bit more than expected, think of yourself as your own toughest competitor when you hit a wall and fight to go above and beyond your limits. Another great way to multiply your results is to focus on rising above what other people expect of you, surprising them with what you’re truly capable of.

Doing the unexpected and adding extra effort separates you from the pack, makes a bold statement, and multiplies the impact of your efforts. In all areas of your life, find the opportunity to multiply your results—prepare better, push harder, last longer and put more of your time, energy and thoughts into your endeavors.
