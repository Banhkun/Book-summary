## Chapter 4: Finding Momentum

Momentum (Hardy calls it “Big Mo”) is a powerful force for success. Momentum doesn’t come easily, but once it kicks in, your ability to achieve success compounds quickly.

The hardest part of achieving momentum is getting started. Think about when you were a child playing on the playground merry-go-round. When it was full of kids and you tried to push it, it took a lot of effort and went very slowly. But as the speed picked up the merry-go-round would spin rapidly and you could hop back on and enjoy the ride. It’s the same with making any changes in your life; progress can be slow at first, but **when momentum kicks in it’s easy to keep moving**. You can put out less effort and receive greater results.

### Putting Momentum to Work for You

Momentum can work for good or bad. The Compound Effect is always at work, so a string of bad habits can build up momentum and send you into a chasm of bad luck with compounding negative side effects. Think of Brad from Chapter 1; because of a few bad habits that gained negative momentum, he gained 33 pounds and ended up with a troubled career and marriage. This is an example of the Compound Effect working _against_ you.

You gain positive momentum by building up your efforts until you hit what’s commonly called “the zone” or “your groove.” Momentum kicks in when you:

  * Make good choices that help you reach your goals and that align with your values.
  * Engage in positive behaviors based on those good choices.
  * Make those positive behaviors into habits of behavior and routine.
  * Remain consistent with your new positive habits and routines.



> **Momentum at Work Example 1: Michael Phelps**
> 
> Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps worked with his coach, Bob Bowman, over the course of 12 years. Their practice and preparation fell into routines, and Phelps’ performance became consistently excellent. By the time the Olympics rolled around, Phelps had caught momentum at the perfect time, and his performance was both amazing and predictable.

> **Momentum at Work Example 2: Apple**
> 
> Apple Computer has been around a long time. Its Macs were always popular, but they had only a fraction of the market segment PCs had. When the company introduced the iPod in 2001, the device wasn’t the first MP3 player around. But Apple had consistency in its courting of customer loyalty and was consistently innovative with design, ease of use, advertising, and the “cool factor.” The iPod was a hit, but the company’s path toward positive revenue growth took a few years. They caught momentum in 2005 and gained 68 percent revenue growth.
> 
> Today, Apple dominates the smartphone market with its iPhone and has exploded into other areas such as digital music.

### Why Routines Are Important to Momentum

When you have set a goal and created good new habits to support that goal, you must have daily, weekly, and monthly routines in place to reinforce your positive new direction. The greater your challenge, the more stringent your routine should be.

Think of new military recruits heading to boot camp. As soldiers, these recruits will have to be able to carry out their duties efficiently and reliably even under intense pressure and imminent danger. Because of this, boot camp instills rigorous routines for even minor tasks, such as standing at attention, making the bed, and shining shoes. In only 8-12 weeks, basic training turns young kids into confident soldiers through the power of routine.

Another example is famed golfer Jack Nicklaus, who was known for his pre-shot routine. To focus himself, he would go through a series of physical and mental steps—similar to a dance—before each shot. The timing of this routine never varied even by a second. In contrast, at the 1996 Masters, golfer Greg Norman’s pre-shot routine grew faster and faster each round; his consistency lost, he never gained momentum and his game collapsed.

You may not be a soldier or golfer, but predictable daily routines are vital to your success.

#### The Most Important Time for Routines

Your day is likely unpredictable; it’s hard to control all the events coming at you, so it’s hard to implement routines. But **how your day starts and ends _is_ in your control, and setting routines for these times** can help you implement healthy, positive behaviors and gain momentum.

Hardy’s personal morning routine starts at 5 a.m. when his alarm goes off and he hits Snooze. This morning routine keeps Hardy grounded, disciplined and performing at a high level.

  * **Gratitude.** First, he uses the 8-minute snooze time to think of things he’s grateful for. 
  * **Sending love.** Second, he sends love to someone, imagining the good things he hopes for them. He calls this a “mental love letter.”
  * **Day’s top goal.** Third, he thinks about his top goal and lists three things he can do on this day to move that goal forward. 
  * **Coffee and stretching** : When up, he puts the coffee on and does a series of stretches to fight stiffness.
  * **Read** : Next, he takes his coffee, sets a 30-minute timer, and reads something positive.
  * **Focused Work** : When the timer goes off, he works for an hour on his most important project. This work is focused and undistracted.
  * **MVPs** : Next he has what he calls a “calibration appointment,” where for 15 minutes he goes over his long-term goals and weekly and monthly goals, and sets his top priorities (“Most Valuable Priorities”) for the day. He asks himself what three things he could do that day to propel him toward his big goals.
  * **Email** : He then opens his email, and delegates tasks to his team, and gets to work.



Hardy’s end-of the day routine is reflective.

  * He thinks about his day’s performance, comparing what actually happened to his plan for the day. 
  * He looks at what needs to carry over to tomorrow and what tasks need to be added. 
  * He jots new ideas or insights into his journal and reads 10 pages of an inspiring book before sleeping. 



No matter what happens during the day, his morning and evening routines mean his day will start and finish strong.

**When Routines Need to Be Shaken Up**

Sometimes routines can get boring and you find yourself in a rut. For example, when Hardy works out with weights the same way week after week, he stops seeing compounded results in his body and needs to change up the workout. Momentum can’t show up when you’re bored. This is why challenging yourself can liven things up and help you recapture your passions. Things like changing your exercise routine, going to a new restaurant, or joining a club help you gain a fresh perspective.

### Finding Your Rhythm

**When you make your habits a routine, you can get into a rhythm—your routine feels easy and natural. Once you’re in a rhythm, momentum gets a chance to work its magic.**

Hardy likens this to a steam locomotive. When it’s stopped, you only need a small piece of wood to prevent it from moving forward. Getting the wheels to budge is a slow process that takes a great deal of steam and connections, but when the train gets rolling, the wheels fall into a rhythm and gain momentum—and it could crash through anything in its path.

Daily rhythms are important, but looking to the future is important too. For example, Hardy and his wife have created a rhythm in their marriage and family life that gives their relationship momentum. Along with weekly date nights and setting aside every Saturday as “Family Day,” the couple reviews their relationship every Sunday evening, discussing the week’s good and weak points and what adjustments need to be made. They share things they’ve appreciated about each other during the week and ask how they can make the other’s experience better.

Each month they schedule a unique experience to share; they also plan quarterly getaways to do a deeper check-in on the relationship. All of this has created a rhythm for their family life that allows momentum to take effect in their relationship.

### Consistency Is Critical to Success

When you want to change your life for the better, doing too much too soon can set you up for failure. Instead, set up a rhythm for success that you can stick to because this is about improving the rest of your life with the Compound Effect, not just having a better day, week or month. **Aiming for improvements you can make consistently is critical for success.** A lack of consistency is a momentum-killer.

For example, if you’ve never worked out a day in your life and you decide it’s time to get fit, it’s a mistake to go too gung-ho and vow to work out two hours a day five days a week. At some point you’ll find you don’t have two hours to spare, so you won’t work out at all. This will start happening more and more, and you’ll get discouraged and soon the whole effort will end.

**Instead of overdoing it, start a program you can maintain for 50 years, not a month.** Set a reasonable amount of time to exercise as your target, such as 45 minutes a few times a week, so you can reap the long-term benefits of consistency. You can always add more as you go.

> **The Flight Toward Your Goals**
> 
> Think of two planes headed from Los Angeles to Manhattan. Say one plane takes off and goes 500 miles per hour, but lands and takes off again in every state in between. The other plane goes only 200 miles per hour, but flies straight through with no stops; it will get to the destination far more quickly. The other plane probably won’t even make it because it will run out of fuel. This is just like achieving your goals: keeping a regular “speed” keeps your energy and motivation strong, while trying to do too much is disastrous and wasteful.

#### The Price of Inconsistency

Since consistency is critical to gaining and maintaining momentum, it’s important to understand the high price of inconsistency. When you’re inconsistent, you lose not only a single action and its small benefits; the loss of momentum will damage your overall progress.

Hardy likens this to a hand-pumped well. Bringing the water up to the surface requires pumping the lever, which causes a suction effect to bring the water up through the spout. When we start a new program, it’s tempting to grab the “lever” and pump hard. But when no water (progress) immediately appears, we often give up. If we keep going, when a little water appears (small, visible changes), we might think, “Is that all there is?” If we are able to persist through this, soon a steady stream of water appears (tangible results); we no longer have to pump (maintain our habits, routines and rhythms) with so much effort, just with consistency.

But slacking off kills momentum. If we stop pumping the water lever, we’re back to square one and have to start the arduous process all over again. Slacking off in our habits and routines ruins our progress. When you miss a few weeks at the gym, or stop sticking to your date-night routine with your spouse, you end up right where you started, with no momentum.

**The lesson: keep your pace slow and consistent; given enough time, your momentum will carry you to victory.**
