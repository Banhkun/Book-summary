## Exercise: Start a Compound Effect

Get started using this powerful principle.

* * *

Think about poor Brad in the example above. He made what seemed to be small, innocuous changes in his life that led to very negative outcomes. What are some small behaviors in your life that may be steering you down a negative path? What would the negative outcomes be?

Now think about Scott, whose small life changes brought powerful, positive results. What are three small changes _you_ could make every day to steer your life in a more positive direction? What would the positive outcomes be?

Think about an area of your life where you are enjoying some success. Is there anything you are taking for granted in this area, leaving you in danger of becoming complacent? What is one small thing you can do to improve in this area to keep your success fresh and thriving?
