## Chapter 5: Understand What’s Influencing You

We are all responsible for the choices we make, but it’s important to realize that those choices are influenced by powerful outside factors. We’re often unaware of the subtle influence of these external forces, but understanding and governing them can help us maintain our trajectory toward success.

There are three main types of influences:

  * What’s going in (input)
  * Who we associate with
  * Our surroundings



### Controlling Your Mind’s Input

Controlling what our brains consume directly impacts our productivity and results. For example, reading a tabloid won’t help your brain function at its peak, but reading something educational and inspirational will nourish your brain.

What our brains consume is difficult to police, however, because we absorb so much unconsciously. Even if eating junk food is easy and mindless, at least you have to put it in your mouth yourself. In contrast, we can hear, feel and absorb irrelevant and destructive input without even knowing it—for example, switching on the radio on our way to work can flood our brains with terrible news, leaving us with fear and negativity to start our day.

**You are the gatekeeper of your mind, and you must be vigilant about protecting it from worrisome and destructive input—and being very particular about what you allow in.**

Your thoughts have an impact on what you create in your life, so whatever is influencing your thoughts is important. Whatever you allow into your brain is influencing your thoughts.

Hardy likens your mind to an empty glass. Fear, negativity, worry and stress—delivered care of news filled with politics, murder, economic collapse and more doom and gloom—fill that glass with muddy water. It’s hard to be creative with a mind full of negativity and sludge. But if you flush that muddy water with clean, clear water, soon you will have a glass of fresh, clean water. Positive and inspirational input is the clean, clear water for your mind. Seek out stories of success, people who overcome challenges, and ideas that foster love and abundance.

#### Guard Against Negative Input

You can’t lock yourself in a bubble; negative info bombards you on billboards and at work, and friends, family, and even your own thought process can let negativity seep in.

While you can’t control everything, you can limit your exposure to “dirty water.” For example, you can’t avoid the tabloids at the supermarket register, but you can cancel your subscription. At home, you can turn off the news and instead record inspirational and educational programs that benefit the whole family—and skip the commercials. You can turn off the radio on your morning commute and listen to a book on tape or something uplifting.

Another way to limit your exposure to negative input is to go on a “media diet.” The media is savvy; it knows that sensationalism appeals to our basic nature as humans. This would be easy to tolerate if there were only a few media sources. Today, however, the news is everywhere and runs 24/7. As media outlets compete for our attention, they try to outdo each other with shock value. The result for us is a warped, dismal view of the world. The millions of good things that happen each day don’t make it into our minds. This is crippling to creativity.

Hardy’s personal media diet is stringent. He doesn’t read or listen to any news. He has set up RSS feeds with news that directly impacts his interests and goals only.

Many of us spend untold hours in our cars—in fact, 12,000 miles a year is the average for Americans. Instead of turning on the radio and listening to the news or whatever music is playing, try listening to instructional and inspirational material instead. Brian Tracy explained to Hardy that listening to educational material for a year while you’re driving is equivalent to gaining the knowledge of two college semesters.

### Watch Your Associations

The people with whom you closely associate are critically important because you inevitably end up talking, reading, eating, thinking, watching and otherwise doing things like them. According to one expert, your closest associations—your “reference group”— can determine much of your success in life. Jim Rohn says **we are the average of the five people we associate with most.**

Our friends influence us subtly yet powerfully, and that influence can be negative or positive. For example, if you hang out with people who order potato skins and other greasy appetizers while gossiping, you’ll soon find yourself joining right in. If, however, you hang out with people who order healthy food and talk about uplifting subjects, you’ll assimilate these behaviors.

If you want to possess certain traits, the best way to start is by hanging out with people who already possess those traits. The habits and attitudes they possess will rub off on you, and you can then mirror that success in your own life.

Consider the people you spend the most time with and place them into one of 3 categories:

  * **Dissociations**. These are the people you need to cut ties with. They are negative influences who don’t seem to be growing or changing in a positive direction. When you break away from these people, it won’t be easy. They will resist, seeing your positive direction as a negative reflection on them.
  * **Limited associations** : There are people who are fine to be around for a few minutes, or a few hours, or even a few days, but any more than that creates a dampening influence on you. Look at the people in your life and see if you're spending too much time with someone whose contact you should limit.
  * **Expanded associations**. Find people who have positive qualities in areas of life you’d like to emulate, for example, business success or loving marriages. Make an effort to spend more time with these people, even if you have to go out of your way. Join organizations where the type of people you admire gather. If you admire an author or speaker you don’t have access to, listen to their materials and learn from them.



**Expanded Associations:** **Mentoring**

Finding a mentor is a great way to associate more with an individual whose qualities you’d like to emulate. You are never so good that you can’t benefit from a mentor. In fact, some of the most successful individuals keep learning from the best coaches and trainers there are. One of Hardy’s mentors was Paul J. Meyer, who spurred him on to higher levels of ambition and spirit.

Finding a mentor is a simple process. You don’t have to take a lot of their time; rather, small snippets of wisdom is greatly beneficial.

**Expanded Associations: The Board of Your Life**

Another strategy Hardy uses to keep high-minded people around him is what he calls his life’s “board of advisors.” These dozen people have expertise or special talents in certain areas of life; he contacts them regularly for feedback and input, and the process has yielded invaluable benefits.

### Control Your Environment

Your goals and ambitions may be bigger than your current surroundings, and sometimes it takes getting out of your current environment to see your dreams fulfilled. Hardy likens this to planting an oak tree; it has to be in a big space to soar to its potential.

Your environment isn’t just where you live; it’s everything that surrounds you. The goal is a positive environment that supports your dreams, and creating this environment means eliminating the clutter in your life. This isn’t just the physical clutter; it’s what Hardy calls “psychic clutter.” In particular, psychic clutter is everything around you that’s incomplete or broken, such as a commitment or agreement. Incomplete tasks don’t allow you to move forward because they keep you mired in the past until you finish them.

Another thing to consider when creating a goal-supportive environment is understanding what you tolerate. Whether in your family or business, what you tolerate, you will get. Tolerating disrespect leads to disrespect. Tolerating an unhealthy body means you stay unhealthy.

Guarding your physical, emotional and mental environment allows you to live with peace and creativity, protected from the chaos of the world.
