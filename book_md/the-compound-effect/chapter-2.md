## Chapter 2: You Make Your Choices, and Your Choices Make You

Every decision you make impacts the Compound Effect. Your life is the sum total of your choices. Choices, no matter how tiny, alter the course of your life because they lead to behaviors; behaviors lead to habits. Your choices are your best friend or your worst enemy.

Most people don’t make bad decisions on purpose. No one strives to be overweight, divorced or bankrupt. **The problem is that many of our choices are ingrained in our routines and habits; we aren’t consciously making them.** When multiple small, poor choices proliferate, we end up in a bad place. We sabotage ourselves without even knowing it.

The goal is to become aware of the choices you’re making rather than existing on autopilot. With awareness, you can make a series of small good choices that lead to the behaviors and habits that support a happy, successful life.

### Small Choices, Big Repercussions

Sometimes you can make a single big, catastrophic choice that damages your career or relationships. Think of celebrity mishaps, like the comedian who was caught on tape hurling racial slurs, or the anti-gay politician caught soliciting gay sex. These mistakes are doozies and they have swift, severe repercussions.

**The real problem for most of us, however, isn’t such massive mistakes; it’s the repeated, small choices that seem to be inconsequential.** Because you’re not mindful of them, they can throw your life off course. For example, say you grab a snack and watch TV; suddenly it’s two hours later and you’ve eaten an entire jumbo bag of potato chips and several cans of soda—and didn’t finish an important project. You made these choices without thinking. When this kind of choice is made repeatedly, your life veers off course.

The Compound Effect is always working, but continued small, _poor_ choices—made mindlessly— have it working against you.

### Gratitude Creates Good Choices

One such small negative choice is focusing on the negative qualities of other people or situations. It’s a bad habit that leads to a cycle of negativity _—compounded_ negativity.

Focusing on what you are thankful for, however, creates a compound effect of _positivity_.

To illustrate this, Hardy shares the story of a friend whose marriage was on the verge of collapse. This man complained about his wife constantly and saw her as the source of his unhappiness. Hardy shared with his friend an experience that strengthened his own marriage.

One Thanksgiving, Hardy decided to keep a yearlong journal of gratitude about his wife to present to her the following Thanksgiving. Every day that year, he wrote down something about his wife he appreciated, whether it was a meal, something she said, how she related with her friends or cared for her dogs, how she looked, and more.

While his wife was elated about the gift, Hardy was the one most affected by this experience. He had spent a year focusing on the positive, often subtle, qualities of his wife and gained a greater appreciation for her. His gratitude and positive feelings changed his behavior toward her; she responded with even more wonderful qualities and behaviors toward him.

Hardy’s friend gave this gratitude exercise a try and was able to turn around his marriage. By viewing his wife through a lens of positively, he changed his behavior toward her; she then chose to respond to him differently, leading to a new, compounded cycle of positivity.

### Choose to Take Responsibility for Your Life

**You are always 100 percent in control of yourself.** When you take full responsibility for yourself, you hold unlimited power to control your destiny. Taking 100 percent responsibility for your life means you are completely responsible for what you do and don’t do, as well as your response to what happens to you. You don’t blame bad luck or outside circumstances.

> **Example: 100/0**
> 
> At a seminar when he was just 18 years old, Hardy’s instructor asked the participants how much responsibility one person holds in a relationship. Hardy said 50/50, while others threw out 51/49 and 80/20. The instructor wrote out “100/0,” saying that for a relationship to work, you have to be willing to give 100 percent without expecting anything in return. It’s entirely up to you.
> 
> This resonated with Hardy; he understood that if he always took 100 percent responsibility in all areas of life, he held the power.

People think they take responsibility for their lives, but many point to outside factors when things don’t go their way. Victimhood lets you off the hook when problems occur. For example, say you’re late to work. If you’re not taking 100 percent responsibility for your life, you blame the traffic or something that delayed you. But if you take 100 percent responsibility, you’d understand you should have left sooner or been more prepared before you left the house.

> **Example** : **It’s All Your Fault—and That’s a Good Thing**
> 
> Hardy once was asked to become a partner in a startup venture; he invested a great deal of money and worked hard for two years, only to find out his partner had lost the entire investment through mismanagement—more than $330,000.
> 
> Hardy didn’t sue the partner or even hold a grudge. He took full responsibility for the loss, acknowledging that he didn’t research the partner fully and didn’t watch the finances closely. Through a series of small choices, he ignored red flags and, ultimately, took responsibility for the results. He learned his lesson and moved on from the experience.

### The Truth About Luck

We’re all lucky to some extent. If you’re alive, healthy, and know where your next meal is coming from, you’re _very_ lucky. Beyond the basics, the kind of luck we associate with success and good fortune is actually the result of a series of choices. Richard Branson, for example, felt he was no more lucky or unlucky than anyone else. **The difference was he took advantage of good luck when it came his way**.

An old adage says, “Luck is when opportunity meets preparation.” Hardy says there’s more to it: luck is a combination of the following:

  * **Preparation:** When you prepare yourself by constantly seeking to improve, you can pounce on great opportunities when they come your way. The great golfer Arnold Palmer once said, “It’s a funny thing; the more I practice, the luckier I get.”
  * **Attitude:** When you take the attitude that luck is all around you, you can find good fortune in the situations, circumstances and conversations you encounter every day. 
  * **Opportunity:** Though you can “make your own luck,” _this_ kind of luck is something unplanned—a natural occurrence that comes out of the blue.
  * **Action** : When luck lands in your lap, it’s up to you to do something about it. When you take action on the lucky things that happen to you, you can achieve great success.



**Luck doesn’t play favorites; it’s distributed equally to all of us.** Instead of blaming bad luck when you find yourself in unfortunate circumstances, understand that other people have it worse than you. It’s up to you to take advantage when “lady luck” makes an appearance.

### Tracking Can Help You Make the Right Choices

When you track your behavior, you can take control of the choices you make throughout the day; your habits begin working _for_ you and positive results fall into place.

Say you want to lose weight. First, **get a good understanding of where you are now and picture where you want to be**. Do you have a smaller waistline? Are you wearing a bathing suit? The next step is to **become aware of the choices that are leading you away from this picture**. Are you snacking late at night? Drinking soda? Awareness is important because it allows you to make smarter choices going forward.

**Next, track your choices throughout the day, writing them down in a notebook you carry with you**. Tracking is the way to get a derailed life back on track. It brings complete awareness to the actions you are taking in an area of life you seek to improve. When you are aware of and responsible for your actions, you can make the most of yourself.

For the losing weight example, you’d write down everything that goes in your mouth throughout the day. No excuses. If your goal is to get out of debt, you’d write down every penny you spend. If your goal is to get fit, you’d track every exercise and workout.

Hardy attributes much of his success to tracking; tracking forced him to be very conscious of his choices. And when you’re making good choices repeatedly, the magic of the Compound Effect springs into action—reaping big rewards from small, seemingly inconsequential actions.

When you think of a success story, know that tracking is involved. Think about the casinos in Las Vegas; they track hourly every gaming table and winner. Professional athletic trainers track their athletes’ every workout and nutrient. Baseball pitchers know every statistic involved with their game. Golfers collect diverse metrics on their swings. Professional athletes keep meticulous stats—they know that when their stats improve, they win more and earn more.

#### Tracking in Real Life

Tracking brings awareness to your actions, and you’ll view life very differently when you’re consciously making better choices.

Hardy urges readers to **try out tracking for one week, focusing on the area you most want to change**. If you’re trying to lose weight, as mentioned above, you’d track everything you eat and drink for one week. If you are trying to get out of debt, you’d track every penny you spend. Write everything down in an organized way, with a new page each day on which you write the date. After one week, you’ll likely be astonished at all the calories or money that you previously had no awareness of.

Next, continue tracking for three weeks. The three-week timetable is a good measure, because 21 days is a good amount of time for a new habit to develop. Carry around a notebook and write down everything in the category you’re focusing on. **During this 21-day tracking period you’ll find yourself going from being conscious of your actions to actually shaping your actions.** You’ll ask yourself, “Do I really want that donut?” or “Do I really need to buy a $5 coffee at Starbucks?” After two weeks of saying no to that 200-calorie donut, you’ll have lost a pound. Two weeks of saying no to coffee will save you $70. When the Compound Effect goes into action over long periods of time, you’ll have lost significant weight and saved thousands!

> **The Compound Effect of Money**
> 
> Tracking spending, in particular, illustrates the power of the Compound Effect. When you look at the potential value of money that you spend instead of invest, you realize you lose a great deal more than the amount on the price tag. If an item costs $50, the potential value of that $50 is actually $250—that’s the true cost because that’s what you’d have if you invested the money. So if the item is worth $250 to you—not $50—then go ahead and buy it. But if not, move on and keep your money.

#### Tracking Small Changes Results in Huge Payoffs

When you start tracking, you become aware of the tiny things you’re doing that don’t serve you well. This awareness lets you make small course corrections that, over time, will yield incredible results. There won’t be immediate applause or trophies, but eventually, your course corrections work and the Compound Effect will reward you with huge payoffs.

Think about a horse race. A horse can win by a fraction of an inch, but the prize money won is 10 times more than what the runner up wins. The horse isn’t 10 times faster, but many small actions—more training, better nutrition—made it just a _little_ better—better enough to win.

> **Example 1:** **The CEO Turnaround**
> 
> Hardy once mentored a CEO of a large organization that was doing well, but suffered from a lack of employee enthusiasm and engagement. Hardy had the CEO track one simple change: three times a week he was to go out into the company and talk to an employee who was doing something right or who he’d heard good things about. He was to share his appreciation and have a conversation with these employees.
> 
> This change in the CEO’s behavior took only minutes a week, but over time it had an extraordinary effect on the employees’ attitudes and work ethic. Feeling appreciated, they worked even harder; results trickled down to customer interactions and engagement, which resulted in increased referrals and business. After 18 months, the company’s profits grew by 30%—all because the CEO committed to a small action he performed consistently over time.

> **Example 2: Creating Wealth With the Compound Effect**
> 
> Hardy once had an assistant, Kathleen, who earned $40,000 a year and wanted a raise because she had too many expenses and couldn’t save the 10% of her income that Hardy recommended. He didn’t give her a raise, but rather showed her how to become wealthy.
> 
> First, he had her track every penny she spent. He told her to open a savings account with $33, which was 1 percent of her monthly income. The next step was to live on $33 less the next month, which she was able to do by bringing a lunch from home one day a week. The next month she was to save 2 percent ($67), saving another $33 by cancelling her cable subscription. The following month she saved 3% by cutting a magazine subscription and making coffee in the office instead of going to Starbucks. By the end of the year she was able to save 10 percent of her earnings without a huge impact on her life.
> 
> This behavior trickled down into other areas of her life. Instead of spending money on mindless entertainment, she invested in personal growth material. Her creativity soared, and she came to Hardy with a plan: she’d implement new revenue and money-saving strategies for the organization and receive a percentage of the profits and cost-savings. By the end of the year she was earning more than $100,000 a year.

### Now Is the Time to Make the Right Choices

When it comes to the Compound Effect, the sooner you make small, positive changes, the better. For example, if you started putting $250 a month into an IRA at the age of 23, you wouldn’t have to invest anything more by age 40—you’d have more than $1 million by age 67. But if you didn’t start until the age of 40, you’d have to continue investing until the age of 67, when you’d end up with less than $300,000.

But don’t use the excuse that it’s too late to start; it’s _never_ too late to use the power of the Compound Effect. Starting _now_ is the key, no matter how old you are. If you’ve always wanted to play the piano but think it’s too late because you're 40, understand that if you start now, by the time you retire you’ll have been playing the piano for 25 years!

> **Example:** **Choosing to Succeed**
> 
> Hardy met a woman named Beverly who was overweight and convinced she could never do anything like run a half-marathon. Hardy assured her she could and found her motivation: an upcoming high school reunion where she longed to look fabulous.
> 
> This motivating goal led her to follow a simple plan. First Hardy had her map out a mile loop near her home and told her to walk that loop three times a week for two weeks. Next, he had her slowly jog, but switch to walking if she felt winded. Seven weeks from starting the process, she could jog the full mile.
> 
> Beverly’s choice to get fit for her reunion fueled her new healthy habits, and the Compound Effect was set in motion. She upped her exercise slowly, and within 9 months she could run 13.5 miles and had lost weight, but the ripple effect was even greater. Feeling more energy and self-esteem, her interaction with her husband and children improved and became more loving, and her career benefitted from her newfound energy.
