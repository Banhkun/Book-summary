## Chapter 1: Putting the Compound Effect Into Action

Consistency is the key to success, but doing what you need to do on a consistent basis remains a stumbling block for many people trying to achieve their goals.

From an early age, Hardy learned the power and importance of positive habits applied consistently. He likens himself to the tortoise from the tale of the tortoise and the hare—able to win any race because of positive, consistent progress.

Raised by a single father who stressed hard work, discipline and responsibility, Hardy grew up with a “no excuses” mentality that set him up for achievement. He attributes his success to believing in and living the Compound Effect every day—something his dad made sure of.

But most people face hurdles becoming a true believer in the Compound Effect. They haven’t experienced the payoffs of the Compound Effect principle, don’t understand how much hard work is involved, and expect quick fixes. Let’s examine these hurdles and learn how to get around them to get on board with the Compound Effect.

### Hurdle #1: You Haven’t Yet Reaped the Rewards of the Compound Effect

If you haven’t yet experienced the payoff of the Compound Effect, it’s hard to buy into the idea. The Compound Effect means reaping big rewards from a series of small, good choices. The results are huge but don’t come immediately. Change, at first, feels imperceptible.

Because change doesn’t happen right away, many people give up on self-improvement. They quit exercising after a few days because they’re still overweight, or they stop contributing to their retirement plan because they could use that cash. **What people don’t grasp is that these small, smart choices, adhered to consistently over time, create huge changes**.

#### **Example 1: $3 Million or a Penny**?

What if you were offered a choice between a $3 million cash payout or a penny that doubles in value each day for 31 days? The $3 million is tempting, but surprisingly, the penny results in more money.

If you took the $3 million and your friend took the penny, by day five you’d have your $3 million and your friend would have 16 cents. By day 10, your friend would have $5.12. After 20 days, the friend would have only $5,243 in comparison to your millions. But then the magic of the Compound Effect happens: by day 31, your friend would have $10,737,418.24.

The principle of consistency over time rewards your friend with three times as much money—but in the beginning, the right choice was so hard to see.

#### Example 2: Three Friends

Three friends, Larry, Scott, and Brad, live very similar lives as far as income, marriage, health and body weight (they all have a little flab). Larry says he’s happy and goes about his life not making any changes—but he does complain that “nothing ever changes.”

Scott decides to make small, positive changes. He reads every day and listens to something inspirational during his work commute. He decides to cut 125 calories a day from his diet, and finds it easy to do. He starts walking 2,000 steps more per day, and this change is easily incorporated into his life. He sticks with these simple choices.

Brad decides he wants a little more fun in his life. He buys a big TV so he can better enjoy his favorite shows. He starts sampling rich recipes and desserts, and he installs a bar in his home, having an extra drink each week.

After five months, the three friends are the same as ever. No one would notice anything different about them. By the 27th month, however, the changes are startling. Brad, who added about 125 calories a day with his drinks and new recipes, has gained 33.5 pounds. He’s not happy at his job, doesn’t feel great, and his marriage is unsteady.

But Scott, who cut 125 calories a day, has lost 33.5 pounds. **Brad now weighs 67 pounds more than Scott**. Scott also put in 1,000 hours reading and listening to self-improvement material, which he put into practice at work, earning a raise. His marriage is happy. Larry, of course, is exactly the same—except perhaps slightly more bitter.

The Compound Effect works both ways—you can use it to your benefit (like Scott) or let it work against you (like Brad). It may appear to be miraculous, but in reality making big changes comes from small, smart choices, repeated consistently over time.

#### The Ripple Effect

This example shows how one very small change can have a ripple effect, causing other unexpected changes—for good or bad.

The small choices Brad made created a ripple effect across his life. For example, one of the bad habits Brad developed was eating rich food more often. He learned how to bake delicious muffins; his family loved them and he felt proud. He began to cook and bake more and eat more of his own handiwork. The extra food, however, lowers his energy. He doesn’t sleep as well and is crankier. The crankiness spills over into work, and he receives negative feedback.

With lower energy and more stress, he eats even more comfort food and stops taking walks with his wife. He grows unhappy, dissatisfied with himself and others. His wife misses his company and grows unhappy and distant. Their marriage suffers as Brad refuses to look inward, instead finding fault with his wife.

In contrast, the calorie counting, mental stimulation, and increased exercise Scott engaged in had a positive ripple effect across his life, spilling over into his career and marriage.

### Hurdle #2: Hard Work Over Time Is Required

It’s also difficult to buy into the Compound Effect because we’re not used to putting in hard work over long periods of time to get the results we want. **The Compound Effect is a challenging system because it’s not about instant payoffs—you have to put in the work.**

To truly succeed, we have to regain the work ethic of the older generations. Think about your grandparents; they likely worked hard, developed good habits, and practiced discipline over their lifetimes. Today, however, many of us suffer from a complacent, entitled mentality and don’t value such success skills as grit and hard work.

We may reach a certain level of success, but then we get comfortable and slack off—we stop doing what led to our initial success. Hardy likens this to the frog in boiling water who doesn’t jump out because the warming was so slow he never noticed he was getting cooked.

Real success that lasts requires a lot of hard work with maintained consistency, despite the shortcuts you may hear about in the media or from self-help gurus.

> **Nothing Fails Like Success**
> 
> A wonderful new beach restaurant opened up in Hardy’s home town. At first it was spotless, offered friendly service, and the food was incredible. People lined up and waited for more than an hour for a table. But success made the restaurant staff complacent; servers looked disheveled and lost their courteous ways; the food quality went down. This restaurant went out of business in a year and a half, done in by their own success—when they stopped doing what made them successful in the first place.

### Hurdle #3: There Are No Quick Fixes

Another reason the Compound Effect is hard to implement is because we’re all used to quick fixes. We believe success should come as quickly as all the other conveniences in our lives, such as fast food, overnight delivery, and instant hot water. You may be entranced by the idea of winning the lottery or hitting the jackpot in Vegas, but these scenarios are more than highly unlikely—you have about a zero percent chance of being the big winner.

The Compound Effect dispels the idea of a quick fix. **Success comes from continued effort—daily hard work and discipline compounded over time.** You can create the life of your dreams, but it won’t happen overnight.

The Compound Effect is always working. Whether it’s working to bring you success or failure is up to you. Using the Compound Effect to create a better life is a matter of making simple, positive changes—and sticking with them.
