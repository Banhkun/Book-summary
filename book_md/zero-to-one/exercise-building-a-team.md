## Exercise: Building a Team

Thiel argues that startups should choose people for their initial team who are as similar as possible to enable the team to work cohesively and efficiently from the start.

* * *

In building a team for your company or a potential new business, what common qualities would you look for?

Thiel also stresses the need to create a team identity. How would you encourage a common look and common interests so that your employees are “different in the same way?”

To attract talented people who have many options, you need a compelling answer to the question of why they should choose your company over others that might offer more pay and prestige. How would you answer this question? (Hint: Thiel says the answer must focus on why your mission and team are unique.)
