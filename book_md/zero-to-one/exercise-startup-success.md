## Exercise: Startup Success

To succeed, a company must have solid answers to the following questions: **Engineering** : Is your technology a significant advance or only an incremental improvement? **Timing** : Is this the right time to sell this technology? **Monopoly** : Are you targeting a big share of a small market? **People** : Do you have the right people on your team? **Distribution** : Do you have a plan to market and sell your product? **Durability** : Will you dominate your market in the next 10 to 20 years? **Secret** : Have you identified a unique opportunity overlooked by everyone else?

* * *

Answer the above questions for your company or a potential future business.

Which of your answers are the strongest? Which are the weakest?

How can you improve your weakest points?
