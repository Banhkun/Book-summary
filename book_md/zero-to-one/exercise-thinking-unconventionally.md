## Exercise: Thinking Unconventionally

Building a great company requires out-of-the-box thinking rather than following conventional wisdom. Often the truth is the opposite of what everyone believes.

* * *

Make a list of the most common conventional beliefs youâ€™ve heard at your company (things that are assumed to be true) about its product(s) and market.

What would be the opposite of each of these beliefs?

Could any of the opposite statements be true? If so, what are the implications?

What is something you believe that very few other people believe?

What is a promising area that has a ton of potential value, but that very few people are looking at?
