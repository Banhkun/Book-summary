## Exercise: What’s Your Worldview?

If you’re optimistic, you tend to think of the future as definable and definite, as something you can understand and shape. If you’re a pessimist, you think of it as uncertain and indefinite; since it's random, you can’t intelligently predict or plan for it.

* * *

What’s your view of the future? Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Explain your answer.

How much of a role do you believe luck plays in success?

How have your beliefs about the future affected the way you pursue your goals?
