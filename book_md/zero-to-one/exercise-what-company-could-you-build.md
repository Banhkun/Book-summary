## Exercise: What Company Could You Build?

A key question that Thiel poses to entrepreneurs is, “What valuable company hasn’t been started yet?” Answering it requires discovering a secret—for instance, seeing untapped potential or solving a problem by looking at it in a new way.

Think of a problem, inconvenience, or opportunity you encountered in the past week. What was it?

Why does this problem still continue to exist? What are people not getting right about solving this problem?

What might a radical business solution to this problem/opportunity look like?

If you had unlimited money, how could you build a company to address this problem or opportunity?
