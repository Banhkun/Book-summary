## Higher Education, Part One

Life at college would bring new opportunities, as well as new challenges for Tara. She began wriggling free from her family’s dogma, but was constantly reminded of just how profound an effect Buck’s Peak had on her. Her new experiences at college would force Tara to look at her old life on Buck’s Peak in a whole new light.

### Fish Out of Water

On New Year’s Day, Faye drove Tara to her new life at BYU. What struck Tara immediately was the noise in Provo, Utah, where the university was located. Growing up on Buck’s Peak, she had been accustomed to constant silence. Here, however, there was noise from crosswalk signals, motor traffic, and people on the streets.**It was her first small taste of culture shock.**

She received an even bigger shock when she met her roommates. One of them wore clothes that her father would have surely decried as frivolous and indecent, like tank tops with spaghetti straps and pink pajama bottoms with “Juicy” written on the back. They also shopped on the Sabbath and, overall, appeared to lead highly secular lives.**These were the _exact_ kind of women that her parents and Shawn had told her to stay away from.**

Tara quickly clashed with these roommates over issues of cleanliness and personal hygiene. Growing up, Gene had taught Tara that **practices like washing one’s hands after using the bathroom and disposing of rotten food in a garbage bag were frivolous**. Thus, Tara thought nothing of leaving moldy peaches in the refrigerator or only showering once a week.

Although obviously intelligent,**Tara lacked much of the foundational knowledge required for college-level work.** Elementary concepts like how to write essays were completely foreign to her, as were most of the basic facts of American and world history. She’d heard of figures like Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, but was completely lost when her professor began discussing the “philosophical underpinnings” of the American Revolution in the works of writers like the ancient Roman orator Cicero and the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume. Unsurprisingly, **she flunked her first American history quiz.**

#### A Shocking Knowledge Gap

In a Western art class, she learned of another massive gap in her knowledge about the world. She’d volunteered to read a section of their book during a class discussion, but she stumbled on a particular word, asking innocently, “I don’t know this word. What does it mean?”

The professor rolled his eyes and said, “Thanks for _that_ ,” while the rest of the class sat in silence. They thought she’d been joking. Afterward, a classmate told her that she shouldn’t make jokes like that, and that what they had been discussing wasn’t funny. But Tara hadn’t been joking. She was deadly serious about never having encountered this word before.

**Only later that day, when she looked it up online, did she come to understand the full gravity of this word she’d never heard before: “Holocaust.”** As she learned more, she was horrified by several things all at once—the barbarity of the event itself, the sheer power of man’s inhumanity to man, and her _own_ ignorance for having never heard of it. Later, Tara would discover that anti-Semitism was a core component of her father’s conspiratorial worldview. He believed that a cabal of Jewish bankers had conspired to start both world wars and that _they_ had actually been the architects of the Holocaust. Her understanding of the Holocaust was further hampered by the fact that she also didn’t know Europe was a continent composed of many countries, not one big country. Naturally, little of what the professor said made sense.

#### Making Progress

As with the ACT, Tara didn’t just lack foundational knowledge. **She didn’t know how to be a student, take a test, or properly study.** She knew little, and didn’t know _how_ to learn.

Her only test had been the multiple-choice ACT. She therefore assumed that _all_ tests were multiple-choice. It’s no surprise that she was baffled when she opened up her test booklet in her Western art course to find that the exam was in open-question format.

She also didn’t know that she was supposed to be _reading_ the assigned textbook. Because it was an art class, **she thought that all she needed to do was look at the paintings and sculptures in the book** and identify the artist and the specific work. Again, she failed her first exams in this course. It was only when a friend advised her to actually read the textbook that she began receiving B’s and even A’s.

In some other subjects, Tara found more success. Her English professor, for example, praised her natural talent as a writer, but **remarked that her writing was oddly formal and stilted**. Tara didn’t share that her writing style reflected the fact that she’d only learned to read by studying texts like the Bible and the Book of Mormon. Her prose naturally mimicked the arcane style of those works, because she knew little else.

Tara began to do better and better as she became more accustomed to university life and discovered how to truly _be_ a student. By the time the semester ended, she had done well in courses in history, English, music theory, and Western civilization. **She was confident that she’d be able to qualify for a partial scholarship** , which she desperately needed to remain in school.

### Back Home

Unfortunately, Tara wasn’t entirely free from Buck’s Peak. When she returned home for the summer, she was told that she wouldn’t be able to stay with the family unless she worked with her father in the junkyard. She would be forced to break her promise to herself to never again work for her father. She vividly recalls the sinking feeling that**all her accomplishments at college, all of her personal and intellectual growth, was negated** by having to revert to her old way of life.

During this summer, Tara also struck up a friendship and quasi-romantic relationship with Charles, one of the young men with whom she’d been involved in the theatre program. As an outsider to her world, Charles was able to prompt Tara to question much of what she’d been told to believe growing up. He told her that he was angry on her behalf that she’d been deprived of a proper education. He pulled back the curtain on things Tara had never noticed or thought about before, like the fact that the Westover home smelled like rotten plants from Faye’s herbal remedies practice. Bit-by-bit,**Tara was learning just how _abnormal_ her life with her family was.**

She was beginning to see how absurd her father’s obsessions with the Illuminati and the supposedly oppressive and socialist federal government were. **Her attempts to defend her upbringing now felt rote, perfunctory, and emotionless.** Despite her obvious fondness for Charles, however, she was unable to take the next steps in their relationship. Her family’s patriarchal and puritanical lessons and values still exerted**a powerful hold over her sexual freedom**.

Unfortunately, being back home also meant that **she was once again exposed to Shawn’s cruelty and abuse**. The doctors at the hospital had warned that Shawn’s personality may have been irrecoverably altered following the brain injury he sustained from the motorcycle crash. He had become even _more_ hostile, impulsive, and wantonly mean than he was before.

He took to mocking her college education and stigmatizing her for it, labelling her “uppity.” He also began calling her “wench” and “Wilbur” (a reference to the pig from _Charlotte’s Web_) when he was supervising her work in the junkyard, and often in front of Charles. Soon, however, he began branding her with a far worse epithet.

(Shortform note: Shawn started calling Tara the N-word. It’s impossible to summarize this part of the book without using the word itself, and it’s important to include it, as it gives powerful insights into Shawn’s personality, Tara’s continued intellectual growth, and the Westover family’s racial politics.)

After a long day in the junkyard, Tara’s hands and face would often be covered in black soot. As a result, **Shawn began calling her “nigger.”** Tara wasn’t entirely unfamiliar with this word (she’d heard Gene use it before), but she was **completely ignorant as to its true weight, meaning, and history.**

In her first semester at BYU, however, she’d learned about slavery, Jim Crow, and the civil rights movement. She came face-to-face with the brutal reality of race relations in American history. This was a story she’d never heard before: even **iconic figures like Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. were completely unknown to Tara**. To the extent that she knew _anything_ about America’s racial past, she’d been raised to believe that slavery had been a benevolent institution and that stories of anti-black violence and discrimination were largely myths. She now saw how **anti-black racism was part-and-parcel of her father’s belief system.** Even years later, while visiting Tara at college, he became upset when he saw a poster of MLK in Tara’s room, branding the civil rights icon a communist.

Tara’s new understanding of the history of her own country (especially the relatively recent history of the civil rights movement) caused her to see events and people in her own life in an entirely new light. **She saw people like Shawn and her father as being the villains, the opponents, in a long struggle for freedom and equality**. For the first time, she was able to place her family’s beliefs and practices in a wider historical context.

#### Taking Medicine

Tara was learning to rebel against her family’s orthodoxy in other ways as well. One night, while driving with Charles, she complained of a debilitating migraine. She told him that she had taken some lobelia and skullcap for the pain. Predictably, Faye’s homeopathic remedy failed to alleviate Tara’s symptoms.

Charles then suggested to Tara that she take a real painkiller, which he proceeded to retrieve out of his medicine cabinet. Tara initially balked. Imbibing the products of the hated and feared medical establishment would fly in the face of one of her father’s core teachings. But as Charles questioned _why_ she believed taking a pill would be so harmful, she realized she had no answer. She couldn’t even articulate what she thought would happen if she took the pill.

She gave in to reason and took the painkiller. Within 20 minutes, her headache was gone. **The pill had been more effective in 20 minutes than lobelia and skullcap had been in a lifetime.**

### A Second Assault

Tara returned to school in the fall and continued her studies, though she was driven to a state of anxiety by her college algebra course. She asked Charles to tutor her in the subject, which he agreed to do when she returned home to Buck’s Peak for Thanksgiving.

Charles joined the Westovers for dinner for the holiday. It would be an evening Tara would never forget. Shawn was in a particularly hostile mood at dinner, making cruel and snide remarks to Tara and Charles. When Tara told Shawn not to touch her after he jabbed one of his fingers into her ribs, the situation rapidly escalated out of control.

**Shawn pinned her down to the floor (just out of view of everyone else), cutting off airflow through her windpipe**. Later on in the evening, he gut-punched her as she was bringing dinner rolls to the table. When Tara protested again (her resistance was obviously a trigger for him), Shawn once more **pinned Tara to the floor and dragged her to the bathroom, where he shoved her face into the toilet.** In the course of this attack, Tara broke her toe. This time, the assault was in full view of the family—and Charles.

Tara hated the idea of Charles seeing her in this state—as a victim, a helpless pawn of Shawn’s. So she tried to present it as a game, in which Shawn was only playfully roughhousing with her and there was no need to worry. She even made a point of laughing throughout her assault, **to give off the impression that everything was just a joke, happening with her full consent.**

Charles was deeply disturbed by the incident and by Tara’s refusal to acknowledge what had really happened. He parted ways with her, telling Tara that _she_ was the only one who could rescue herself from her family.

### A Final Assault

Shawn would attack Tara on one more occasion. When she was back home a few weeks later for Christmas, she was out driving with Shawn when they happened upon Charles’ car in the parking lot of the local gas station. Shawn, with cunning instinct, immediately recognized that Tara didn’t want Charles to see her with Shawn, especially since she was covered in soot and grime from the junkyard. Shawn, of course, **saw an opportunity to inflict maximum humiliation and emotional trauma on his younger sister**. He demanded that she accompany him inside.

When she refused, he snapped. **He dragged her out of the car and pinned her face-down onto the asphalt parking lot, breaking her wrist and ankle in the process**. This attack was in public, so there were plenty of onlookers (though thankfully not Charles).

Tara retreated into the same defensive shell that she’d used during the Thanksgiving attack the month before: she pretended that it was all a joke. **She made a public show of laughing as Shawn paraded her through the store at the gas station** , in front of the people who’d witnessed the attack in the parking lot just minutes before. She ignored the pain from her wrist and ankle.

When they returned home, Tara went to her room to write about the experience in her diary. She couldn’t understand why Shawn did these things to her, even when she’d told him not to touch her and had _begged_ him to stop. Later, Shawn came into her room with an ice pack and told her that she should always feel free to tell him if his “fun and games” went too far. In other words, **_she_ was responsible for not having stopped him.** He was gaslighting her, denying her reality, and making her think that she had _imagined_ the entire encounter as being more violent than it really was. It was, yet again, classic abuser behavior.

Tara had long convinced herself that Shawn’s violence was _her_ fault—that if she’d just asked Shawn to stop in the right way, he would have. This night, however, **she wrote about the experience in her diary plainly and honestly,** without resorting to vague or euphemistic language. It was one of her first steps toward recognizing what Shawn truly was—and recognizing, also, how her family had implicitly condoned his abuse.

Years later, as a survivor, Tara would understand why she had come to believe that Shawn’s emotional manipulation had all been her fault. She saw that it was more comforting to accept the abuse as stemming from a flaw in herself, rather than in him—because if it was _her_ defect, she would at least be able to control it. She was displaying a common symptom of abuse victims, that of **sympathizing with their abuser or rationalizing away the abuse they suffer.**
