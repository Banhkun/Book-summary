## The Mountain, Part Two

Growing up in the Westover home, Tara experienced more than just ideological extremism. Her parents’ beliefs had real-world consequences for the children, which frequently put Tara and her siblings in grave danger. Whether it was through near-death experiences in car crashes or maimings in the junkyard where Gene forced his children to work, it was a constant struggle for survival on Buck’s Peak.

### Happy Birthday

**Tara had no birth certificate** , because she hadn’t been born in a hospital or delivered by a licensed medical professional with a witness present. Her family had chosen not to register her birth with the courthouse in town. Officially, the state of Idaho had no record of her existence. Even today, her actual date of birth cannot be determined with 100 percent certainty.

When Tara was nine, **Faye decided that she should obtain birth certificates for all her children**. This proved more difficult than expected, as she had no documents that could prove her children were, in fact, her own. The only documents for Tara were her christening and her baptismal records, each of which had a different birth date. Eventually, Tara was only issued a Delayed Certificate of Birth after Grandma-down-the-hill swore an affidavit in court attesting that Tara was born on September 27, 1986 (though there was internal family disagreement about the accuracy of this date).

Up until this point, Tara had never known when to celebrate her birthday. As an adult, Tara now sees how **this most basic childhood experience had been denied to her**. At the time, of course, she accepted it as normal. She believed that she _had_ a birthday (she _had_ been born after all) just like everybody else—it just changed from year-to-year.

But there would still be uncertainty around Tara’s actual birthday, even within her family. Years later, when Tara was applying to college,**** even Faye couldn’t remember whether her daughter was 16 or 20, observing, **“It’s hard to keep track of how old you kids are.”**

### The Crash

The family would take annual trips to visit Gene’s parents during the winter months, when the latter would snowbird in Arizona. This was usually to combat **Gene’s intense bouts of depression** , which would set over him during the harsh winters on the mountain in Idaho. He would take to bed and refuse to emerge from his room for days at a time.

Faye explained this away by likening Gene to a sunflower: he’d wither and die in the snow, so he needed to be replanted in the sun. Looking back, **Tara now sees that this was a symptom of her father’s mental illness** —but, like so many other things in her childhood, she accepted her mother’s rationalizations for the family’s need to uproot itself and cater to Gene’s needs.

While the family was in Arizona, Gene would assail Tara’s grandmother with his unorthodox views. When he found out that she was going to see the doctor, he informed her that herbalism (as practiced by Faye) was a sacred calling, one which used God’s own bounty on earth to cure sickness. He contrasted this with the**godless, unnatural, and dangerous practices of modern medicine**.

He claimed that “doctors and pills” were Grandma’s gods, and that she had given herself over to false idols. He thoroughly believed that doctors were in the business of slowly poisoning their patients over time. He even accused his mother of being an agent of the Illuminati.

(Shortform note: The Illuminati were an eighteenth-century Enlightenment group that operated in Bavaria. Modern-day conspiracy theorists like Gene, however, believe that an all-powerful and clandestine group that calls itself the Illuminati secretly controls world events, ranging from the French Revolution to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. They frequently claim that presidents of the United States are tools of the Illuminati. The conspiracy theory has many adherents among members of the far-right American militia movement.)

One day during this trip, Gene abruptly declared that the family would have to hit the road back to Idaho, immediately. The family began their journey home in the early evening, meaning that they would be doing most of the 12-hour drive in the middle of the night. No one on board was wearing a seatbelt. Gene made Tara’s 17-year-old brother Tyler do the entire drive in their uninsured vehicle.

Around 6 am, **Tyler fell asleep at the wheel, having driven nonstop all night through Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.** The resulting crash was horrific. In addition to the family’s new collection of broken bones, missing teeth, severe bruises, and emotional trauma, the car was surrounded by downed power lines. A farmer who witnessed the crash called the utility company to deactivate the lines. Only then could the family emerge from the car in relative safety. Miraculously, everyone survived and managed to make it back to Buck’s Peak, but it was a defining moment for young Tara.

#### Mom Transformed

Faye came out of the crash worst of all. Although she was never properly treated for it, her post-crash symptoms as described by Tara clearly point to a severe and permanently damaging concussion.

Tara recalls that **her mother was never quite the same after the accident.** She had difficulty being around bright lights, and confined herself to the basement for a week after the crash, where she could rest in darkness. Her eyes, meanwhile, had swollen to a deep black. Later, Tara would learn that these **“raccoon eyes” were a classic sign of serious brain injury.** She would also continue to suffer from near-constant migraines, for which her homeopathic remedies were of little use. Most troublingly, Faye’s short-term memory was impaired. In the ensuing months, she would repeatedly call Tara by the names of her siblings.

One might have thought that the trauma she suffered would have been a wake-up call to Faye, vividly demonstrating to her the danger in which her husband had placed the entire family. But the opposite happened. Her survival **only seemed to _deepen_ Faye’s belief in her healing powers. **Although still clearly suffering from the effects of the concussion, Faye redoubled her efforts to manufacture large batches of essential oils out of herbs like eucalyptus, sandalwood, and ravensara. She mixed different combinations together, believing that each mix had specific properties that could cure specific ailments. Over the years, she would create dozens of these “medicines.”

She also delved deeper into pseudo-scientific New Age “energy healing,” believing that she could use the power of energy to cure injuries and disease, **simply by laying her hands on someone in the right places and applying the right amount of pressure**. She claimed that God was working through her fingers. Tara recalls diagrams of chakras and pressure points appearing throughout the house around this time.

Soon, Faye began selling her blended oils and charging clients for “energy work.” She may have had no license or training, but **Tara’s mother was well on her way to becoming the established medical authority for fellow off-the-grid families in their county.** Eventually, Faye came to believe that she could diagnose illnesses simply by touching people and objects. In effect, she had come to believe that she possessed magical powers.

### Tyler

The accident (and his guilt at having fallen asleep behind the wheel) may have been the final push that Tara’s older brother Tyler needed to leave home. One month after the accident, in the summer before Tara turned ten,**he declared that he would be leaving home to attend college**. His determination to learn was truly remarkable. He had a lifelong love of learning and was a true autodidact, having taught himself algebra and calculus.

Unsurprisingly, Gene was displeased with his son’s decision. For Gene, college was the epicenter of secular, godless sin and government indoctrination. He had told Tara that college was “extra school for people too dumb to learn the first time around.” He believed that liberal or “socialist” college professors (a favorite epithet of his and a frequent target of his denunciations) set themselves above God, believing their wisdom to be greater than His. That Tyler intended to study at Brigham Young University, an institution run by the Church of Latter-Day Saints, made no difference to Gene.

Tyler had always been different. He was intellectually curious, studious, and enjoyed reading books. His demeanor and interests set him apart from his more rough-and-tumble brothers, whom Tara would later liken to **a pack of wolves—always testing one another, always looking for weakness.** This formed the basis of a special bond between Tara and Tyler. It was Tyler who introduced her to classical music, and helped ignite her first sparks of interest in the world outside Buck’s Peak.

Once he left for college, he rarely returned home. Years later, Tara, looking back through the lens of her _own_ liberation from the family, would observe that he was **“building a new life for himself across enemy lines.”**

His decision to go to college and openly defy Gene’s propaganda planted a seed in Tara. It would serve as a powerful example of a life that could be achieved outside the confines of her isolated world. Tara would later walk the path that had been paved by Tyler.

#### “Doing School”

Given her own meager crumbs of an education, Tara saw Tyler’s pursuit of college as revolutionary. **The only education she had received had been homeschooling from her mother**. Faye would announce the beginning of these sessions by declaring that they would be “doing school.” Initially, Faye had been idealistic about homeschooling, believing that she was offering her children a _better_ education than what they would receive in public school. Even homeschooling, however, soon ran afoul of Gene’s ideological and religious fanaticism. He wanted the children to learn practical skills, and fought with Faye to have them start working in the family’s junkyard.

Just as with her midwifery and her homeopathy, **Faye had no formal training or license to properly conduct homeschooling**. Sadly, the results showed. Tara’s brother Luke was barely literate, while Tara herself had almost no instruction in basic math. Faye’s only teaching materials were some paperbacks and a motley collection of old textbooks. When she was “reading” her math textbook, Tara would usually just run her finger down the centerfold of the page—when it reached the bottom, she credited herself with having “read” the page. Occasionally, however, Tara’s literary diet would be supplemented by trips to the local library, where she and her siblings were able to read some children’s books.

Even this makeshift schooling came to an end when Gene’s ideology hardened and became even _more_ extreme as Tara grew older. **“Doing school” had ceased altogether by the time she was eight.** For Tara’s family, schooling was secondary to work around the house and in the junkyard, where Gene would scrap metal from old cars, which served as the main source of the family’s meager income. After “doing school” was discontinued, Tara tried to keep up her education on her own as best as she could, reading whatever textbooks were still laying around.

She also read the New Testament and the Book of Mormon (the touchstone documents of her family’s faith) and began writing rudimentary essays on the doctrines of faith and sacrifice. Even though the arcane prose in these texts was difficult, Tara now sees that she was learning a critical skill: **the patience to read things she could not yet understand.**

### In the Junkyard

Tyler may have been off to college, but Tara’s future (for now) was in the junkyard with her father and brothers. This, along with Faye’s midwifery, was the family’s means of income. The winter after Tyler left, **Tara began working as part of her father’s junkyard crew—at the age of ten.**

She describes the junkyard as a dangerous and desolate place, cluttered with leaking car batteries, rusting corrugated tin, and jagged pieces of brass piping. Tara’s job was to sort aluminum, iron, copper, and steel. **Gene was more concerned with efficiency than safety**. He even compelled Tara to _remove_ her rubber working gloves and hard hat, telling her that they would only slow her down.

Tara quickly realized how hazardous working in the junkyard would be. She frequently saw her brothers getting maimed or burned. She’d even seen other members of the work crew lose fingers while cutting metal in the junkyard. Tara herself was hit in the stomach with a steel cylinder that her father had hurled through the air in an attempt to get it into a sorting bin.

Of course, the only medical treatment anyone received was from Faye’s ineffective homeopathic remedies.

Gene reassured his daughter that God and the angels wouldn’t let any harm come to her. Based on what she’d already seen, Tara was beginning to have her doubts.

#### Near-Death Experiences

One day, Gene forced Tara to pack iron scraps into a flatbed trailer, _while_ he was operating a forklift that was dumping more iron into the trailer. **Tara was stabbed in the leg by a piece of iron, then nearly crushed to death** by the load of iron that her father was dumping onto her from the forklift. As was typical, Gene was barely concerned with Tara’s safety and wellbeing after this incident, being more upset about the fact that she would now be losing a working day due to her injury.

Based on her diagnostic method of laying hands on Tara’s body, Faye concluded that Tara had suffered kidney damage. Tara was given a mixture of juniper and mullein flower and sent on her way.

On another occasion, when Tara was 10, her older brother Luke accidentally set his legs on fire in the course of draining gasoline from old cars in the junkyard. As no one was home, **Tara had to treat his burns** by wrapping her brother’s legs in garbage bags and placing them in water. Throughout, she was traumatized by Luke’s relentless screams of agony. Later, Faye and Gene spent the night with a scalpel, removing the bits of plastic from the garbage bag that had fused to the burn wounds.

The children were instructed to lie about Luke’s accident on behalf of their parents. If anyone asked, they were told to say that Luke was sick. Gene warned that the Feds would take the children away from the family if word got out, and that Luke would be put into a government hospital, where he would succumb to a fatal infection.
