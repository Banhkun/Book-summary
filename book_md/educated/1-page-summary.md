## 1-Page Summary

_Educated_ is the autobiographical story of Tara Westover’s journey from being the child of extreme anti-government, anti-science, and religious fundamentalist Mormon parents to becoming a Cambridge- and Harvard-educated PhD.

Born in her family’s isolated home in the mountains of Idaho, **Tara was denied a proper education as a child**. Her father, Gene, believed that public schools were a tool of the “socialist” U.S. government, meant to “brainwash” people. As such, he kept his children out of school and relegated them to a dubious homeschooling curriculum designed by his wife, Faye, who lacked any proper credentials for educating children. There were no tests or exams at Faye’s rudimentary school, and **Tara mostly learned to read and write by studying the Holy Bible and the** **Book of Mormon**. Because of this, Tara had enormous gaps in her knowledge—she barely knew the basics of elementary math and was deeply ignorant on key historical facts about the U.S. and the world.

Her father was also deeply hostile to what he termed the “Medical Establishment,” **believing that modern medicine was a plot cooked up by the government to poison people**. A key part of his religious fundamentalism was his belief that God had provided all the medicine one would ever need in the form of natural herbs. **He and his wife were committed to homeopathy, alternative medicine practiced in the home**.

Faye believed herself to be a gifted healer, far more effective than any actual doctor (though she lacked any medical training). Thus, the family treated colds, sore throats, and even severe cuts, bruises, burns, and concussions with homemade concoctions of lobelia, skullcap, and eucalyptus. Hospital visits were simply out of the question. As Tara recalls, **these remedies were almost never effective** and they subjected her and her siblings to needless and easily-preventable suffering throughout their childhood.

When she was a teenager, **Tara began to be abused by her older brother Shawn**. On several occasions, he beat her, dragged her across rooms by her hair, stuck her face in the toilet, and even broke her wrist, toes, and ankles. Tara was tormented by the abuse and **manipulated into believing that it had been _her_ fault**. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given their patriarchal worldview and deeply anti-feminist beliefs regarding women’s sexuality and role in the home, **Tara’s parents turned a blind eye to Shawn’s violence** and refused their daughter’s requests to intervene and protect her.

By the time she was 16, Tara could see that she was unsafe living in her home. She knew that if she stayed, she would just settle into the same pattern of life her mother had: marrying a man, moving to a corner of the Westover property, giving birth to a large brood of children (Tara was one of seven), and learning homeopathy and midwifery herself. This did not appeal to her and **she yearned for a life that would let her explore the full potential of her own mind.**

With the encouragement of her older brother Tyler, who had already found an escape through education, Tara took the ACT and was accepted into Brigham Young University, despite having no formal education at all. As a student, Tara began to learn just how deep her ignorance ran. In one class discussion, she inadvertently revealed that **she had never heard of the Holocaust**. In an art history course, she didn’t know that she had to actually _read_ her textbook instead of merely looking at the pictures. But she was able to learn from her early missteps, make up ground, and began earning Bs and As in her courses. **She began to shed the ideological baggage of her father’s beliefs** , wearing wearing normal clothing (which her father would have derided as “frivolous” or even “whorish”); going to the doctor when she got sick; and seeing her womanhood as something to be celebrated, rather than scorned and repressed.

Eventually, **she did well enough to earn a place in a prestigious study abroad program at Cambridge University** in England. Cambridge was unlike anything Tara had ever seen, with its medieval architecture and refined air of intellectual exploration and discovery. While there, she deeply impressed the seasoned and renowned scholars who served as her advisors, with one professor calling her term paper on 18th-century political philosophy one of the finest he’d ever seen written by an undergraduate. Later, **Tara was accepted as a graduate student and then a PhD candidate at Cambridge** and earned a coveted Visiting Fellowship at Harvard. She studied 18th- and 19th-century political thought and explored her own religion of Mormonism as an intellectual movement. Ten years after first setting foot at BYU, **she defended her thesis and earned her PhD: she had become Dr. Westover.**

While she was pursuing her graduate studies, Tara became aware that Shawn’s victims included more than just herself. **She learned that sister Audrey, Shawn’s past girlfriends, and his wife had all been brutalized by her brother**. Things came to a head one evening while Tara was visiting home, when Shawn threw his wife out of their trailer in the dead of winter and then proceeded to stab their dog to death in front of his young son. He then threatened to do the same to Tara. Tara was now determined to bring the long-buried matter of Shawn’s abuse to their parents. But, to her dismay, Gene and Faye refused to believe her and insisted that she was lying and trying to destroy the family. Even Audrey herself recanted her story and joined the rest of the family in discrediting and denouncing Tara.

Ultimately, **Tara was left with no choice but to break off contact with her family**. She knew that she needed to sever her ties with their cycle of abuse, paranoia, and control. As an accomplished woman, she was now determined to step fully into her new life and use the power of her intellect to shape her own path. She now saw that her education had been more than just the acquisition of fancy degrees or titles.**It had been an act of revolution, of self-emancipation, and liberation from the bonds of ignorance and control**.
