## The Mountain, Part One

**Tara Westover was one of seven children born into a family of hardline, anti-government survivalists** who lived on a remote mountain in rural Idaho. A Mormon fundamentalist, her father was an adherent (and active promoter) of an extreme ideology that welded together strands from the militia, anti-vaccination, and evangelical Christian movements.

His adherence to these views subjected his family to a number of privations.

  * Tara was born at home and didn’t see a doctor or nurse until her adulthood. 
  * She didn’t attend any school growing up, public or private.
  * She didn’t have a birth certificate, and the state of Idaho had no official record of her existence until she was issued a Delayed Certificate of Birth at the age of nine.



### The Voice of God

The family lived at the base of Buck’s Peak, a mountain in Franklin County, Idaho. Her father, Gene, had free reign to impose his beliefs on the rest of the family from this remote, isolated location, free from interference (or intervention) from the outside world.

(Shortform note: Westover has changed the names of the principal characters in the book, since they are real people, many of whom vigorously contest the version of events that she presents. As the reader, we only know these individuals by the names she assigns to them.)

Gene’s family had been living on the mountain for over 50 years, but his own siblings had long since moved away by the time Tara was born in 1986. He had a contentious relationship with his own mother, whom Tara knew as “Grandma-down-the-hill” and who lived (as her nickname would suggest) just down the hill from Tara’s immediate family. She did _not_ share her son’s hardline beliefs and **frequently clashed with him over his refusal to send his children to school**.

**Gene was a religious fundamentalist** , who believed that he could communicate directly with God and who took the text of the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon literally. He once forced the family to purge their refrigerator of dairy products and brought home 50 gallons of honey in his truck. He had done this because he had read in the Book of Isaiah, “Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.” He believed that God was telling him dairy was evil and honey was good.

He was an apocalyptic prophet,**believing that the family was living at a time close to the end of the world, or as he called the era, the “Days of Abomination.”** In his fevered end-times scenario, Gene believed that the government and the basic structure of society would collapse, paper currency would become worthless, and everything would descend into anarchy and chaos. To prepare the family for what he saw as an inevitability, Gene insisted on **stockpiling supplies of homemade canned goods, clothing, gold, and, most disturbingly, high quantities of military-grade weaponry**.

His faith also made him an avowed opponent of public school, and in fact, _all_ forms of education other than homeschooling. Indeed, he believed that**public school was a government conspiracy to indoctrinate children** and lure them from the righteous path of God.

He had come to this belief around the time he was thirty, before Tara was born. At this time, he had pulled her older brothers—Tony, Shawn, Tyler, and Luke—out of school. The children born _after_ this decision—Audrey, Richard, and Tara— _never_ had the chance to attend school at all, having come into the world after Gene had undergone his most intense phase of radicalization. He had removed the telephone from the house, stopped renewing his driver’s license, and started hoarding food and weapons. **_This_ was the only world these children knew. **Like the prophet he believed himself to be, Gene also felt compelled to share his gospel with others, and frequently hounded churchgoers at local Mormon houses of worship with his beliefs.

**He believed in living “off-the-grid” and adhering to strict self-sufficiency,** without any help from the government. Gene also had a persecution complex and delusions of grandeur, believing that the federal government was out to get him for defying the “brainwashing” being done in schools and other mainstream institutions of American society.

**He also detested what he saw as the “frivolities” of modern life,** like interior carpeting, wallpaper, and even most forms of basic hygiene (including basic practices like washing one’s hands after using the bathroom). Tara recalls learning early on that “frivolous” was a severe slander in her family. To him, frivolities were false idols, worshipped by unbelievers who had strayed from the true path of God.

#### Grandma-Down-the-Hill Makes an Offer

Around the time Tara was seven or eight, Grandma-down-the-hill presented her with a startling offer: to **take her to Arizona, away from her family, and enroll her in public school.** Tara was naturally apprehensive at the idea of leaving behind her family and the world she’d known. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she was also fearful about the idea of school itself, having been subjected to her father’s anti-education diatribes for her entire life up to that point.

Tara’s grandmother told her to wake up early and sneak out while her family was still asleep. She would then be taken to Arizona in her car. In the end, however, Tara simply couldn’t go through with it. She thought about the worry she would cause her parents and her siblings, and what they would imagine had become of her when she went missing.

When morning came, Tara did not come out to meet her grandparents. **For now, at least, she chose Buck’s Peak.**

### Freedom Fighters

Gene also became obsessed with the story of Randy Weaver and his family during Tara’s early years. Gene told his family that the Weavers were their ideological and religious fellow travelers, “freedom fighters” who had come under the bootheel of the federal government for refusing to subject their children to the “socialist” indoctrination of public school.

He terrorized Tara and her siblings with the lurid story of how**federal agents had massacred the Weavers** in their cabin—and that the Westovers would surely be next, unless they took the necessary steps to prepare and defend themselves.

This prompted a frantic stockpiling of weapons and munitions by Gene, an early display for Tara of **the paranoia and violence that was so crucial to her family’s beliefs.** He came home one day with a large cache of military-grade weaponry, including over a dozen SKS rifles (semi-automatics). Then, he purchased a machine that would enable the family to make their own bullets.

He also forced the family to prepare for the inevitable day when they would have to flee to the mountains to escape the Feds. Tara recalls days of endlessly canning peaches and preparing MREs (meals ready-to-eat) to ensure the family would have enough supplies to survive on their own in the wilderness.

### Herbal Remedies

**Gene believed that the “Medical Establishment” injected brainwashing drugs into people’s bodies.** As a result, he refused to let the children go to the doctor, even when they sustained grievous injuries working in his junkyard or when they got debilitatingly sick.

This was another outgrowth of his religious fundamentalism. Gene insisted that God had provided all the medicine that anyone would ever need in the form of natural herbs and oils which could be manufactured and administered right in the home on Buck’s Peak. Indeed, **he would come to refer to these remedies as “God’s Pharmacy.”**

His wife Faye acted as the family’s primary medical caregiver, concocting homeopathic remedies for the children. **Tara and her siblings were treated with their mothers’ herbal mixtures of calendula, lobelia, and witch hazel.**

Once, when Tara was 12, she started suffering from painful sore throats. After Faye failed to reduce her swelling with echinacea and calendula, Tara was instructed to let the sun shine into her throat—to allow the supposed healing powers of the sun to cure her. For a month that winter, she laid out in the backyard of their home for up to 30 minutes every day, with her mouth agape, to no effect whatsoever.

Looking back, of course, Tara sees that these medicines were _never_ effective in curing illnesses, or even in relieving pain. **She endured years of needless suffering because of her parents’ anti-medical ideology.**

Nevertheless, Faye’s alleged expertise in homeopathic medicine won her a reputation as an effective healer among those in the area who similarly rejected medical science. When Tara was a child, Faye became an assistant to a midwife named Judy, helping this woman with home births for families who rejected conventional prenatal care or hospital deliveries. Faye’s entrance into the world of midwifery was largely at Gene’s behest, who insisted that it would be important for the family’s self-reliance if Faye knew how to deliver their future children (and grandchildren) free from the oppressive clutches of the state.

As an adult, Tara dryly notes that Judy had no formal credentials or training which would have qualified her to deliver babies—she was a midwife simply because she said she was.

### Midwifery

Tara soon came to see just how risky and frightening unlicensed midwifery could be. Faye was clearly distraught by the idea of wielding this kind of responsibility, in which life and death hung in the balance.

She shared stories with Tara of births in which the mother suffered from uncontrollable hemorrhaging, or where the baby had the umbilical cord wrapped around its neck. These were situations that could have been easily resolved had they taken place in a hospital setting: but they didn’t, and Faye had to guide the mother and child through these situations with her fragmentary medical knowledge. Still, she helped deliver dozens of babies under Judy’s “tutelage.” Eventually, when Judy moved away, Faye took over as head midwife.

The risks were high. Midwifery was legal in the state, but Faye had no license to practice it. If a delivery went wrong, she could face severe civil and even criminal penalties. While still harrowing, Tara sees with hindsight that **her mother derived a genuine sense of purpose from serving as a midwife**. For Faye, it was thoroughly empowering: _she_ was in charge, she wielded awesome responsibilities, and she was bringing in real money. This money even enabled the family to reinstall the phone line, which Gene had previously removed. Even Gene was willing to set aside his usual strictures against women working, as **he believed that Faye’s midwifery was a form of rebellion against the government**.

Tara recalls accompanying her mother to a delivery when she was nine. To this point, she had been proud of her mother’s work, and saw how the other people who were off the grid in their corner of Idaho respected her. On the way to the delivery, Faye rehearsed with Tara what the protocol would be if the Feds arrived. She was instructed to say nothing and give no information to the authorities. Tara was becoming aware of the risks. As her mom told her, **“All it takes is one mistake, and you’ll be visiting me in prison.”**
