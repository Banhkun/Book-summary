## Exercise: Reflecting on Educated

Think through the major themes and lessons from _Educated_.

* * *

Tara talks a lot about freeing herself from intellectual and emotional slavery. Why do you think education was so important in freeing her from this bondage?

How do you think families perpetuate the cycle of abuse?

As you reflect on Taraâ€™s experiences, how did your _own_ education shape your outlook and make you the person that you are today?
