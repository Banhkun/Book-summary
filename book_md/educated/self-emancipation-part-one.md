Removing from Favorites 

## Self-Emancipation, Part One

Tara continued to excel as a student, liberating her mind from the ideological constraints into which it had been placed for her entire life. She was thinking for herself and exploring her mind’s true potential. But she would soon be forced to confront the true ugliness of her family’s inner dynamics.

### Brave New World

When Tara returned to Cambridge as a graduate student through the Gates Scholarship, her status was different. She was not a guest, or a visitor. **She was a member of the university.**

Tara was learning about Isaiah Berlin’s concepts of negative and positive liberty. Negative liberty was the more basic concept, a freedom from external constraints. If you weren’t physically prevented from taking action, you enjoyed negative liberty. Positive liberty, however, was defined by a mastery of the self. This meant having **control over one’s mind, a freedom from irrationality and paranoia, and all forms of self-policing.**

Tara realized that it was this positive liberty that had been denied to her by her family.**She had not had freedom of thought,** but had instead been instructed to believe in irrational and paranoid lies, which had stunted her intellectual growth. She had also been a victim of self-coercion, most notably through her conviction that Shawn’s abuse had been _her_ fault and that she needed to censor or edit herself to prevent it. The time had come to, as Tara’s favorite Bob Marley lyric put, it **“Emancipate yourself from mental slavery.”**

Tara’s Cambridge friends were unlike any she’d known before. They were educated, erudite, and intellectually curious. She was set to embark on a whole new world of experiences as a full-fledged part of their world. She was no longer an outsider or observer looking in on this life: **it was _her_ life; she was of this world now.**

She embarked on new cultural experiences that she never could have enjoyed before, including drinking red wine for the first time and travelling to Rome. She was in awe of the ancient city, and captivated by the interplay of buildings from antiquity with the modern infrastructure that surrounded her. She saw that she and her friends debating philosophy by the Trevi Foundation or discussing literature in the shadow of the Colosseum gave life to the ancient capital: **they did not treat it as a dead relic, but instead made it the live background of their intellectual experience.**

She began to embrace feminism, a word that had been a vile smear in the Westover home.

Tara immersed herself in the writings of second-wave feminists like Betty Friedan, Germaine Greer, and Simone de Beauvoir. Reading these authors, Tara discovered that **centuries of repression by the patriarchy had obscured the true extent of women’s capabilities.**

At home, her womanhood had been stigmatized as a source of weakness or as something that needed to be guarded by the males in her life. Her sexuality was something to be repressed and her thoughts were castigated as being less worthy than those of men. But if the true extent of female capabilities had been unknowable since time immemorial, then Tara believed there was a positive corollary: that **all her potential was untapped and her possibilities were limitless.**

She excelled in her studies and began to write about the ideas in the works of John Stuart Mill, the 18th-century English philosopher. She was intrigued by his ideas of self-sovereignty, particularly as they pertained to her own previously repressed life. The quality of her work continued to impress her professors. After excelling in her graduate studies, Tara was accepted into the PhD program at Cambridge.

#### Examining Mormonism

As a PhD candidate, Tara would no longer be studying the work of other historians. She now had to produce an original piece of research, to become a historian herself. She chose to bring her experience full circle: by **studying Mormonism (her family’s faith) as an intellectual movement, not simply a religious one.**

She reexamined the works of the Mormon prophets Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, the texts that had been some of her earliest points of contact with the written word. This included studying practices like polygamy as social policy, not just as part of church dogma. Looking at her own religion in this scholarly and dispassionate way felt like an act of radical self-liberation. **It was a final act of shedding the fundamentalism and dogma of her youth.**

### The Cycle of Abuse Continues

The December after she submitted her final graduate paper for the semester at Cambridge, Tara had returned to Idaho for a visit. Despite the family’s new wealth, all was not well on Buck’s Peak.

Since Tara had left for good, Shawn had married a woman named Emily, who had given birth to a son, Peter. The boy was sickly, having been born with underdeveloped lungs. In fact, his attempted homebirth had been such a close call that the Westovers made one of their rare visits to a hospital to deliver him. Years before, Tara had tried to warn Emily about Shawn’s violent nature, but Emily reacted with complete denial, insisting that Shawn was a changed man who had learned how to treat women well.

One night while Tara was visiting, Emily came running to Gene and Faye’s home crying and shaking with terror. Shawn had gotten angry with Emily for bringing home the wrong crackers for their son and violently thrown her out of the trailer in the dead of winter.

Yet**Tara’s parents continued to do nothing about Shawn’s disturbing behavior** , even when it put their grandson and daughter-in-law at clear risk.

#### Audrey’s Story

In speaking about this incident with her sister Audrey, Tara learned that she, too, had been abused by Shawn. Being her older sister, Audrey had experienced all of it first.

Audrey would later recount to Tara via email that **she never believed their mother would intervene to stop him and protect her daughters**. But she was determined to do so _now_ , before the situation escalated any further. Tara was afraid to reveal the abuse to her parents out of fear that they _already_ knew and had chosen to do nothing about it.

The day after the sisters’ email exchange, Audrey confronted Faye about Shawn. Later that evening, Faye got in touch with Tara online to discuss the matter further. Faye confessed to having looked the other way at what her son was doing to her daughters. **She had wanted to believe that Shawn was irrational and not in control of his actions** and, therefore, not responsible for them. Faye acknowledged that she should have protected Tara and Audrey.

She also admitted that Gene was mentally ill, something she had never been willing to discuss with Tara before. It _seemed_ like they had reached a breakthrough. **But Faye’s support and understanding would sadly prove to be illusory.**

When Tara returned to Buck’s Peak for Grandma-down-the-hill’s funeral (which Gene had dominated with his usual religious ranting), Audrey told Tara that nothing had changed. **No one had taken any action at all.**

#### A Final Meeting with Shawn

The next Christmas, Tara returned home. She spent time with Shawn, who at least initially, appeared to be changed. His demeanor was calmer, his words more thoughtful. Perhaps he had mellowed with age. But this, too, was to prove false.

One night when they were alone, Shawn confronted Tara about her conversations with Audrey. Although Tara denied having spoken to her, Shawn once again revealed his malevolent streak. He called Audrey “a lying piece of shit” and said that he would be willing to murder her for her treachery (Shawn was often seen bradishing firearms), but he **“didn’t want to waste a good bullet on a worthless bitch.”**

That same night, Tara decided to reveal everything to her parents. Gene was outraged—at _Tara_. He demanded “proof” of the violent acts that Tara told him about. Tara insisted that he didn’t need proof, that the truth was plain and obvious and had been right in front of his face for years.

Faye, meanwhile, sat by completely silent, failing to rise in defense of Tara’s claims. Gene insisted that Shawn be given an opportunity to answer the charges in person. When Shawn came in, he gave Tara a knife that was covered in blood. He then told her that **if she didn’t use the knife on herself, he would use it on _her_.** This threat, made right in front of Faye and Gene, met with only mild rebukes from them.

Gene then lectured everyone about how little girls needed to be told how to behave appropriately around men, so as to not invite the wrong kind of attention. The full extent of the family’s**violence, patriarchy, misogyny, victim-blaming, and rationalization of abuse** was at last laid bare.

Tara fled the scene early the next morning, quite understandably in fear for her life. Later she would learn what the source of the blood on Shawn’s knife had been. He had brutally stabbed the family dog to death in a fit of rage when Gene had called him to the main house to answer Tara’s charges. This had happened in full view of his young son.

Tara later reflected that the choice of a knife was a deliberate one on Shawn’s part. He could have shot the dog in the head: there was hardly any shortage of guns around the Westover home. **He wanted to use the knife to cause maximum pain** , to feel the blood running down his hands as he did it, to experience the thrill of killing.

### Losing Her Family

Back at Cambridge, Tara tried to shut out the awful events that had recently transpired on Buck’s Peak. But she couldn’t completely escape.

Shawn began sending her threatening emails and even called her long-distance one evening to openly muse about whether he should hire an assassin to murder Tara or do the deed himself. Once again, her parents downplayed the significance of what Shawn said, saying that he was only joking or didn’t really mean it.

Eventually, Shawn stopped calling her. He finally wrote her a letter claiming that **he never wanted to speak to her again, and warned her to stay away from his wife and daughter**. Tara’s parents, even her mother, defended Shawn’s actions as entirely justified. To them, she’d hurled baseless accusations at her brother and caused him and his family endless emotional anguish. **To them,_she_ was the abuser**. It was a total denial and inversion of reality.

In the end, this force of denial even swept up Audrey, Tara’s erstwhile ally in the fight to bring the truth to light. **The family was closing ranks—against their youngest daughter.** Sure enough, Audrey likewise told Tara to stay away from her forever. She had lost her family.
