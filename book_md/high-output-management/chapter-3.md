## Chapter 3: Performance Reviewing

You’ve now learned about seven of the 11 important managerial activities. In this chapter, we’ll look at the eighth: giving performance reviews.

### Activity #8: Performance Reviewing

**The primary goal of a performance review is to _improve_ performance (not just assess it).** Giving performance reviews is a high-leverage activity because it affects the recipient’s performance for a long time—she often recalls the feedback. Performance reviews should be used in all organizations regardless of size because performance matters to every organization.

Managers don’t naturally write good reviews for three reasons:

  1. Delivering and receiving feedback can be unfamiliar and emotionally awkward. Most of us don’t have much practice at performance review-like work because American society discourages conflict (which negative reviews can generate). Recall good reviews you’ve been given for guidance.
  2. Assessing performance, especially of knowledge workers and managers (whose output depends on others’ output), is challenging.
  3. Performance is tied to compensation and rewards, two complicated and touchy subjects.



First, we’ll look at a four-step process for how to handle the first two difficulties and write good performance reviews. Then, we’ll look at how to handle the third difficulty.

### Step #1: Determine Expectations

**Before you can assess performance, you need to determine your expectations** so that the review can focus on whether or not your subordinates met them. (Failing to do this is the major problem with most reviews.)****

As you come up with your expectations, remember that output is an important marker of performance. Consider the recipient’s actions, not just her results, because:

**1\. Often, there’s a delay between doing an activity and seeing the output.** The output might not accurately reflect the results of the recipient’s activities during the period the review covers.

For example, when Grove was reviewing one of the managers who reported to him, the manager’s output measures were all strong—for example, sales had increased. There were some signs that not all was well—for example, the manager’s organization had higher-than-usual turnover—but Grove prioritized the output measures and gave the manager a good review.

The next year, the output measures had all declined. Grove looked carefully at the situation and realized that the offset between the manager’s activity and output was about a year. The output measures were only good the first year because they had been set up by previous employees and only come to fruition years later. Therefore, the manager hadn’t deserved the good review because the outputs didn’t reflect his actual performance. Interestingly, the manager’s performance had actually _improved_ since the first year, even though the output measure didn’t reflect this at all: His work just hadn’t come to fruition yet.

**2\. You need to assess both short- and long-term projects.** Long-term projects may not show output for years, so to evaluate them, consider the future gains and what they’re currently worth.

  * (Shortform example: A writer’s short-term work is to prepare articles. Her long-term work is to refine her workflow so she can write future articles faster. Her long-term work takes time away from her short-term work, therefore affecting her performance, but will speed up her work in the future.)



### Step #2: Assess Performance

Once you’ve established your expectations:

**1._Don’t_ ask the review’s recipient to write a self-review for you to reference** because:

  * If you give her the same feedback she provided you with, she’ll feel cheated.
  * She’ll feel like you weren’t paying enough attention to her—if you _had_ been paying attention, you’d have enough content for the review on your own.
  * Her review might sway you.



**2\. Gather data on the recipient’s performance** by collecting meeting notes, progress reports, and so on.

**3\. On a blank sheet of paper, write down every thought you have about the recipient’s performance.** Don’t edit them or order them by importance; just write down your stream of consciousness.

**4\. Once you’ve finished, look for broad themes.** Probably, you’ll see evidence that the person does the same actions in various contexts.

  * (Shortform example: If one of your subordinates always hands her reports in late, there’s a good chance that she also misses other deadlines.)



Don’t focus on potential or appearances because it doesn’t matter how professional someone acts or how good she _could_ be—for example, if the recipient is a manager and her team doesn’t perform, her performance is flawed.

**5\. Call these themes “messages” and make a list of them.** Then, support the messages with examples from your worksheet. (Ideally, none of your messages are surprising because you monitor the recipient and provide guidance regularly. If you _do_ discover something you weren’t expecting that might appear to the person as coming out of left field, include it anyway: They need to know about it to improve their performance.)

**6\. If the list of messages is too long for the recipient to remember, cut the less critical ones.** You can probably mention them in a future review.

### Step #3: Provide Feedback

As discussed, the goal of the performance review is to improve performance. Therefore, after assessing performance, you need to provide task-relevant feedback—feedback that is directly related to work—to guide recipients toward improvements.

There are three formats for providing feedback in performance reviews:

#### Type #1: Alternate Positives and Negatives

In this type of review, which is very common, managers list negative feedback and then temper it with positive feedback. These reviews aren’t very effective at improving performance because:

  * They’re superficial and disorganized, which will confuse the recipient.
  * The amount of feedback is overwhelming. People can only absorb so much at once, and if overloaded, they either can’t absorb any more or forget everything they have absorbed so far.



#### Type #2: Address a Major Problem

In this form of review, you discuss and try to resolve a single fire-worthy performance problem.

Likely, when you bring up a major problem, the recipient will go through the following stages:

**1\. Refuse to acknowledge the problem exists.** To show the recipient the problem is real, use examples and evidence.

**2\. Deny that it’s a problem.** Again, use evidence to show that the problem is real.

**3\. Accuse others of causing the problem.** In this stage, the recipient accepts that the problem is real but doesn’t think it’s her fault and therefore doesn’t plan to do anything about it. This tends to be the hardest step to get through. If she can’t get through it on her own, use your position power. Tell her that you understand she doesn’t see the problem the same way you do and that either of you could be right, but it’s your responsibility to the organization to give instructions.

**4\. Assume ownership of the problem.**

**5\. Find a fix.** You should help the recipient do this. It’s typically easier than the other steps because finding fixes is a matter of logic, and moving through the other steps is emotional, which is more difficult for some people to handle.

The recipient may not go through all the stages, and if she doesn’t move on from one, you can’t either (it’s impossible to talk about fixing a problem that someone refuses to admit even exists).

There are three ways this review can end:

  1. The recipient agrees with your assessment and agrees to implement your suggested fixes.
  2. The recipient doesn’t agree with your assessment but _does_ agree to implement your fixes.
     * For example, Grove once asked a manager to rewrite a performance review. The manager thought it was a waste of time, but he did do it.
  3. The recipient doesn’t agree with any of it.



**The first outcome is ideal because if the recipient feels the same way about the problem as you do, she’ll likely be more motivated to solve it. However, the second option is acceptable too** because while it might not be as emotionally comfortable to disagree, the problem will still get solved. The third option is not acceptable.

#### Type #3: Review a High-Achiever

In this review, you give feedback to a high achiever. Because the goal of a review is to improve performance, **_always_ include suggestions for improvement, even if someone is already doing well.** (When it comes to high performers, there’s a tendency to simply summarize the subordinate’s work instead of providing suggestions to improve.)

High performers do a lot for the organization, so if you can improve their performance even more, you’ll improve the company’s output significantly.

### Step #4: Deliver the Review

Once you've decided which type of feedback to provide, it’s time to deliver the review. You should give a recipient a written review in advance of your in-person discussion because:

**Reason #1:** It will give her time and privacy in which to process the information. She’ll be more prepared to discuss her review when the time comes.

**Reason #2:** If you give her the written review after the discussion, she might find something that surprises her because she wasn’t listening carefully in the meeting and get upset about it.

**Reason #3:** If you give the written review during the meeting, she may pay more attention to it than what you’re saying. Additionally, she won’t have time to prepare what she wants to say in response.

  * For example, one manager reads a subordinate a few paragraphs of the review and then they discuss. However, the subordinate is eager to hear the whole thing and may be distracted imagining what else is in the review instead of engaging in the discussion.



There are three important to-dos when it comes to delivering the in-person review:

**1\. Be honest and straightforward.** The process won’t be helpful if you give incomplete or wishy-washy feedback. Handle both negative and positive feedback with the same honesty and straightforwardness.

**2\. Confirm that the recipient is absorbing your feedback.** Just because you’re talking to someone doesn’t mean she’s listening or processing—if she’s emotional, thinking of what she’ll say in response, or is tuned out, she may not hear what you’re saying.

Use your senses to make sure you’re getting through to the recipient. For example, watch her as you’re talking to her. If her body language indicates she’s not listening, keep communicating. It’s your responsibility, not hers, to get the message across.

**3\. Focus on the recipient.** The review is about her, not you. You’ll likely have strong emotions because giving a review can be nerve-wracking, but you need to control them.

### Promotions and Performance

**Promotions should be based on performance because when you promote someone, you create a role model and show what qualities (high performance) you value.**

**Note that when you promote someone who’s _exceeding_ expectations, her performance will actually _decrease_** in the new position to merely _meeting_ expectations. This is because she’s still learning the role and navigating new responsibilities. As she gets more experience, training, and motivation, her performance will improve and she’ll start exceeding expectations again.

You may fear promoting exceptional people because you don't want their performance to decrease, even temporarily. However, **if you _don’t_ promote them, you’re wasting a resource.** Eventually, they lose motivation, stop exceeding expectations and drop back to only meeting them, and settle for being average.

If you promote someone to a position that she’s not even able to _meet_ expectations in, it’s not the failure of the employee, it’s the failure of management—you made a bad judgment call about her abilities. In this situation, you can fire her (which Grove thinks is “dead wrong”), or, you can “recycle” her—return her to the position she held (in which she exceeded expectations) before she was promoted. She’ll probably be embarrassed, but if you’re straightforward and supportive she’ll likely get over it quickly. You might promote her again later, once she’s gotten her confidence back and you’ve better assessed her readiness.

### Compensation and Performance

Compensation, like promotions, should be based on performance to reinforce the importance of good performance.

There are three ways to determine base salaries:

  1. **Experience** , which ties compensation only to time. The longer an employee has spent in a position, the more she’s paid. This model is the easiest to implement and to justify to employees, but it implies that performance isn’t important.
     * For example, good teachers and bad teachers who have the same amount of experience are paid exactly the same.
  2. **Merit** , which ties compensation only to performance and output. This model can be awkward because: 
     * It’s hard to completely discount experience when determining someone’s salary.
     * Money is limited (if you have lots of high performers, you can’t afford to pay them all well).
     * It’s socially awkward to rank people by performance because someone always comes in last.
  3. **Combination** , which is a compromise between the two systems above. Often, new people (with the same experience: none) start at the same base salary but get raises based on their performance.



**No matter which system you use, salaries should max out because all jobs have an upper limit to their value.** Once someone reaches the maximum, don’t keep giving raises on a schedule.

#### Paying Managers

When it comes to paying managers you supervise, whose output is more difficult to determine because it's based on other people’s, **you should create a performance bonus so that at least part of the managers’ compensation is based on team performance.** This reinforces that a manager’s output is related to her team’s**.** The higher the total compensation, the higher the percentage of the bonus should be.

  * For example, senior managers, who usually already have a lot of money (and therefore think of it as a measure of achievement rather than a means to satisfy a need) should get a higher percentage bonus, such as 50%. Middle managers should get 10-25% because they’re still motivated by the practical need for money rather than the status-based need—if they get enough money to satisfy all their basic needs, they might not need more and could stop working. 



To build an effective performance bonus system:

  * Determine which team’s performance is linked to the manager.
  * Determine what time period to consider when awarding the bonus. The manager needs to receive the bonus soon enough after doing the work that she can connect it to the work. Keep in mind that sometimes there’s a delay between activity and output, however, so the bonus may need to be somewhat delayed.
  * Determine if the bonus is based entirely on objective measures (for example, profit) or subjective measures (a performance review).
  * Determine how to keep the bonus system within budget. 
    * For example, don’t build a system that requires you to give large bonuses if the company is in a financial crisis.



For example, you might end up with a system where different factors contribute a percentage to the overall performance bonus. 5% could be determined by individual performance, 5% could be from the immediate team’s performance, and 5% from the company’s performance. This allows you to make each type of performance visible.

### Reviews of _You_

You can ask your subordinates to review you as a manager, but make it clear that _their_ review of _you_ is informal and advisory, while _your_ review of _them_ is your job. Never pretend you’re on the same level as your subordinates in a review.
