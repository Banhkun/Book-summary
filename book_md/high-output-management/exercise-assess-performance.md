## Exercise: Assess Performance

There’s a step by step process to assessing performance.

* * *

Choose an employee to evaluate. Where could you find data on her performance? Consider looking at progress reports, meeting notes, and so on.

Write down every thought you have about your employee’s performance.

What broad themes do you see on the list? (For example, the employee might consistently miss details: Her emails are full of typos, she misses items in lists, and she skips agenda items when she runs meetings.)

If you give the employee too much feedback at once, she’ll probably be overwhelmed and won’t remember any of it. What are the most important three themes from your list above? Why?
