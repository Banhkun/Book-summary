## Chapter 5: Planning and Delegating

In this chapter, we’ll first look at the 11th and final managerial activity, planning—**coming up with actions that need to be done now to affect something in the future.** Then, we’ll look at delegating, which will help you make time to complete the 11 activities we’ve explored.

### Activity #11: Planning

There are four steps to effective planning:

#### Step #1: Determine Demand and Conduct Difference Analysis

**In management, demand comes from your environment** , which is the other groups in your organization that closely interact with you.

To determine your demand, consider:

  * What other people in the company currently expect from you. For example, manufacturing process engineer Cindy is in charge of the method for making microchips. Her environment consists of new methods and tools and people who work with her, such as development, production, and product engineers. All of these people want something different from Cindy—less required experimentation, more documentation, or finished microchips, respectively.
  * Technological developments. (Shortform example: After the invention of email, people no longer needed physical memos.)
  * The performance of the groups that support you. (Shortform example: If you depend on the communications department to announce your projects, do they have enough resources to meet your needs?)



Then, consider the expected state of all these factors in the future to determine the difference between what people expect of you now and what they might expect in the future. This is called a difference analysis.

Don’t try to resolve anything yet—that will come in the next steps.

#### Step #2: Evaluate Your Current Status

There are two things to consider when evaluating your current status:

  1. What you’re capable of doing now
  2. The projects you’re currently working on. Consider timing and whether all of the projects will actually be completed (usually, some projects get canceled).



Use the same vocabulary to describe status and demand. For example, if your demand is for “completed product designs,” refer to anything in-progress is a “ _partly_ completed product design.” That way, you can more easily compare your status and demand.

#### Step #3: Reconcile

In this step, **you’ll change what you’re currently doing so that you can meet future environmental demand**. To do this, ask yourself two questions separately:

  * What _needs_ to be done?
  * What is _possible_ to do?



Decide on your strategy (a general summary of what you plan to do) and tactics (what you’ll actually do to make your strategy come true), keeping in mind how your actions will reconcile and how long this reconciliation will take.

Make sure to involve the people who will be responsible for implementing the plan. For example, Cindy made a list and a schedule of what steps the development engineers needed to do to produce enough documentation for her needs. She spoke with the development group’s manager to negotiate what was possible.

##### Scheduling Implementation

**You only need to implement actions that need to be done in between the present moment and your next re-evaluation of the strategy you determined in step #3.** For example, every year, Intel plans for the next five years. Because they plan annually, they only need to focus on implementing one year’s strategy, because they’ll look at the other four years and one new year in the next plan.

Don’t plan too often, or you won’t have time to get the feedback you need to adjust your plan before you have to implement it.

#### Management by Objectives (MBO)

When planning for short-term concerns, you can use the “management by objectives (MBO)” technique. Because the timeline is short, you should already have a good idea of present demands on your time, so MBO focuses on steps 2 and 3 of the previous section. When using MBO, you need to determine only two things:

**1\. Objectives.** Only choose a small number of objectives for yourself and your subordinates—if you have too many, your focus will be diluted, and none of them will be done well. Note that if your subordinates meet their objectives, this will result in your objective being met because their objectives are to execute tactics, which will lead to carrying out the strategy, which is your objective.

  * For example, in 1491, the government of Spain needed money to continue the war against the Moors. With the help of her subordinate Christopher Columbus, Queen Isabella decided to look for a new trading route. The queen’s objective was money and Columbus’s was to find the new route. If he found the route, she would get her money.



**2\. Milestones (indicators of pace).** These need to include specific wording and dates so that it’s very clear whether they’re reached. The deadlines should be short so you can get feedback on your progress quickly.

  * For example, some of Columbus’s milestones were to acquire ships, test the ships, and set sail. 



Subordinates can still miss objectives even if they reach all the milestones on time. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean they’ve performed badly—they may have just focused on other, equally productive opportunities.

  * For example, Columbus built the ships, tested them, and set sail, but he never found the trading route he was looking for. He did, however, find the New World, which made Spain a lot of money.



### Delegating

To give yourself time to do the valuable and high-leverage actions in this chapter and the previous ones, you’re going to have to stop doing low-leverage activities. You can do this by delegating—many lower-leverage activities do need to be done, but not necessarily by you. There are some criteria for delegating:

**1\. You and the person you’re delegating to need to know the same information and be in agreement** about how to do the task. If the person you’re delegating to can’t do the task without you giving them step-by-step instructions, you’ll need to spend a lot of time giving directions, and the leverage of this time will be low.

**2\. You can keep the tasks you like doing as long as you’re consciously aware** of what’s motivating your decisions to delegate or not to delegate. If you give away a task but can’t let go, you’ll spend time on it regardless, and your leverage will remain low.

**3\. Monitor the person you’ve delegated to.** Even if you’re not doing the task yourself, you’re responsible for it getting done, so you can’t completely step back. To monitor:

  * Check tasks at early stages (draft rather than a polished final report), so that people don’t spend a lot of time finessing something with substantive problems.
  * Monitor people more often if they’re doing something new or unfamiliar, but less often if they have experience with the specific task you’ve given them. (Monitor based on task-relevant experience, not experience in general.)
  * Take samples of the work you’re monitoring instead of inspecting everything. You only need to check enough work to make sure things are going well.



(For more on monitoring, see the “Testing” section in Chapter 6.)

**4\. When possible, delegate the tasks you’re familiar with** rather than the ones you aren’t because it will be easier to monitor something you already know how to do.

**5\. If you’re delegating decision-making, monitor the decision-making process.** Ask the person to reflect before presenting a decision. Then, ask a question to monitor how well she reflected.

  * For example, at Intel, when someone decides to purchase new capital equipment, she prepares a presentation and requests approval. After the presentation, her superiors ask her about her decision to confirm that she’s thought through everything.
