## Chapter 4: Hiring and Retaining

In this chapter, we’ll look at the next two managerial activities: hiring new employees and retaining existing employees who have decided to quit.

### Activity #9: Hiring

First, **acknowledge that hiring is hard.** In activity #8, you learned how hard it is to assess the performance of people who already work closely with you even when you have output measures, specific examples of their work, and a confirmed environment. Evaluating the potential performance of a stranger is even more difficult. There’s no foolproof way to hire—even if you follow all of Grove’s recommendations below, you might still end up with a bad hire.

When hiring for a position, your goals should be to:

  * Choose a top performer
  * Teach her about yourself and the organization
  * Figure out if you’re a good fit
  * Get her excited about the job



You have two resources with which to do this:

#### Resource #1: The Interview

**The goal of interviewing is to predict how an applicant would do at your company based on her self-assessment of her own abilities.** There’s no way to avoid using self-assessment at the interview stage because you don’t have access to objective measures of skills, performance, and other factors. However, even though self-assessments can be inaccurate, they can still provide good information if, as the interviewer, you’re blunt and direct, because this usually inspires similar directness in the applicant.

Here are some tips for interviewing:

**Tip #1:** Aim to learn the following types of information:

  * **Technical skill level.** Ask her to describe a project she’s completed or about her skills weaknesses. This will tell you if she’ll be able to do the job you’re hiring for.
  * **Ability to apply skills.** Ask questions about previous successes and failures to determine if the applicant knows how to actually apply her skills.
  * **Discrepancy between knowledge and actions.** If a person is capable but didn’t perform, find out why. Ask about issues at her current job and what she’s learned from past mistakes.
  * **Values.** Ask why she wants a new job and why she feels your company is a good fit. Her values will tell you how she will approach the job. (Shortform example: If you run a non-profit that rescues animals, and the applicant values humane treatment of animals, she’ll likely approach her job with a lot of passion and motivation.)



**Tip #2:** Listen. The applicant should talk for 80% of the time so you can learn as much about them as possible.

**Tip #3:** If the applicant gets off topic, interrupt her and tell her you’d like to change the subject. You only have an hour or two—use it wisely.

**Tip #4:** Use the same language and make sure you both understand the meaning of any jargon you use.

**Tip #5:** Ask the applicant to consider a hypothetical situation. For example, when Grove was interviewing an accountant, he asked him to determine the cost of a finished wafer. Grove explained the wafer manufacturing process and answered questions about the process, since the accountant didn’t know how it worked, and the accountant worked out how to determine the price.

**Tip #6:** Ask the applicant if she has questions. This will show you if she prepared for the interview, if she researched the company, and what she’s looking for in a company.

**Tip #7:** Don’t use tricks—for example, giving applicants a broken chair and then seeing how they react when they fall. Instead, give a realistic first impression of yourself and the company because it takes first impressions a long time to fade, and encountering tricks during an interview suggests there will be tricks and traps on the job too.

#### Resource #2: References

When checking references, you want to get the same four pieces of information (see Tip #1) from references that you aimed to get in the interview. This will be difficult for two reasons:

  1. You’re usually talking to someone you don’t know at a company you don’t know, so it’s hard to accurately weigh someone else’s assessment of performance when you’re not familiar with the environment or company culture. 
  2. Many references don’t give specific criticisms. 



To mitigate these challenges, try to develop a bond with the reference to get her to open up to you. Do this by finding something you have in common or stretching out the conversation to give you time to connect.

After talking to references, ideally, interview the applicant again to address anything that came up.

### Activity #10: Retaining

The last managerial activity is talking people out of quitting. **When a valuable employee decides to quit because she feels unappreciated, as a manager, you have failed.** Your failure doesn’t necessarily end with the departure of that one employee. The actions of good employees affect your other employees as well—people who respect and identify with the departing employee will be affected by what happens to her and potentially become demotivated and consider leaving themselves.

Usually, someone will tell you that she wants to quit when you’re in the middle of something important. You should:

**1\. Immediately talk to her.** This probably won’t be your first reaction—the conversation will be uncomfortable and your instinct will likely be to wrap up whatever important thing you were in the middle of first. However, if your employee is quitting because she thinks you don’t care about her, pushing off the conversation until later only reinforces her belief.

**2\. Ask her why she’s decided to quit and listen.** She’s probably rehearsed this conversation, so let her get through her script without interrupting, and only ask questions at the end. Her script probably didn’t touch on her real reasons for quitting, so try to get her to reveal those by encouraging her to talk more.

**3\. Don’t argue or try to change her mind yet.** At this early stage, all you should do is ask for some time to come up with a solution.

**4\. Go talk to your supervisor** —this is a major problem you need help with. Your supervisor will also probably be in the middle of something important, but you need to make her help you. While your subordinate quitting is more destabilizing for you, her departure will affect the whole company.

**5\. Brainstorm ways to keep the employee at the company.** This can include transferring her to a different department—while you’ll lose her, the company won’t. As a manager, it’s your (and all managers’) responsibility to keep valuable employees with the company, even if you don’t get to work with them yourself.

**6\. Speak with the employee again and present your solution.** She might counter by:

  * Suggesting you only made changes because she forced/blackmailed you into doing so. Tell her that everything you’re doing you would have done anyway—it had been an oversight not to do it sooner.
  * Reminding you of her acceptance of another company’s offer. Remind her that she’s made a commitment to your company too, and this commitment is stronger because she’s actually worked with people at your company.
