## Chapter 8: Other Productivity-Increasing Strategies

In the previous chapter, you learned how to increase your productivity by taking inspiration from manufacturing’s production process. In this chapter, we’ll look at some other manufacturing strategies that can aid productivity, as well as strategies for efficient and productive meetings.

### Other Productive Manufacturing Strategies

#### Strategy #1: Use Indicators

Indicators, or measurements, tell manufacturers (or managers) about what’s going in the production process (or administrative process) and provide information about output.

There is a myriad of possible indicators ranging from equipment downtime to profit to customer satisfaction. To determine what your indicators should be, **ask yourself what information you want to know first-thing every day to head off potential problems.** Effective indicators must:

  * **Measure output rather than activity.** For example, it’s more important to know how many orders a salesperson received than how many calls she made.
  * **Be physical and countable.** For example, a janitorial indicator might be the number of square feet cleaned.
  * **Tell you if you’re going to meet your operational goals.** (Shortform example: The number of pages of a novel you write today will tell you if you’re going to finish your book by your deadline at the end of the month.)



For example, here are the five most important pieces of information to a factory manager:

  1. **Sales forecast,** which is how many sales you expect to make in a given time period. To inform your forecast, compare yesterday’s forecast to yesterday’s real numbers (the difference between them is called variance). This will show you if your forecasting is generally accurate or if you need to reconsider your approach.
  2. **Raw material inventory,** which is how much of the materials manufacturers need to make the product on hand. If you check this first thing in the morning, you have time to either order more or cancel a delivery, whichever is needed.
  3. **Equipment condition.** If something has broken down, manufacturers will need to get it fixed or adjust the process to work around it.
  4. **Human resources.** If some staff are sick, manufacturers have to call in extra help or take people off the less important jobs to cover the most important ones.
  5. **Product or service quality.** Manufacturers use a variety of measures for this indicator, such as customer satisfaction.



Indicators are very helpful in types of work besides manufacturing because they:

  * Provide clarity about individual and team goals
  * Make abstract tasks more objective
  * Allow for comparisons between different groups 
  * Help solve problems. When something goes wrong, you can look at your existing data to see where and how the problem might have started. If you don’t have data, you can’t do anything until you collect it, and in the meantime, the problem will likely worsen.



People tend to overreact to what they’re paying attention to. (Shortform example: If you’re trying to avoid overstaffing, you might inadvertently reduce your staff so much you don’t have enough people to manage the workload.) To avoid overreacting to an indicator, pay attention to _all_ areas of your business.

##### Leading Indicators

There’s a special type of indicator, called a **leading indicator, that tells you what might happen in the future.** These indicators are useful because they predict problems before they happen, so you can take preemptive action to avoid them. (However, this is harder than it sounds, because you don’t have an existing problem to justify the expense or anxiety of reacting.) Leading indicators must be accurate and believable (or else you’ll be reluctant to act on them).

There are a few leading indicators that are appropriate for most cases. All of them are only visible once you’ve plotted the data on a graph:

**Linearity indicator.** This indicator is the slope of the line of output over time. Ideally, the line should be straight and ascending (which indicates a consistent output) and hit the desired point of a particular output at a particular time.

If the graph is a saggy line or not a line at all, then output isn’t constant and you’ll have to adjust production in the remaining time to meet the goal. If you continually have concentrated output right before the deadline, you’re probably not using equipment and manpower efficiently and run the risk of having a problem that derails the goal right before the deadline.

**Trend indicators.** Like the linearity indicator, this indicator shows output over time but also takes quality into account: Output must meet a certain standard. This helps you extrapolate both future output and quality.

**Stagger chart.** A stagger chart estimates future output numbers a few months in advance and is updated as the real numbers come in. This allows you to see how close the forecasting was to reality, which informs your future predictions (Shortform example: If you consistently predict selling more than you actually sell, start predicting lower). Stagger charts are particularly useful for forecasting economic trends.

  * For example, in the chart below, in March, the forecaster predicted that March would see 20 units, April 26 units, and May 32 units. In April, she had the real number for March—21 units, indicated with an asterisk—and predicted a new forecast for the next three months.

|  Forecast for:   
---|---  
|  | March  | April  | May  | June  | July   
Forecast made in:  | March forecast  | 20  | 26  | 32  |  |   
April forecast  | *21  | 25  | 31  | 29  |   
May forecast  |  | *19  | 28  | 28  | 33   
  
#### Strategy #2: Build to Forecast

The second strategy is building to forecast, in which **manufacturers**(or managers) **_predict_ how many orders they’re going to get for each product and build enough to satisfy them.** The advantage of building to forecast is that customers don’t have to wait for products. (If manufacturers waited until they _had_ orders to start building—referred to as the “build to order” method—customers would have to wait longer for their products.)

  * Manufacturing example: Intel builds computer parts to forecast this because their throughput times are long and customers don’t want to wait for products.
  * Business example: As a manager, you can use your calendar to help you forecast demands on your time and how you’ll schedule them. The limiting step (the step that takes the longest or is most important) is scheduled firmly and the non-time-sensitive ones can offset where there’s space. 



Both sales and manufacturing forecast so that both departments are accountable for meeting their predictions, and they use stagger charts to help with accuracy.

The disadvantage of building to forecast is that if the predictions _are_ wrong, manufacturers end up with a bunch of leftover inventory or lack the inventory customers do want. However, this is still preferable to making customers wait.

Delivering built-to-forecast products involves two simultaneous processes with their own timelines. Ideally, both flows finish at the same time:

  1. **Manufacturing flow** , which involves getting the raw materials through production, to being finished goods, to the shipping dock.
  2. **Sales flow** , which involves finding customers, selling them the product, securing an order, and then shipping it.



**However much you plan, it’s rare that the two flows line up exactly** —sometimes, customers change their minds or there’s a mistake in the manufacturing process—which is where the slack (extra time or resources) you left in the system will come in handy.

Some businesses use both building to order and building to forecast—for example, the breakfast cafe builds breakfast to order (cooks only start cooking after a customer has ordered) but buys raw inventory (purchases eggs, toast, and coffee) based on forecasted demand because it’s not possible to acquire it instantly.

#### Strategy #3: Use Proven Processes

In manufacturing, most workflows are tested and well-worn. **Manufacturers don’t waste time coming up with a new way to do something if there’s already a good existing way. Do the same as a manager.** However, keep in mind that the value of a process is the logic behind its steps, not the steps themselves, so be open to changes if old processes become illogical.

#### Strategy #4: Batch

**All manufacturing processes include set-up time, and if you can do all the activities that require the same set-up together, you can save time.** This process is called “batching.”

  * Business example: It requires some time to get into the right mindset to read reports. Therefore, once you’re in the mindset, read all the reports at once.



#### Strategy #5: Don’t Overload Capacity

If a factory is already booked up, manufacturing leaders don’t start new projects because otherwise, **the overload might cause a bottleneck and materials might have to be aborted at a higher-value stage because they spoil while waiting to move on to the next step.**

It’s harder to avoid overloading capacity in a managerial context because you don’t have the same capacity indicators as a factory, but you must have a vague idea of how much time it will take you to do your usual tasks. **Say no to new projects you don’t have time for.** (Remember that if you’re already fully booked, you _can’t_ get the new project done. Also, remember that your time is finite, so anytime you say yes to something you’re turning down something else.)

#### Strategy #6: Distribute Workload

Factories try to evenly distribute their workload over time. Managers can benefit from this technique too. **The main threat to an even managerial workload is interruptions** because they unexpectedly increase workload. You can manage interruptions by taking inspiration from factory techniques:

**Make standard (not custom) products.** In this context, “products” are answers to questions that interrupt you, which usually come from subordinates or people you influence. Study these questions and prepare widely applicable responses. In addition to saving you time writing original responses every time, you can share these responses with others and delegate their delivery.

  * For example, many customers get in touch about refunds, and if you pre-prepare a response, you (and your subordinates) can give it to everyone with the same concern.



**Take advantage of indicators.** Indicators help you avoid losing time to interruptions by allowing you to do two things:

  1. Quickly address interruptions. If you have data on hand and readily available, you’ll be able to quickly and easily answer questions.
  2. Schedule problem-solving. If your leading indicators warn you that you’ve got a future problem, you have to deal with it before it explodes, but you don’t have to deal with it immediately and let it interrupt you.



**Encourage other managers to embrace regularity.** Because you work with them, your schedules have to mesh.

  * For example, a company might reserve Monday mornings for planning group meetings. 



**Batch subordinate interruptions.** Don’t physically hide from your subordinates when you don’t want to be interrupted—their questions are legitimate. Instead, schedule a time when you’re available for questions.

  * For example, you might hang a sign on your door that says you’re doing individual work and that you’ll be available at a later time for questions. It should ask people not to interrupt you unless it's very urgent.



### Meetings as a Time Management Tool

In the previous section, we looked at some strategies to make _managerial work_ more efficient. Now, we’ll look at how to make _meetings_ more efficient.

Many managers hate meetings and think they’re a waste of time and a symptom of disorganization. In reality, **meetings are just a medium in which you can do activities** , and if run properly, they can be an efficient way to carry out the managerial activities that you learned about in the previous part (many of which have to be done in-person).

There are two types of meetings, and if you use your meeting time _perfectly_ , you’ll only ever need to hold the first kind:

#### Type #1: Process-Oriented

**The purpose of process-oriented meetings is to exchange expertise and information.** These meetings take place according to a regular schedule.

To make these meetings effective, use manufacturing strategies:

  * **Standardize them.** The meetings should all be run in the same way, cover topics in the same level of detail, and have clear goals.
  * **Forecast them.** Because the meetings are regular, you’ll get data on how long it takes to cover particular subjects or parts of the meeting. Attendees will come to know how much time to budget for each part.



There are three subcategories of process-oriented meetings:

##### Subcategory #1: One-on-One

**The goal of this type of meeting is to exchange information and maintain professional relationships.**

**_Attendees_**

The only attendees of this kind of meeting are you as a manager and one subordinate.

The subordinate’s job is to:

**1\. Give you detailed information about her work and concerns.**

**2\. Plan the agenda and give it to you in advance.** This is for two reasons:

  1. The subordinate is attending only one one-on-one, while you’re attending several because you have several subordinates. It would be too time-consuming for you to plan several agendas.
  2. Preparing an outline forces the subordinate to reflect on their work and potential problems. It also allows you to pace the meeting to spend more time on what’s most important.



The agenda should include a discussion of:

  * **Indicators** , especially indicators that suggest problems on the horizon.
  * **Potential problems** , even if there are no indicators except intuition. If a subordinate feels like something is going to go wrong, you can look at indicators in more detail.
  * **Important events** that happened between this meeting and the one before.
  * **Anything in the “hold” file** , which is where you and the subordinate file anything that’s important but not urgent for discussion in subsequent meetings. (This is a method of batching.)
  * **Anything that’s bothering the subordinate** , including her feelings about work—for example, whether she finds a particular part of her job frustrating. Try to broach this earlier in the meeting rather than at the end so you have time to address it in depth.



**3\. Take notes on the agenda during the meeting.** This is because:

  * It helps her pay attention.
  * It helps her absorb the information because she has to connect it to what’s already on the page.
  * It’s a form of commitment. When she writes down a note, this implies she will take action.



Your job, as a manager, is to:

**1\. Soak up the information** the subordinate provides.

**2\. Help the subordinate articulate her problems.** When you think the subordinate is finished talking about something, ask another question to determine if _she_ thinks she’s finished talking about it. Keep asking questions until you both feel you’ve covered everything.

**3\. Take notes on the agenda.** This is for the same reasons the subordinate should take notes, and additionally, your notes will help you monitor the subordinate as she carries out the actions discussed in the meeting.

**_Scheduling and Frequency_**

**Schedule the next one-on-one at the end of the current one** rather than using a set schedule. Otherwise, a set schedule may conflict with vacation or a commitment. Plan for every one-on-one to take at least an hour to give subordinates time to talk about complicated issues. (If a subordinate knows she only has 15 minutes, she’s not going to bring up anything that seems thorny or delicate.)

There are two factors to consider when determining how often to have one-on-ones:

  1. **Task-related experience.** For subordinates that are working at a specific task they don’t have much experience with, one-on-ones more should be more frequent, such as once a week. For more experienced subordinates, every few weeks is appropriate.
  2. **Speed of the industry.** If things change quickly in your department (for example, marketing is always a fast-paced field), then you may need to schedule more frequent one-on-ones to keep up. 



**_Setting_**

Hold the one-on-ones near the subordinate’s work area. This allows you to observe her and learn more about her, such as whether her work area is organized and how often she gets interrupted.

If it’s not possible to meet face-to-face, you can do the one-on-one remotely, but because you can’t watch each other take notes, you should trade notes after the meeting so it’s clear what each person will do.

##### Subcategory #2: Staff Meetings

**The goal of the meeting is to facilitate peer interaction, learn the dynamics of your subordinates, and exchange information in both directions.**

  * For example, on one team Grove supervised, the team members knew more about each other’s work than Grove did, so he learned more from observing them talk (or argue) with each other than he did from talking to them individually.



**_Attendees_**

The attendees of a staff meeting are you as the supervisor and all of your subordinates.

Your job, as the supervisor, is to:

  * **Moderate the meeting and keep it on schedule.** The meeting should have an agenda (shared in advance so people can prepare their thoughts) and an open discussion period for issues and housekeeping.
  * **Avoid lecturing** —you’ll stifle discussion.



The subordinates’ role is to participate in the discussion, which should include talk of:

  * **Anything relevant to more than two attendees.** If a topic only affects two people, they can discuss it outside the staff meeting.
  * **Decisions.** Staff meetings are good for decision-making because all the attendees are used to working together and know their relative authority.



##### Subcategory #3: Operation Reviews

**The goal of this final meeting subcategory is to facilitate learning and connect people—often managers—who don’t have another medium for interaction** (for example, they’re too far apart on the organizational chart to be in the same staff meetings). The meeting should include presentations by managers of different groups.

**_Attendees_**

The attendees are two managers—the one who organizes the meeting and the one the meeting is directed at (“reviewing manager”), presenters, and the audience.

The organizing manager’s job is to:

  * Handle all the event details, such as booking the meeting room, sending out invitations, and so on.
  * Supervise the presenters and help them decide what to cover. 
  * Act as timekeeper during the meeting. During presentations, she should gesture remaining time updates to the presenters.



For example, at Intel, this role might be held by the divisional marketing manager.

The role of the reviewing manager is to:

  * Share her first impressions. She should never look at the material in advance (her spontaneous first impressions are valuable).
  * Ask questions.
  * Encourage the rest of the audience to participate.
  * Set the meeting tone (formal, spirited, and so on).
  * Role model appropriate conduct.



For example, at Intel, this role might be held by the general manager of a division.

The role of presenters is to:

  * Use visual aids and a pointer to clarify their points (budget 4 minutes of talking per visual).
  * Adjust the speed of their presentation based on the audience’s cues—if people’s body language is bored, the presenters can go faster; if people look confused, they should slow down or clarify.



The audience’s job is to:

  * Demonstrate interest (this boosts the presenters’ confidence).
  * Pay attention.
  * Comment, ask questions, and speak up about mistakes.



#### Type #2: Mission-Oriented

**The purpose of these meetings is to solve a problem by making a decision.** They’re scheduled in response to a problem’s development. In theory, these meetings should never be called because all problems are preempted in process-oriented meetings. In practice, however, even if things operate well, about 80% of problems will be handled in process-oriented meetings and the remaining in mission-oriented meetings because not everything can be preempted.

**_Attendees_**

The attendees are the chairperson (often the person who calls the meeting) and the other people she recruits to help her solve the problem.

The chairperson’s role is to:

  * **Decide on attendees.** Don’t invite more than eight people because with a large group, it becomes harder to make a decision. Follow up with people once they’re invited to make sure they’ll come, or if they can’t, that a representative will come.
  * **Create an agenda** that explains what decision the meeting will make and everyone’s role in the meeting and decision-making.
  * **Maintain discipline.** Don’t let people be late because this wastes everyone’s time and costs the company money. 
  * **Manage housekeeping.** Make sure the meeting room is equipped with all required audiovisual equipment.
  * **Send out minutes after the meeting.** The minutes should summarize the discussion, decision, and further action, including who should do what next and when. Send out the minutes soon after the meeting, so no one forgets what happened in the meeting, the decision, or the next steps.
