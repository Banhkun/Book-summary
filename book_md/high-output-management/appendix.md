## Appendix: Points Exercise

Throughout this summary, you’ve learned a variety of techniques that will help you become a high output manager. In this appendix, Grove provides a list of activities that are each worth a certain amount of points. Do enough of the activities to earn at least 100 points and you’ll improve your managing game significantly.

### Production Exercises

For 10 points:

  * Figure out what parts of your work are most similar to the production and assembly parts of manufacturing.
  * Figure out what the equivalents of manufacturing’s testing (receiving, in-process, and final inspections) are in your work. Determine if your tests should be monitoring or gate-like, and determine the ideal schedule for testing.
  * Think of an in-progress project, determine the limiting step, and create a workflow to accommodate it.
  * Think of six indicators, both quantitative and qualitative, that will predict output.



For 20 points:

  * Start using your indicators and discuss them in staff meetings.
  * Reflect on the most important strategy you’re executing right now. Consider the demand that prompted the strategy, your current status, and whether your strategy will change your future status enough to meet your future demand.



### Leverage Exercises

For 10 points:

  * Determine your most time-consuming task and simplify it. Cut at least 30% of the steps.
  * Determine your output (as a manager, this is the output of your team and other teams you influence). Then, put the outputs in priority order.
  * Consider where you get your information. Are you getting information from a variety of redundant sources?
  * Tour your workplace and make a list of whom you talked to and about what.
  * Think of a reason why you need to tour your workplace every month.
  * Consider how you will monitor a delegated project. When will you check in, and how?
  * Brainstorm some non-urgent projects you can work on when you have discretionary time. These will keep you busy and stop you from meddling with your employees’ work.
  * Reflect on the tasks you’ve done over the last week and rate them on leverage. How could you stop doing some of the low-leverage activities, giving yourself time to work on more high-leverage ones instead?
  * Reflect on what you’ll be doing next week, considering how much time you’ll spend in mission-oriented meetings. If you expect them to take more than 25% of your time, how could you reduce this?
  * Write a list of the upcoming decisions you have to make. Choose three and walk yourself through the six-question approach of management activity #3.
  * Reflect on where you and all of your reports fall on the Maslow hierarchy of needs.
  * Make a list of the task-relevant feedback your employees have access to. Determine if they can assess their own progress.
  * Determine the TRM of each of your reports (high, medium, or low) and what management style would be most effective for them. Consider if your management style matches their TRM.
  * Redo a performance review that you wrote in the past, keeping in mind Grove’s tips on writing a good review.



For 20 points:

  * Explain one-on-one meetings to your subordinates, ask them to prepare for one, and conduct it.
  * Determine the top three organizational objectives for the next quarter. What are your key milestones?
  * Ask your subordinates to determine _their_ key milestones. Then, discuss milestones together.
  * Start a competition—create performance indicators so your employees can compete with each other.
  * Reflect on the most recent performance reviews you received and delivered. Consider if they gave task-relevant feedback or improved performance. Also, consider how each was delivered.
