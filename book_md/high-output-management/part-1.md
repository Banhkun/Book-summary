## Part 1: Managerial Output | Chapter 1: Managerial Activities

In _High Output Management_ , Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel and 1997 _Time_ Man of the Year, shares what he’s learned about management over his decades-long career. One of his main insights is that **manufacturing principles—which have been honed over hundreds of years and focus on output and productivity—are very applicable to yet rarely used in management.**

In this summary, you’ll learn:

  * How to increase your managerial output
  * How to increase your managerial productivity
  * How to manage on a larger scale



The book is relevant to all managers but may be particularly useful to middle managers because there are fewer resources available for them (there are many courses for front-line managers, and most business schools focus on training CEOs). Middle managers are all managers in between front-line managers and the people at the top of the organizational chart. The term also includes “know-how” managers who don’t formally have reports but influence the work of others by sharing their knowledge and skills.

(Shortform note: We’ve reorganized the book’s material for concision and clarity.)

#### Publication History

The original edition of _High Output Management_ was published in 1983. Grove wrote a new introduction to the book in 1995 because two major events took place that changed the managing game:

**Event #1: The world became more globalized.** Businesses now had competitors all over the world, not just locally, and if they didn’t adapt, they died. Because so many companies could supply the same products, speed became a major competitive advantage.

Competition for jobs also increased—managers have to work harder to maintain their personal competitive advantage. Grove recommends asking yourself the following questions to reflect on your work. If you answer no to any of them, your career as a manager might be in danger:

  * Are you always trying to find ways to make things work better?
  * Are you aware of your environment and developments in your field?
  * Are you personally experimenting with new technologies and ideas?



**Event #2: Email was invented.** It increased the speed and ease of communication and made the managerial activity of disseminating information less critical to the job. Keep this in mind when reading the sections on managerial activities and meetings.

### What Is Managerial Output?

The output of some processes, such as manufacturing, is very obvious—at a factory that makes breakfasts, the output is breakfast. Your own output as a manager, however, is less concrete. **It’s _not_ the output of your own individual work; it’s the output of all the teams you influence.** _Their_ output is determined by the activities you do and how much of an effect—or leverage—these activities have.

Written mathematically:

You managerial output = team outputs = output of your team + output of teams you influence = (managerial activity #1 × leverage of activity #1) + (managerial activity #2 × leverage of activity #2) + …

Therefore, **you can increase your managerial output by increasing the output of your team or the teams you influence, and/or increasing the value of _your_ activities or _your_ leverage.**

First, we’ll look at how to increase the output of teams by choosing an appropriate managing style. Then, we’ll look at high-leverage managerial activities that you can engage in to increase your output. Finally, we’ll look at how to increase leverage.

### Increasing the Output of Teams

To improve the output of your team, choose the management style that will best foster their high performance. The deciding factor in this decision is **task-relevant maturity (TRM)—how educated, experienced, and mentally ready an employee is to do a _particular_ task in particular circumstances.**

  * For example, one Intel sales manager was very successful in the field environment—he had high TRM—and Intel promoted him to a plant environment. However, his TRM in this new environment was low—he didn’t know how to do any of the plant-related tasks.



Here’s how you should manage employees with the following TRM levels:

**Low:** Provide structure and strong guidance on operational values. Give your team detailed directions about exactly what needs to be done, how, and when.

**Medium:** Provide some structure and guidance but expect the team to provide some of it themselves. Instead of managing prescriptively, exchange ideas and communicate. (Note: This mode is the most difficult for most managers because hitting a balance is more challenging than meeting an extreme.)

**High:** Provide minimal structure—the team will provide the bulk of it themselves. Don’t involve yourself with the team’s work; just make sure objectives are clear. High TRM is advantageous because:

  * The managing style is less time-consuming.
  * The manager can be confident about delegating because she knows her subordinates can handle the task.
  * When teams are managing themselves, motivation usually comes from self-actualization, which is the only need in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs that can never be satisfied and thus provides a permanent source of motivation. (We’ll discuss Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and motivation further in Chapter 2.)



**Always monitor your team, no matter what the TRM level is.** If the TRM changes, adjust your management style, up _or_ down.

**None of these management styles are better or worse than others.** Many managers feel the prescriptiveness of low-TRM management isn’t nice or sophisticated, but your goal isn’t to be these things—it’s to be effective.

#### Friendships With Subordinates

Whether you foster friendships with subordinates is up to you. **It’s easier to care about and communicate with someone you’re friends with but harder to revert to a formal relationship if necessary because ordering a friend around can be awkward.** Additionally, close personal relationships don’t necessarily result in communicating management relationships.

Grove has seen friendship with subordinates work and he’s also seen discipline end friendships. To figure out if you can handle it,**imagine that you’re giving a critical performance review to an existing friend. If the thought makes you uncomfortable, don’t become friends with your subordinates.**

### Five Valuable and/or High-Leverage Managerial Activities

You can also increase your output by choosing to do valuable and/or high-leverage managerial activities. We’ll cover five activities in this chapter and the rest in subsequent chapters.

#### Activity #1: Information-Gathering

Information-gathering involves collecting data about both the interior and exterior workings of your company. You’ll use what you learn from this activity to inform all of your other managerial activities.

There are two main sources of information, and you need to gather both:

**1\. Verbal,** via conversations with people both inside and outside the company (competitors, customers, and so on). Verbal information is more up-to-date than written information and therefore valuable, but often insufficient or even incorrect because in conversation, people don’t always mention all relevant context.

There are two good ways to get access to verbal information:

  * Talk to people who want you to do things for them. They’re often excellent sources of information because they’ll tell you all sorts of things to get you on their side. 
  * Visit part of the company, observe proceedings, and engage in casual conversation. (In contrast, if people come to see you in your office, you spend a lot of time on social niceties and don’t actually exchange that much information.) If you feel awkward about wandering around without a specific goal, schedule a visit that has a task associated with it, such as a safety check. This will give you a good reason to walk around and talk to people.



**2\. Written,** via memos, reports, and so on. Written information travels more slowly than verbal information but is necessary and valuable because:

  * The information is more thorough than what can be covered in a conversation.
  * The author has to think to write the text—the exercise involves self-discipline, precision, and reflection. Even if no one reads the final product, the author will have gained from writing it. 
  * The reader can use written information to validate verbal information and as a reference in the future.



You should have multiple sources of both verbal and written information so that you can compare the different accounts to each other to confirm they’re accurate.

#### Activity #2: Disseminating Information

A second managerial activity is **supplying information to your organization and to the people you influence.** Information includes hard facts but also goals, priorities, and preferred methods of doing things. If you don’t share this information, then your reports won’t know how you want things done and their output will be sub-par.

Sharing information also contributes to the development of culture, which we’ll look at more in later chapters.

#### Activity #3: Decision-Making

The third managerial activity is decision-making. As a manager, you have two decision-making roles:

  1. Make decisions yourself.
  2. Help others make decisions by giving them information or opinions, debating with them, and approving or vetoing their choices.



To know which to do, consider the two kinds of power:

  1. **Position** , which is authority given by an organizational chart and job title.
  2. **Knowledge** , which comes from working closely with the details of a business.



In traditional industries with a strict organizational hierarchy, decision-making responsibilities were assigned based on position power, so the higher-ups in the chart would make the decisions. However, **in knowledge industries, a person with position power may not have as much knowledge power as someone lower in the chart** because they’re more distanced from day-to-day operations, and the faster-moving the industry or customer preferences, the larger the disconnect.

  * For example, a recent college graduate will be more up-to-date on current technology than a manager who’s been working for years. 



Therefore, **the best way to make decisions is to harness both kinds of power and make the decision at the lowest competent level** —lowest because lower people are closer to the action and technical know-how, and competent because technical knowledge doesn’t always come with judgment or experience. As a middle manager, you’re uniquely positioned to do this because you’re in contact with both power-holders.

If you can’t find people who have both the technical knowledge and judgment to make, or help you make, the decision, then create a decision-making group that includes a mix of people: some of whom have technical expertise, and some of whom have proven strong judgment. It’s fine to include someone senior, but she must act as an equal to everyone else involved so that everyone feels comfortable participating in the discussion rather than deferring to the senior leader.

##### Ideal Decision-Making Model

It’s important to adhere to a standard decision-making process for two reasons:

  1. **It’s faster** —you don’t have to come up with a new process every time.
  2. **It’s less frustrating for the affected parties.** If people know upfront who will be making and approving the decision, they know there’s the possibility the decision they’ve been working on will be vetoed. If they _don’t_ know this upfront, even if there’s a good reason for the veto, they’ll potentially see the veto as political maneuvering or become demoralized.



There are four steps to Grove’s ideal decision-making model:

**Step #1: Address the Six Pre-Decision Questions**

Before starting the decision-making process, to promote an optimal, efficient decision, you must give everyone involved in the process the answers to the following six questions:

1\. What is the decision?

  * For example, Intel had to decide where to build a new plant in the Philippines. The choices were a location next to an existing plant (which would be more convenient but more expensive because space was limited and the building would have to be multistory) or a new location.



2\. What is the deadline?

  * Intel had to decide within a month so that there would be enough time to build the plant before it was needed.



3\. Who will make the decision?

  * Intel’s facilities people (who knew about costs and construction) and manufacturing plant managers (who knew about operational benefits) would make the decision together. Three managers from approximately equal power-positions represented each group.



4\. Whom do you need to talk to before making the decision?

  * The managers of each group spoke with their staff to gather relevant information.



5\. Who will approve or reject the decision?

  * Grove would do this because he was the first common person in the organizational chart (the president) above the senior managers. He was also familiar with the existing Philippines plant.



6\. Who needs to know the decision?

  * Grove would tell the chairman of the board. He wasn’t directly involved with plants, but building a new plant is a big business decision and therefore relevant to the chairman.



**Step #2: Encourage Free Discussion**

Discussion should cover all points of view and all relevant information because the best decision will come from considering the opinions of all knowledgeable people. Everyone should get to speak freely. Encourage disagreement—it’s common for participants to stay out of the discussion until one view seems likely to win and then jump in to support this view, but this behavior won’t produce the best decision because it results in people withholding their true opinions.

Free discussion ends when you’ve heard and considered all the information. At this time, push for a consensus, or make the decision yourself (you’ll be well-informed thanks to the free discussion). This timing is important:

  * If you end a discussion too early, you won’t have all the information you need to make a good decision.
  * If you don’t end it, it could go on forever and people could get further from the right decision.



For example, the Intel groups considered all the information about the new plant’s possible locations, including costs, geography, and traffic patterns. They thought it would work best to build the new plant beside the old plant but keep the new plant small to avoid huge costs.

**Step #3: Explain the Decision Clearly**

Once something is decided, it should be explained as clearly as possible to everyone who will be affected by it.

People tend to be vague about controversial decisions to avoid arguments with those who disagree with the choice, but you should do the opposite. Being vague doesn’t prevent an argument, it just postpones it, and people don’t like being kept in the dark.

If the decision is very different from what was on the table (for example, if Grove had canceled the construction of the plant), announce it, give people some time to digest it, and then later, talk about it with everyone. Some time for reflection and the opportunity to share feedback will help people accept the decision.

**Step #4: Demand Full Support**

Everyone involved in the decision must support it. They don’t have to _agree_ with it—it’s not always possible to get agreement on everything because everyone has differences of opinion—but they must commit to executing it.

##### Challenges Associated With the Model

This four-step process comes with challenges:

**1\. Unnaturalness.** Middle managers often find this model awkward because they struggle to express their views, make hard decisions, and get behind decisions they don’t agree with.

**2\. Emotions.** It’s hard for people to separate their emotions from decision-making, and people tend to get even more emotional when they have to make decisions with people they don’t know. If there’s a big divide between knowledge and power, everyone can feel uncertain. People might fear sounding stupid and not speak, or fear being overruled and therefore feel embarrassed.

To manage your emotions, remember that you, like all people, are smart and have willpower.

**3\. Peer-group syndrome.** When in a group of peers, most people are reluctant to express an opinion because they don’t want to say something that the rest of the group doesn’t agree with. Therefore, people talk around in circles until they feel confident that the group is leaning towards something (or if this doesn’t happen, they talk forever). One member will state the perceived consensus weakly using first-person plural, so it’s not attached to them personally. If they’ve read the room right, everyone else will start supporting the position too. This is disadvantageous because it cuts the discussion short, and without examining all points of view, it’s harder to make a good decision.

There are two ways to avoid this circling:

  * Put someone in charge of the meeting. If this person notices that peer-group syndrome is developing, they must intervene and set the decision-making process back on course. Choose whoever will be most affected by the outcome of the decision as the leader, or call in a more senior manager (which is called a peer-plus-one approach at Intel). A senior manager can advise on decision-making techniques and lend the group some confidence.
  * Instill self-confidence in all of the peers. Tell everyone that there are no life-threatening consequences of making a suggestion that’s overruled or a wrong decision.



#### Activity #4: Nudging

The fourth managerial activity is nudging, which is a softer version of decision-making (and a stronger version of disseminating information) in which you influence people but don’t command them.

  * For example, instead of _telling_ someone what decision to make, you might offer an opinion in a meeting about it. 



Nudging and decision-making should be distinct. You’ll probably nudge a dozen times as much as you decide.

#### Activity #5: Role Modelling

The fifth activity is role modeling, in which you share your values and the kind of behavior you want to see by demonstrating it. Telling people what you want in a memo will never be as effective as showing them visibly. You can do this in whatever way fits your leadership style—such as working one-on-one or giving a presentation.

  * (Shortform example: If you want employees to be punctual, always be on time yourself.)
