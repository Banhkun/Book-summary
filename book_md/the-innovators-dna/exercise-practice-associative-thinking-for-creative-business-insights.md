## Exercise: Practice Associative Thinking for Creative Business Insights

Associative thinking is the heart of innovative thinking. The following exercises will help you practice your associative thinking skills and learn how to apply creative insights to real-world business challenges and opportunities.

* * *

Pick a random object from your current surroundings, such as a pencil or a coffee mug. Spend two minutes brainstorming a list of at least ten different associations or connections that come to mind when you think about that object. For example, if you picked a coffee mug, you might think of associations like "coffee, tea, warmth, relaxation, conversation, or morning routine.”

Next, choose one of the association words you came up with and brainstorm a list of at least five _new_ associations or connections that come to mind when you think about that word. For example, if you chose "conversation" as an association for the coffee mug, you might think of new associations like "communication, sharing, inspiration, or socializing."

Now select one of your new associations and try to come up with a real-world example or case study of how that word has been used to create something innovative or successful in business. For example, if you chose "communication" as a new association for the coffee mug, you might research how a company like Slack has used their tools to innovate communication in many work settings.

Next, identify a problem or opportunity in your company that you could potentially address by applying the real-world association you identified above. For example, if you were inspired by how Slack has innovated communication for many companies, you might think about how to innovate communication and collaboration in your workplace.

Finally, write down a brief action plan for implementing or experimenting with your idea. This could be as simple as scheduling a brainstorming session with your team to explore new and improved ways of communicating and working together.
