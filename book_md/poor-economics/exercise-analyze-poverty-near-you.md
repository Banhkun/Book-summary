## Exercise: Analyze Poverty Near You

Duflo and Banerjee’s approach to analyzing poverty is based on the belief that the poor make deliberate choices about their lives—they’re making the most of the little they have. In this exercise, we’ll consider how we might analyze poverty that exists close to our homes.

* * *

You may not live in a place where you often encounter abject poverty of the kind Duflo and Banerjee discuss (living on less than 99 cents a day). However, poverty is in some sense relative to the cost of living in a particular area. Take a moment to do some quick research—find out what the poverty line is for a household of your size where you live. Write down the source of your information and the poverty line you discovered in the box below.

Now, consider how your purchasing decisions might be affected if you lived at or below that level of income for many years. What would you have to give up? How might an unexpected large bill, such as a car repair or a health expense, affect your sense of stability and security? Could you afford to eat well? Write your reflections below.

Finally, consider the situations of those around you who may be facing poverty. Are there any small things you can do to help improve their daily lives? Write some ideas below.
