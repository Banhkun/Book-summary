## Chapters 3-5: Three Characteristics of Success

What you want to accomplish (what you define as success) depends on where you are in life and what you’re focused on. But whatever success means to you, it has three characteristics:

1) Success matters.

2) Success is your obligation or duty.

3) The supply of success is unlimited.

### Success Matters

People often comment that “success isn’t everything.” But success is vital to all organizations—they must succeed and grow in order to thrive and contribute to society. Similarly, individuals and families must succeed to have security, confidence, satisfaction, and growth.

People who downplay the importance of success are sometimes rationalizing their own failures. No one benefits when you fail or quit, but when you accomplish something important, you and everyone around you gain—and it lays the groundwork for further success.

### Success Is Your Duty

Cardone’s life changed when he stopped waiting for success and began thinking of it as an ethical obligation—that is, as a duty to himself, his family, and his company.

People often think of success as an option, something that may or may not happen. Others settle for modest success.

The idea of success as an obligation struck Cardone in 2008 when the recession put his company, personal finances, and family’s security in jeopardy. He realized he’d let this happen by becoming complacent after achieving several successes. He’d rested on his laurels rather than focusing on continued success as a responsibility.

Those who treat success as an option or who make excuses for not succeeding aren’t living up to their potential. And **not living up to your potential is unethical.** This applies to every aspect of life: work, marriage and family, health, faith, social contribution, and legacy.

You should think of success the way good parents think of parenting: it’s an honor, a duty, and a priority, and they do whatever it takes to care for their children.

When you begin thinking of success as your responsibility rather than an option, you behave differently. You take the idea of living up to your potential—creating 10X success—seriously because it not only affects you, but also your family, company, coworkers, and colleagues. And because failing to do so is unethical.

### The Supply of Success Is Unlimited

People sometimes think of success as being in limited supply—that someone else’s success somehow limits theirs. Or perhaps one person’s achievement makes a less successful person feel inadequate, so they think of success as available only to a few.

But one person’s achievement doesn’t limit anyone else’s ability to succeed. Success isn’t a commodity. For example, Warren Buffett doesn’t see his investment success as being limited by someone else’s strategy. Nor does Buffett's success hinder anyone else’s ability to be successful.

Successful people like Buffett understand that **you create success rather than acquire it. And there’s no limit on the success ingredients of ideas, creativity, talent, intelligence, and persistence**. You and millions of others can create as much success as you’re capable of, anywhere at any time.

Others’ achievements affirm that success is possible for everyone. That’s why we’re inspired by extraordinary performances by athletes and musicians. Don’t begrudge anyone their success—let it motivate you to let go of limiting thoughts and create more success.
