## Exercise: Overcome Excuses

Everyone has favorite excuses or reasons for what they do or don’t do. But excuses usually aren’t the real reasons motivating what you do; they’re a rewrite of the facts to make you feel better later.

* * *

What excuse do you find yourself using frequently, or what’s an excuse you’ve used in the past week? (For instance, the traffic is terrible, my boss hates me, I don’t have time to exercise).

What's the real reason behind your excuse (for instance, maybe the real reason you’re late for work isn’t traffic, but oversleeping).

How can you reframe the situation to take responsibility and solve the problem?
