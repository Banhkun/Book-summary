## Exercise: Start the Recovery Process

Brown explains that the first step in recovering from emotional setbacks is acknowledging when you’re having a setback and what you’re feeling. Examine a past emotional setback to practice confronting your emotions.

* * *

Describe a recent time when you were upset but couldn’t figure out why. (For instance, maybe you went to a party in a good mood, but halfway through the night, you started feeling low. You ended up leaving the party in tears.)

What was the first physical or mental sensation you noticed that could be a clue to your emotional state? (For example, at the party, the first change you might have noticed was a strong mental urge to escape the situation by going to the bathroom or hiding in the corner.)

Now, dive deeper into the situation—what emotion could have caused the sensation that marked the beginning of your emotional setback? (For instance, what emotion made you want to escape the party? Maybe you were feeling anxious and self-conscious.)

Next, consider what event could have sparked this setback—what happened right before you started experiencing negative emotions? (For example, maybe your friend left to speak to someone else. You noticed that everyone else at the party seemed to be good friends, and you were the odd one out.)

Finally, what techniques can you use next time to confront these emotions when they arise? (For example, grounding yourself with breathing exercises may reduce your anxiety and bring you back into the moment so you can enjoy the party rather than getting stuck in your head and feeling self-conscious.)
