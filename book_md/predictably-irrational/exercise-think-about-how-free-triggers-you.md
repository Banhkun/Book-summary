## Exercise: Think About How “Free” Triggers You

Knowing how you tend to behave when “free” is in the equation can give you valuable insight into your vulnerabilities, helping you stop its influence.

* * *

When was the last time you got an item—or a feature of an item—for free? Describe the transaction.

Was this item or feature _truly_ free, or did you have to pay for it in time or money? (For example, you bought an overpriced printer because it came with 2 free ink cartridges, or you spent several hours in line waiting to get into a museum for free.)

If this item or feature hadn’t been free, would you have been able to justify this choice, or would you have made a different choice?

How can you commit to looking out for the influence of “free” in the future? (For example, looking on Groupon for discounted museum tickets, or crunching the numbers to figure out how much those two ink cartridges _really_ saved you.)
