## Chapter 8: How We Overrate Ownership

Ownership is an inherent, important part of your life—you own all sorts of things, from clothing to cars to trinkets. Unfortunately, our sense of ownership usually drives irrational selling and buying decisions. **First, we’ll look at how poor selling decisions are rooted in four particularities of human nature:**

  1. **You naturally start to love things as soon as you own them.** Imagine your parents give you a dog for your birthday. You’re astounded by your parents’ spot-on intuition when picking him out—he’s a perfect match for you. However, it’s very likely that you would have felt the same about any dog your parents gave you. The “perfect match” happened not because of your parents’ intuition, but rather your natural, immediate attachment to something that’s yours.
  2. **You focus on potential losses more than potential gains.** For example, if you were thinking of putting your bike up for sale, you’ll focus more on the loss of the transaction—losing use of the bike—than on the financial gain. This loss aversion might prevent you from putting the bike up for sale at all, or might prompt you to put a ridiculously high price on it. 
  3. **You assume that the other person shares your view of the transaction.** For example, if you were to sell your prom dress, you’d likely remember the night fondly and expect your buyer to notice how flattering the fit is and how it glitters in the sunlight. Your buyer, however, just sees a dress, and they’re more likely to notice some fraying around the zipper. 
  4. **Your sense of ownership becomes stronger the more work you put into an object.** If you were to buy a broken, old bike and refurbish it completely, you’d likely feel a stronger sense of ownership for it than you would for a bike that you bought in brand new condition.



### Navigating the Endowment Effect

**These particularities combine to create _the endowment effect_ —that is, when you own something, you automatically value it much more than other people do. **

The endowment effect contributes to poor selling decisions in several ways.

  * First, when you love an object or are focused primarily on the loss of the object, it will likely be much harder to part with—this drives you to place an exorbitant price on it, or choose not to sell it at all. 
  * Second, you’re likely to put a too-high price on items you’ve put a lot of work into—you’re pricing based on your effort, not based on the _actual_ value of the item. 
  * Third, even if you drastically overprice an item, you’ll assume that the price you’ve chosen is a fair price because you understand all the item’s pleasant, cost-worthy quirks. You don’t take into account that the buyer won’t see the item as better or different from another, similar, lower-priced item. 



Many people fall victim to the endowment effect when they put their houses on the market. Selling a house can be an emotional affair—the sellers have put years of work into the house and the landscaping, they’re focused on losing the place where their children grew up, and they’re fond of all the house’s wonderful quirks. Due to these factors, many sellers naturally assume that their house is worth more than similar houses. Subsequently, they price their home far above the neighborhood’s market value and reject offers that don’t reflect the value that they believe their homes have.

#### Don’t Let Ownership Own You

It’s very hard—perhaps impossible—to overcome ownership bias and teach yourself to think more objectively about the things you own. However, it’s important to realize that you overvalue and are inherently more confident about things that are “yours.” This is why you probably think you have better music taste than the average person or the way you decorate your home is best.

**Even if you can’t think objectively about your possessions, you _can_ make better decisions if you recognize how your ownership colors your perception.** Once you have this awareness, you’re in a better position to consider the advice of more neutral parties—such as a friend or real estate agent—who have a clearer, unburdened idea of the value of your possessions.

(Shortform note: For more on the endowment effect and how loss aversion affects your decision making, read our summary of Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

### How Advertisers Use “Virtual Ownership” to Sway You

**The effects of ownership don’t only influence our poor selling decisions. They can also influence poor buying decisions, due to the fifth particularity of human nature: You can feel ownership of an object _before_ you own it.** This is called _virtual ownership_ , and it’s a powerful selling tool.**** There are a few common ways that companies use virtual ownership to influence your buying decisions: advertisements and trial periods.

#### Advertisements

Many advertisements work by prompting you to imagine that you are experiencing the products advertised. When you see a commercial that features a smiling family on a cruise, you imagine yourself and your family in their place, enjoying a relaxing vacation under the sun. Or, you see a cologne ad in which a tuxedoed man shares dinner with a beautiful woman.

These advertisements feed you a visual story that prompts you to imagine yourself in place of the actors, experiencing the same positive feelings. Once you imagine yourself owning the advertised goods, you naturally fall in love with them and your lack of real-life ownership feels like a loss. This thought process often drives you to buy—and therefore _actually_ own—the product.

#### Trial Periods

Many companies go a step beyond visual advertisements, which merely let you _imagine_ what it’s like to own a product, and offer trial periods, which let you _experience_ what it’s like to own a product.

Usually, trials have an “out”—you can cancel at any time, or the trial will automatically end after 30 days. This out tricks you into thinking that testing out a product can’t do any harm. After all, it’s free, and you can easily stop the trial if you find you don’t have any use for the item. However, this is usually not the case.**Because trials are designed to replicate the feeling of ownership, you’ll naturally start to feel that the product is yours and become averse to losing it.** Instead of giving up the product at the end of the trial period, you’ll often end up purchasing it—even if you don’t particularly _need_ it.

For example, many entertainment streaming services offer 90-day trials. Often, you’ll agree to these trials, thinking you’ll binge a few shows over the 90 days and then be done with it because it’s not a necessity in your life. However, the trial period sees you immersing yourself in a few new shows, and making a nightly habit of watching an episode or two. By the end of your trial period, the service feels like a _necessary_ part of your routine that you’re happy to pay to maintain.

You also see virtual ownership at play in companies that rent out furniture and other home goods. These companies rent to you with the knowledge that you likely won’t bring back that couch at the end of your 6-month rental period. By then, the couch has become a valued part of your home. You opt to purchase the couch instead of returning it—likely costing you much more in the long run than simply buying a couch at the outset.

#### Avoid the Temptation of Virtual Ownership

You can avoid the trap of virtual ownership in several ways. First, when you see an advertisement, think about how the product will _really_ show up in your life. Often, you’ll find that it isn’t quite as you imagined it and the product isn’t necessary for you.

Second, avoid trial periods if you don’t need the product—once you “own” the product, it starts to _feel_ like a need. When it comes to renting, consider the cost of renting _then_ buying, instead of just renting. With this new figure in mind, does it make sense to rent, or would it be better to buy?
