## Exercise: Engage With Trustworthy Brands

Because general distrust trickles down from distrust of organizations and companies, it’s important that you engage with brands you trust.

* * *

Choose a brand you’d like to examine. How does this brand engage with complaints and try to improve themselves?

What type of initiatives does this brand take part in that are in the interest of the common good?

In what ways do you think of this brand’s marketing as honest or dishonest?
