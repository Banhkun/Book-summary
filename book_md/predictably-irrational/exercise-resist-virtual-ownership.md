## Exercise: Resist Virtual Ownership

Many advertisers will use “virtual ownership” to make you feel that you’re the owner of a product before you’ve even bought it. Work on recognizing this practice and taking a step back from the allure of ownership.

* * *

Think of a time you were influenced by virtual ownership—either by advertisement or trial period. Describe the purchase you made.

What ideas did you form about owning the product, as a result of the advertisement or trial period? (For example, an ad made you feel that you’d be Clooney-esque if you bought a new cologne. Your free trial of Hulu made watching a show before bed a relaxing habit.)

Looking back, how were your ideas about the product accurate or not accurate?

What do you think are the best ways to avoid virtual ownership in the future? (For example, refusing free trials that aren’t _needs_ , or doing research on an advertised product.)
