## Exercise: Break the Cycle of Comparative Consumption

Practice diminishing your comparison opportunities and broadening your perspective to avoid the irrational purchases that relativity can encourage.

* * *

Think of a large purchase you’re considering. What is the purchase, and what prompted you to first consider making it?

How do you think comparison may be influencing your decision to make a purchase? (For example, your friend got a jet ski and now you want one, or you recently saw an SUV that’s nicer than your current car.)

How can you diminish your comparison opportunities? (For example, not researching jet skis, or committing to _not_ going to the car dealership.)

Change your focus—what could that money be better spent on? (For example, you can go on vacation and _rent_ a jet ski, or you can put the SUV money toward a house.)
