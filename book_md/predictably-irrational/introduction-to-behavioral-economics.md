## Introduction to Behavioral Economics

The standard economic model that our world operates on is based on the idea that humans are rational creatures. This model assumes that when you’re presented with options or a decision to make, you’ll carefully weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each of your options, and choose the best possible outcome for yourself.

Furthermore, this model dictates that in the case you _do_ act irrationally and make a poor decision, the flaw of your decision will be quickly revealed to you, you’ll realize your mistake, and you’ll avoid making the same mistake again in the future.

**Behavioral economics, on the other hand, argues that humans are systematically irrational, often don’t recognize their mistakes, and don’t learn to make better decisions.**

The emerging discipline of behavioral economics pushes against the standard economic model and seeks to understand why humans so frequently depart from perfect reasoning skills and how our everyday environments are used to influence and shape irrational behaviors and decisions.

Both experiments and real-life scenarios consistently reveal a significant quirk of human nature—we’re not only irrational but _predictably_ so. Because we’re not conscious of when or why our decisions are irrational, we fail to correct our mistakes. Instead, we continue to repeat the same mistakes in such a predictable way that our irrational line of thinking can be _used against us_ —by marketing agencies, employers, or even your real estate agent.

The good news is, it doesn’t need to be this way. In this book, Duke behavioral economist and best-selling author Dan Ariely untangles the common pitfalls of human logic and explores the forces that _really_ drive your actions.**Armed with this knowledge and awareness, you can consciously avoid the traps of irrationality and improve your decision-making skills to act in ways more beneficial to you.**
