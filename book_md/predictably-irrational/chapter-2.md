## Chapter 2: How We Unreasonably Determine Reasonable Prices

Often, you’ll find that your idea of a fair price for a product doesn’t match another person’s idea of a fair price. This disparity can be explained by the concept of _arbitrary coherence_ —the “right” price you assign to an item is completely _arbitrary_. Usually, it’s simply the first price you saw that product listed for. But, once you have that price in mind, it influences how you think of the present and future prices for that product (_coherence_).

  * For example, if you happened to grow up in Hawaii, your idea of a fair price for a gallon of milk would be around $7. However, imagine if you lived in Wisconsin—where milk runs about $2.95 a gallon—before moving to Hawaii. You’d find Hawaii milk prices ludicrous. The product is the same, but your idea of what it should _reasonably_ cost is based on the milk prices wherever you happened to grow up. 



**This process of establishing a product’s price as “normal” and making it the benchmark by which you judge all other prices for that product is called _anchoring._** In this chapter, we’ll discuss just how irrational these anchor prices can be, and then examine how anchors can compound into long-term irrational decisions.

### How You Set Anchors

The figure you establish as “normal” is completely arbitrary—so it makes sense that anchoring can be triggered by _any_ figure. One experiment at MIT set out to explore this idea, using the digits of students’ social security numbers.

#### Experiment: Anchoring With Social Security Numbers

The participants were shown several objects up for silent auction—including several well-aged bottles of wine, Belgian chocolates, a book, a wireless mouse, and a keyboard and mouse package. Each participant received a list of the items and was asked to write the last two digits of her social security number at the top of the page. Then, they wrote those two digits next to each item in the form of a price (25 → $25, for example). Lastly, the participants indicated a) whether they would pay their listed price for each item, and b) what bid they’d prefer to place on each item.

**The results revealed that those with social security numbers ending in higher digits (80 to 99) were more likely to bid _higher_ on each item, and those with lower social security numbers ending in digits (01 to 20) were likely to bid the _lowest._**

#### What Might Anchoring Look Like for You?

While this experiment demonstrates that social security numbers can be effective anchors, it’s important to understand that _any_ number can have the same effect—the first two digits of the students’ phone numbers, for example. Of course, you don’t create anchors in your everyday life by thinking about your telephone number or social security number.

Rather, you are constantly influenced by prices—advertisements, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), a car salesman explaining a car’s value.**As soon as you consider buying a product at a particular price that’s been put before you, that price “sticks” as an anchor.** You may _rationally_ be aware that product prices must change depending on environment and circumstances, but _irrationally_ , these anchors will continue to inform your choices.

These choices may be small, such as determining that milk in Hawaii is too expensive based on your experience with milk prices in Wisconsin. Other times, anchoring might drastically affect how you make large decisions, such as looking for housing.

  * For example, when moving from Lancaster, Pennsylvania to Boston, you may _rationally_ expect housing prices in Boston to be much higher. Nevertheless, you will _irrationally_ —yet automatically—reference your anchor prices from Lancaster when looking for an apartment. This will drive you to downsize rather than spend more on housing than you’re used to. 



#### Experiment: Do Anchors Influence Future Decisions?

An experiment at MIT set out to determine if your anchors affect future purchases as well as those you make right after encountering an anchor.

In the first part of the experiment, two groups of participants had to listen to three 30-second clips of annoying sounds. After listening to the sounds, **Group A** was asked if they’d be willing to listen to the sound again for 10 cents, and to name the lowest payment they’d accept for listening to the sound again. **Group B** was asked the same questions, but their anchoring rate was 90 cents.

The results showed that participants in Group A asked for much less money to listen to the sound again (an average of 33 cents) than participants in Group B (who asked for an average of 73 cents).

In the second part of the experiment, participants from both groups listened to 30 seconds of a new annoying sound and were asked if they would listen to the sound again for 50 cents. Then, they had to indicate how much they’d ask to be paid to listen to it again. The results showed that Group A asked for a much lower payment than Group B—even though they’d both been presented with the new anchor of 50 cents.

These results suggest that our anchors, once established, influence our present decisions as well as our _future_ decisions. **In short, we tend to stick with our first impressions, even when they may not be rational—and knowing this is key to spotting your vulnerability to making irrational decisions based on impressions.**

### Making Decisions Based on Herding

To understand how an anchor can translate into long-term habits, it’s important to first understand the concept of _herding_. _Herding_ is when you observe the behaviors of other people to decide if something is good or bad and copy the crowd’s behavior. For example, if you see a line of people waiting to get into a restaurant, you’ll determine that it’s a good restaurant and might also hop in line.

**What’s interesting is that you can also perform _self-herding—_ you decide if something is good or bad depending on your _own_ past behavior, and you continue copying that behavior. **In this way, a positive first impression (anchor) about a decision you’ve made can result in a long pattern of copying your own behavior. Eventually, you believe this behavior is your preference and not just an echo of that first decision.

#### Example: The Sandwich Shop

On a whim, you decide to get a sandwich at the artisanal deli down the block from work, instead of going to Subway as usual. The sandwiches, while they’re much more expensive, aren’t much different. However, the deli has a nice perk—comfortable couches and a fireplace to enjoy while you eat. Overall, you form a positive first impression about the deli—which becomes the anchor underpinning your future lunchtime decisions.

The next week, you’re thinking about where to go for lunch. Rationally, you should think through your options while considering the cost of the food, the distance from work, and so on. Instead, you simply recall that you tried the deli and that you enjoyed the experience. Based on this positive first impression, you determine that the deli is a good choice and go again. So begins the process of _self-herding_.

The third week, you recall your two previous decisions to go to the deli and go again—a bit like getting in line behind the people queuing outside a restaurant. Based on the fact that you keep going to the deli, you may believe that it’s your preference. In fact, it’s just your primary decision compounded into a _habit.**Habits built from self-herding often aren’t the most rational choice.**_ You know, rationally, that Subway is closer to your office and offers a similar product for a lower cost. But, because you continue going to the deli, you irrationally believe that you’re making a conscious decision about how you want to spend your money.

##### The Circumstances That Can Set New Anchors

Since the products are similar, shouldn’t you be anchored to Subway’s prices, and realize that the cost of the artisanal sandwiches is too high? _Rationally, yes._ However, because the artisanal place _feels_ so different, it becomes a first impression, instead of being comparable to the Subway. If the deli had a very similar aesthetic to Subway, you’d likely realize that the high prices weren’t the best use of your money. But the fact of the matter is, the food looks nice and there are nice window seats—in your mind, it’s a completely different type of place and the higher prices are justified.

(Shortform note: For more examples of anchoring and how it works, read our summary of Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

### Making Better Decisions

Thinking rationally about your behaviors can help you untangle habits from your true preferences—allowing you to spend your money in more fulfilling ways. In examining your “preferences,” ask yourself several questions:

  * How did this preference start?
  * What pleasure am I getting from this preference? Is it worth the money and time I spend on it?
  * Is it possible for me to cut back? Is there a wiser way I could be spending this money? 



You can also prevent yourself from forming future habits by giving extra thought to your _first_ decisions to do something. Would you want it to become a long-term habit?

### Why the Supply & Demand Model Doesn’t Make Sense

The implications of price anchoring and our tendency to make irrational decisions based on our own past behaviors and impressions are much further-reaching than choosing a favorite sandwich shop. In fact, we should be rethinking the standard supply and demand model. Standard economics would tell us that prices are determined by demand—the higher the demand, the more people are willing to pay for a product.

However, we know this model doesn’t make sense, because our anchors are so arbitrary.

  * First, people often aren’t aware of their anchors, so it’s hard to accurately predict how much they’d be willing to pay for a product. 
  * Second, anchors can be manipulated _very_ easily—simply thinking about several random digits can create an anchor. 



**These findings of behavioral economics suggest that it’s actually the _prices themselves_ , or the anchoring that happens on the supply end of the system, that influence how much people will pay. **

Furthermore, the discussion of self-herding tells us that looking at peoples' _preferences_ won’t give you accurate information about their willingness to pay for products—their demand is based on their _memories_. The aversion we feel to paying a higher price for a product is because we remember how much we paid for it in the past (or the anchor we established when we considered buying it), and we want our present decisions to be _coherent_ with our past decisions. Of course, this means that over time, your anchors can naturally change.

  * For example, if the price of milk in Wisconsin jumped from $2.95 to $5 overnight, there would be a steep drop in demand because the _memory_ of $2.95 gallons would be fresh in everyone’s minds. However, as they continue needing to buy $5 milk over time, the decision to do so becomes a habit—decisions coherent with previous decisions. Over the long term, their memories of the $2.95 gallon would fade and demand for milk would steadily increase back to where it was before.
