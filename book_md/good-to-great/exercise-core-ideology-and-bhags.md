## Exercise: Core Ideology and BHAGs

Use these exercises to explore your core ideology and Big Hairy Audacious Idea.

* * *

In the space below, write down your core purpose and three core values. (These can be the core purpose/values of your business, your position at your job, or yourself a person.)

Now, using the area of your life you used in the question above, write down the BHAG you’d like to achieve in that area.

If you’ve completed the Hedgehog Concept exercises, examine your BHAG in relation to your Hedgehog Concept. Are the two in alignment, or do they contradict one another? Why? And how might you change your BHAG to match your Hedgehog Concept?
