## Exercise: Your Own Hedgehog Diagram

Use this exercise to home in on your own Hedgehog Concept, whether in work or life.

* * *

Answer the question, “What can I do better than anyone else in the world?” Brainstorm some answers and write them below.

Answer the questions, “What is my financial engine? What is my economic denominator?” (Reminder: this is a ratio like “profit per X” that best reflects the economics of your business.)

Answer the question, “What am I profoundly passionate about?” Brainstorm some answers and write them below.

Review your answers to the three questions. Are there overlaps between your answers to the different questions? Is there a Hedgehog Concept among your answers that can fit in the space where all three circles insect?
