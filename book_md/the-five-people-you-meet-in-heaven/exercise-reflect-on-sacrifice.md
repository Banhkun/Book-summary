## Exercise: Reflect on Sacrifice

The Captain teaches Eddie that we should be proud of our sacrifices. Reflect on your own sacrifices and how theyâ€™ve helped others or improved your life.

* * *

Think of a time when you had to make a difficult sacrifice. What did you feel you were giving up or losing?

Looking back, what silver linings came out of that situation? Did you gain anything as a result of your sacrifice?

Is there something or someone in your life that you would be willing to sacrifice a lot for? What or who makes you feel that way?
