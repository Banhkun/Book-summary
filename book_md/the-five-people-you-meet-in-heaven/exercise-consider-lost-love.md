## Exercise: Consider Lost Love

Marguerite teaches Eddie that love does not have to end when life does. Rather, our love for those we’ve lost is still alive within us.

* * *

Remember someone you have loved and lost—any friend, family member, or romantic partner. What were some of the things you loved most about them?

How can you continue to keep that person’s love alive and strong within you? What memories will you hold onto when you need to remember and feel their love?
