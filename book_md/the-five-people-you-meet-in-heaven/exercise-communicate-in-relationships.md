## Exercise: Communicate in Relationships

Eddie struggles to communicate with his loved ones. For example, he and his father were never able to tell each other their true feelings. He was never able to tell Marguerite the truth about the war and how it affected him. Eddieâ€™s lack of communication had effects on his personal relationships. Reflect on how you communicate within your relationships.

* * *

Think of a difficult truth that you have struggled to tell a loved one in your life. Why were you hesitant to communicate honestly with that person?

If you did eventually tell that person the truth, how did it feel to be open? If you were not able to tell that person the truth, how did it feel to keep it inside?

What is something that you want to communicate to someone in your life right now but are afraid to? What do you have to gain by being honest?
