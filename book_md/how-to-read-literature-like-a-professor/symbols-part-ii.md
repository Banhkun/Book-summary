## Symbols Part II: The Symbolic Significance of Setting

Every good story needs a setting, the time and place in which the story takes place. In literature, the setting is not only the backdrop for the story but an integral part of the story itself. **The setting of a particular story informs the mood of the story, the attitude of the characters, and the presentation of the themes**.

### Weather

When you begin reading a poem or a novel, **take notice right away of any weather** that is mentioned. **Weather is never only about weather** in a piece of literature.

Weather can also act as:

  * **Plot device:** The weather can force characters to do something, such as come together to get out of the rain.
  * **Atmosphere enhancement:** The mood of the story is indicated by the weather conditions.
  * **Democratic element:** All characters, just or unjust, are affected equally by the weather. 



The most popular weather condition employed by authors in literature is rain. **Rain** has many associations that you should be aware of as a reader:

  * **Drowning:** Humans are land creatures, and as such have a fear of drowning. When an author employs rain in association with flooding or drowning, she speaks to the reader’s primal fear.
  * **Misery:** For an author, having characters stuck in the rain is a great way to make them even more miserable than they already were. 
  * **Cleansing:** When a character walks through the rain, it is usually a symbol that they are being cleansed. 
    * Example: In Toni Morrison’s _Song of Solomon_ , Hagar goes to shops and salons in an effort to fit the “white” ideal of beauty. On the way home, she gets caught in the rain, ruining her new clothes and hairstyle. She has been symbolically _cleansed_ of her false standards of beauty. 
  * **Mud:** Just as rain can cleanse, it can also create mud that leaves you literally or metaphorically stained.
  * **Restoration:** Rain can bring nature back to life and restore new growth.
  * **Rainbows:** Rainbows symbolize a divine peace—a harmony between God, people, and nature.



Of course, other weather has associations, too.

  * **Fog is a symbol of confusion**. When an author puts fog over a scene, it shows that things are ethically, mentally, or emotionally murky. 
  * **Snow can symbolize inhospitality, starkness, severity.** On the other hand, snow is sometimes used to invoke playful, warm, and cozy images. 



There are too many possibilities for weather to cover in one book. The most important thing is to learn to **see weather as something to analyze as a purposeful choice on the part of the author**.

### Geography

Every time an author sits down to write a story, one of the first questions he asks himself is _where will this story take place?_ An intelligent reader will recognize the geography of a novel as a conscious choice on the author’s part to deepen the story’s meaning.

In literature, geography is not only about the earth’s physical features, like hills, rivers, and seas. **Literary geography is about the ways in which a specific place forges the people who live there.**

Geography informs a novel’s:

  * **Atmosphere**
    * Example: In Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,” the narrator describes the geography of the landscape in detail before ever getting to the house or the characters. By illustrating the dreary geography, he sets the mood of the story before it even begins.
  * **Character development**
    * Example: In Barbara Kingsolver’s _The Bean Trees,_ the main character moves from her small hometown to the vast West coast. Her nature is reflected by this move—she opens her mind to new people and experiences and embraces personal growth. 
  * **Plot**
    * Example: In E.M. Forster’s _A Room with a View_ , the protagonist, Lucy, travels to Florence, where she falls in love and sheds off the societal stiffness she is used to. Forster’s use of geographic change is the prompt for the novel’s plot. 



Characters go traveling in a lot of literary works, and often they travel south. There are a couple of different **thematic elements you should look for in a novel when a character goes south** :

  1. Moving geographically south can be a symbol for going deep into the psyche. In “the south” (meaning any place south of where the character started), characters encounter new political ideas or philosophical viewpoints. Often the author is suggesting that those ideas were there all along, in the character’s subconscious. 
  2. Writers send characters south so that they can get into trouble. Whether the consequences are tragic or comic, the warmer climate and wider horizons associated with “the south” allow characters more room to run amok. 



Hills and valleys are another form of geography that have somewhat specific thematic implications.

  * Valleys and low land are associated with crowds, shadows, unpleasantness, swamps, and heat. 
  * Hills and high places are used to signify snow, ice, clean air, good views, and isolation. 



As a reader, you should also consider an author’s __ personal geography when reading their work. For example, poet Theodore Roethke was largely influenced by his background in the Midwest. To truly understand and appreciate his poetry, the reader should understand how that midwesterness influenced his thematic concerns and artistic voice.

### Season

Many authors of literary works have used seasons symbolically to enhance the reader’s sense of themes and characters. Over the course of literary history, the seasons have been used so often and so consistently that each season carries ingrained meanings and associations.

**Autumn:**

  * Middle-age
  * Harvest
  * Reflection
  * Tiredness
    * Example: In Robert Frost’s “After Apple Picking,” the speaker is tired after bringing in a huge harvest. This is inherently autumnal: as we reap the rewards of our efforts, we also reflect on the energy we’ve used and the time that has passed. 



**Winter:**

  * Old age
  * Unhappiness/anger/hatred
  * Death
    * Example: In W.H. Auden’s “In Memory of W.B. Yeats,” there is a lot of wintery language. There is snow, a frozen river, and all of the unpleasantness associated with the cold. Auden is being literal (Yeats died in winter), but he’s also using the winter to represent death and the old age at which Yeats passed away. 



**Spring:**

  * Birth/fertility 
  * Youth
  * Fresh possibilities
    * Example: Henry James names his title character _Daisy_ Miller. Daisies and other flowers are associated with spring. The reader shouldn’t be surprised to learn that this character is young, beautiful, and full of naive idealism. 



**Summer:**

  * New adulthood
  * Passion
  * Love
  * Freedom
    * Example: Shakespeare writes, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?” Even before he goes on to use words like “lovely” and “temperate,” the reader knows this is high praise.



As readers, our emotional responses and associations to the seasons are deeply ingrained. This means that an author can choose to play into those expectations and easily create meaning with fewer words.
