## Advice for Readers

### Irony Changes Everything

**An intelligent reader will always be on the lookout for irony in literature—when an author plays against expectations**. When irony is in play in a novel, every other chapter in this book is irrelevant, because the author will invert the typical meanings of symbols and archetypes.

Some modern writers, like James Joyce and Angela Carter, deal almost exclusively with irony. So as you become more familiar with their work, you will be ready for them to go against your conventional expectations. But how can you spot irony in other works of literature?

**If there is a disconnect between your expectation of a story and the reality of how it plays out, it is most likely ironic**. The conversation between the expectation and reality deepens the meaning of the work.

Think of irony like jazz music. Before a soloist takes off on a jazzy improvisation, he begins by playing the melody straight. That way, when he starts riffing on that melody, the audience can hear how his changes enhance and play against the basic melody. That kind of dual hearing is what irony does in literature. Our expectations are the melody, and the irony is the solo.

Some kinds of irony in literature:

  * **Verbal irony** : When a character says something that means something else (sort of like sarcasm). 
    * Example: In Oscar Wilde’s _The Importance of Being Earnest_ , a character observes that a widow’s hair is “quite gold from grief.” This is ironic because normally we would expect someone who is grieving to grow gray hair.
  * **Ironic mode** : The characters have less free will or knowledge than the reader does. In most literary works, characters are equal to the audience in terms of autonomy and knowledge. But in ironic mode, characters struggle against conflicts that the reader could easily overcome.
  * **Structural or dramatic irony** : The author goes against the reader’s expectations of the plot or the overall structure of a story. 
    * Example: In Samuel Beckett’s _Waiting for Godot_ , two characters stand by the side of a road for the entire play. As we know, roads are normally associated with trips, and trips normally suggest a quest. But Beckett’s characters never go anywhere and the road never brings anything to them, either. Because Beckett knows the reader’s expectations of a road, he has the freedom to do the opposite and create irony. 



### Read With an Open Mind

In order to read like a professor, you’ll have to learn to read without your own biases and the fixed position of being you in the year that you are in. Instead, you should try to **read every novel as it was intended to be read**.

As a reader, you should remain open-minded enough that you can sympathize with the historical moment in which a novel was written. And sometimes the social, historical, or cultural background of that novel will clash with what you know or feel to be true.

For example, Greek epics have many unsympathetic qualities, like concubines and violent slaughter. But there are plenty of valuable lessons to learn from these works if you can read like a citizen of ancient Greece and put those things aside.

Unfortunately, some literature will have racist undertones or sexist remarks. And sometimes, you will want to reject those works rather than try to sympathize with the author. That is your prerogative as a reader. However, you should always give the novel a chance with an open mind before you decide to reject it.

#### Example: “Sonny’s Blues”

At the end of James Baldwin’s “Sonny’s Blues,” the main character shows forgiveness and understanding to his brother, a reformed drug addict, by sending him a drink. Today, many readers know that alcohol can be dangerous to a recovering addict. But in 1957 when the story was written, that information was not widely known. And more importantly, it isn’t helpful in understanding the story.

“Sonny’s Blues” is a story about the main character’s redemption, not Sonny’s. And as the reader, if you can’t differentiate your own knowledge about addiction from what was known at the time, you risk missing the touching message at the end of the story.

### There’s No Such Thing as Being “Right”

So far in this book, we’ve learned to find and interpret symbols, allusions, and more. But a lot of readers wonder—did the author really _intend_ to put all of those things in their text?

The truth is that (with the exception of some authors who have actually talked or written about their work) there’s really no way to know for sure.

Many modern writers, such as James Joyce and T.S. Eliot, employ their symbols and references so intentionally that we can confidently say that they mean every inference that the reader can find. Their use of mythic structures is so complex that we know it can’t be spontaneous.

Before 1900, almost all writers would have received some amount of classical education. And their readers would, too—even more than the average reader today. So it is fair to assume that references to Shakespeare and other classic works were fairly deliberate.

We must also remember that an author spends a lot of time composing their novel, which gives them plenty of time to consider every angle and bring in a great deal of related material.

That said, a reader’s obligation should not be to the author of a particular work but to the text itself. If you think you discover meaning from the words on the page, without skipping or adding anything, then you probably did. And since it is impossible to prove a writer’s intentions, **the more important thing to consider is what the reader can discover from the text**.

Once you discover something in the text, don’t get caught up in needing to prove yourself right. When discussing meaning and interpretation of literature, many readers say things like “I could be wrong” or “It’s just my opinion.” But **you, as the reader, have ownership over your interpretation of the story**. So trust your instincts.
