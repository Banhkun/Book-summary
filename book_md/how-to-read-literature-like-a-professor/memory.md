## Memory: Compare Texts

Readers who are new to literature might feel as though everything they read is new. But really, **there is no such thing as a new story**.

All literary works are alive and involved with each other like eels in a barrel. Each time a new eel is created, it squirms its way into the barrel. It _is_ new, but it’s also an eel just like every other one that ever has been or ever will be in the barrel.

Just because an author can’t create anything purely original anymore, doesn’t mean that modern literature is derivative or unimportant. Rather, new literature gains significance from the harmony and dissonance it strikes with what came before.

Once you understand that all stories—no matter the genre—exist together as part of one big story, you can begin to see the patterns and recurrences between them. This is what critics call **intertextuality**. Authors use references and parallels to draw connections to previous literary works.

**Intertextuality in literature deepens the meaning of the text by drawing on the reader’s expectations**.

### Example: _Going After Cacciato_

A great example of an author referencing previous literature is Tim O’Brien in his novel _Going After Cacciato_. The novel has three interwoven stories: one, the history of protagonist Paul Berlin’s war experiences; two, an imagined trip to Paris in search of their fellow soldier Cacciato; three, the present night in which Paul Berlin is remembering the first story and inventing the second.

Paul Berlin’s fantasy trip to Paris is made up of a bunch of stories, each based on or influenced by some novel, story, or historical figure from the past. Tim O’Brien, as the author, knows this. But Paul Berlin, the character, doesn’t. He is simply making up stories the way everyone else does—by drawing on other stories.

For example, in one part of Berlin’s fantasy, he and his squad fall down a hole in the road. They end up in an otherworldly network of tunnels. One character even states that they need to fall back up. As a reader, you are invited to relate this part of the story to when Alice falls down the rabbit hole in Lewis Carroll’s _Alice in Wonderland_.

**Now that you have made that connection, your reading of the story will be nuanced by that awareness**. You might expect that the tunnels the characters find themselves in will be some kind of wonderland for them.

### Analyze Intertextuality Like a Professor

Don’t worry if you aren’t able to catch allusions to intertextuality right away when reading literature. The worst thing that happens is you miss the references and enjoy a good story anyway.

It takes a lot of practice and knowledge of other books to begin to make connections and consciously look for layers beyond the text on the page. When you do, you will enrich your reading experience and give yourself the opportunity to see the way **an author might play with your expectations based on literary references**.

  * Example: In _Wise Children_ , author Angela Carter uses the character Tiffany to subvert expectations and surprise the reader. First, Tiffany goes crazy and supposedly drowns. The reader might draw the conclusion that Tiffany represents Shakespeare’s Ophelia. But later, Tiffany comes back to teach her cheating lover a lesson. Now, the reader might think of Tiffany as more closely related to Shakespeare’s Hero character. Here, Carter uses intertextuality to delight and double-cross the reader. 



### Sacred Texts

In order to truly read literature like a professor, you need to **be on the lookout for references to “sacred texts,”** like Shakespeare, the Bible, classic fairy tales, and ancient myths.

Using recognizable themes or plots from these sacred texts gives the author the chance to use the reader’s associations to say more in their own work with fewer words. And for the reader, recognition of these references enhances the experience of current literature, because the modern stories share in the power of the sacred text.

#### Shakespeare

**Authors in every time period have reinvented Shakespeare in their own works**. You see Shakespeare’s plot devices, themes, and language adapted in plays, movies, and literature from every age.

For example, Jane Smiley’s novel _A Thousand Acres_ is a rethinking of _King Lear._ Although the time and place are much different, the themes of greed, love, and misunderstanding are still the same.

There are some surface reasons that authors choose to use Shakespeare for inspiration:

  1. His plays are great—from the characters to the plots.
  2. The language is astounding—from the grandiose speeches to the witty dialogue.
  3. His work has taken on the quality of a sacred text—it has authority. 
  4. Using Shakespeare references proves that the author has read Shakespeare, and catching the references makes readers feel accomplished. 



However, the use of Shakespeare goes beyond the surface in some ways as well, making his intertextual references deeper than many others. **Shakespeare’s work provides a source against which writers can challenge ideas and struggle through timeless questions**. The new literature has a chance to have a say in the dialogue opened up in Shakespeare’s classics.

  * Example: Athol Fugard’s play _“Master Harold” … and the Boys_ uses Shakespeare’s _Henry IV, Part II_ as a device. In Shakespeare’s classic, Prince Hal must grow up and become King Henry. To do this, he has to turn his back on an old friend. Fugard’s plot is similar. In an effort to assume responsibility, Master Harold must turn away his black friends. Fugard invites his audience to question whether choosing to regress toward racism is really the mark of growing up. **He challenges Shakespeare’s values, and gives the audience the chance to do the same.**



Authors know that Shakespeare is the most well-known writer in history, so they rely on a reader’s awareness of Shakespeare to deepen the meaning of their own work. This allows reading to be a creative activity—not only for the writer, but for the reader, too.

#### Fairy Tales

**Fairy tales are popular choices for authors to reference because they’re an assumed body of knowledge**. While some readers might not be able to pick up allusions to more traditional works, they have certainly internalized the classic fairy tales. The author wants her story to be new, but also to have familiarity. And, as an added bonus,**there is very little ambiguity in fairy tales.**

“Hansel and Gretel” is one of the most commonly adapted fairy tales in modern literature. The story of children far away from home, lost in a forest, and captured by some evil witch in a strange place—you’ve probably seen a version of this in something you’ve read.

As an example, let’s think of a modern story with a fairy tale inspiration: A young couple is driving their BMW and get lost in a big city. Their cell phones are dead and their only option is to stop into a crack house. Sure, the young people aren’t brother and sister. Instead of their bread crumbs getting eaten by birds, their phones die. The crack house probably isn’t made out of gingerbread. But the ideas from the original fairy tale are still there.

In order to read literature like a professor, you want to see the details, patterns, or pieces of the story that the author is taking from the old fairy tale. Then, you have to ask _why?_ **Why did the author borrow that particular element, and what does it illuminate about their own story?**

As a reader, you should also be on the lookout for irony—the use of a common pattern that goes against expectations. When the author puts the unambiguous world view of a fairy tale in conversation with our highly ambiguous reality, there is almost always irony there. (We will talk more about irony in a later chapter.)

#### Myth

In general, the term **“myth” means a story that explains people to people**. Classic myths are stories that are deeply ingrained in the memory of a group and that have the power to shape a culture’s way of seeing the world.

When an author uses a myth as inspiration for their work, he is reaching back to stories that matter to him and his tribe.

_Why_ do authors use myths as guides for their own work? **To show their characters’ nobility, while also highlighting their actions as primal.** In Greek and Roman myths, characters heroically struggle against nature, the divine, other people, and themselves.

  * Example: Derek Walcott’s _Omeros_ uses parallels to _The Iliad_ and _The Odyssey_ to tell the story of a community of Caribbean fishermen. He knows this community intimately and wants to tell their story in a way that highlights their struggles, as well as their triumphs. The narrative guide of the classic myths allows Walcott to show the nuances of the fishermen’s condition by associating their story with an ancient epic. 



Sometimes, authors put classic myths up to a funhouse mirror to distort the stories and show sillier correspondences to our reality. These ironic parallels are still meant to show some kind of nobility or voyage.

  * Example: In James Joyce’s _Ulysses_ , each strange episode is an homage to some incident in _The Odyssey_. Instead of a visit to the god of winds, Joyce has his character visit a newspaper office, where a gust of wind blows through. 



When reading, remember that **a reference to mythology in literature means that the author is giving you a hint that their story goes beyond what is on the page**. She is trying to teach you something about the human condition.

### The Bible

Like Shakespeare’s work, the Bible is an age-old and widely-known text that provides authors (even non-religious ones) the chance to deepen the meaning of their work with relatively few words.

In literature, the Bible inspires:

  * Plots
  * Titles
  * Character names
  * Quotations



Think of some of the common stories from the Bible: Judgement Day, the Fall, the Prodigal Son. Have you seen these stories mirrored in literary works before? Chances are, you have.

Example: In James Joyce’s story “Araby,” a young boy feels desire for the first time, so he tries to buy a gift for the object of his desire. In the process, he realizes that his affections are just the ordinary kind, and that this girl will probably never love him. Any story, like this one, that is about**a loss of innocence is really a story about the Fall of man**.

**Many authors use the Bible to highlight the differences between religious tradition and modern life**.

  * Example: Ernest Hemingway used the title _The Sun Also Rises_ , which alludes to a passage from the Bible that is about life’s endless cycle. The passage reminds us that every night is followed by a new day, and every death is followed by new life. But Hemingways’ book is about hopelessness—it’s about infertility and the feeling that the future will never come. Hemingway’s ironic biblical reference is meant to highlight a key theme for the reader.



#### How to Look for Biblical Allusions Like a Professor

**If you read something that seems to resonate more deeply than the story itself, chances are it comes from something bigger** , like a Bible story. If a quotation sounds different than the rest of the story’s prose, take note.

When you read something that alludes to the Bible, know that the author is trying to give you the sense that the story is not only about the characters in that time and place. The author wants you to know that **the story is timeless—it speaks to the tensions and struggles that have existed since the beginning of man**.

#### Christ Figures

In order to read literature like a professor, **you must be able to recognize the religious traditions of the culture from which the literature originates**. For example, to read English and American novels in a scholarly capacity, you will need to know about the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.

Even if the author of a particular novel is not a religious believer, Christian principles and values will inform the literary work because it is such a dominant part of our culture.

One of the most prevalent ways that religion informs literature is through the presence of a Christlike figure. How do you know when a character is being portrayed as a parallel to Christ?

Look for some of these signs:

  * Wounds on hands, feet, side, or head
  * Self-sacrifice
  * Good with kids
  * Disciples
  * Parables
  * Walking on water
  * Outstretched arms
  * Resurrection
  * Time alone in wilderness
  * Temptation by the devil
  * Restores hope to those around him



Within a literary work, a character who stands for a Christ figure might not necessarily exhibit all of these signs. The figure could be a woman, a criminal, or any kind of character—even one that looks opposite to the Christ we know from the Bible. But if you can identify a couple of the listed behaviors in a character, you should put your antennae up.

The use of a Christ figure in a novel can serve many purposes, not all of which will suggest something religious. Perhaps the author wants to deepen the sense of sacrifice or forgiveness or redemption in their novel by using the parallel to Christ.

##### Example: The Old Man and the Sea

In Hemingway’s _The Old Man and the Sea,_ we meet an old, **pure-of-heart** fisherman who **befriends a young boy**. During a fishing trip one day, the old man catches a big fish and gets **carried out to sea, alone**. During his struggles at sea, the man comes up with several **parable-like pieces of wisdom**. Three days later, he comes back to land, where everyone assumed him dead—a kind of **resurrection**. He goes home and lays on his bed with his **arms thrown out to the side**. He has **raw, damaged hands** from his adventure. Because of the fish he returns with, peoples’ belief in the old man is **redeemed**.

Even for beginning readers, the parallels between Hemingway’s story and the Christian portrayal of Christ are clear.
