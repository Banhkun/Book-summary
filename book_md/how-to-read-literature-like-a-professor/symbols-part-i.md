## Symbols Part I: Recognize and Interpret Metaphor

Even readers who are new to literature usually know to ask themselves, “Is this a symbol?” The next question they might ask is, “what does it mean?”

One problem with symbols is that they can mean so many different things to different readers. In fact, it is the mark of a great piece of literature when readers and scholars can come to different, even conflicting, interpretations.

(The exception to this rule is allegory. **Allegories convey a particular message by associating a symbol with one specific meaning**.

  * Example: Paul Bunyon’s _The Pilgrim’s Process_ is an allegory in which the main character, Christian, is traveling to the Celestial City. This is meant to directly convey the devout Christian getting to heaven. There is no ambiguity that allows for a different understanding of the story.)



Another problem with symbols is that different authors can use the same symbol in many different ways. For example, let’s look at three different rivers from three different authors:

  1. Mark Twain uses the Mississippi River in _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ to symbolize both danger and safety. Although Huck and Jim are mostly safe from the dangers they flee on land, they also battle the dangers of river travel.
  2. Hart Crane uses American rivers in his poem _The Bridge_ to symbolize connectivity. Although rivers cut off two pieces of land horizontally, they also connect other lands vertically. 
  3. T.S. Eliot uses the River Thames in _The Wasteland_ to symbolize the decay of modern life in Western culture. 



The final problem with symbols is that they aren’t always objects. **Actions can also be used as symbols**. For example, Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken” is literally about deciding between two paths. But it has become a universally used graduation poem because it can symbolize choosing your direction in life.

**When interpreting symbols in literature, think of it as an imaginative and intellectual exercise**. You should actively bring yourself to the encounter with the text. Use your instincts about how the text makes you _feel_ , and don’t be afraid to use those feelings to infer meaning from symbols. Associate the symbol with everything you can, then toss out the associations that don’t seem to apply.

Remember: A symbol’s literal meaning within the narrative will always be its primary purpose. The metaphorical meaning is secondary to that. If a novel is unsuccessful at telling the story, no amount of symbolism will change that. On the other hand, if a novel presents a great story _and_ a variety of figurative symbols and imagery, that is the sign of a great piece of literature.

#### Example: _A Passage to India_

In E. M. Forster’s _A Passage to India_ , a progressive woman named Adela is taken on an outing to the Marabar Caves by an Indian man named Dr. Aziz. In the cave, Adela has a confusing experience. She runs out of the caves bruised and scared, feeling as though she’s been assaulted. She later discounts her own story, unable to be sure of what transpired in those caves.

The mysterious caves in the story __ are clearly symbols—but that’s the only thing that’s clear about them. Readers can infer a variety of meanings from the caves. Here are just a few:

  * Considering caves as the dwellings of our earliest ancestors, you might read the caves as a symbol of the most primitive elements of human nature. Maybe Adela was scared when confronted with the most basic element of her own nature. 
  * Perhaps Forster was implying that every person’s cave is different. Throughout the beginning of the novel, the caves are only described very vaguely, as though they must be seen to be understood. The reader could interpret the caves as standing for our own, individual fears. 
  * Adela’s cave could symbolize her fear of matrimony and sex. She is on the cusp of an arranged marriage and comes out of the cave feeling as though she has been assaulted. Perhaps this is a symbol of her feeling the marriage is being thrust on her. 
  * The caves could be a racial or cultural symbol in some way. 



_A Passage to India_ is a great work of literature because of its networks of possible meanings and significance. The fact that **every reader can bring his own experience to the book and come away with a different interpretation** of the caves speaks to the power of its symbols.

### Vampires, Ghosts, and Other Exploitative Characters

In literature, **scary characters like vampires and ghosts are almost always a symbolic representation of the darker side of our reality.**

Think about Dracula: An old, dangerous, alluring man who preys on beautiful, unmarried women. When he finds a victim, he uses her life force to become younger and more alive. Read that way, it seems that Count Dracula is about a lot more than just a cheap scare.

Beyond the literal interpretation of vampirism (sucking blood and the rest), **vampirism should be read symbolically to mean exploitation of others** , seduction, and a lack of respect for others’ autonomy.

Similarly, literary ghosts are always about more than scaring the reader. Often, they are meant to present a lesson. For example, in _A Christmas Carol_ , Marley’s ghost is there to teach Scrooge about ethics.

Doppelgangers and evil twins are scary, of course. But they also show the dual nature of humans, like Dr. Jekyll’s other half, Hyde. Even a respectable doctor has a dark side that is capable of evil.

The Victorian era of literature was particularly full of vampire and ghost stories because mythical characters were a convenient way to write about subjects that were considered taboo at the time—like sex. Victorian authors translated these taboo subjects into symbolic forms, like vampires, to avoid censorship issues. Can you see how a man sucking the blood of a woman might be representative of a sexual encounter?

Even today, writers use scary things to symbolize the dark side of human nature and experience. But **the difficult part about recognizing vampiric symbols in literature today is that they aren’t always presented as vampires**.

  * Example: In Henry James’ _Daisy Miller_ , a young, innocent American girl named Daisy is interested in an older, prestigious man named Winterbourne. Because Daisy doesn’t subscribe to the rules of society, Winterbourne is both attracted to and repulsed by her. Winterbourne strings Daisy along until she is left with no energy or interest to go on. Here, Winterbourne exemplifies the consuming spirit of a vampire, showing that there is a thin line between ordinary people and monsters. 



Any time you read about a character or group who grows in strength by weakening someone else, analyze how that character is vampiric in nature.

And **any time you read a book about vampires, ghosts, or other scary figures, consider how there might be a dual purpose in the story, as a parallel to reality**.

### The Symbol of Flight

Since human beings cannot actually fly, **when a character in literature takes flight, it is a symbol of freedom**. This could mean freedom from a particular place or circumstance, or freedom from all the general struggles that weigh us down.

  * Example: In Steven Spielberg’s movie _E.T._ , the children literally escape from road-blocked streets in their neighborhood when their bikes fly into the air. They also metaphorically escape the conformity, suspicion, and hostility of the people chasing them. 



But if the symbol only worked when characters literally took flight, it wouldn’t be very helpful. Instead, these **examples of actual flight give us instruction for how we should interpret figurative, imagined, or failed flight in literature**.

  * Example: In Fay Weldon’s _Hearts and Lives of Men_ , a young girl and her kidnapper find themselves in the rear section of a plane that has exploded in two. Improbably, they glide down to the earth unharmed. This depiction of falling from a great height is an interpretation of flight. Usually, that fall would result in death, so their survival is a symbol of rebirth and second chances. What does it mean to come face to face with death and escape it? 



**Flight is also used a lot in literature to express spirituality**. In the Christian tradition, it is a common notion that the soul can flutter or fly separately from the body.

  * Example: In Shakespeare’s _Hamlet_ , Claudius attempts to pray. Although his “words fly up,” he admits that his “thoughts remain below.” This is a symbolic way to say that his spirit is weighed down by guilt. 



When it comes to common symbols such as flight,**irony changes everything**. But irony only works because the patterns of symbols are so established that authors can feel free to invert them.

  * Example: In Angela Carter’s _Night Circus_ , the heroine, Fevvers, has wings. But she is outcast from society and forced to perform in a circus act. Ironically, she is trapped by the one thing that should be a symbol of freedom. Carter’s use of wings and flight enhances the sense of captivity in the novel by working against what the reader expects flight to symbolize.



### Unique Symbols

Not all authors use common symbols, such as flight, that have ready-made associations attached. **Some writers use a symbol that is private to them, and that makes it slightly more challenging for the reader to interpret**.

  * Example: In John Donne’s poem “A Valediction: Forbidden Mourning,” the speaker is saying goodbye to his beloved. He compares himself and his lover to a geometry compass—she is the static foot and he is the pencil point. He says that he’ll always be connected to her, no matter how far he roams, because she is the center of his life. 



There aren’t many poems that employ mathematical instruments as symbols, so you can’t fall back on your expectations to interpret the symbolism of the compass. At first, you may not understand the ways in which two people could be like the foot and point of a compass, or what this comparison signifies. However, you have other associations of goodbyes, themes of connectedness, and lovers’ promises that you can look to for guidance in interpreting the compass in this poem.

**You can decode unique symbols by using what you learn from the work itself**. Every literary work teaches you how to understand it as you read along.

  * Example: There is no other novel that is like James Joyce’s _Ulysses_ , so you won’t be ready to read it until you begin reading it. Joyce presents his narrative strategies in a way that unfolds chapter by chapter and allows the reader to come along for the ride. 



Another strategy for interpreting unique symbols is to **trust what you know**. Every novel, poem, story, movie, and play you’ve read or seen in the past has been preparation for the next thing you will read. Don’t deny yourself credit for all of the examples of symbolism that you’ve encountered—you know more than you might think.

#### Example: _W. B. Yeats_

Irish poet W. B. Yeats is notorious for employing very unique or private symbols in his body of work. One in particular: A tower with a winding staircase. He bought the tower and lived in it for many years, and was always interested in the image.

In his poetry, Yeats uses this tower to symbolize many different things in many different ways:

  * A representation of being rooted in Ireland.
  * A setting from which to watch the unfolding Civil War.
  * A symbol for imperfect art. 
  * An illustration of retreat from the modern world. 
  * A means of connecting to past aristocracy. 



Because there are no uses of this particular tower and its winding staircase anywhere else in literature, readers will find Yeats’s work challenging at first. In fact, it might take several readings of each poem and a study of Yeats’s personal history to even recognize the tower, much less understand all of its implications. That is the beauty and the challenge of such unique symbols.
