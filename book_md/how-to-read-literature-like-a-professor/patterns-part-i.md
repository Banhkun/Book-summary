## Patterns Part I: Know the Archetypes, Find Them Everywhere

We’ve already covered this notion, but it is worth saying again: **All literature exists as part of one big story. Nothing is really new.** Although every piece of literature is different, it still interacts with every written work that came before it. In fact, even if an author attempts to avoid referencing any other novels, that avoidance is an interaction in itself.

  * Example: Imagine you are directing a western movie. If your hero is the silent type, he will remind the audience of John Wayne. If he’s a big talker, he’s more of a James Garner-type. If you have one of each, your movie will be reminiscent of _Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid._



One of the main benefits of the one big story is the emergence of archetypes. **“Archetype” really just means “pattern,” or the original on which that pattern was based.** No one knows the original use of archetypes, just like no one knows exactly where ancient myths began. They predate written history.

It doesn’t really matter where they come from, when they began, or how often they’re used. **Archetypes grow in strength with each use in literature.** They create an _aha!_ moment for the reader—a satisfying moment when we recognize a pattern between what we’re reading now and what we’ve read before.

Archetypes and common patterns are always with us, because they’ve been a part of our collective consciousness for so long. They help writers and readers understand each other because we share knowledge of these archetypes and their role in the one big story.

### Trips and Quests

**Anytime a character begins a trip, you should be on the lookout for a quest narrative.** This is one type of archetype.

Example: In _The Crying of Lot 49_ by Thomas Pynchon, a young woman named Oedipa travels from San Francisco to Southern California to execute the will of her former lover. Along the way, Oedipa meets a lot of strange and scary characters and ends up in a lot of dangerous situations. By the end, Oedipa has learned to rely on herself and trust her own self-knowledge.

In this novel, Thomas Pynchon presents an example of a classic quest narrative.

Structurally, every quest consists of

  * A quester: In this case, Oedipa, a young woman with many problems in her life 
  * A place to go: San Francisco
  * A stated reason to go there: To execute a will
  * Challenges along the way: Oedipa goes through a nightlong exploration, a dangerous visit to her therapist’s office, and a mysterious postal conspiracy
  * The real mission: **The real reason behind any quest is the search for self-knowledge**



The stated reason to go on a quest is often in search of a “holy grail.” This can be as simple as going to the store to get a loaf of bread. Throughout the quest, the stated goal falls away and the real mission is revealed: **the character learns about himself**.

Questers are often young, inexperienced characters. This is because older characters would either already have self-knowledge or be too late to ever get it. In comparison, young characters have a lot of learning and development left to do.

(Shortform note: For more on the quest archetype and the hero’s journey, read our summary of Joseph Campbell’s _The Hero with a Thousand Faces_.)

### Shared Meals and Communions

**Whenever literary characters share a meal together, it is an act of communion**. The act of communion is another archetype.

Consider writing a meal scene. It is very difficult, because eating is boring and food has been described a million ways before. So, if an author includes a meal scene in a literary work, there is almost always a compelling reason for doing so—to symbolize a communion between characters.

Although the word “communion” has religious connotations, it is important to realize that not all communion is a religious or holy experience. Rather, breaking bread together is a symbolic way of expressing, “I am here with you because I like you and want to create a community.” That is the kind of communion we are talking about.

  * Example: Think of scenes where soldiers share rations together as comrades or a little boy shares scraps of food with a stray dog. The reader gets a sense of loyalty and companionship. 



In contrast, some meal scenes relay the opposite message. **In these cases, the failed meal is a symbol of bad relationships or negative feelings**.

  * Example: Imagine a mafia don who brings his enemies together for a meal, only to have them killed. The assumption that one should be kind to his dinner guests is violated here, and the mafia don is presented as an evil character. 



#### Example: James Joyce’s “The Dead”

The story “The Dead” __ by James Joyce is a great example of the full effect of a meal scene as communion. The story centers around a dinner party. At this party is a man named Gabriel Conroy, who thinks he is superior to all the other guests at the table. Over the course of the meal, there are many moments of tension that shock Gabriel’s ego and show him that he is just one of the group. As Gabriel puts his ego in check, he is able to share a meal with his fellow guests and make a speech of gratitude at the end. The reader is part of Gabriel’s evolution from self-made outsider to grateful sharer of the meal.

James Joyce’s illustration of the meal itself mirrors the plot of the story. He puts great detail into bringing the meal to life for the reader. In this way, he asks the reader to pull up a chair and join the party closely. Joyce describes the food on the table as though describing armies in rank for battle. This conveys a sense of conflict to mimic the tensions in the conversation at the table.

### Secondary and Minor Characters

Minor characters may also be archetypical. A story’s plot is intimately connected with its characters.

There is a cyclical way of looking at it: **The plot is driven by the nature of the character, and the nature of the character is revealed in their actions throughout the plot.**

But it is important to remember that not all characters are equal in the eyes of the author. Characters fall somewhere on a spectrum from round to flat.

  * **Round characters are three-dimensional**. They’re given backstories, strengths, weaknesses, likes, dislikes, and contradictions. They grow and change throughout a story. 
  * **Flat characters lack development**. They are only used as a means of getting the protagonist to his ending. 



Why don’t authors make all their characters round?

  1. Labor: It would take too long to write that much detail into every character.
  2. Length: Books would be considerably longer.
  3. Purpose: Flat characters are easier for the reader to define. For example, if the villain in a story is given good characteristics, as well as evil ones, the reader might have a hard time discerning the character’s purpose in the narrative. 
  4. Focus: If every character were fully developed, the reader would have a hard time understanding who the true protagonist of the story was meant to be. 



So secondary and minor characters in literature are usually flat, and their purpose is simply to help the hero reach his destiny. We often forget about these characters when they’re not on the page.

**Unfortunately for many secondary characters, especially sidekicks and best friends, their role in the story is usually fatal**._But why?_

In order to keep the reader’s attention, things have to happen in a story. Characters have to change, grow, and develop. If the plot needs something dramatic to happen, a character must often be sacrificed. But the author can’t kill off the protagonist if the story is going to continue, so he kills the best friend instead.

Examples:

  * In _Romeo and Juliet_ , Shakespeare needs the conflict between the Capulets and the Montagues to reach the point of no return. But he can’t very well kill off Romeo (yet). Instead, he kills Mercutio. 
  * In the film _Top Gun_ , Maverick’s mix of risk-taking and confidence leads to the death of his best friend Goose. This teaches him the fragility of life.



**The death of the friend in literature is used to create the need for rage and/or revenge**. It’s also a dramatic way for the protagonist to learn the life lessons he needs.

It might not seem fair, but when you read like a professor, you’ll learn not to view characters as people and not to put too much focus on your emotional responses to them. Rather, **intelligent readers analyze the character’s purpose within the narrative**.

### Politics and Social Criticism

Writers tend to be people who are observant of the world around them and interested in commenting on society. That is why **almost all literature has a political element on some level—a consideration of the class relations, power structures, sex and race relations, or ethical dilemmas of its time**. This is a pattern you should be looking for every time you pick up a piece of literature.

If you neglect to familiarize yourself with the world as it was at the time and place the author was creating the work you’re reading, you put yourself at risk of missing the political and social commentary that is most likely behind the text.

**Political writing is meant to change the reader in an effort to eventually change society as a whole**. The story might question one way of thinking, while presenting another, nobler, viewpoint.

Not all literature will be overtly political. In fact, overtly political writing tends to be reductionist and lacks staying power.

Writers such as Edgar Allen Poe and Washington Irving were some of the first to create a specifically American political consciousness through literature, though they did so in two different ways:

  * Edgar Allen Poe used stories such as _The Fall of the House of Usher_ to criticize the European system of classes. He characterizes European-style language and behavior as corrupt and decaying, and suggests that the inevitable result is madness. 
  * Washington Irving’s _Rip Van Winkle_ falls asleep for 20 years and wakes up after the American Revolution. Although the society he sees is slightly disheveled and exhausted, they are free. They are in the process of defining their own way of life. 



Both of these stories exemplify political writing that is definitively American because they question the features of previous rule and celebrate American freedom.

Especially in American literature, **the role of an individual character is almost always politically charged, because matters of free will are inherently relatable to society**.

### Baptism

When a character drowns or nearly drowns, it’s more than just a solution to a plot difficulty. The difference between death and rescue in a drowning scene means a lot to the character, as well as the story. **When a character emerges from the water in which they almost drowned, that’s a baptism**.

Just like communion, it’s important not to think of baptism in terms of the religious practice. Instead,**think of baptism as any death and rebirth that happens in water**. The rebirth is both literal (the character survived a deadly situation) and symbolic (the character is given a new life).

Another important characteristic of baptism is that the character has to receive it. **The character has to change or reform as a result of their new chance at life**.

The means of rescue from the water is significant to the meaning of the symbol, as well. Did the character swim out herself? Did she grab onto something floating in the water? That could be the difference between a character with a strong will to change, or a character with good luck. Either should impact the reader’s understanding of a story.

#### Example: _Ordinary People_

In Judith Guest’s _Ordinary People,_ two brothers sail out onto Lake Michigan. When they get caught in a storm, the older brother drowns while the younger, Conrad, survives.

After this event, Conrad has to come to terms with his survival. He has to develop a new identity for himself since he is no longer just the younger, insecure brother of a great athlete. That version of Conrad dies with his brother, and it’s a new Conrad that comes back to land. Throughout the novel, Conrad faces his new reality and finds his new place in the world.

This is a clear example of a symbolic baptism: Conrad is reborn when he survives the storm.
