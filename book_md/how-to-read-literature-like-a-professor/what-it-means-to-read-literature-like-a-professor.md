## What It Means to Read Literature Like a Professor

A literature professor is always looking for meaning and significance beyond the text of a novel, poem, or play. Here’s an example:

In the play _A Raisin in the Sun_ by Lorraine Hansberry, the protagonist, Walter Lee Younger, moves his African American family into an all-white community. A white man named Mr. Linder comes to Walter with an offer: He wants to buy the Younger family out of their claim on the house. Although the offer is insulting, Walter Lee is forced to consider it. This is one of the play’s primary dramas.

Imagine you’ve just read the play. Would you be surprised to hear your literature professor say that Mr. Lindner is the devil? Would you have come to that conclusion on your own?

If not, that’s okay. That means that **you, the student, and your professor have read the same story, but not in the same way**. Your professor has had practice analyzing literature and finding its conventions and codes. She has the skills to remember instances of bargaining with the devil in other stories, and connect that pattern to Mr. Lindner through common plot devices and themes.

So what is the difference between reading like a student and reading like a professor?

Students:

  * Focus mostly on the plot and characters in a story.
  * Respond to the story first on an emotional level.



Professors:

  * Focus mostly on **memory, symbol, and pattern** in the story.
  * Accept the emotional response, but look deeper to find the universal truth displayed. 



### Memory, Symbol, and Pattern

**Memory:** When you read with a powerful **memory, you actively look for how the text corresponds to other literary works**. You mentally flip through the things you’ve read before and look for similarities (or differences) to the structure, theme, or characters of what you’re reading now.

  * Example: Watching _Pale Rider_ starring Clint Eastwood might make you think of the movie _Shane_ from 1953.



**Symbol:** When you read with a symbolic mind, you constantly look for **metaphors and analogies. You not only see things for what they actually are, but also what they might represent**.

  * Example: The monster in _Beowulf****_ is not only an actual monster, but also a representation of the dark side of human nature which can only be overcome by achieving a higher version of ourselves. 



**Pattern:** When you read to observe patterns, you **recognize the similarities between life and books**. You look beyond the plot to see how the drama and characters illustrate a truth of human experience.

  * Non-literary example: A good car mechanic can use pattern recognition to diagnose a car. They can see that if these things are happening, it is probably caused by this. Then they know to check that. 



**The combination of using memory, identifying symbols, and recognizing patterns allows the reader to analyze literature in a new light**. If you ignore memory, symbols, and patterns in literature, you will not be able to appreciate a book for everything that it says between the lines.

#### Non-literary Example of Memory, Symbol, and Pattern:

Imagine you meet a man who is very hostile towards his father, but gentle and loving towards his mother. You might not think much of it. But then, you meet three more men who show the same behavior. You have **recognized a pattern**.

Now, you might start to think of where you have seen behavior of this pattern before. Your **memory calls to mind** the story of Oedipus, who killed his father and married his mother. The men you met didn’t actually do those things, but your **symbolic mind can draw the connection**.

This is how Sigmund Freud came up with the term Oedipus complex. He “read” his clinical patients and interpreted their behavior patterns. Then, his memory and symbolic imagination corresponded their behavior to a drama he had read before. His psychoanalytical revelation mirrors the way that you will learn to read literature in this book.

By the end of this book, you will have

  * Learned the conventions of literature: Character types, plot structures, themes, symbols, archetypes, and more.
  * Gained the skills to find and analyze them on your own. 



_Author Note: In this book there is a lot of use of the words “always,” “all,” “never,” and “none.” Just remember that there are exceptions to every rule._

(Shortform note: For the sake of clarity, we’ve reorganized the chapters in this book to follow the themes of memory, symbol, and pattern introduced here.)
