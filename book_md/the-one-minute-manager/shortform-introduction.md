## Shortform Introduction

The book is written in the form of a narrative fable. In this story, a young man visits the new one minute manager and learns from him the three secrets of successful one-minute management. We later learn that he applies these principles in his own life and career to great effect, becoming a one-minute manager himself. In this summary, we leave out this narrative framing device to focus solely on the principles, since the plot doesn’t add much beyond conversation around the principles.

Also, this is primarily a summary of _The New One-Minute Manager_ , the updated and revised version of the original book. This core principles are the same as in the original book, but _The New One-Minute Manager_ applies these ideas to make them more relevant for today’s rapidly evolving business world. To provide the richest reader experience, we’ve incorporated ideas from both versions of the text.
