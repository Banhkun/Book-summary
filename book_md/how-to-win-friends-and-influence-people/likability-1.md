## Likability 1: Show a genuine interest in the other person.

With the 3 major principles in place, _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ then describes how to get people to like you.

In summary, make people feel important by being happy to see them, encouraging them to discuss their interests and passions at length, calling them by their name, and giving genuine praise for things they pride themselves on.

* * *

### Principles

  * Who is universally loved as friendly and approachable? A dog. They’re _always_ excited to see you and seem like you’re the most important thing in their world.
  * **Showing interest in other people makes them feel important** (Fundamental 2).
    * All of us like people who admire us. If we think highly of ourselves, then we appreciate people who have good taste and judgment.
  * **People aren’t interested in you or me. They’re interested in themselves, every day, for their entire life**.
    * When you see a group photo, whose face do you look for first?
  * It must be sincere.
  * You make friends much more easily by being interested in them, than by trying to get them interested in you.



### Tactics

  * Ask people about their background and their goals. 
  * **Remember problems people are having.** When you come across a solution, share it with the person.
  * Go out of your way to talk to people who are “beneath your level” - employees who don’t report to you, servicepeople. 
  * For people “above your level,” express a genuine interest in them, their work, their advice. **They feel important when they can pass on secrets of their success**.
  * When traveling, attempt to speak their language. Try to understand their world instead of being a tourist.
  * Remember birthdays and act on them.
  * Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. On the phone if you know who’s calling, greet them warmly, not with a cold “hello?”



### Examples

  * An editor said that he could tell after a few paragraphs if the author liked people. If the author doesn’t like people, people won’t like her stories.
  * A famous magician didn’t see his audience as suckers. He was grateful they came to see him and endeavored to give them the very best he could. Before each show he repeated to himself, “I love my audience. I love my audience”
  * It’s a common strategy for employers to ask front desk staff what they thought of applicants. Rude people are rejected.
  * A banker interviewing a company president learned that the president’s grandson was collecting stamps. He dug up stamps his bank owned and offered them to the president, who was now much friendlier.
  * A fuel vendor had tried to sell to a large chain store without success. Carnegie arranged a debate where they had to argue whether the chain store was better or worse for the country, and the vendor took the positive side. He approached the large chain manager asking for his help. The manager talked for two hours, proud of his company’s contributions to the world and even changed the vendor’s attitude. At the end, the chain store placed an order with the vendor.
