## Feedback 7: Make the Improvement Look Easy

### Principles

  * If you tell someone they lack the talent and will never be good at something, you have removed interest and hope for improvement.
  * Instead, **tell them they have the right talent and fundamentals, but just need to practice to get better**. Make the steps easy to do.



### Tactics

  * Connect it to something they’ve mastered in the past. “There’s nothing to it other than **_. You’ve done_** before. X will be a cinch for you.”
  * Take one piece of the task that the person is doing well, and praise that. Then show how if the person can do that, then she can do the entire task.



### Examples

  * Dance instructor to a poor dancer: “you have a natural sense of rhythm. You are a natural-born dancer.”
  * Dale Carnegie was apprehensive about learning the card game of bridge, which he knew nothing about. His teacher said, “there’s nothing to bridge except memory and judgment. You’ve published tomes on memory. Bridge is right up your alley.”
