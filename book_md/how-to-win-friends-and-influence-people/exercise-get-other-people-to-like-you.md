## Exercise: Get Other People to Like You

Become a more likable person by changing how you approach people.

* * *

Are you the type to want to dominate the conversation, or to ask other people to talk? If you’re the former, what could you say in your next conversation to show you’re interested in them? What could you ask to hear their point of view?

Are you the type to remember people’s names, or to forget them instantly? Do you believe remembering people’s names is important to reaching your goals? What could you do to remember names better?

Think of a recent time when you made someone feel small and unimportant. What happened? How would you reapproach this situation to make them feel important?
