## Fundamental 2: Appreciate People Sincerely

### Principles

  * People crave importance almost as much as they do food and air. 
    * This spurs people to boast about their children, attract attention through their appearances, signal wealth by buying cars and houses, donate money to help others, have mountains and stars named after them. 
    * Unhealthily, it spurs criminals to achieve notoriety, getting a place in the news alongside sports stars and presidents. It pushes people to become invalids, attracting help and pity when they don’t need it.
    * It’d be a crime to deprive people of six days of food. Yet we withhold praise for six months at a time.
  * Think that every person you meet is superior to you in some way. Try to find what that is and learn it from him or her.
  * Appreciation arouses enthusiasm. Criticism kills ambitions.
    * Schwab: “I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism.”



### Tactics

  * **When someone makes a mistake, praise them for the silver lining**.
    * When Rockefeller’s partner lost a large sum overseas, the boss didn’t chastise, but rather praised him for saving 60% of the money invested, better than what they sometimes retained from errors.
  * Leave little signs of appreciation throughout your daily life.
    * Let a tired serviceperson know she had an exemplary attitude.
    * Every public speaker knows the crushing feeling of not receiving any praise for their sermon.
  * Do not stray into flattery, which is insincere. You should only praise what you genuinely appreciate.
    * Commonly, flattery is praising others for things only you value yourself.
  * **“Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”** -Schwab
  * Praise people publicly to make them feel important.



### Examples

  * Stevie Wonder, blind from childhood, had never been appreciated for blindness. One day his teacher asked him to help her find a lost mouse in the classroom, as he alone had the hearing to do it. He said this set off a new life.
