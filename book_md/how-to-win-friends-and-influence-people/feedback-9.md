## Feedback 9: Praise Every Improvement

### Principles

  * Praising every improvement inspires the other person to keep on improving.
  * When training a puppy, you praise every improvement with a small reward, and this locks in the good behavior. Why don’t we do the same with other people?
  * Look back on your life and remember moments where just a few words of praise sharply turned your entire future. You can have this impact on others.



### Tactics

  * Give _specific_ praise. Single out a specific accomplishment, instead of general flattering remarks. This makes your praise sound more sincere, and also forces you to find genuine points of appreciation.
  * Some relationships, especially between parents and children and between employer and employee, have evolved into a vicious cycle of yelling. The parent gives no praise, the child resists, the parent yells at the child, the child resists further, the parent yells more loudly to get any result. You must break out of this vicious cycle to build a virtuous cycle.



### Examples

  * As a young boy, Charles Dickens aspired to be a writer. He lived in poverty and labored as a child, and he kept sending out manuscripts that were routinely rejected. One day, an editor accepted his work and praised him. This praise changed his life, since this encouragement proved that he could be a writer.
  * An owner of a printing business had a new employee who had difficulty getting up to speed. The immediate supervisor thought the employee had a bad attitude, but the owner visited and talked with the new employee. The owner pointed out that the new employee’s work was some of the best work he’d seen produced for some time, and he pointed out exactly why it was superior. Of course, the young printer’s attitude improved dramatically, and he became a loyal worker.
  * A father had a son who had suffered a brain injury and was a slow learner. The son didn’t know his multiplication tables by 7th grade and was downtrodden. The father created flashcards of arithmetic operations, and worked with his son to answer them correctly. Then he started timing his son, saying that when they could finish in 8 minutes, they’d stop. They started at 52 minutes, then the next night reached 48, then the next 45. They celebrated each little improvement. By the end of the month, he was down to 8 minutes.
