## Likability 6: Make the Other Person Feel Important

This is really a repetition and recap of the other principles.

### Principles

  * Almost all people you meet feel superior to you in some way. Let them realize in some subtle way that you realize their importance.
  * Inversely, **avoid doing things that demean the other person and make them feel small or unimportant**.
  * For people who think highly of themselves, showing that you think they’re important suggests good taste and sense on your side.



### Tactics

  * Give a genuine compliment when the cost is low. “I wish I had your head of hair.”
  * Give praise without wanting anything from them, merely to radiate happiness and lift them up. It helps both people for a long time.
  * Phrases: “I’m sorry to trouble you.” “Would you mind-” “I know you’re busy-” “Thank you.”
  * Pay special attention to people who are often treated as unimportant - the elderly, poor, servicepeople, front desk staff.
  * Everyone has gone through tough periods. Ask about a person’s unique struggles and appreciate them.
  * Give public approval of someone’s work.



### Example

  * A salesperson visiting Eastman (of Kodak) was told he had strictly 5 minutes of time. The salesman walked in and admired his office, and Eastman talked about the woods selected. They then passed through the window, Eastman pointing out the way he was using his fortune to help humanity. The salesman asked about his early struggles, and Eastman talked about the poverty of his childhood. They talked for far longer than the appointment was scheduled for, and he got the sale.
    * (Shortform note: Even people of high stature need genuine appreciation, since they so frequently get barraged with people who want things from them.)
