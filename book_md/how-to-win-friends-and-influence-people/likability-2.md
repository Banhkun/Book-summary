## Likability 2: Smile

### Principles

  * A smile says, “I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you.” It’s a message of good will. This is why dogs and smiling babies are so beloved. A smile makes people feel important and appreciated.
  * You must have fun meeting other people if you expect them to have fun meeting you.



### Tactics

  * **Talk on the phone with a smile** \- your intonation changes completely.
  * Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. On the phone, if you know who’s calling, greet them warmly, not with a cold “hello?”
  * Smile especially at people who are not used to being smiled at and just see frowns all day, like servicepeople.
  * If you don’t feel like smiling, force yourself to smile. Hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were happy, and that will tend to make you happy.
    * Picture the type of person you want to be. This will make you seize the opportunities to fulfill that desire.
