## Exercise: Reflect on the Path of Scientific Progress

Kaku relates the history of physics by explaining the natural world while at the same time trying to bring scientific theories under one unifying banner. While working toward a unified and preferably _simple_ theory of everything, scientists have produced theories that are increasingly complex and difficult for the layman to grasp. Think back on the theories presented in this guide and how well you grasp their underlying concepts.

The implications of Einstein’s relativity—that time and space can stretch and bend—have been verified by experiments for over 100 years. When such seemingly implausible theories are confirmed by experiments, does it make it easier for you to accept it as fact, even if you don’t understand the math behind it? Why or why not?

At the subatomic level of quantum mechanics, particles obey completely different rules than those we experience in our day-to-day lives. Scientists conclude from this that our understanding of physics must be flawed because two different sets of physical laws can’t both be true at the same time. What do you think about this apparent contradiction?

String theory offers a mathematical resolution for the many incongruities between the laws governing the fundamental forces. Does its lack of experimental evidence make you doubt it, or do you believe that an elegant mathematical solution is persuasive on its own? Why do you feel one way or the other?
