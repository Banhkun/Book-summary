## 1-Page Summary

In a society troubled by overconsumption and disconnection, what are plants, Anishinaabe Indigenous worldviews, and science all trying to teach us about restoring balance?

In _Braiding Sweetgrass,_ Robin Wall Kimmerer contends that these three sources of knowledge show us how to flourish by practicing mutual care:**acting in ways that help us as well as other people and the environment.**

As our industrial society puts increasing stress on ecosystems and climate change threatens the well-being of us all, we must shift from a mindset of consumption and competition to one recognizing our interdependence.**Then we can practice mutual care to enable all living beings to thrive.**

Kimmerer is a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation and a professor at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF) in Syracuse. She received a MacArthur Fellowship in 2022 for her work in education, writing, and outreach in Indigenous communities. As the founder and director of the Center for Native Peoples in the Environment at SUNY-ESF, Kimmerer teaches environmental studies to Indigenous students and helps science benefit from Indigenous knowledge.

Published in 2013, _Braiding Sweetgrass_ is a collection of essays that integrate Kimmerer’s personal experiences, Anishinaabe Indigenous worldviews, and scientific knowledge. These three components represent the strands of a braid of sweetgrass, a sacred plant in the Indigenous Potawatomi culture. Like the strands of sweetgrass, the three knowledge sources are woven together to create something sacred: a deeper understanding of how we can practice mutual care. (Shortform note: The Potawatomi are a subgroup of the Anishinaabe people, currently in the Northeast United States.)

_Braiding Sweetgrass_ became a _New York Times_ bestseller in February 2020, seven years after its initial publication, and it stayed on the bestseller list for 129 weeks. One explanation for this is that the book resonated with readers during the Covid-19 pandemic when many people were feeling isolated and anxious about the world.

In this guide, we’ll first focus on what plants, Indigenous traditions, and scientific knowledge can teach you about practicing mutual care. Then, we’ll identify specific ways that mutual care can benefit you. Lastly, we’ll describe strategies to help you practice mutual care in your own life. The guide updates historical events described in the book and explains how phenomena in the plant world apply to humans.

### How Plants Teach Us About Mutual Care

Observing plants provides insight into how mutual care helps individuals and communities flourish. Plants engage cooperatively in symbiotic relationships, collective solidarity, natural succession, and generosity, which**can inspire us to practice mutual care** with other humans as well as non-human beings.

(Shortform note: In _Finding the Mother Tree_ , Suzanne Simard also describes several examples of plants functioning in symbiotic and cooperative relationships. Although she doesn’t propose this as a model for human behavior, she uses the examples to advocate for mutual care in a forest ecology context. She warns against clear-cutting logging practices that disrupt the intricate symbiotic relationships within the forest and recommends a research model that looks at the long-term impact of human activity on forest ecosystems.)

#### Symbiotic Relationships

Plants often have _symbiotic_ relationships in which **different species work together in a way that benefits both of them**.

Kimmerer illustrates this principle with the example of a lichen. A lichen is an organism composed of fungi and algae. The fungi decompose organic matter to nourish the lichen with water and minerals. They also hold in moisture and protect the lichen from the sun. The algae provide food for the lichen by photosynthesizing sunlight into sugar.

Because of their differences in feeding strategies, the decomposers (fungi) and producers (algae) can cooperate to meet their basic needs. Similarly, humans can interact with other organisms in a mutually positive way.

(Shortform note: How does the concept of symbiosis apply to humans? In _Range_ , David Epstein describes how creating diverse teams in organizations makes them more likely to come up with novel ideas because of members’ different backgrounds and experiences. Just as different natural organisms encourage each other’s growth through symbiosis, the interactions between different kinds of people help both the individuals and the group succeed.)

> **The New Lichen Definition Reinforces Mutual Care**
> 
> Since _Braiding Sweetgrass_ was published, research has established a new scientific definition of lichens that reinforces Kimmerer’s justification for why mutual care is important.
> 
> Lichens were previously understood as the combination of single species of fungus and alga, but research now shows that they can include multiple species of fungi, algae, bacteria, yeast, and viruses that each support each other’s survival. In other words, lichens are not simply two complementary species, but rather tiny ecosystems made up of diverse and interdependent microorganisms. This demonstrates that whether we recognize the relationships among organisms or not, living beings are linked to one another in complex ways, making mutual care essential.

#### Collective Solidarity

In addition to the symbiosis _between_ different species, collective solidarity _within_ a species is another way that plants demonstrate mutual care. **When plants exhibit collective solidarity, they act in a unified way that helps the whole group survive.**

The author describes how pecan trees demonstrate collective solidarity when they participate in “mast (or synchronous) fruiting”: All of the pecan trees in a region produce a heavy crop of nuts in the same year to overwhelm seed predators (such as squirrels) and increase the trees’ chance of reproducing via seed. In this process:

  1. A massive quantity of pecans in one season causes a spike in the squirrel population.
  2. The large squirrel population drives an increase in the number of predators that feed on squirrels.
  3. The pecan trees all stop producing nuts at the same time that the predator population is high, causing the squirrel population to plummet. 
  4. The pecan trees mast fruit again when the squirrel population is at a low point, increasing the chance of their seeds taking root.



The strategy of mast fruiting works because all of the pecan trees in a region participate regardless of their microclimate or individual resources.

> **Collective Solidarity Requires a Common Goal**
> 
> The example of mast fruiting is based on the assumption that the common goal of the pecan trees is to successfully reproduce. This incentivizes their mutual care from an evolutionary standpoint. When translating the idea of collective solidarity to the human world then, a common goal is essential for practicing mutual care.
> 
> This condition is more feasible on a smaller scale, such as within families or organizations, than on a national or international scale. In _First Things First,_ Stephen R. Covey clarifies the key components of an empowering shared vision: It should come from within the group, address _everyone’s_ needs, focus on something the group feels passionate about, be based on ethical principles, and enable the group to live, love, learn, and leave a legacy.

Kimmerer relates this principle to the human world with an example of failed collective solidarity. The federal government offered the Anishinaabe people (who had been displaced multiple times) citizenship and legal protection for their land if they agreed to relocate again and convert their communally owned territory into small plots, privately owned by individual families.

The Anishinaabe eventually agreed, and the process of fracturing their common land ultimately made each family more economically vulnerable. Many lost their land due to the tax burden or predatory purchasing tactics. Over two-thirds of their total Indigenous land was eventually lost. Kimmerer suggests that if her people had been able to retain their community structure, they would have been more resilient long term.

(Shortform note: The ongoing Landback movement to reclaim Indigenous land incorporates the strategy of collective solidarity by strengthening connections among organizations to work toward their common goal. To date, there have been some successful cases of reclaiming Anishinaabe territory (not limited to the individual plots described in this example) that was stolen during colonization. These include a cemetery near Lake Superior and forested land returned to the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota.)

#### Natural Succession

Another way plants provide a model for mutual care is through the process of natural succession. Kimmerer explains that **in natural succession, plants and animals act sequentially to restore an ecosystem after a disturbance** , such as clear-cutting a forest, pollution from toxic chemicals, or a natural disaster.**** Each species creates the conditions for a new species to thrive, and the overall health of the ecosystem is restored over time.

For example, in a landslide, organic matter and vegetation disappear suddenly, making it difficult for plants or animals to survive. However, life is restored through the following stages of natural succession:

First, hardy pioneer species like moss come up from residual seeds or roots, or from seeds blown in by the wind. These plants can survive in exposed areas and protect the soil from erosion. Then, the ground cover from the early pioneer species enables weedy plants and grasses to take root, creating more diversity and organic mass. Next, larger plants grow up and optimize sunlight and nutrients with their spacing. When shrubs and trees appear, they provide birds and other animals with habitat and food, bringing more seeds (through droppings), more biodiversity, and a stable ecosystem.

> **What Does Natural Succession Look Like for Humans?**
> 
> An analogous version of natural succession occurs in human communities when different resources are mobilized at different times to lay the groundwork for long-term recovery after a natural disaster. The FEMA Disaster Recovery Framework talks about the short-term, medium-term, and long-term stages of recovery for a community.
> 
> In the short term, the “pioneer species” would be the emergency services provided to meet urgent needs, like transportation to a safe location and paramedics. In the medium term, the smaller shrubs and plants would be the economic investment and aid needed to get water and electricity running and re-build houses. In the long term, the larger shrubs and trees would be providing ongoing mental health support to the communities and mitigating structural inequalities that made certain disaster victims more vulnerable to begin with.

#### Generosity and Cyclical Gifting

The last characteristic of plants that teaches mutual care is generosity and cyclical gifting. Kimmerer describes how **plants act generously by providing many resources that meet the basic needs of other plants, animals, and people.** In ecological systems, those gifts are continually replenished and recycled because they are interdependent with other species.

An example of a “generous” plant is the coconut tree. It provides leaves to build roofs and weave baskets, habitat for birds and bats, fiber from the coconut shell (useful in horticulture and for heating fuel), hydrating coconut water, coconut oil, shade, and food for humans and animals. These gifts cycle back to the plant when it is fertilized by the manure of animals that interact with it, when the leftover materials decompose and provide nutrients to the tree, or when humans spread the seeds to help it reproduce (the coconut itself is the seed).

In human communities, gift-giving encourages mutual care because when someone cooks a meal for us or gives a thoughtful gift, it makes us want to give back to the other person.

(Shortform note: In _Influence_ , Robert C. Cialdini distinguishes between gifts that are given as a genuine favor versus gifts that are used to manipulate someone. He describes cyclical gifting in the human community as the Reciprocity Principle, which explains how gifts are used to manipulate people into making concessions or buying a product. For example, if you give someone a free sample of a product, they feel socially obligated to listen to your sales pitch or buy something. In contrast to the simpler gifts of the plant world, human gifts given out of obligation contradict Kimmerer’s concept of mutual care because one party may feel resentful about the transaction.)

### How Traditional Indigenous Culture Teaches Mutual Care

Indigenous culture is the second source of inspiration and knowledge for how to practice mutual care with other beings. Kimmerer draws on three main areas of Indigenous culture that embody this concept: stories and language, honorable harvesting, and ceremony.

#### Stories and Language

Cultural lore and language conventions in Indigenous culture embody mutual care by honoring the life of non-human beings and acknowledging our interdependence, particularly through the Windigo mythology and animate verbs and nouns

##### The Windigo Mythology

Kimmerer tells the story of the Windigo, a mythical monster in Ojibwe culture who was turned from a man into a monster when his greed drove him to cannibalism. He was ostracized by the community and suffers eternally from insatiable hunger, growing more ravenous every time he eats.

**The Windigo story warns against unconstrained consumption** and demonstrates how this behavior is dangerous in a society based on shared resources. It cautions you to never let your greed get the best of you, even in times of scarcity.

(Shortform note: In addition to Indigenous communities, cultures worldwide use mythology and lore to discourage greedy behavior. For example, in Greek mythology, King Midas was granted his wish to be able to turn anything he touched into gold. Although he was thrilled at first by his new power, he soon regretted the unforeseen consequences. Since everything he touched turned to gold instantly, he was unable to eat or drink anything or lie down on a soft surface.)

##### Animate Verbs and Nouns

In addition to its instructive stories, the Potawatomi language teaches mutual care by using animate verbs and nouns for entities that are not made by a human. According to Kimmerer, this **assigns agency and respect to things like plants, animals, and bodies of water** , which are referred to as an inanimate “it” in English.

For example, having animate verbs means that the word “listen” is different in the context of listening to a bird call or a river, as opposed to listening to a truck engine. The bird call and the river are animate (alive or spirited), while the truck engine is not. Kimmerer explains how this grammar convention suggests that humans are not superior to plants, animals, and other natural entities, and thinking of others as kin in this way encourages mutual care.

There were only a handful of native speakers of Potawatomi alive when _Braiding Sweetgrass_ was published, and Kimmerer explains that the decline of Potawatomi is significant specifically because of the way its grammar embodies the concept of mutual care. The loss of a language can lead to the loss of its cultural values, but Kimmerer also uses this as motivation to continue learning Potawatomi.

> **Preserving Languages That Prioritize Mutual Care**
> 
> Many languages describe non-human beings as animate, but the number of languages spoken worldwide is rapidly decreasing. More than 200 Indigenous languages of North America have gone extinct, and this pattern extends to other continents as well. According to the Language Conservancy, 90% of the world’s languages are likely to go extinct over the next century.
> 
> Because of the distinct ways that languages like Potawatomi express mutual care, it is crucial that we preserve these endangered languages. Programs are already underway to revitalize Potawatomi using modern technology to make it more accessible. Many learning resources are available online, and a Covid-19 relief bill allocated millions of dollars to Native American language preservation.

#### Honorable Harvesting

In addition to stories and language, the Indigenous concept of honorable harvesting teaches us about mutual care by encouraging us to take care of natural resources. Kimmerer’s description of the Honorable Harvest includes guidelines for being considerate when harvesting wild fruits, medicinal plants, mushrooms, or other materials like bark and minerals.

(Shortform note: We synthesized the key ideas of the Honorable Harvest to make it straightforward to readers, but as Kimmerer notes, it is not a strict doctrine or understood as a set of _rules_ in Indigenous communities. It is more of an intuitive understanding of how to be respectful and a set of habits learned from being immersed in a culture of mutual care.)

**1\. Take only what you need, never take the first or last, and never take more than half** of whatever you’re harvesting. This ensures there’s enough for others.

**2\. “Ask” first.** This could be a visual or logical assessment of whether the population is healthy enough to withstand some harvesting. It could also be a more spiritual or intuitive understanding of whether the plant or animal should be taken.

**3\. Give a gift in return.** You could offer a gift to the plant you harvested by sowing its seeds or by putting compost under a tree that you harvested fruit from.

**4\. Use it well.** Use the material well by making a useful tool or enjoying a meal, as opposed to letting it go to waste or storing it for no particular reason.

As an example, if you are looking for the medicinal plant comfrey to make a salve, you would never take the first one you spot, in case it’s the only plant in that region. After you leave the first one and find more of the plant nearby, the next step is to ask first: Is this species endangered by humans, habitat loss, or disease? Does the population seem healthy? In the case of comfrey, there’s likely an abundance of it, and it can even get _too_ vigorous and start to take over.

The next step would be to harvest less than half of it and just enough to make the salve. Give a gift in return by replanting a root fragment in a new location. The harvested comfrey then benefits you, and the remaining comfrey will continue to thrive and benefit other living beings.

> **Simplify the Honorable Harvest**
> 
> The steps of the Honorable Harvest can be simplified and applied to areas of your life outside of harvesting natural materials.
> 
> Guideline #3 tells you to give a gift back to nature, but this principle can be simplified even further to “be generous.” In _The Happiness Hypothesis_ , Jonathan Haidt describes this habit in human communities as the “reciprocity reflex.” Similar to Kimmerer, he suggests that this instinct to repay others is useful from an evolutionary perspective, since giving back to other people when they help you increases everyone’s chances of survival. Kimmerer takes this a step further by suggesting that people benefit from a reciprocity reflex (giving a gift in return) with nature as well as humans.
> 
> The other three guidelines of the Honorable Harvest**** all boil down to the idea of practicing moderation. Therefore, instead of remembering the individual steps of all the guidelines, **aim to be moderate in what you take from nature**. In addition to benefiting your relationship with nature, studies show that practicing moderation can improve your emotional stability, your effectiveness at work, and your nutritional health.

#### Ceremony

In addition to their language and harvesting practices, ceremony is another way Indigenous people hold their communities accountable for their values of gratitude and mutual care. Ceremonies accomplish this through **outward expressions of gratitude** (such as song and dance) and by **incorporating practical ways of caring for living beings**. This section looks at specific examples of these types of ceremonies.

##### The Thanksgiving Address

In the Onondaga Nation, the Thanksgiving Address is considered “The Words That Come Before All Else.” It is a lengthy declaration of gratitude for various elements of the natural world, such as water, medicinal plants, and the moon. By reciting the Thanksgiving Address regularly, the community reinforces gratitude as a top priority. **When gratitude is prioritized, people are mobilized to act generously and support other beings in return**.

(Shortform note: Kimmerer implies that ceremonies like the Thanksgiving Address have a direct impact on the gratitude people feel and the way they act toward other beings. Scientific research backs up this theory, including a study showing that the feeling of gratitude makes people more likely to help other people, including strangers.)

##### The Salmon Return Ceremony

Another ritual reinforcing mutual care is a traditional ceremony performed in the Pacific Northwest to celebrate the annual return of salmon as they swim upriver to reproduce. This ceremony has the symbolic importance of honoring the salmon, an important food source in this region, and it also has practical components that keep the ecosystem thriving.

The ceremony involves days of feasting, dancing, and lighting coastal land on fire to guide the fish home. The fire keeps the land healthy by fertilizing it and stimulating the growth of medicinal plants and pasture for animals. As part of the ritual, the salmon are allowed to pass upriver without being harvested for three days. This ensures that the salmon population remains high, providing food security for the human community as well.

(Shortform note: The salmon ceremony went through a period of decline as a result of colonization, but Indigenous communities in the Pacific Northwest have revitalized it in recent decades and expanded its scope. There is now a Salmon Homecoming Alliance, a nonprofit organization that invites local families to participate in the celebration and also incorporates environmental educational programs.)

### How Science Can Help Us Practice Mutual Care

Now that we’ve covered how plants and Indigenous wisdom can teach us to practice mutual care, we’ll look at how science also provides useful tools for mutual care. Species identification and research enables mutual care by**increasing your familiarity with the natural world and providing evidence for how to be better land stewards.**

#### Species Identification

Learning scientific taxonomy (the organization of species by groups and Latin names) is one way that science can contribute to a practice of mutual care. While Kimmerer notes that science is sometimes a reductive and mechanistic lens for viewing nature, it also **provides a framework for recognizing and growing a relationship with another species**.

For example, if you learn the Latin name for yarrow and its unique identifying characteristics, you might then notice it in the wild and harvest it for medicinal uses. You can make observations about what that plant needs to thrive and how you might cultivate it. Identification is a first step in establishing this mutually beneficial relationship.

(Shortform note: Kimmerer does not explicitly mention that for many people today, science is likely the most _accessible****_ framework for learning species identification. Many people no longer have community members to personally pass on knowledge about ecosystems based on intergenerational experience. However, with modern technology, you can take a class on botany online, or download a plant identification app on your phone. These are simple ways that science can facilitate the process of forming interspecies relationships that are key to Kimmerer’s concept of mutual care.)

#### Guidance From Research on Land Stewardship

Scientific research can also contribute to mutual care by providing information on how to restore ecological systems. One of Kimmerer’s examples of this is a study on sweetgrass showing that harvesting sweetgrass according to Indigenous practices helps it thrive, while leaving it alone diminishes it. Professors initially dismissed the research topic as useless, based on their assumption that harvesting plants is inherently harmful. However, the **research illuminated a way that we can practice mutual care by maintaining an important species**.

> **Nuances of Combining Indigenous Knowledge With Research Methods**
> 
> As shown in this example, research on land stewardship can also benefit from the deep ecological knowledge of Indigenous people. However, using scientific research methods and incorporating Indigenous knowledge can be challenging and nuanced.
> 
> For example, researchers did another study on sweetgrass harvesting, which was intended to be an ecological assessment that would enable Wabanaki Indigenous people in Maine to harvest sweetgrass from their ancestral lands at Acadia National Park. However, by selecting random plots of sweetgrass to study in the park, they inadvertently ignored the fact these were not the same sites that traditional gatherers would have selected when harvesting sweetgrass.
> 
> Since the goal of the study was to assess the impact of Wabanaki gatherers in particular, the results would not have been an accurate picture. The researchers had to create a parallel study, where they allowed Wabanaki gatherers to select the harvesting locations and use traditional harvesting methods.
> 
> Missteps like this demonstrate the need for better communication and overlap between Indigenous communities and researchers so that science and traditional ecological knowledge add to one another.

### Benefits of Practicing Mutual Care

The previous sections described how plants, Indigenous wisdom, and science traditionally practice mutual care, but why is mutual care so important? This section of the guide describes the ways that **mutual care supports the long-term vitality of life on Earth, feelings of abundance and wealth, and a sustainable economy**.

#### Long-Term Vitality

From the author’s perspective, mutual care is necessary for the long-term survival of humans and the environment because our well-being (human and non-human) is highly interdependent. In this sense, taking care of the environment is not about altruism, but rather sustaining the things that sustain us in return. For example, if we contribute to soil health by applying compost, reducing tillage, and growing cover crops, we ensure that the soil remains fertile to keep growing food for many generations.

(Shortform note: Kimmerer argues that mutual care ensures our long-term survival, individually and collectively. However, practicing mutual care as an individual, or even at the community level, does not guarantee that others will do the same. For example, at the global level, if one country implements mutual care by reducing carbon emissions that cause environmental harm, this change would likely not be significant enough to prevent the onset of more fires, droughts, and other extreme weather events. Therefore, this particular benefit of mutual care relies on its widespread adoption.)

#### Feelings of Abundance and Wealth

Another benefit of a culture of mutual care is experiencing feelings of abundance and wealth when you look at the physical world. Through the lens of mutual care, entities that were simply objects before, become gifts. You feel wealthy because there are insects that pollinate the plants that feed you, clouds that bring rain, and endless other gifts like this given to you every day. On the other hand, in a culture of individualism, your wealth consists of the commodities you own, and it is easy to feel that it is never enough compared to other people’s.

(Shortform note: This benefit of mutual care is difficult to prove with concrete evidence. Feelings of abundance and wealth are subjective, and even concepts like “happiness” are difficult to study due to people’s varying interpretations. However, one study confirms that comparing yourself to others based on finances has a negative impact on your emotional well-being.)

#### Sustainable Economy

Another benefit of mutual care is that it supports a sustainable economy. A “gift economy” based on mutual care is sustainable because its goal is to support life in general, rather than to accumulate wealth at the expense of others. In a gift economy, there are no commodities or property, and every person has a responsibility to take care of the earth’s gifts, including plants, animals, water, soil, and other people.

For example, all living organisms on Earth need water to survive, and in an economy based on mutual care, humans would not pollute or hoard water. Doing so would contradict mutual care by harming other beings and restricting access to a vital resource. In this scenario, clean water remains abundant to all organisms indefinitely.

In a capitalist economy, humans and whole ecosystems suffer from lack of clean water because humans own some of the water sources, profit from the commodification of water, and profit from industrial processes that make water toxic. This is unsustainable because the availability of clean water is diminished over time.

> **An Alternative Model for a Sustainable Global Economy**
> 
> Kimmerer’s discussion of a gift economy based on mutual care includes a general argument for sustainability, but it does not include much detail on what this economic system would look like on a global scale. _Doughnut Economics_ by Kate Raworth makes a similar argument that an economy based primarily on growth (and therefore intensive extraction of natural resources) is unsustainable. However, rather than creating a gift economy where there are no commodities at all, Raworth recommends specific policies to reform the global economy and de-emphasize growth.
> 
> The central idea of the “doughnut economy” is to grow the economy enough to support the basic needs of all humans, but not so much that the economic growth exceeds the planet’s ability to regenerate resources that support life on Earth. Raworth’s conception of the post-growth economy requires the following changes: a negative-interest currency, tax reform, and breaking the culture of consumerism.

### Strategies for Enacting Mutual Care With All Living Beings

Kimmerer recommends the following strategies to encourage mutual care with other people and other life forms, such as plants and animals, in your community.

#### Express Gratitude

Expressing gratitude reminds us to treat the things we’re grateful for with respect and care. Gratitude rituals are also a way to hold each other accountable for stated values. For example, to reinforce mutual care, you could take a moment before you start eating a meal to say thank you to the plants, animals, and humans who provided the meal.

(Shortform note: This strategy relates back to the Indigenous ceremonies that reinforce mutual care: They are spiritually meaningful and sometimes incorporate practical elements. In _The Power of Ritual,_ Casper ter Kuile talks about how to turn simple activities into spiritually meaningful rituals by **setting an intention before you begin, engaging your five senses to help you stay present, and practicing the ritual repetitively**. These steps could transform ritual expressions of gratitude into a lived practice of mutual care.)

#### Tell Stories

Because cultural lore is an indicator of worldviews and priorities, sharing stories related to mutual care can guide us in healing our relationship with the natural world. Storytelling can inspire people to practice mutual care, caution people against selfish behavior that contradicts mutual care, and teach community members about why mutual care is important. Kimmerer notes that the Indigenous mythologies specifically described in the book are meant to be shared, and you can use the gift of language to tell your own stories as well.

(Shortform note: In _Sapiens_ , Yuval Noah Harari discusses the historical power of storytelling to motivate and change human behavior. Harari describes how the cognitive ability to tell stories enabled early humans to cooperate and create more advanced societies. Unlike their predecessors, _Homo sapiens_ created “collective fictions” that provided the foundation for religion and ethics. This form of storytelling motivated people to cooperate on a mass scale.)

#### Steward the Land

Working the land is a straightforward way to practice mutual care through direct interaction. This could include **gardening, removing invasive plants, or planting trees** to restore a cleared forest. Making a garden benefits you and many other beings by providing food for pollinators, beautification of a space, an abundance of fresh food for your community, habitat for insects, increased soil health, and psychological satisfaction and enjoyment.

(Shortform note: Research confirms that gardening has a positive impact on our brain chemistry. Studies show that the benefits of gardening include increased happiness, memory retention, creativity, and self-esteem, and decreased effects of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and dementia.)

#### Advocate for the Land

Advocating to protect or restore land is another strategy for practicing mutual care. You can raise awareness about conservation needs in cases where natural spaces are at risk of losing biodiversity and habitat due to human development. You could also speak to your political representatives about cleaning up industrial waste sites to mitigate further damage.

(Shortform note: Kimmerer does not go into specific recommendations for advocacy, but there are many organizations to join, and there are online resources available about implementing effective advocacy campaigns. One guide recommends starting with in-depth research on the topic and surrounding legal issues, followed by a planning stage, the implementation of deliverables, measuring progress, and reflecting on and revising your strategy.)

#### Use Resources Mindfully

Practicing mindfulness with regard to resources encourages mutual care by influencing the way you invest your money and fostering gratitude. **Try buying things that minimize harm** to others and the environment. For example, buy local, organic produce that required fewer fossil fuels to get to you (because it wasn’t transported from far away by industrial vehicles) and did not have contact with toxic chemicals.

Another strategy for being mindful is to mentally **trace your items back to their original living form** so that you appreciate the lives given to make those items. For example, you could acknowledge the trees that a wooden bed frame and coffee table came from.

(Shortform note: Marie Kondo argues in _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ that actively appreciating your material possessions increases their longevity and usefulness, linking the recommendation for resource mindfulness to the strategy of expressing gratitude. Kondo’s definition of “active appreciation” includes greeting your house and saying thank you to the items you use. These habits contribute to mutual care with the environment because if your items last longer, you can purchase fewer items and reduce your consumption of natural resources.)

#### Give Generously

Lastly, giving generously to other people and non-human beings is a way to practice mutual care in your community. Giving a gift contributes to the well-being of another person, and Kimmerer notes that the **gift may also inspire the recipient to share with others in return**. In the context of non-human beings, gift giving is a way to support the ecosystem that supports you. Gift-giving could include things like hosting a dinner for friends, volunteering at a community clean-up, sharing excess food, applying mulch to a tree, or planting a shrub with berries that are edible to birds and other critters.

(Shortorm note: In addition to helping the recipient of the gift, evidence suggests that giving gifts has psychological benefits for the giver as well. One study showed that participants were significantly happier when they spent more money on others compared to themselves. In addition, the proportion of money spent on others was more correlated to happiness than the actual amount of money people received. This research reinforces the inherent _mutual_ aspect of giving.)
