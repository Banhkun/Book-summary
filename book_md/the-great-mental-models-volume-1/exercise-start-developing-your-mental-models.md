## Exercise: Start Developing Your Mental Models

The authors emphasize that mental models are tools for making better decisions. Practice using mental models to aid your decisions by applying three to a situation you’re currently experiencing.

* * *

Considering the authors’ nine foundational mental models, pick three mental models that you could implement today. Below, briefly describe how you might use each.

Now, take your first mental model and put it into action. Bring to mind a situation you’re currently in and, using the mental model, briefly write down any insights it gives you. For instance, you might “consider the consequences” of your current spending habits.

Taking your second model, try applying it to the same situation. Below, describe what the model helps you see about the situation. For example, you might ask whether personal finance is one of your regions of mastery—and how you might make it one.

Last, use your third model to look at the situation from a third perspective. Briefly reflect on what the model reveals, and how you could act from there. For instance, you could look for the fundamentals of personal finances and, with those first principles, devise new spending habits.
