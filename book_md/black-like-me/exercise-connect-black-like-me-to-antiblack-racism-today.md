Which of Griffin’s observations or conclusions about antiblack racism feel like they’re still true today? Explain why.

What is one way you can expose or confront antiblack racism in your own life? Be specific about what action you’ll take. (For example, if you’re a teacher or professor, you could notice any time a colleague or a student perpetuates an antiblack stereotype. When you catch this happening, you could explain to them why that stereotype is harmful and how it contributes to a vicious cycle of oppression.)
