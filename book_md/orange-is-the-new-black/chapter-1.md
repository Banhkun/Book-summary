## Chapter 1: Looking for Adventure

_Orange Is the New Black_ is Piper Kerman’s memoir of her year at a federal women’s prison. **Piper was a well-educated white woman from an upper-middle-class, liberal New England family**. Growing up in these circumstances, there seemed to be little doubt that Piper would go to a good college, graduate, and start a successful career as a white-collar professional. With her social and financial privileges, as well as her obvious intelligence and solid work ethic, this kind of life was certainly open to Piper. But Piper was to take a different path, one that her experiences and background could never have prepared her for.

### Nora

Piper graduated from Smith College in the early 1990s. Not wanting to settle down right away and start a career, she instead went looking for adventure and new opportunities for self-exploration. She moved to the nearby town of Northampton, Massachusetts, where she began a bohemian chic life alongside a clique of other 20-something college graduates. She worked at a brewery and enjoyed casual sexual encounters with her peers. During this time, she also explored another dimension of her sexuality, having relationships with women as well as men.

It was during this period of Piper’s life that she met a mysterious, but intriguing woman named Nora Jansen. While Nora was not conventionally attractive, she had an allure that mesmerized Piper. Piper quickly learned that Nora was a far-from-conventional person with a far-from-conventional job—Nora, in fact, was a drug dealer, working for an international heroin smuggling ring headed by a West African drug lord.

For Piper, who was desperately looking for adventure and unique life experiences, Nora was a window into a thrilling and high-stakes world. Piper fell under Nora’s sway and began a torrid love affair with her. As the months went on, Piper became more and more involved with Nora’s smuggling operation, as did many of her Northampton friends.

**Nora provided Piper with the adventure that Piper craved**. On a whim, she moved with Nora to San Francisco, where they began a life defined by travel to distant and exotic locations, where Nora would meet her contacts in the drug ring. Piper was engaged as a courier in this operation, transporting bags of drug money through international airports. She was fascinated and thrilled by the adventure and risk of it all, and she relished the opportunity to see the world.

### Getting in Over Her Head

Later in life, Piper would look back on these experiences and reflect upon how insulated she was from the real-world consequences of her criminal behavior. Drug abuse was something that destroyed lives, tore families apart, and was a main driver of the ever-escalating costs of mass incarceration, particularly in the United States. **As a willing and eager participant in a heroin smuggling ring, Piper was directly contributing to this social destruction,** but she was blithely unaware of the consequences of her actions at the time. To her, it barely even registered that she was committing crimes at all.

Still, Piper had growing apprehensions. On one trip, Piper journeyed with Nora to Indonesia. They stayed in a luxury hotel and enjoyed the height of comfort and splendor, but Piper was taken aback by the wildness of the country. Her mind boggled at seeing the stark contrast between the dire third-world poverty and the decadent excesses of unrestrained, unregulated, and illicit capitalism practiced by the endless parade of oil tycoons, arms dealers, and drug kingpins.

**Piper began to feel that she was on a truly dangerous and reckless path and had gotten herself in far over her head**. In particular, she began to have her doubts about Nora. During the Indonesia trip, Piper and Nora journeyed to Krakatoa, where they spent the day in a pool that lay atop a 35-foot waterfall. Nora dared Piper to jump over the waterfall into the river below. Reluctantly (and after pressure from Nora), Piper made the terrifying plunge. Nora followed after, but told Piper she was using her as a guinea pig—she only jumped _after_ seeing that Piper had done so with dying or suffering gruesome injury. This set off an alarm in Piper’s mind that Nora was dangerous and untrustworthy.

She knew that Nora was exploiting her, using her as a courier to help herself make money. Clearly, Nora was willing to put Piper at great legal and physical risk for her own benefit. After one final trip during which Nora asked her to smuggle actual heroin (instead of money) through the airport in Zurich, Piper decided enough was enough. She ended her relationship with Nora and cut ties with her. She closed this exciting, but frightening chapter of her life—or so she thought.

### Meeting Larry

After breaking it off with Nora, Piper returned to San Francisco to begin a more conventional, risk-free life. She landed a job as a television producer and editor, working primarily on infomercials. She settled into a stable, normal, contented life, with a good network of friends. She was glad to put her criminal past behind her and found that she was happy living a more conventional life, believing that her thirst for adventure had at last been satisfied.

**While in San Francisco, she met and fell in love with a man, a freelance writer named Larry Smith.** Larry was not the sort of person Piper expected to fall in love with. He was a _man_ , and not the hip, conventionally attractive kind of man she had been in relationships with before. Their relationship began in a purely platonic way, after they were introduced by mutual friends. After some time as friends, the pair realized that they had a special connection. Larry may not have been a bohemian chic pretty boy of the type that Piper had known in Northampton and in her days with the drug ring, but he was good-hearted, kind, and loved her intensely—and, Piper discovered, this was all she ever wanted.

After some time in San Francisco, Piper and Larry moved to New York City in 1998 to take advantage of job opportunities. They settled in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan and began what they thought was going to be a quiet and contented life together.

### Piper’s Past Comes Back

**In May 1998, Piper and Larry’s happy life in New York received a rude awakening.** One day while Piper was at home in their apartment, she heard a knock at the door. When she answered, she was shocked to find two US customs officials. She let them into the apartment, where they told her that she was being indicted on conspiracy charges related to her drug smuggling activities with Nora, which she had ended five years before. The customs officials told her that she needed to speak to a lawyer as soon as possible.

As Piper read the indictment, her past came flooding back. Apparently, the drug ring had collapsed and the participants started informing on one another in an attempt to secure more lenient sentences. Nora gave Piper’s name to the authorities.

Naturally, Piper was shocked, embarrassed, and terrified upon hearing this news. Was this real? Could she really be facing the prospect of going to prison? When she called to tell Larry what her situation was, he was initially incredulous, believing that she was pulling a prank on him. Piper told him that it was no joke, that she was really being indicted on federal drug charges. Piper told Larry all about her past with Nora—a subject he knew nothing about. Larry was taken aback, but supportive, telling Piper that he would stand by her no matter what happened.

After speaking with an attorney, Piper learned that she was facing a potential sentence of a decade in prison if she was convicted at trial**.** This, she learned, was because of “mandatory minimum” statutes. **Mandatory minimums limit the ability of judges to modify sentences based on individual defendants’ circumstances and are a major driver of the skyrocketing US prison population.**

Piper’s lengthy sentence could be avoided, however, if she agreed to accept a plea deal in exchange for a lighter sentence. Although she would _certainly_ go to prison by taking this deal, she would be incarcerated for a much shorter period of time. Not wanting to run the risk of receiving the maximum sentence by going to trial, Piper pleaded guilty in 1998 and awaited her fate.

### Sentencing Delayed

Amidst all this tumult, Piper and Larry made the journey up to Massachusetts to tell her family what was happening to her. Like Larry, they were shocked at the news that Piper would be heading to prison. **She was bracing herself for anger and judgement, but she was surprised—and relieved—when they expressed their support for her.** More than anything else, Piper felt their love and warmth in her hour of need. Although they were scared for Piper and worried about what would happen to her in prison—a place they never dreamed she would be going—they refused to turn their backs on her.

Piper was expecting to be formally sentenced and taken to prison imminently, but then, something curious happened—her sentencing was delayed. The West African drug kingpin who was at the head of Nora’s smuggling operation was being held in London. The American government wanted to have him extradited for trial in the US, but the British authorities also had claims on him and were interested in trying him in the UK.

While these legal issues were wrangling themselves out, Piper’s sentence was delayed indefinitely. She was a potential witness in his case, and the Department of Justice did not wish to send Piper to prison until after he had been convicted, believing that she would be a more compelling witness if she were not already in prison by the time of his trial.

This began an anxiety-ridden five-year period, during which Piper was already convicted of conspiracy and knew she was going to prison, but did not know when she would be going or for how long**.** During these long intervening years, Piper grew paranoid about her impending fate. It also became difficult to explain the nuanced legal situation to her upper-middle-class friends and family, who struggled to understand the concept of being free while waiting to be told when to report to prison.

### Finding Support

On top of this, Piper and Larry faced heavy financial burdens. She started working multiple jobs to support her mounting legal fees. Piper marvelled at how all the money she and Larry earned seemed to be going toward paying off the consequences of her disastrous relationship with Nora.

Piper did enjoy one truly joyous moment during this odd and tortuous five-year purgatory period—in summer 2003, Larry proposed to her**.** Piper tearfully accepted his proposal. Although she was terrified for what lay ahead of her, she was grateful to have the love and support of a wonderful man like Larry. She knew that, together, they would be able to overcome whatever the future had in store for them.

After the engagement, it was also time to break the news of Piper’s criminal past and future time in prison to Larry’s parents. This had been kept secret from them for the past five years, but Piper and Larry could put it off no longer. Piper feared how Larry’s parents might react—although they had always been kind to her, they were older and more conservative than her parents. Where her family treated Piper’s plight with sympathy and support, she feared Larry’s family might react with scorn and judgement.

But to her surprise, they were supportive and open-minded about Piper’s legal troubles. They _were_ angry at the harshness of a justice system that imprisoned good and upstanding people like Piper for mistakes made years before and were baffled as to why the government would commit precious resources to imprisoning a nonviolent offender like _her_. Larry’s father, an attorney, even offered to help Piper with her case. As with her family, Piper was immensely relieved and grateful to have such a strong and nurturing support system in Larry’s parents.

### The Sentence Comes Down

Ultimately, the UK government decided in 2003 _not_ to extradite the West African drug kingpin, choosing instead to place him on trial in Great Britain. Piper would no longer be needed to stand as a witness in his trial. This meant that there was no longer any need to delay her sentencing. Piper was again overwhelmed with emotion when she saw how much support she had from her friends and family, who wrote letters to the court attesting to her character and urging the government to give her a light sentence.

**Piper was, at last, sentenced on December 8, 2003 to 15 months in prison at the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury, Connecticut** , a decade after committing the original offense for which she had been convicted. The unknown date was finally at hand. Although she was frightened by the thought of prison, she was relieved to be sentenced near her family, where they would be able to visit her on a regular basis.

After the sentence was handed down, Piper had one more meeting with her attorney. He assured her that, while she was unlikely to face physical danger at a minimum-security facility, **incarcerated life would still be a major transition for someone of Piper’s background**. He warned her not to make friends or get entangled in disputes among inmates or between inmates and the correctional staff. He predicted that the most difficult aspect of prison life for Piper would be putting up with the myriad petty tyrannies of poorly educated and ill-tempered prison officials, or as he put it, **“chickenshit rules enforced by chickenshit people.”**

After a tequila-soaked goodbye party in Manhattan’s East Village the night before she was to report to Danbury, she and Larry headed out the door the next morning to greet this new, and most unexpected, phase of their lives.
