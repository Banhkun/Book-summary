## Chapter 5: Comings and Goings

In September, the Bureau of Prisons issued an order banning inmates at Danbury from smoking. This was met with great outcry from the prison population—tobacco was one of the few pleasures and stress relievers these incarcerated women had. Smoking was more than just a habit, it was a ritual for many women and an important social lubricant. People met in groups to smoke together, with cigarettes serving as a focal point for the community.

Piper herself was not a smoker, but she disliked the pettiness and high-handedness of the new regulation. She wryly observed the irony of doing time with a population of women mostly locked up for illegal drug offenses, while cigarettes killed far more people than the drugs did.

### Job Fair

That fall, the annual job fair came to Danbury. This event was yet another reminder of **how inadequately the prison was preparing its inmates to functionally reintegrate into mainstream society.** Piper (in yet another marker of her privilege) was fortunate enough to have a job waiting for her, a marketing position at a company run by a friend of hers.

Her fellow inmates, disproportionately women of color, lacked the kind of social capital necessary to capitalize on these kinds of opportunities. They were poor, marginalized, and convicted felons. The deck was stacked against them from the start. As a result, many of them would fall back into illegal activity upon release.

When inmates had questions about job training, or what employers might be open to hiring women with a record, the job fair organizers had no answers. They didn’t even know that the women of Danbury lacked regular access to the Internet, preventing them from even _knowing_ what jobs were available. They were clearly totally unprepared for dealing with an inmate population.

The only advice the job fair organizers could offer came in the form of a “dress for success” contest, in which the women were given an assortment of outfits and judged on the basis of how “professional” their attire was. While some of the prisoners enjoyed the competition—Vanessa, in particular, relished the opportunity to strut on stage—**the sexistimplications of judging women’s suitability for the workplace based solely on their appearances were not lost on Piper.** The whole event was condescending, patriarchal, and racially problematic, with its implied denigration of Latin or African-American modes of dress in favor of white ones.

### Martha Stewart

Throughout much of Piper’s time at Danbury, the inmate population was following one news story with bated breath: the trial, conviction, and sentencing of television personality Martha Stewart on charges related to securities fraud. When Stewart was convicted and sentenced in July 2004 to five months in federal prison, there was intense speculation both in the media and among the inmates of federal institutions as to where she would serve her time. Many women at Danbury eagerly hoped that Stewart would be heading to _their_ prison, as it was widely believed to have been Stewart’s preferred location to serve out her sentence.

**While all this speculation was going on, news stories began to appear about how dangerous Danbury was**. One article in _People_ magazine even quoted a former Danbury inmate who labelled her fellow prisoners as “scum of the earth.” On the other end of the spectrum, the women of Danbury were outraged to learn that a more recently released inmate had given an entirely different account of the prison to the _Hartford Courant_ —and that this inmate was none other than Piper’s old coworker in the electrical shop, Levy.

In her tell-all interview, Levy portrayed Danbury as a cushy “Club Fed” resort complete with gourmet food, college-level courses, and Haagen-Dazs ice cream on demand. This from a woman who had done nothing but complain while she was there and stigmatize her fellow inmates as lacking in any “class.”

Everyone was angry that Levy had portrayed Danbury this way. It was a grave insult and a missed opportunity to expose the truly inhumane conditions at the prison. Why had Levy, of all people, gone out of her way to sugarcoat her prison experience?

**Piper reasoned that an upper-middle-class white woman like Levy wouldn’t want to admit that she’d been ghettoized and marginalized like other, “lesser” groups in prison**. It was a painful and almost unbearable loss of status and privilege for someone like Levy to admit that she’d been forced into the same prison circumstances as these other women. Thus, she had a psychological need to fictionalize her prison experience.

### Prison Parties

That fall, Vanessa was released. She was only at the minimum security camp for a few short months, a reward for good behavior at the very end of her sentence. As was the time-honored Danbury custom, Vanessa’s bunkmates threw her a sumptuous (by prison standards) going-away party. These parties were an important ritual for the prisoner community, a well-wishing to someone hopefully closing a painful chapter of their old life and starting a new one. They brought the women together in celebration and solidarity—when someone you knew was finally going home, it was as if _everyone_ had regained a small piece of freedom.

The women of The Ghetto gave Vanessa the warm send-off she deserved, bringing her an array of homemade prison delicacies. Piper even made a “cheesecake,” using vanilla pudding, lemon juice, Laughing Cow cheese, and crushed graham crackers, a delicacy for which she had become renowned at Danbury. In her farewell speech, Vanessa talked about how moved she was by the spirit of love and community she’d found in this most unlikely of places. **She told her fellow prisoners that although she’d undergone surgery to become a female, it took coming to a women’s prison to truly become a woman.**

This wasn’t the only memorable party Piper got to attend that fall of 2004. On September 28,

Pop summoned Piper to the visiting room. When Piper arrived, she was greeted by her friends yelling, “Surprise!” Pop and Jae had organized a surprise 35th birthday party for her, complete with a full prison banquet, decorations, and gifts. Piper was overcome with gratitude, joy, and emotion when Pop presented her with a pair of homemade slippers, made from reconstructed shower shoes and covered in crocheted yarn.

Seeing all her friends—Pop, Jae, Little Janet, Rosemarie, Pennsatucky, Toni—gathered together was overwhelming. These were women whom, a year ago, she wouldn't have ever thought she would even meet. Now, they were among her very closest friends. **Piper saw that she had a community at Danbury, with people who truly loved and cared for her** . Little Janet wrote a heartfelt letter to Piper, telling her to stay strong and reminding her that she would soon be back home with her family and her fiance. Jae handed Piper a handmade birthday card, in which she wrote, “I never thought I’d find a friend like you.”

### Breakdown of Discipline

It was a time of transition at Danbury. Women with whom Piper had grown close were leaving—and now, Yoga Janet was one of them. Piper wondered how she would survive in Danbury without her. Yoga Janet was an older woman who had organized yoga and mindfulness classes in the recreation room. These classes were an important part of Piper’s rhythm of prison life, helping to center her mind and give order to her day. In the chaos of Danbury, Yoga Janet was a comforting and inspiring presence. Now, she would be gone.

**Inmate send-offs were usually an occasion for celebration, a collective victory for all the women of Danbury.** But Piper was distraught to see Yoga Janet go, throwing her arms around the aging hippie and telling her how much her presence had meant to her during her sojourn in prison. Although she was happy that Yoga Janet was finally free, Piper knew there was no replacing her. Even with Yoga Janet gone, Piper continued to do her morning routine, with the help of an old fitness VHS tape that Janet left behind. Yoga would go on without Yoga Janet.

That fall, the Bureau of Prisons decided that it would _not_ be sending Martha Stewart to Danbury after all, citing the facility’s ease of access to New York-based media, which would bring unwanted scrutiny. When it looked like Stewart might be taking up residence in Danbury, new inmates had been redirected to other federal facilities in an effort to avoid giving the appearance of an overcrowded prison if there were to be a sudden media swarm with such a high-profile prisoner. Now that Stewart was _not_ coming, the floodgates opened and new prisoners once again began stretching Danbury’s capacity to the limits. The results were overcrowding, high tensions, and a generally hostile mood throughout the camp.

On top of this, Butorksy retired and was replaced by another BOP lifer named Finn. While Butorsky was racist and homophobic, he was also a stickler for rules, paperwork, and proper procedure—not necessarily bad qualities to have in a chaotic place like a federal prison. Finn, on the other hand, was lax, disorderly, and a disastrously inept administrator. While this did give inmates some greater level of day-to-day freedom, it also contributed to a general breakdown of order and discipline, creating unsafe conditions in the prison. Even worse, **individual COs enjoyed greater personal discretion over how to handle inmates in the absence of clear guidelines from the top of the hierarchy** . This gave the most sadistic and abusive among them an opportunity to indulge their worst tendencies.

The story of a prisoner named Cormorant demonstrated to Piper just how dangerous this chaotic state of affairs could be. **** Cormorant was carrying on a sexual relationship with a male CO named Scott (given the power disparities between COs and inmates, it was impossible to know how truly consensual the relationship was in the first place). Finn harbored a deep dislike for CO Scott, but he chose instead to retaliate against _Cormorant_. Finn first had Cormorant sent to SHU as a way of antagonizing Scott. When Scott quit, Finn had Cormorant sent to the maximum-security facility, where she would serve the duration of her sentence. **Cormorant was the unwitting (and unwilling) pawn in a power struggle between two different players in the prison bureaucracy.**

### The Fall Classic

That October, the prison was captivated by the 2004 American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. Interestingly, the series broke down largely along racial and class lines, with the primarily white, upper-middle-class, New England-born inmates supporting the Red Sox and the predominantly Latinx or African-American, poor, Bronx-born inmates favoring the Yankees.

Piper, a Massachusetts native, was a diehard Red Sox fan and wildly cheered her team on as they became the first Major League Baseball club to overcome an 0-3 series deficit and defeat their hated rivals, before going on to win their first World Series title in 86 years. It was a cathartic moment for Piper, one weighted with deep symbolic importance. She broke down crying watching the Red Sox celebrate their historic championship, thinking back to just the year before during the 2003 ALCS, when she and Larry had sat heartbroken in a Manhattan bar as Yankee fans celebrated yet another victory over the Red Sox. In just a year, so much had changed.

**The Red Sox victory showed Piper that so many of her assumptions about her life had simply been wrong**. She joked to herself that she had to go to prison for the Red Sox to win the World Series. It was truly a world turned upside-down.

### Piper’s Downward Spiral

In late fall, Piper learned from her father that her grandmother was in poor health. This was deeply upsetting—**Piper was locked away in prison, unable to see her grandmother or be with her or the rest of the family during this difficult time**. Her grandmother was always an incredibly important person to Piper—although she came from a reserved, somewhat conservative southern background, her grandmother was amazingly broad-minded and easy to talk to. They were close confidantes, feeding off one another’s intellects and shared needs to challenge the status quo. It was her grandmother who first spoke to Piper about topics like feminism, sex, power, and patriarchy.

Now, Piper feared that her worst anxiety was coming true—that her grandmother would die during her period of incarceration. Fearing the worst, Piper wrote a long and heartfelt letter to her grandmother, telling her how much she loved and admired her and how she would always be one of the most important and influential people in her life. She cursed the stupidity of her choices in life that had led her to her present situation.

Piper knew that furlough—a temporary, conditional release from prison—was technically possible under certain circumstances. Perhaps this family emergency would qualify. The other inmates, however, told her that furlough was a pipe dream and lost cause. The veteran prisoners told Piper that they had never seen an approved furlough request in all their years at Danbury. Piper requested it anyway. She knew it was a longshot, but what other choice did she have?

The cynics proved right in the end. Piper’s furlough request was quickly and unceremoniously denied by the Bureau of Prisons. Piper entered a state of deep anger and depression, unable to enjoy the company of her friends, visits from family, the rhythms and rituals of daily prison life, or even special occasions like the Halloween party. She felt miserable and utterly powerless. She did manage to have a brief phone conversation with her grandmother from Finn’s office, after which she broke down sobbing.

**Piper began to wall herself off from the world around her**. All her life, her stoicism and stiff upper lip had helped her survive. These qualities were certainly being put to good use in prison, a world filled with people struggling to cope with insurmountable loss and hopelessness. Piper’s hard exterior earned her respect from her fellow inmates, none of whom liked a crybaby. Despite her privileged background and elite education, Piper earned a reputation for having street smarts. Nevertheless, everyone knew that she was hurting deeply inside, or was “in some kind of way,” in prison parlance.

In her heightened and deteriorated emotional state, Piper lashed out. One day running on the track, she smacked a particularly annoying and loud “Jesus Freak” named LaRue who happened to be on the track with her at the same time. LaRue was known for making loud and ostentatious declarations of her faith. She recognized that her dislike of LaRue was irrational and mean, and was more about her inability to cope with her feelings than it was about LaRue. **Piper was ashamed that prison had transformed her into someone capable of inflicting violence on someone else.**

Through it all, Pop urged her not to let the injustices of prison turn her bitter and jaded. In conversations with another inmate named Gisela, Piper also began to understand the fulfilling role that faith played in the lives of many women at Danbury. Piper, although nominally Episcopalian, had always been quite secular, with religion never playing an important role in her life.

Now, she saw that she had been wrong to look askance at faith. Gisela’s relationship with God was joyful and affirming. Rather than treating God like a vehicle for wish fulfillment, Gisela’s approach to spirituality was focused on what _others_ needed from _her_. In a place like a federal prison, this could be a tremendous force for good.

### The Power Imbalance

Piper could sense her freedom getting closer and closer. On one of his visits, Larry mentioned that he had bought a house in Brooklyn for them to live in when she got out. This was wonderful news for Piper—it made her freedom and her life after prison seem more real. She also knew that it marked her out as privileged. Instead of hitting the streets or a homeless shelter, as so many of her fellow prisoners would upon release, she would be living with her fiance in a new house in a chic and gentrified neighborhood in Brooklyn.

Visits from Larry and her family were Piper’s lifeline, but she had to pay a price afterwards—the humiliation of the body search performed by the COs after each visit. During these searches, women like Piper were treated as little more than objects to be fondled, groped, and ogled.

**Guards knew that they could brazenly violate the physical space of female prisoners without facing any repercussions** —such was the nature of the drastic power imbalance between male guards and female prisoners. Those women who dared to file complaints in response to this treatment were handled harshly. They were sent to the SHU (ostensibly for “protective custody”) and had their jobs and visiting privileges revoked.

**Many guards were pure authoritarians.** These men fed off the power they wielded over powerless inmates, relishing their authority and capacity to inflict harm on those who wouldn’t fight back. Piper even suspected that there was a certain authoritarian personality type that was drawn to correctional work, with prisons giving such men (and they were nearly always men) unchecked opportunity to indulge their worst impulses.

She saw this in action when she earned a low-level “shot” (prison bureaucracy jargon for a disciplinary infraction) after being caught by Finn loitering in a part of the prison where she wasn’t technically authorized to be. There was a graduated system of shots, with small infractions garnering minor penalties and major ones resulting in harsh penalties—the worst could land one in SHU or result in extra charges being added to one’s sentence.

Piper’s transgression was nothing of the sort: she knew it and Finn knew it. No major disciplinary action was ever going to result from her trivial “offense” (cells in SHU were a finite commodity and they couldn’t throw every rule violator in there), nor would the prison even be inclined to pursue the matter (prison officials were generally lazy and wished to avoid cumbersome paperwork).

**Nevertheless, Piper had to stand there and listen to Finn menacingly shout at her, despite the underlying absurdity of the situation.** In the end, Piper was punished with 10 hours of extra work service. She made the most of her punishment, filling it by helping Pop prepare the Thanksgiving meal in the kitchen.
