## Chapter 3: On the Job

**After a week, Piper moved out of the Rooms and into permanent housing in the Ghetto, the primarily African-American housing unit**. There, her bunkmate was Natalie, an older woman of Caribbean origins. Natalie was widely respected among the other inmates as a tough woman who knew her way around prison—Piper learned from Pop that, years ago, Natalie had beaten another inmate with a sack stuffed with combination locks during an altercation. Thankfully, Natalie liked Piper and agreed to take her under her wing. Natalie was, however, strict about order and cleanliness in their bunk and made it clear to Piper that she would not tolerate messiness or clutter.

Life in the Ghetto was unlike anything Piper had ever been exposed to before. One night, a woman urinated on the floor of the neighboring bunk as part of an ongoing feud with another prisoner. More generally, there were loud, chaotic nights, with women talking, yelling, singing, playing music, and calling out to one another across the dormitory.

On Valentine’s Day, Piper saw that the women of Danbury engaged in all the merriment of the holiday that couples on the outside did. There were romances, discreet displays of affection, and even exchanges of cards. Piper was genuinely surprised by this aspect of prison culture. She marveled at how relationships could exist in such a place.

**Piper was impressed by the ways in which women managed to hold on to their culture and dignity, even inside prison**. The West Indian women and “Spanish mamis” made genuinely delicious Latin and Caribbean dishes, using nothing more than junk food from the commissary as ingredients. The human spirit and passion for creativity could not be extinguished, even at Danbury.

### Prison Economics

**At Danbury, inmates performed menial labor for $0.14 per hour**. These were low-skill jobs, providing prisoners with none of the workforce training or experience they would need to reintegrate into society upon release. This dysfunctional system, Piper learned, was a contributing factor to high rates of recidivism—prisoners simply re-entered the criminal justice system when they couldn’t get living wages outside of it.

The women at Danbury used their paltry wages to buy overpriced commissary items like toiletries or feminine hygiene products that weren’t provided by the BOP. Piper wanted a job so she could stock up on much-needed items and repay her friends who had loaned her these things upon arrival.

**Some prisoners worked for private companies, like Unicor, that contracted with the federal prison system**. Although these jobs paid more, they were still exploitive—these companies were taking advantage of what amounted to forced labor to pay the kind of starvation wages that would be illegal anywhere else but the penal system. Other jobs, meanwhile, were coveted by the inmates because they offered rich opportunities for smuggling and contraband.

Piper wanted to work in the prison education program, believing that, with her background, she would be a unique asset. Despite her enthusiasm, Piper was warned against this job by the other inmates. They told her that it was understaffed, poorly supervised, and that she would have to deal with unruly and insubordinate student-inmates with no interest in learning.

### Electrical Shop

**Ultimately, Piper was assigned to a job in the electrical shop.** On her work crew were two other inmates, the perpetually nervous Little Janet and Levy, a French Moroccan Jew. Piper developed a quick distaste for Levy, who was snobbish and constantly insisting that no one else at Danbury had any “class.” The head of electrical was the cruel and odious DeSimon, who took pleasure in emotionally tormenting the inmates. DeSimon was the head of the CO union and widely disliked even by his colleagues.

Piper and the other inmates lacked any background in electrical work and were poorly trained for their jobs, creating hazardous conditions. One day, Piper found, to her horror, that she’d walked out of the shop without returning the screwdriver she was using. This was strictly prohibited, as tools like screwdrivers could be used as weapons. All tools needed to be properly signed out and returned at the end of the day. Piper feared that it was only a matter of time before DeSimon fingered her for the infraction, which could result in her being sent to the SHU and possibly even having time added to her sentence as punishment.

In a panic, she disposed of the screwdriver and hoped that the whole thing would just blow over. She told the whole story to Nina, who reassured her that nothing was likely to come of it—DeSimon was too lazy to pursue the matter, nothing could be proven, and they weren’t going to waste precious limited space in the SHU on the likes of Piper.

One day, DeSimon took Piper, Little Janet, and Levy in a van to a pump house just outside the prison. He then left them outside of the pump house and drove off for several hours. This was pure emotional torment for the three—DeSimon surely knew that if any prison officials passed by and saw them standing outside, off-campus, in their uniforms, they could be charged with attempting to escape. Finally, he returned and ordered them to clean the pump house in preparation for an upcoming inspection of the prison by the BOP. **The work was grim and dark—the women screamed when they found discarded snakeskins in the pump, which elicited an evil chuckle from DeSimon.**

### New Offers, New Dilemmas

One of the more unpleasant features of Piper’s prison routine was her weekly check-in with Butorsky. **He was in the habit of making homophobic and racist comments about other inmates, ideas which he (wrongly) believed Piper to be in sympathy with**. He drew distinctions between people like himself and Piper, and the other inmates, whom he viewed as being inferior. He observed that “northerners” (a common euphemism for “white” among the prison staff) deserved the best jobs, like van driver.

Butorsky offered Piper, a fellow “northerner,” the coveted driver job, which was available with Minetta’s impending release. Piper, however, turned it down—the job, while not without its perks, was seen by the other inmates as the one reserved for the jailhouse snitch. **She did not want to lose social standing with her fellow prisoners or do anything else to mark herself out as privileged or special.**

In addition to Minetta, Nina was also leaving Danbury to enter a drug treatment program “down the hill” at the maximum-security facility. While harsh, successful completion of the program promised to reduce Nina’s sentence, so she was eager to participate. Piper was upset to see Nina leave, as she was her first real friend at Danbury. Nina was Pop’s bunkmate—and her departure created an opening for someone to replace her as Pop’s new bunkmate and lieutenant, a highly prized spot at Danbury.

Piper, to her surprise, was offered the opportunity to move into the predominantly white Dorm A—“The Suburbs”—and assume this role. But she decided to reject this offer too. Piper suspected that she might be perceived as racist if she chose to leave the Ghetto, plus she did not want to offend her current roommate Natalie, with whom she had grown close. Piper recommended a new inmate, an Italian-American named Toni, for the slot instead. Through this whole process, Piper was surprised to see that an inmate had such an ability to call the shots on bunk assignments—but, then again, Pop was no ordinary inmate.

### Under Pop’s Wing

**There was no shortage of piety and faith-based activity at Danbury, though Piper had her doubts about how much of it was motivated by sincere spiritual conviction**. Every denomination was represented in the prison, and they all had their own designated time for religious services. Although fairly secular herself (she was a blue-blood Yankee Episcopalian), Piper was tolerant of everyone’s expressions of faith. There was only one group that managed to irritate her—the Evangelical Christians. Piper found these women to be loud, judgemental, pushy, and holier-than-thou. They were constantly parading through the dorms, loudly declaring what they were going to pray for, while castigating everyone else as damned, unrepentant sinners.

But Piper did manage to find some level of comfort from religious holidays. When Easter came up in March, it was the first holiday she knew she would miss with her family because of her incarceration. But Pop and her kitchen crew prepared a wonderful Easter meal that managed to give Piper a small taste of home. They served up baked chicken, cabbage, dumplings, and deviled eggs. Pop’s connections gave her access to contraband that no one else in the prison could dream of getting.

Although Piper chose not to bunk with her, **Pop became like a mother to Piper** , guiding her through the trials and tribulations of prison with a unique mixture of compassion and tough love**.** She was exactly the kind of guardian figure someone like Piper needed in Danbury. Although Pop had a tough exterior and came from a completely different background than Piper—she was a Russian gangster’s wife who had spent years on the run from the FBI before finally being apprehended—she had a genuine warmth and compassion and made it her business to look out for the “girls” in her crew. And that now very much included Piper.

### Retaining Humanity

In prison, inmates were issued drab uniforms instead of being allowed to dress in their personal style, and issued numbers and called “inmate” by the COs, instead of receiving the dignity of being called by their real names. In such circumstances, **incarcerated women at Danbury did everything they could to hold onto some sliver of their humanity and their individuality.**

The prisoners operated a makeshift beauty salon on campus, where they could maintain their hair, nails, and makeup. Even in Danbury— _especially_ at Danbury—Piper saw that these women maintained pride in their appearance. This was especially true if they were preparing for a visit. Indeed, one could tell who was expecting a visit from a loved one based on how much time they spent in the salon. Women also did whatever they could to sew alterations into their uniforms (strictly prohibited by the regulations) to better match their personal style. Sewing was a highly valued skill at Danbury and women who knew how to do alterations could make a fortune in the prison barter economy, trading their talent for commissary goods.

Piper certainly availed herself of these services, considering the barrage of visits she received on a continual basis from Larry, her mother, and her friends. Her mother was a particular source of strength. Piper knew that it was destroying her mother to see her daughter in prison, but she dutifully made the journeys down to Danbury to support her. Her father also made his best efforts to help Piper feel normal (or, at least, as normal as possible under the circumstances), eating M&Ms with her and listening to Piper explain the elaborate and baffling social system that was prison life. Still, it was clearly agonizing for him to see Piper behind bars.

**These visits were her lifeline and her strength, although she was always crushed when visiting hours ended and she had to return to the drab world of Danbury.** Even worse, every visit was followed by the standard, yet humiliating and dehumanizing, strip search to check for the contraband that COs feared visitors were always attempting to smuggle in. Many women eschewed visits altogether out of distaste for the strip search, but this was a price Piper was willing to pay.

And Piper was floored by the wellspring of support she received from those who knew and loved her. Friends came from all over the country. Her visitors attracted attention and comments from the inmates, many of whom were serving long sentences and received few visitors. Piper often overheard the male COs mocking her gay friends who came to visit and making homophobic jokes. When they weren’t doing this, they would leer at her female friends.

### Sex and Romance at Danbury

**Sex was on the minds of almost everyone at Danbury.** The prisoners were deprived of the company of their partners, creating an atmosphere of sometimes aching sexual repression and lust. Piper was no stranger to this feeling, never having experienced the sensation of being deprived of Larry for so long.

Piper grew increasingly lustful for Larry. The “no touching” visiting hours rule became increasingly difficult to obey, though Piper feared the consequences of defying it. One particularly harsh CO (nicknamed “Gay Pornstar” for his mustache, which reminded the inmates of male stars of adult films from the 70s and 80s) was known to strictly enforce this rule, threatening to cancel visits altogether if he saw even the slightest contact between a visitor and an inmate. Piper began to wonder if her relationship could withstand the stress of her incarceration.

The women of Danbury found unique ways to cope with pent-up sexual frustration. One prisoner, a proud hillbilly nicknamed “Pennsatucky,” even discussed with Piper the subtle art of making homemade prison dildos using sporks, maxi pads, and rubber gloves.

That spring, a new inmate came to the minimum-security camp as a reward for her good behavior at the neighboring maximum-security facility. Her name was “Crazy Eyes” Morena, so nicknamed because of her powerful expressive eyes, with which she would stare at the other inmates. Crazy Eyes was one of Danbury’s few “out” lesbians and she quickly took a fancy to Piper, attempting to seduce her. To Piper’s dismay, Crazy Eyes began following her around on her daily walks through the yard—which were typically a time of quiet reflection and solitude for Piper, one of the precious rituals she maintained to ease her time in prison.

**Now, Crazy Eyes was starting to seriously interfere with Piper’s routine**. She was in the habit of proclaiming to Piper that she had no time for all these “silly bitches” and that she needed a “real woman” like Piper. She boasted that she was a big-time drug dealer on the outside and that she needed a lover who respected and admired her the way she felt she deserved. Piper would always listen politely, but she was becoming seriously intimidated by Crazy Eyes.

**Piper knew that many heterosexual women engaged in brief, experimental same-sex relationships during the period of their incarceration—going “gay for the stay”** as it was called—but she was determined to remain faithful to Larry, regardless of her own romantic history with women. Eventually, Piper politely, but firmly rebuffed Crazy Eyes’s advances, telling her that she hoped she would eventually find the “real woman” she was looking for. To Piper’s great relief, Crazy Eyes backed off.

### Connecting to the Outside

**Maintaining some semblance of normalcy and connection to the outside world was crucial to survival and sanity at Danbury**. Piper, Rosemarie, and another inmate named Carlotta would plan their future weddings, thinking about the guest list, the food, the venue, and the music selection. All of this was a lifeline to the world outside of prison and a way of clinging to a better and more hopeful future. Piper and Rosemarie wanted to get married because they loved their partners. Carlotta, on the other hand, wanted to wed so she could lord her happy, stable life over the dysfunctional women she had grown up with, or, as she put it, “so bitches can hate.”

The inmates were always focused on who was being released from week to week. This served as a reminder that there was a light at the end of the tunnel, that _their_ time at Danbury, too, would eventually end. An inmate being released was a victory for _everyone_. To celebrate these victories, prisoners organized “going away” parties, in which the soon-to-be-released inmate gave away their extra commissary items and clothes, while their friends prepared special send-off meals. These rituals were a crucial part of prison life and vital to maintaining one’s sanity.

**The key was to avoid getting sucked into the petty drama and upheaval of prison life**. Many women got into squabbles over what they would watch on television in the recreation room, who got to sit at what table in the dining room, or who cut who in line at the commissary. In prison, your reputation was one of the few things you could still control, especially if you were a “lifer” or serving a long sentence. Many inmates saw winning such struggles as vital for maintaining their self-respect.

**Piper believed these women were making the mistake of treating prison as though it was real life**. She tried to think of this period as a temporary aberration in her life, maintaining her focus on what came _after_ prison. So many women, she saw, became institutionalized and unable to function outside—for them, prison _was_ their entire world. This, Piper came to realize, was a contributing factor to recidivism—indeed, two-thirds of all released convicts in America are reincarcerated at some point.

She witnessed many inmates returning to Danbury after being released, even requesting to be reassigned to their old cell blocks and bunks. They were often grateful to be back in a federal prison like Danbury, where conditions were far better than those in local jails or metropolitan detention centers.

As she spent more time in prison, Piper began to understand that **prison had the power to break those who were unable to come to terms with their incarceration**. This was true of every woman at Danbury, from every background—whether it was working-class women who rebelled furiously against any form of authority or upper-middle-class women like herself who bristled at the idea of being confined with (and forced to obey) people whom they considered to be their social inferiors.
