## Chapter 6: Space Racism

In previous chapters, we looked at how racism is directed at _people_. In this chapter, we’ll look at how racism is directed at _spaces_. Spaces that are governed or highly populated by racial groups can be assigned race.

**Space racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that aim to eliminate racialized spaces or that cause resource inequity between racialized spaces, the main idea being the **belief that certain racialized spaces are more deserving of resources than others.**

Example #1: People believed that Black “ghetto” neighborhoods were full of violence and juvenile delinquency, and this would creep into surrounding areas if people weren’t careful. People assumed that the people living in these neighborhoods had fewer resources because they were less deserving of them.

Example #2: In South Carolina, school districts became racialized spaces, and there were White schools and Black schools. In 1930, South Carolina spent $53 on each White student and $5 on each Black one. This inequity implies that White students are more deserving of resources than Black students.

**In reality, no racialized spaces are any better or worse than others.** Inequities are due to policy, not the people who live in or govern spaces. The antiracist view of spaces is that racial spaces should be acknowledged and protected, that no spaces bar anyone from entry, and that all spaces are allocated equal resources. No race should have a majority in politics or culture.

### History and Invention of Space Racism

Space racism begins in the US in the early 1800s. According to slaveholders, people in Africa, which was a Black space, were ignorant, immoral, and wild, and a space like this had no business existing. Thomas Jefferson proposed a solution—civilize and free Black people in the US and then send them to Africa so they could teach the rest of the country how to be civilized. However, Black people typically wanted to stay in their existing spaces and had no interest in going to Africa.

In 1865, Edwin M. Stanton, US secretary of war, and General William T. Sherman met with a group of Black leaders including Garrison Frazier. Stanton asked Frazier if his people would rather live in communities of Black people or spread out among White people. Frazier said Black people would rather live separately from Whites because it would take a long time for White people to get over their prejudices and it would be uncomfortable to interact with them in the meantime. Sherman gave Frazier and his people land and an army mule and ordered that they alone should be in charge of their land and affairs.

#### Separation, Segregation, and Integration

Frazier and his people wanted _separation_ , not _segregation_ , which is quite different. **Antiracist separation is one group wanting to put some space between themselves and racist groups. Segregation is one group wanting to put some space between themselves and other groups that it views as inferior.** Segregation was marketed as “separate but equal,” but racialized spaces were never treated equally because segregationists saw certain spaces as more deserving of resources than others.

In addition to separation and segregation, there’s one additional school of thought on spaces: integration. **Integrationists believe that when people of color enter White spaces, they’ll become civilized, and that White people will let their racism go as a result of interacting with people of color.** According to integrationists, integration will also prevent non-White spaces from becoming centers of White hate.

Integration doesn’t take into account the fact that it’s going to be hard for people of color to heal when White people haven’t finished attacking them. Additionally, following integration to its final end would result in every race being divided in every space based on their percentage of the national population. For example, in any given US space of 100 people, 12.7 of them would be black, 4.8 of them would be Asian, and 61.3 would be White. Every space would have more White people than any other race and all spaces would become White.

#### The “Ghetto”

**“Ghetto” neighborhoods are Black spaces that were formed by Black people moving from the South and White people fleeing their arrival.** White people went to other neighborhoods that the government supported via loan guarantees, highway construction, and subsidies. Developers built new places to live for White people.

Black people stayed in the “ghettos,” which became overcrowded. However, “ghetto” wasn’t used to describe this progression of racist policies—it was used to describe bad Black behavior in certain areas.

In the 1960s, Kenneth Clark wrote about the “dark ghetto,” a dangerous Black neighborhood where he grew up that was full of violence and juvenile delinquency. **The idea that Black neighborhoods are inherently dangerous is misleading.** It results in people avoiding Black neighborhoods because they fear crime and trying to live in White neighborhoods.

White neighborhoods have crime too, especially white-collar crime. White-collar crime loses people somewhere between $300-600 billion every year. When violent crime was at its highest in 1995, robbery and burglary were costing only $4 billion. White neighborhoods also produce the White males who commit mass shootings.

It’s clear that**no racialized neighborhood is better or worse than any other** —all have both good and bad qualities and deserve equal resources.

(Shortform note: Parts of the “Ghetto” section appeared in the book’s Chapter 12.)

#### Educational Funding

**Throughout history, discrepancies in educational funding between White and Black school districts have been a major part of space racism.** For example, in 1930, Alabama spent only $7 on each Black student and $37 on each White student. However, it was so hard for civil-rights activists to secure equal funding for racialized spaces that they decided to fight for integration instead, which would allow at least some Black people to access the same resources as White people.

In 1954, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lawyers argued that separating two races makes the non-White race feel inferior. For evidence, they used a doll test, which involves giving Black children dolls with different skin colors and asking them to choose their favorite. Most Black children chose the White dolls. As a result of the NAACP’s efforts, in _Brown v. Board of Education_ , the Supreme Court ruled that segregation was unconstitutional, regardless of whether or not segregated spaces are equal in every other way.

The court did some things right with this decision—they noted that _exclusionary_ White spaces _completely_ dominated by White culture and people that take more than their share of public resources _are_ a problem. However, they did some things wrong too—they noted that _integrated_ White spaces _mostly_ dominated by White culture and people that take more than their fair share of public resources _aren’t_ a problem. The court also didn’t acknowledge the existence of integrated Black spaces that don’t get enough resources.

**The integrated White space became the ideal.** If a student stayed in a Black space, she was stuck—she could only develop if she moved to a White space.

Some people, such as Martin Luther King Jr., didn’t agree with integration in schools—he was worried about White, potentially-racist teachers being in charge of children’s education and development.

Only some Black children went to White schools, and in 1973, it became impossible to ignore funding inequities between Black and White schools. **Funding for schools came from local property tax, which varied by neighborhood.** When parents in the San Antonio Independent School District took the school district to court, **the Supreme Court ruled that the tax allocations didn’t violate the Constitution’s equal-protection clause.**

Some people, such as David L. Kirp, a Cal Berkeley professor, wrote in 2016 that integration made a huge difference for Black children. He based this on the fact that as more Southern Black students went to integrated White schools, the “achievement gap” narrowed. From 1989 to 2011, when the percentage of Black students attending White schools dropped, the gap widened. Kirp took this to mean that African-American students at integrated schools did better than those at segregated schools. This conclusion was incorrect—there are other ways to explain this trend, such as the fact that when Black students went to integrated schools, they were taught how to take the standardized tests everyone was using to measure intelligence.

##### Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)

**Like public schools, HBCUs and Historical White Colleges and Universities (HWCUs) don’t receive equal funding.** For example, Yale and Stanford have 36 times more endowment than Howard, the richest HBCU. UT Austin has 5 times more than Howard. Because there are wealth inequalities between races, certain groups can donate more or less.

Public colleges and universities also have to deal with inequity in state funding. Racist policies result in HWCUs getting more public funding than HBCUs.

Therefore, **when people argue that the best Black colleges can’t keep up with White ones, this is an inherently unfair position.** Comparing spaces without taking into account race-classes is like asking a flyweight to box a heavyweight. If you’re going to compare White and Black spaces, you have to compare them within the same economic level to find any meaningful results. For example, when you look at financially comparable HBCUs and HWCUs, HBCU graduates are more likely to be physically, socially, and financially successful, and more Black students graduate.

Some people think that HBCUs aren’t representative of the “real world,” which is majority-White. They think Black students should go to non-Black schools because once they graduate, they’re going to have to operate in a majority-White space. This is untrue—**many Black Americans live and work in predominantly Black spaces.** People can only think the Black spaces aren’t real if they’re looking at the world from a White point of view.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Space Racism

**When Ibram studied African American studies at Temple University, he was part of a Black space.** Black history, culture, thoughts, and people governed this space. Other spaces at the university that were governed by White versions of these things weren’t called “White spaces,” just “spaces,” because, incorrectly, many people viewed White spaces as the default, standard norm.

Temple was surrounded by low-income Black neighborhoods. White racists were worried about people from the “ghetto” coming onto campus, and security guards checked IDs before people were allowed to enter campus buildings. The fear of these Black neighborhoods and attempts to segregate White and Black spaces were clear examples of space racism.
