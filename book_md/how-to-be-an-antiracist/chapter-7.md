## Chapter 7: Racism Towards Specific Groups

All the types of racism previously mentioned in Part 2 can be directed at any non-White race. The types of racism in this chapter are directed at specific races.

Before we explore anti-White racism and Black-on-Black racism, we need to confront the myth that Black people can’t be racist.

### Powerless Defense

**Powerless defense is the idea that it’s impossible for Black people to be racist because they lack power.** This concept appeared in the 1960s as a response to accusations of anti-White racism. Black people defended themselves by saying that they couldn’t possibly be racist towards White people because they didn’t have any political power.

Suggesting that people of color don’t have power results in several negative consequences:

  * It lowers expectations for people of color who do hold positions of power—if they or others incorrectly assume people of color never have real power, they’re not held accountable when they don’t act in anti-racist ways.
  * It suggests that people of color have no power to change things—racist policies and inequities are here to stay.
  * It defends people of color when they do racist things.
  * It downplays the historical oppression of people of color by other people of color. White people have given people of color the power to oppress others, and some people of color have used this power for personal gain.
  * It’s another version of racism—White people have more power and, therefore, are superior to Black people.



Additionally, the idea of powerless defense is flawed. Everyone, even those who don’t hold a high political position, has power. **Black power is more limited than White power, but it exists—if White people had absolute power, they would control everyone’s minds, and not only would no Black people reach positions of power, it would never even occur to them to try for power.**

### Anti-White Racism

Anti-white racism is the **belief that people of European descent are behaviorally, biologically, or culturally lesser than those of other racial groups, or the belief that all White people are part of racist power.**(The definition of anti-White racism doesn’t include racist policy that creates racial inequity because historically, White people have been favored by policy.)

White people have done a lot of terrible things, such as enslaving and massacring people. However, this isn’t because they’re genetically, culturally, or behaviorally evil. **White people are only a problem when they create racist policies, subscribe to racist ideas, and then deny that they’re racist.**

#### History and Invention of Anti-White Racism

Similar to how White people made up creation stories and justifications for the inferiority of other races, non-White people did the same thing towards White people. There are four incorrect theories about how White people were created:

**Theory #1: Created by an evil scientist.__** Elijah Muhammad, who led the Nation of Islam, wrote a book called _Message to the Blackman in America_ in which he explained how White people came into being. Muhammad believed that 6,000 years ago, the world was all Black. Yakub, an evil Black scientist, was exiled. He wanted to get revenge on society so he created White people. When Yakub’s White people invaded Black society, Black authorities imprisoned them in caves, but Moses released them when he “lifted up the serpent in the wilderness.” Moses then taught White people how to rule, which ultimately led to the inequities between Black and White people today.

Malcolm X was influenced by Muhammad’s writings. He converted to the Nation of Islam and when he got out of prison in 1952, he used his speaking and organizing skills to grow the movement. However, he left in the Nation of Islam in 1964 and converted to orthodox Islam. By this point, he had rejected Muhammad’s ideas and creation story because he believed they were racist.

**Theory #2: Two-cradle theory.** This theory, created by Cheikh Anta Diop, a Senegalese scholar, states that people who developed in the northern cradle (Europeans) developed barbarianism and violence because they needed it to survive their harsh climate. People who developed in the south cradle (Africa) lived in a plentiful environment, so they developed spirituality and peacefulness instead.

**Theory #3: Influenced by the Ice Age.** Like the two-cradle theory, Michael Bradley’s explanation for the behavior of White people is based on environmental determinism. In 1978, Bradley wrote in _The Iceman Inheritance_ that White people are ruthless because they developed in the harsh conditions of the Ice Age.

**Theory #4: Recessive genes.** This is the only biological theory. Frances Cress Welsing, a psychiatrist, wrote in 1982’s _The Isis Papers****_ that the genes that cause darker skin are dominant and those that cause white skin are recessive. White people are already a minority and fear that they’ll go extinct. This fear leads them to act the way they do.

##### White Racist Power

The author believes that anti-White racism is actually a form of anti-Black racism, because it ends up hurting Black people as well as (if not more than) White people. **White racist power does well in a climate of anti-White racism—when people of color direct their hatred towards regular White people, they’re no longer focusing on White racist power** and its policies, which are the real problem.

Additionally, racist power can distract people from the real problem by convincing regular White people that there are no policy problems, and that changes to policy would result in them losing their jobs, rights, or privileges. Plenty of White people are worried about anti-White discrimination. For example, worker Tim Hershman complained to a reporter that he’d been passed over for a promotion because superiors seemed to favor Black candidates. (Hershman lost the job to a White finalist, so his perception was incorrect.)

However, while regular White people can benefit from the policies of racist powers, they would benefit far more from a more equal society. Racist power has been responsible for things such as slashing school budgets, creating economic inequity, and destroying unions. Many policies favor only superrich White men, not White people in general.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Anti-White Racism

**Ibram started believing in anti-White racist ideas after the 2000 election when Black voter suppression helped George W. Bush win the presidency.** Gore, whom Ibram supported, would have won, but officials manipulated voters, the counts, and the ballots:

  * Black people who registered to vote never received their paperwork.
  * 50,000 alleged felons were struck from the list of eligible voters. Many of the people on the lists _weren’t_ felons, and it was difficult to get back on the list.
  * Palm Beach County’s ballots were so complicated that people accidentally spoiled them or voted for the wrong candidate.
  * Gadsden County, where many Black citizens lived, had the highest spoilage rate in Florida.
  * Bush’s legal team instigated recounts in areas where he’d lost and suppressed recounts in areas where he’d won.
  * Ballots from Black people were ten times more likely to be rejected than those from White people.



To Ibram’s disappointment, Gore conceded quickly, without a fight. Ibram felt the Democrats had passively let Bush “steal” the presidency, and he decided that all White people cared about was maintaining a functioning democracy for _White_ people. Ibram maintained his anti-White racism throughout his second year of college and in 2003, wrote his first piece in FAMU’s student newspaper. Although it was about how Black people should stop hating White people, it still demonstrated his anti-white racism. In theorizing that White people were attempting to “destroy” Blacks because they were a “different breed” just trying to survive—they had recessive genes and were a global minority—Ibram suggested that White people as a whole were racist (a racist idea itself). He didn’t yet understand that the real reason it’s wrong to hate White people is thatthey aren’t the problem—racist policies are the problem.

### Black on Black Racism

Many people think Black people can’t be racist toward each other. Black people themselves often don’t call other Black people “racist;” they have other names, such as “sellouts” or “Oreos,” but “racist” is most accurate. Black people can be racist towards other Black people in two ways:

  * They create subgroups within a race and assign a hierarchy.
    * For example, Chris Rock, in his show _Bring the Pain_ , talked about how he loved Black people but not “niggers,” which he and many others define as a lower class of Black people.
  * They work against members of their own race. Some people are more concerned with advancing their own personal interests than those of their races.
    * Example #1: In the 1980s, Samuel Pierce, the Black secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, gave funds that had been intended for low-income housing to Republican donors and corporations.
    * Example #2: Ken Blackwell, Ohio’s Black Secretary of State, suppressed Black votes, which affected the results of the 2004 presidential election.



#### History and Invention of Black-on-Black Racism

**The first instance of written Black-on-Black racism comes from a book written in 1526.** The author, a Morrocan Moor, was kidnapped in Africa and enslaved. He was given to the pope, who converted him and freed him. The book included lines about Black people behaving like animals.

In 1657, Richard Ligon, an Englishman, wrote a story he may have made up about slaves in Barbados. A group of slaves tell their master about a planned revolt and when their master tries to reward them, they refuse the reward, because they consider divulging the revolt to be their duty—these Black slaves believed Black people _should_ be enslaved.

In 1818, when Denmark Vesey organized a revolt near Charleston, South Carolina, he had to contend with the fact that some enslaved people were loyal to their masters. He cautioned his army to be careful about who they recruited. Someone wasn’t—when a man named Peter Prioleau found out about the planned revolt, he told his master. Vesey’s army was destroyed and Vesey hung. Prioleau was emancipated and given a lifetime pension, which he used to acquire his own slaves. Prioleau cared more about his own interests than those of his race.

##### Black People in Positions of Power

Black people have increasingly entered positions of power, starting in the 1960s, which saw more Black police, judges, and politicians. Many people thought that more Black people in power would mean less anti-Black racism from those in power, but often, this wasn’t the case: Black police, politicians, and the Black middle class still practiced Black-on-Black racism.

For example, in the 1960s, **violent crime was on the rise in poor neighborhoods, and Black residents approached their leaders with their fears about _Black_ criminals and _Black_ drug addicts, as opposed to criminals and drug addicts in general.** Nobody seemed to see the whole picture, which was that drug problems were a public-health crisis, not a specifically “Black problem,” and that violent crime is far more strongly related to poverty than race.

People thought hiring more Black cops would combat police brutality against Black people. However, some of the Black officers treated Black people as badly or worse than White officers. According to a study in 1966, Black officers were less likely to be racist than White officers, but some of them called Black people “savages” or said it was their own fault they weren’t educated. Some police killings, such as that of Shantel Davis, were by Black officers.

A 2017 survey found that White officers are far more likely to be racist than Black ones—only 6% of White officers thought the US has more work to do when it comes to racial inequity, compared to 69% of Black officers. **Regarding police killings, however, Black officers are only twice as likely as White officers to attribute the death of Black people by police to “a broader problem,”** even though in reality, _all_ racial inequity is caused by policy.

##### How Much Does Racism Affect Black People?

**In 2003, only 40% of Black people thought that the fact that Black people had worse housing, income, and jobs was due to racism.** In 2013, it was only 37%. Everyone else found other reasons to explain racial inequity, which was likely a result of the internalization of racist ideas.

By 2017, after very public police killings, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the election of Donald Trump, the percentage of Black people attributing their inequity to racism was 59%.**But around 33% of Black people still attributed the inequity to the personal fault of Black people**.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Black on Black Racism

##### Journalist Internship

After Ibram wrote his anti-White column in the FAMU student newspaper, the Black editor of the _Tallahassee Democrat_ , whom Ibram was supposed to be doing an internship with, called him into his office. During the meeting, the editor mentioned that he had a nice car, and that he hated it when he was pulled over and treated like one of “them niggers.”

Ibram kept quiet even though he was very offended. **He was furious that the editor would look down on people in his own race and see them as the problem, not the cops. However, Ibram had criticized Black people too.** Before Gore had conceded and Ibram had transitioned to hating White people, Ibram had blamed Gore’s loss of the 2000 election on the fact that not enough Black people had voted, not on voter suppression policies, which was the actual reason.

##### African American Studies

**Speaking with the editor helped Ibram discover that he could be racist even though he was Black, and he began to deal with his dueling consciousness.** He took some courses in African American studies and realized that history was a struggle between antiracists and racists, not between different kinds of racists. He had been planning to go into sports journalism but found himself disinterested and pursued graduate studies in African American studies instead, at Temple University.
