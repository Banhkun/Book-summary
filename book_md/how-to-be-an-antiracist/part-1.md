## Part 1: What Are Race and Racism? | Chapter 1: Backgrounder

In _How to Be an Antiracist_ , author Ibram X. Kendi takes readers through his journey to become an antiracist—a person who believes that all racial groups are equal and supports policies that reduce inequity. **Antiracists acknowledge that there are differences between races, but these differences aren’t responsible for inequities—policies are.**

Part 1 covers what racism is and how it came into being. Part 2 covers different kinds of racism and how they intersect with each other. For each kind, we look at how and why it was invented, how its policies have affected society, and how it has affected Ibram specifically. We also describe how Ibram identified his own racist ideas and worked at dismantling them. Finally, in Part 3, we’ll look at some of the techniques Ibram and other antiracists use to combat racist policies on a societal rather than personal scale.

The goals of the book are to:

  * Clear up commonly held misconceptions about what racism is—it’s difficult to become antiracist without knowing exactly what racism entails
  * Make you aware of subtle racist ideas you might have been unknowingly supporting
  * Show you how to weaken your racist ideas and start supporting antiracist rather than racist policies



### The Invention of Race

Race has only existed for about 600 years. Most people think that the concept of race came first, then people developed racist ideas, and then, finally, people developed racist policies stemming from their racist ideas. However, the true order of events is different: **policy created to further self-interest—the lucrative slave trade of Africans—came first, and only _then_ was race invented to justify the policy. **Racist ideas came last.

In the fifteenth century, Prince Henry the Navigator wanted to get into the slave trade but didn’t want to work with Islamic slave traders, who were enslaving a variety of people including Europeans, Arabs, and Africans. Prince Henry sponsored voyages to West Africa and focused the Portuguese slave trade on Africans. His ships explored new regions of the continent, including the feared waters around Cape Bojador.

Because the Islamic traders were enslaving people from a variety of areas, their trading policies weren’t racist. However, Prince Henry’s policy, because it focused on a particular group of people, _was_ racist.

In 1453, 20 years after Prince Henry had organized the African slave trade, the King of Portugal commissioned Gomes de Zurara to write a biography of Prince Henry. **Zurara invented the African race when he described the people being sold at a slave auction in Lagos, Portugal. He described the people as being different from each other in language, ethnic group, and skin color, but he lumped them into a single group of people** who lived like animals and needed to be saved by civilized Europeans, who were inherently superior.

Similarly, **the “Indian” or _negros da terra_ (“Blacks from the land”) race was invented by Portuguese and Spanish colonizers after they arrived in the Americas.** All Indigenous people were lumped into this group. Alonzo de Zuazo, a Spanish lawyer, compared this race to the Black race, saying that the Blacks were strong and good at work while the Indigenous people were weak.

The goal of inventing races was twofold:

  * **To create a hierarchy**
    * For example, putting Africans into one group, and slave traders and slave owners in another, allowed for comparisons between the groups. Comparison naturally resulted in some groups being superior to others.
  * **To legitimize treating the groups differently**
    * For example, thinking of Africans and Indigenous people as inferior groups legitimized their enslavement and murder.



Zurara created the concept of sorting people into groups, but he didn’t actually call these groups “races.” Jacques de Brézé, a French poet, first used the word “race” in a poem in 1481. Then, in 1606, another Frenchman, Jean Nicot, defined the word “race” in a French dictionary to mean “descent.”

**By the 18th century, the Asian and European races were invented.** In 1735, Carl Linnaeus color-coded the four existing races as yellow (_Homo sapiens asiaticus_), white (_Homo sapiens euopaeus_), red (_Homo sapiens americanus_), and black (_Homo sapiens afer_), and he built a hierarchy in his text _Systema Naturae_. According to Linnaeus, Europeans were at the top and possessed positive traits such as intelligence and muscular bodies. Next were the Asians, who were melancholy, greedy, and haughty. Then the Indians, who were ill-tempered, stubborn, and free. Blacks were at the bottom and were lazy, careless, and ruled by caprice.

Even though race is not a legitimate scientific category, **race has meaning because history, culture, society, and policy have given it meaning.** It is, therefore, “real.” **We have to acknowledge the existence of race in order to become antiracist** —we have to identify racially so that we can see how our race is privileging or endangering us.

### Defining Terms

An important principle of antiracism is to clearly define words related to racism. Definitions are important for two reasons:

  * They allow us to accurately describe the world and its principles.
  * They force us to be honest. If definitions are flexible, people can spin and manipulate words to present themselves in a better light or silence conversations.
    * For example, the word “racist” has acquired so many negative connotations that it’s become so offensive people are afraid to use it, and anyone who’s accused of being racist denies it. This results in people not speaking up about racism. In reality, words like “racist” and “racism” aren’t pejoratives—they’re descriptive terms that are necessary for identifying and, subsequently, dismantling racism.



_How to Be an Antiracist_ uses the following definitions:

**A race, or _racial group_ ,__ is a hierarchical category into which people are sorted. **These categories aren’t based on culture, biology, or ethnicity—they were invented by historical powers in order to gain power over groups of people. There are six races in the US: Latinx, Asian, African, European, Indigenous, and Middle Eastern.

**A race maker is a person who creates racial groups and subgroups.**

  * (Shortform example: An example of a race maker is Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, who divided humans into five races based on what their skulls looked like.)



**_Racial_ is an adjective that means related to race. **It doesn’t imply any hierarchy or superiority.

**A _racial inequity_ is an unjust imbalance between racial groups.** It’s important to understand that racial inequities are caused by _policies_ , not people within races.

  * Example #1: In 2014, 71% of White families lived in homes they owned while only 45% of Latinx and 41% of black families owned their homes. Black and Latinx families are not inherently less deserving or less capable of homeownership than White families—rather, the imbalance is caused by a series of policies (some of which are discussed in later chapters).
  * Example #2: White people live 3.5 years longer than Black people in the US, and twice as many Black infants die as White ones. Again, this is not because Black people are inherently less healthy and robust than White people. It’s because a series of policies have resulted in fewer resources and higher health risks in Black communities.



#### Racism and Antiracism: People, Their Ideas, and Their Behaviors

**_Racist_ , **as a noun, **refers to a person who believes that some races are inferior to others and who supports racist policies, whether by creating them or by not working to dismantle them.** “Racist” is a descriptive term, not a permanent identity—people can make both racist and antiracist decisions throughout their lives.

  * For example, White supremacists are racists—they believe that White people are superior to all other groups and they vote for politicians who will enact racist policies.



**A _racist idea_ is an idea that implies one racial group is better or worse than another. **

  * An example of a racist idea is believing that Black people aren’t as studious as White people.



**_Antiracist_ , **as a noun, **refers to a person who believes that all races are equal and who supports antiracist policies.** It’s also a descriptive term, not a permanent identity.

  * For example, Ibram is an antiracist⁠—he believes that all races are equal, and he founded the Antiracist Research and Policy Center to work towards dismantling racist policies.



**An _antiracist idea_ is an idea that implies all racial groups are equal.**

  * An example of an antiracist idea is believing that there are no differences in studiousness between Black and White people.



A **_microaggression_ is the constant, daily abuse that White people subject people of color to.** Most White people aren’t aware they’re committing microaggressions. While the term “microaggression” is widely used, Ibram doesn’t use it because “micro” implies that daily abuse is minor, which it isn’t, and “aggression” is vague. He prefers the term “racist abuse.”

  * An example of microaggression or racist abuse is a White woman clutching her possessions to herself when a Black person sits next to her. 



**_Macroaggression_ is large-scale abuse directed at people of color.**

  * An example of microaggression is violence.



#### Racism and Antiracism: Policies

**A _racist policy_ is any law, procedure, process, guideline, or rule, written or unwritten, that causes or maintains racial inequity. **“Systemic racism,” “structural racism,” and “institutional racism” are synonyms, but Ibram prefers to use “racist policy” because it’s more straightforward and concrete.

  * Example #1: Some of Nixon’s fiercest criticism came from Black people and antiwar critics, so he created a policy to attack them. The policy allowed law enforcement to raid their homes and meetings in search of drugs. 
  * Example #2: Ohio required newly registered voters in the 2004 federal election to submit their voter-registration forms on a particular kind of expensive paper, which made it harder to register. The policy appeared to target _all_ newly registered voters, irrespective of race, but a large percentage of newly registered voters were Black, meaning the policy caused racial inequity.



**An _antiracist policy_ is any law, procedure, process, guideline, or rule, written or unwritten, that causes or maintains racial equity. **

  * (Shortform example: The 1965 Voting Rights Act made it illegal to prevent people from voting based on their race.)



**_Racial discrimination_ is treating a group of people in a particular way based on their race.** Racial discrimination is only racist when it creates inequity.

  * An example of racial discrimination is a policy that temporarily helps an underrepresented group. While related to race, this policy isn’t racist because it aims to create equity between groups.



**_Racism_ is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities.**

  * An example of racism is the combination of policies that resulted in Black and Latinx people making up 56% of the prison population in 2016 even though they represent only around 25% of the US population. White people make up 30% of the prison population and 60% of the US population.



**_Antiracism_ is a collection of antiracist policies and ideas that cause racial equality.**

  * An example of antiracism is the combination of the Immigration and Nationality Act (1965), the Refugee Act (1980), and the Immigration Act (1900) that encouraged immigration to the US from non-European countries.



#### Neutrality

You’ll notice there are no definitions of terms like “not racist” or “neutral policy.” That’s because **there is no in-between when it comes to antiracism and racism—anything that’s not antiracist is racist.** Likewise, there is no such thing as a “neutral policy”: All policies and ideas either advance or hamper equality.

(Shortform example: Racist policies have created funding imbalances between Black and White schools. A scholarship program open only to Black people is antiracist because it strives for educational equality between racial groups. Axing this scholarship program because White people aren’t allowed to apply may seem “neutral,” but, in fact, canceling the program would be racist because it would mean canceling something that’s aimed at remedying the current funding imbalance and thereby promoting racial equity.)

**Race neutral programs can actually be more dangerous than the agenda of the alt right.** While the alt right is unlikely to actually create a White ethnostate, race neutrality has a track record of leaving policies that create inequity in place and striking down programs that create equity.

Additionally, race neutrality often goes hand-in-hand with ideas around ignoring the existence of race (the notion of being “color blind”). While race is a power construct, not a meaningful scientific category, it still affects everyone’s lives. Pretending it doesn’t exist allows racists to carry out business as usual—if we ignore race, then we’re blind to racial inequity. Dispensing with racial groups will be one of the very _last_ steps in the struggle to end racism, not the first.

### Segregation vs. Assimilation vs. Antiracism

There are three schools of thought on how to handle racial inequities:

**Segregation.** Segrationalists believe that some racial groups are inherently inferior and can’t rise to the level of other groups. They support programs that keep members of the inferior groups away from their groups by segregating, deporting, imprisoning, enslaving, or killing them. Segregationist ideas are racist.

  * Ben “Pitchfork” Tillman, a US senator, is an example of a segregationist. He participated in many terrifying campaigns including an 1876 mob that killed at least seven Black people in Hamburg, South Carolina, and when he heard that President Roosevelt dined with Booker T. Washington, who was Black, Tillman said that he’d have to kill 1,000 Southern Black people to undo the damage.



**Assimilation.** Assimilationists believe that certain racial groups are inferior to others, but with work, the inferior group can reach the same level as the superior group. They support programs that will develop or civilize the inferior group. Assimilationist ideas are also racist—they set the White race as the standard everyone else has to match.

  * Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Black civil-rights lawyer, is an example of an assimilationist. Norton called on middle-class people with “ghetto origins” to teach people currently living in the ghetto how to become middle-class.



**Antiracism.** Antiracists believe that no racial group is superior to another. They support programs that aim to create racial equity.

  * Ibram is an example of an antiracist. He started the Antiracist Research and Policy Center, which works towards changing racist policies.



### Dueling Consciousness

Many people hold beliefs that fall into more than one of these schools of thought. People of color tend to hold both antiracist and assimilationist views and experience “dueling consciousness”—**the sensation of looking at themselves from two angles: how they view themselves and how others view them.** Antiracism suggests there’s nothing wrong with Black people and they’re perfectly capable of achieving success. But assimilation suggests that when Black people aren’t successful by White standards, it’s due to negative behaviors characteristic of the entire racial group. Consequently, Black people experiencing dueling consciousness are torn between the belief in their own inherent equality and the belief that Black people have only themselves to blame for the disproportional success of Whites in society.

Ibram experienced this dueling consciousness throughout his formative years. He was proud of being Black (an antiracist belief), but at the same time believed that Black people were responsible for their own problems—if Black students would just try harder (act more like White people and assimilate), they would be getting the same grades as White students.
