## Chapter 3: Bodily Racism and Colorism

While the belief that races are genetically distinct has contributed to racism throughout history, there are many more common, and more subtle, beliefs that contribute to racism today. These commonly-held racist beliefs often fall into the categories of bodily racism and colorism, which are related to people’s physical appearance.

### Bodily Racism

**Bodily racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities, the main idea being the **belief that people of certain races are more animal-like or dangerous than those of other races.**

Example #1: Bill Clinton said that Black people have to understand White fear in America. He said that when White people encounter or see violence in the media, it’s often coming from Black people.

Example #2: Cops are scared of Black people, even unarmed kids. The US population is 13% Black, but people killed by police are disproportionately Black—in 2018, 21% of people killed by police were Black. White people are half as likely to be killed by police as Black people.

**In reality, there are no inherently violent or dangerous races.** Researchers have found that there’s a much stronger correlation between unemployment and violent-crime levels than race and violent crime levels, for example:

  * A study of youth data from 1976-1989 found that young White males did less violent crime than Black ones, however, when the researchers looked at employed young males, there were no differences.
  * Another study found that a 2.5% decrease in unemployment created a decrease in robbery, auto theft, larceny, and burglary, between 1992 and 1997.
  * Karen F. Parker, a sociologist, found that between 1990 and 2000, an increase in Black-owned businesses reduced Black youth violence.



Additionally, all-Black neighborhoods have varying levels of crime. If Black people were inherently violent, crime levels in all-Black neighborhoods would be the same. Middle- and upper-income neighborhoods—in which people who have jobs tend to live—are less violent than low-income neighborhoods.

#### History and Invention of Bodily Racism

**White people have consistently associated Black people with violence.** Historical figures such as colonizer Captain John Smith called Black people “devilish” in 1631. In 1903, senator Benjamin Tillman said that Africans were “fiends” and “wild beasts.” Today, Americans view Black people’s bodies as more dangerous and violent than White people’s, even when they’re the same size.

**This view of Black people as dangerous resulted in laws targeting violent crime that disproportionately affect Black people,** such as the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. This act created new minimum sentences, capital offenses, prisons, and federal three-strike laws. It also increased the number of police officers and made it possible to try anyone thirteen or older as an adult.

In response to the proposed act, the Congressional Black Caucus asked for additional funding for violence-prevention and drug treatment programs. Republicans opposed the funding and demanded it be significantly cut before they would support the bill. Democrats and members of the Black Caucus caved. They didn’t want to entirely lose funding, and they also believed the Black body was dangerous.

However, racist Americans didn’t think this act was enough. In 1995, John J. DiIulio Jr., a political scientist at Princeton, warned that “super-predators” were coming. Super-predators were a new generation of criminals developing in Black inner-city neighborhoods. Youth were being influenced by others in the neighborhood and raised with violent inclinations. DiIluio thought this generation would spawn the worst criminals to ever exist.

Superpredators never materialized and violent crime levels went down. In 1993, 7.4% of urban residents were victims of violent crime, but the percentage declined throughout the 90s, and in 2016 it was 3%. Researchers don’t completely trust these numbers—they think that many violent crimes aren’t reported. But even taking that into account, **the numbers are a far cry from the idea that Black neighborhoods are perpetually and inherently violent.**

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Bodily Racism

Ibram had internalized, complicated, contradictory feelings about bodily racism growing up. In ninth grade, he went to a high school in central Queens that had a large population of Black, Asian, and Latinx students, and Ibram was scared of the other Black kids. There were some legitimately scary Black kids at his school, such as Smurf, who beat up kids on the bus and once pulled a gun on Ibram. Ibram defused the situation by telling Smurf he wasn’t scared and complimenting the weapon. Smurf bullied other people too, and Ibram was never brave enough to step in, which he regrets to this day.

However, a good portion of the time, Ibram’s fears of other Black people were unfounded. If he accidentally bumped into someone in the hall or walked through a group of crew members, nothing happened. **The disinterested teachers, overcrowding, and large class sizes were probably more dangerous than the students.**

Ibram’s parents also worried about other Black people. They didn’t like it when Ibram played basketball at neighborhood courts⁠—they worried he’d get shot⁠—and Ibram’s father eventually built a court in the backyard.

At the same time, Ibram thought his neighborhood was safe enough. He knew it had certain dangers but he didn’t think it was a hellhole of violence, and he never connected the violence to Blackness.

### Colorism

“Light” and “Dark” refer to the varying skin colors of people of color. Light people have straighter hair and lighter skin, but they aren’t White. Dark people have bigger noses and lips, kinky hair, and darker skin. These two groups are made up of people from many nationalities, ethnicities, and races—membership is assigned based on physical appearance.

**Colorism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities between Light and Dark people, the main idea being the **belief Light people are superior to Dark people.** Sometimes Light people are lumped in with White people when needed to maintain majority.

Example #1: In 2007, sports commentator Don Imus said that Tennesse’s Light basketball players were cute while Rutger’s Dark ones were “nappy-headed hos.”

Example #2: White female students are half as likely to be suspended as Dark ones, but White and Light female students have the same likelihood of suspension.

**The truth is, there is no hierarchy of skin color.** No color is better, worse, or more or less beautiful than any other.

#### History and Invention of Colorism

In 1680, Morgan Godwyn wrote that Black people think as well of themselves as Europeans think of themselves. Enlightenment intellectuals tried to change this—Johan Joachim Winckelmann wrote that African Americans need to get it into their heads that beauty is White.

**Colorism in the US was popularized by Samual Stanhope Smith.** In 1787, he spoke to the American Philosophical Society about color. He said that domestic servants who worked closer to White people became more attractive—Lighter—and the people who worked in the fields and were farthest away had strange bodies and hair.

Slaveholders agreed that there was a color hierarchy. They thought that the Lighter an enslaved person was, the better they were, and the more they paid for them. Light people often worked in the house, while Dark people worked outside in the fields because slaveholders thought that Light people were more skilled. The hierarchy was White, Light, Dark, and then Animal. (However, some enslavers thought that “mulattos”—mixed-race people—were worse than Dark people.)

After emancipation in 1865, colorism lived on. **White communities tried to keep Black people, both Light and Dark, away from them, and Light people tried to keep Dark people away from them.** For example, in the 19th century, “Blue Vein” societies came into existence. These societies excluded anyone whose skin was too dark to see the blue of their veins through it. Light was a privilege that people wanted to keep.

Dark people didn’t want to associate with Light people either. Three rules came into effect:

  * **One-drop rule** —even the smallest percentage of Black heritage, a single drop of blood, makes you Black. White people have historically followed this rule to keep Light people out of their group.
  * **Two-drop rule** —a little bit of White heritage makes you not as Black as Dark Black people. Black people have used this rule to keep Light people out of their group.
  * **Three-drop rule** —a little bit more Black heritage means you’re Dark. Light people have used this rule to keep Dark people out of their group.



In 1920, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote that Black people had gotten past colorism. He changed his mind when he met a biracial man named Walter White. White had blue eyes and blond hair, was pro-assimilation, and allegedly believed than non-biracial Black people were inferior.

**Getting Lighter—to the point where you could pass as White or Light—became an industry.** Black men used hair gel called congolene to straighten their hair, which made it look more similar to Light people’s hair. Skin lightening products became popular in 1938.

For a brief period in the early 1970s during the Black Power movement, Dark people embraced their natural hair, but the quest for Lightness returned in the 1980s. Looking Light had advantages—for example, Light people had higher incomes than Dark people.

##### Post-Racial Beauty Ideal

**The post-racial beauty ideal is Lightness.** Lightness is racially ambiguous but includes things like lighter eye color, straighter hair, thinner noses, and medium buttocks and lips. These qualities are similar to the White beauty ideal, however, according to surveys, people think tanned skin, which looks like Light skin, is more attractive than Dark or pale skin.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Colorism

As an undergraduate at Florida A&M University (FAMU), Ibram faced his dueling consciousness when it came to his appearance. He wore cornrows, which embraced his Darkness. Cornrows made racists think he was a thug, but he didn’t care. He also wore light-colored contact lenses. At the time, he didn’t think the contacts were an attempt to be Whiter or Lighter—he wore them because he thought they made him cuter. He never reflected on why he thought lighter eyes were cuter.

##### Dating

The first woman Ibram dated at FAMU was Light. All of Ibram’s friends at FAMU preferred Light women and treated them differently from Dark women. Ibram felt uncomfortable about liking a Light woman—he was afraid he was conforming to the colorist beauty standard—so he broke up with her and planned to date only Dark women. Although he was trying not to be colorist, this promise to himself to only date Dark women was a form of colorism, too—he’d flipped the hierarchy, but he was still assigning superiority to one color over another.
