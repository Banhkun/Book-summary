## Part 3: How to Be Antiracist | Chapter 8: Activism

In Parts 1-2, we looked at what racism is and its various forms. Race may have been a made-up power construct, but its various iterations still very much affect us today. Part 3 covers how we can strive to be antiracist.

Chapter 8 covers some of the activism techniques antiracists have used to try to create an antiracist society.

### Identification of the Problem

To work towards ending racism, you have to treat the cause, not the symptoms. Many people think that racism is caused by ignorance and hate, but as we’ve learned in previous chapters, in fact, it’s actually caused by self-interest and policy. The ignorance and hate come later.

Therefore, **any attempt to end racism that starts by addressing ignorance and hate instead of the root cause is never going to be successful.** For example, mentoring programs might help individuals, but no behavioral program will have an effect on policy.

While racist power is very flexible—it will use whatever strategy is most effective—**historically, antiracists have tried the same strategies over and over again, even though they’ve never worked and will never work** because they focus in the wrong place.

According to Ibram, **activism seeks power and creates policy change.** Changing minds and critiquing doesn’t count as activism.

### Suasion

Suasion—trying to persuade people not to be racist—was and still is a popular method for fighting racism, even though it’s doomed to fail because it doesn’t address policy.

#### Uplift Suasion

**Uplift suasion is the idea that Black people can teach White people not to be racist by behaving exceptionally.** For example, free Black people thought that if they set a good example, White people would free other enslaved Black people.

Uplift suasion, in addition to being an ineffective method for fighting racism, comes with some problematic ideas:

  * It suggests that White criticisms of Black behavior are valid.
  * It puts the responsibility on everyone except White people to change their racist ideas.
  * It excuses Black people in positions of power from trying to change policy. According to uplift suasion, just having reached a position of power is exceptional.
  * It’s doomed to fail because no one is perfect all the time.
  * It gives weight to the idea that any Black person who behaves well is unusual because regular Black people all behave badly.
  * It doesn’t allow Black people to be themselves.



**Early White abolitionists gave free Black people this idea, and it resurfaced in Ibram’s generation.** For example, when Ibram was on a date with Sadiqa at a restaurant that had a Buddha statue, a drunk White man fondled the statue. Sadiqa said that she was glad the man wasn’t Black. Ibram had had this kind of thought before and they talked about it. If the man had been Black, Sadiqa would have been embarrassed because he made the whole race look bad in front of White people. As a result, White people would become more racist.

**But uplift suasion didn’t work pre-Civil War and it doesn’t work now either.**

#### Moral/Educational Suasion

**Moral/education suasion is the idea that White people are only racist because they don’t know any better.** Like uplift suasion, the responsibility falls on Black people to change White people’s ideas. Moral suasion is supposed to appeal to White people’s consciences and educational suasion is supposed to appeal to their intellect.

Moral/educational suasion, in addition to being an ineffective method for fighting racism, comes with some problems:

  * Racist policymakers, not the average White person, are the problem. There’s a good chance they’re already aware of the racism their policies cause—the policies might even be designed to create racism, if that racism furthers self-interest.
  * Not everyone has a conscience or morals.
  * Racist ideas are illogical, so appealing to conscience or intellect is ineffective.



**There are instances in history in which moral/educational suasion appeared to be effective. However, in most cases, changes in policy weren’t created by suasion—they were a result of self-interest.**

For example, some people consider that educational suasion was effective because it resulted in the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, and desegregation rulings. However, these changes weren’t caused by educational suasion. They were created by self-interest—US foreign relations were suffering because visiting African diplomats experienced racist abuse. The civil rights legislation mentioned above was created to soothe foreign relations, and once enough nations were soothed, progress stopped.

#### Incorrect Order of Operations

**Uplift, moral, and education suasion all suggest that racist policy can only be changed _after_ racist ideas have changed. However, this order of operations is ineffective** because antiracist policies benefit everyone, and it’s easier to get people to change their ideas once they’ve seen the benefits of policy change. (And they’ve seen that none of the negative consequences racist policymakers warn about have come to pass.)

There are several examples of policy changing first and ideas changing in response, once people see that the policy change was beneficial for everyone:

  * Policies around desegregated schools changed in the 1950s and 1960s, and only later did White people support the change.
  * Policy around interracial marriage changed in 1967, but most White people didn’t support it until later.
  * Obamacare was implemented in 2010 and is far more supported now.



### Demonstrate vs. Protest, Mobilize vs. Organize

Demonstrations and protests are another technique for fighting racism. Though the terms are often used interchangeably, they don’t mean the same thing.

**A protest has the end goal of getting a racist policy changed.** Protests involve organizing people and take place over a long period of time.

The best protests create situations where changing policy is in racist powers’ best interests. For example, if teachers are on strike and racist power needs them to resume work, racist power might give the teachers raises. It’s hard to create situations like this, of course, because racist power tries to make the most threatening protests illegal.

**A demonstration aims to raise awareness about a problem.** Demonstrations involve mobilizing people in a particular place for a short period of time. Demonstrations aren’t as effective as protests because they only force change when power can’t deal with bad press, such as near election time. Most of the time, demonstrations don’t do anything except annoy racist power.

The best demonstrations help people become antiracist and emotionally support protests. For example, while Black women were boycotting buses in Montgomery, Alabama, they were supported by nighttime rallies.

### Ibram’s Experiences With Activism

In 2007, Black students stood under the “White tree” in Jena, Louisiana. The next day, White students had hung nooses in the tree. This sparked racist violence that eventually led to six Black students, the “Jena 6,” beating up a White student. One of the students was charged as a juvenile and the others were charged with attempted murder. The district attorney wanted to send them to prison for 100 years.

In response to this, **Ibram came up with a plan to free the Jena 6 that he presented at a Black Student Union meeting.** He called it the 106 Campaign, and it involved two phases. The first was to recruit 106 students on 106 campuses to rally and fundraise for a legal defense fund. The second phase was to organize all these students into a car caravan that would disrupt traffic in Washington, D.C. and force the president to work on the Louisiana governor, who would work on the local Jena government.

One woman asked if the car caravans were illegal, and others were scared of being towed or of police response. Ibram ignored their fears and kept outlining the plan. He said that they could go to prison, but they should be fine with that because their cause was important.

**Ibram thought he was being radical, but what he was really doing was scaring people off. The Black Student Union officers voted down his plan.** At the time, he thought they were ignorant—he was committed to educational suasion and thought the other students were the problem, not him. He later realized that although his ideas _sounded_ radical, they weren’t. True radicalism changes the way people think and prompts real change in the world, neither of which he was doing.

The new, less risky plan was to demonstrate on campus and to fundraise for legal defense. The demonstrations didn’t have a large effect—the very next day after the demonstrations, the judge denied one of the six bail. This was hard on the demonstrators—if nothing causes change, what’s the point? **However, the fundraising _was_ effective—the new defense attorneys managed to get all of the six pleading guilty to simple battery, and no one went to jail.**
