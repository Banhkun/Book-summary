## Exercise: Identify Your Bodily Racist Ideas

Bodily racism includes the idea that people of certain races are more animal-like or dangerous than those of other races.

* * *

Think about the last time you saw a person who was a different race than you at a distance. What was your first instinctive impression of them? Did they seem bigger or stronger than you, or smaller and weaker? Did you feel the need to do a particular action, such as cross the street to avoid getting close to them?

Where do you think this impression or instinct came from? (From experiences with people of that race, from culture, from the media, and from something else?

Thinking back on the encounter, do you think your first impression was accurate? Why or why not?
