## Chapter 2: Later Development of English

We’ve seen how invasions from the Angles, Saxons, Vikings, and Normans helped to form the basic structure of the English language. In this chapter, we’ll look at more recent developments in the history of the language that made it into the language we know today. These later developments helped give English the richness, variety, and adaptability that helped transform it from a local language into a global one.

### Shakespeare: Elevating the Language

**No writer took greater advantage of the incredible flexibility and richness of the English language than Shakespeare**. In the late-16th and early-17th centuries, the Bard of Avon alone added some 2,000 words to the language, like _mimic_ , _bedroom_ , _lackluster_ , _hobnob._ He also introduced a whole host of new phrases that we still use today, like “one fell swoop” and “in my mind’s eye” owe their origins to Shakespeare. He reshaped English, showcasing its extraordinary possibilities as a language of literature. Although academic works by English authors continued to be written in French and Latin, Shakespeare made a remarkable contribution to the standardization and exaltation of the English language.

### The Great Vowel Shift

**Perhaps the most famous change in the morphology and pronunciation of a language that we can trace through the historical record is the Great Vowel Shift.** This was a change in the pronunciation of English vowels that began in the late Middle Ages and continued into the early modern era, running roughly from 1400-1600 CE. The pronunciation of vowels began moving closer to the front of the mouth. The word _life_ , for example, was pronounced _lafe_ in Shakespeare’s time, with the vowel lodged further back in the throat. The Great Vowel Shift changed it to the pronunciation we have today.

We know a great deal about how these shifts in pronunciation were occurring (even long before the days of audio recording) through our study of rhymes and poetry. Shakespeare forms rhymes using _knees_ and _grease_ as couplets, as well as _grass_ and _grace_. Their placement in verse indicates that these words must have rhymed in his day, even though they wouldn’t in modern pronunciation.

Interestingly, this was the era in which Englishmen were beginning to colonize North America. The American descendants of English settlers in New England and Virginia were thus cut off from the great linguistic developments taking place back in the British Isles. **Early American speech thus preserved many relics and vestiges of Elizabethan English that had long since died out in the mother country.** One example is the _er_ sound in a word like _mercy_ , which was pronounced like _marcy_ by Elizabethan Britons (with the _a_ sound being further back in the throat). This pronunciation survived in parts of the United States well into the 19th century, hundreds of years after its virtual extinction in England.

### The Evolution of English Spelling

These shifts in pronunciation led to strange divergences between how words were spelled and how they were pronounced. The troublesome orthography (the set of conventions for writing) of English can still be seen in words like _debt_ , _know_ , _knead_ , and _colonel_ , with their silent letters, as well as their hidden, but pronounced letters. How did these divergences come to be?

The Normans had noticed the unusual orthography of English quickly after taking control of the country. We see this in the _Domesday Book_ , a remarkable 11th-century survey of English property holdings that William I commissioned in order to help him tax and administer his new conquest. In the _Domesday Book_ , we see multiple spellings for various place-names throughout the country. The Normans complicated this already-complicated picture by superimposing certain conventions of their own spelling into the orthography of their new conquest, introducing the letters _z_ and _g_ for example.

As we’ve seen with pronunciation and the Great Vowel Shift, **sometimes the spelling conventions of one region of England won out over the whole county** , regardless of pronunciation. Thus, some words might be spelled the way they were spelled in the East Midlands, but pronounced the way they were spoken in Yorkshire. For much of the history of the language, words defied standard spelling, with even Shakespeare offering a bewildering array of different and inconsistent spellings for the same words throughout his works.

This unruly spelling even governed (or failed to govern) how people spelled their own names. Even famous and highly literate figures like Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Oliver Cromwell did not spell their own names consistently.

#### The Printing Press

**The first steps toward spelling standardization began with the invention of the printing press in the 15th century** and the gradual spread of written works (and thus, literacy) throughout England. By 1640, there were over 20,000 titles available in English, more than there had ever been. The printing industry became highly profitable and naturally centered itself in the nation’s commercial, cultural, and political capital—London.

And as printed works produced by London printers began to spread across the country, local London spelling conventions gradually began to supplant local variations. As with the Great Vowel Shift, the sheer weight of London’s gravity was decisive. By the dawn of the 18th century, English had become far more unified in its spelling than it had just a generation before.

What this also meant was that **old _spellings_ became fixed just as many word _pronunciations_ were shifting.** Consequently, our inheritance is a written language with many words spelled the way they were pronounced 400 years ago. Such spellings often bear little resemblance to how the words are actually spoken. This accounts for many of the silent letters in words like _knight_ and _aisle_ , which used to be pronounced more phonetically than they are today.

#### Attempts at Formal Standardization

**The incongruity of spelling and pronunciation led some notable public figures to champion more robust efforts at spelling standardization and simplification** by the end of the 18th century. These figures included American Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, famed lexicographer Noah Webster (who actually advocated legal consequences for improper spelling), industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, US President Theodore Roosevelt, and author Mark Twain. By the late 19th century, spelling reform groups like the American Philological Association even began to lobby for new spellings like _tho_ , _wisht_ , and _hav_ in an effort to simplify American English spelling and have it more closely align with pronunciation

These groups decried the irrationality of spelling. After all, what good reason was there to call the money you owe to someone else a _debt_ rather than a _det?_ Leaders of this time belonged to the Progressive Era, which focused on efficiency and rationality and saw little need to pay deference to outdated custom and tradition. Why should they respect the hoary old conventions of English spelling?

#### The Difficulties of Spelling Reform

Despite the great passion and energy poured into spelling reform efforts, however, they mostly failed in their mission. Language is such a fluid and organic tool, used differently by so many people and susceptible to innumerable internal and external influences, that **it is quite impossible for some centrally directed body to impose reforms top-down**.

The pretensions of political and cultural leaders notwithstanding,**the development and evolution of language has always been a bottom-up process**. Two hundred years ago, people spelled _shoppe_ and _musick_. No state mandate ordered people to change the way these words were spelled—on their own, people took the initiative to drop the unnecessary letters from them.

Today, we are used to the non-phonetic spellings of words like _bread_. It would be deeply strange and unnatural for us to write _bred._ And of course, _bred_ is itself a word, which would merely create confusion. _Bread_ and _bred_ are homophones, words that sound the same but are spelled differently. The high number of homophones in English gives the non-phonetic spellings of many words a useful purpose. Thus can we distinguish _might_ from _mite_ , _great_ from _grate_ , and _sure_ from _shore_. Perhaps our spelling isn’t so irrational after all.

### Grammar Police

The organic and sometimes haphazard evolution of English has led some figures to call for the establishment of a central body to create rules about and regulate the usage of the language. Such bodies do exist in other languages. The Académie Française, founded by Cardinal Richelieu in the 17th century, still serves as the official body regulating proper usage of the French language (how seriously its rules are taken by actual Francophones is another matter). English men of letters like John Dryden, Daniel Defoe, and Jonathan Swift believed that English might benefit from the establishment of such an academy.

But this idea was also greeted with hostility by opponents like the great lexicographer Samuel Johnson, US President Thomas Jefferson, and theologian Joseph Priestley, all of whom argued that **an “official” authority on English would inhibit the evolution of the language, exert an overly conservative and stodgy influence on usage, and freeze the language at a particular point in time**. Ultimately, no “English Academy” was established.

Many celebrate this outcome as a positive development for the language, one that freed it from being saddled with a set of cumbersome and inflexible rules imposed by an elitist and out-of-touch body. In the absence of an official organization, English has relied upon informal and self-appointed grammarians and lexicographers to define its rules.

These figures write books and give lectures on proper or standard usage of the language, but they are usually ignored by the vast majority of the population. Even high-profile elites in the worlds of academia, politics, and culture frequently misuse words (confusing _flout_ with _flaunt_ , as US President Jimmy Carter once did in a televised address) or use technically improper forms of the language (splitting an infinitive as in the _Star Trek_ phrase “to boldly go” instead of the more proper “to go boldly”).

Many of the rules of English we observe today are the **arbitrary creations of self-appointed authorities who lived centuries ago and offered little or no rationale for the rules they promulgated**. The 18th-century English clergyman and amateur grammarian Robert Lowth is a good example of such a figure. It is to Lowth that we owe many of the arbitrary rules of usage that we see in style guides and textbooks all over the English-speaking world such as not ending a sentence with a preposition, the prohibition against double negatives like “I don’t want no potatoes,” and the subtle, but different meanings of _between_ and _among_.

Other grammar police of the time and of later ages declared that it was unacceptable to combine Greek and Latin root words into a single new word, and so railed against words like _petroleum_(combining the Latin _petro_ and the Greek _oleum_). These **deeply silly and pretentious dictums rested upon no logic or reason and ignored centuries of real-world use** in England and her colonies by both ordinary people and the great English writers of the time.

#### Bias and Prejudice

**In some cases, it would seem that the practitioners of “bad” grammar have it quite right**. Why is “you was” invalid and “you were” correct? _Was_ is a singular form of the verb “to be” in all other cases (e.g., “she was,” “he was,” “I was”) while _were_ is plural in all other cases (“they were,” “we were”), so it would make sense that the singular _you_ and __ the __ singular _was_ would go together. It’s completely understandable why speakers new to English routinely make the mistake, because the convention makes absolutely no sense.

Unfortunately,**many of these rules come down to simple prejudice and bias rather than logic**. The traditional speech of poorer and more marginalized groups tends to be castigated and stigmatized, while that of elites tends to be enshrined as the “official” and “proper” form of the language. This is despite the fact that the proper form of the language is no more consistent or logical than the improper form, and often considerably less so.

(Shortform note: These issues of class and privilege as they relate to language remain contentious flashpoints up to the modern day. In 1996, for example, the Oakland Unified School District passed a resolution recognizing the legitimacy of African-American Vernacular English and mandated some level of school instruction in this vernacular. This met with great hostility—much of it racial in character—from critics, who argued that the resolution was degrading the English language by elevating improper and illegitimate forms of it.)

### Early Lexicographers

Although efforts to codify official rules of English have met with little success, **English has succeeded in producing the greatest and most comprehensive dictionaries to be found in any language**. The early ones were produced not by committees of academics, but by eccentric oddballs who were driven by a relentless passion for words.

Britain’s most famous lexicographer was Samuel Johnson. Despite unusual spellings (he retained a fondness for the unnecessary Anglo-Saxon _k_ in words like _musick_), some incorrect definitions, and occasionally overly inflated prose, his 1735 _Dictionary of the English Language_ remains a masterpiece of English literature. He was the most significant figure since Shakespeare to truly capture the beauty and richness of the language.

The most comparable figure in America was Noah Webster, working in the early 19th century. Webster himself was widely regarded as unpleasant, exceedingly self-regarding, pompous, officious, and absurdly boastful (he boasted of speaking 23 languages, a claim that was almost certainly untrue). Moreover, much of his lexicographical work was derivative of (if not outright plagiarized from) the works of those who came before him.

Despite his arguably unsavory personal character, **Webster’s English dictionary was the most thorough of its day, with over 70,000 words catalogued**. Driven by a fierce patriotic pride in his young nation and a conviction that American English was just as worthy of exhalation as British English, Webster did contribute to some of the distinctive features and pronunciations of the language on his side of the Atlantic.

Some of his more notable innovations include the American pronunciation of _aluminum_ , and the dropping of unnecessary _l’s_ in words like _traveler_ and _jeweler_. Unfortunately for Webster himself, he profited little from his dictionary during his lifetime. It was only after his death in 1843 that two businessmen named Charles and George Merriam purchased the rights to the book, heavily edited it, and republished it as the famous Merriam-Webster’s dictionary, after which it became a bestseller and household name.

### The Oxford English Dictionary

**The crown jewel of all English dictionaries is the _Oxford English Dictionary (OED)_**. Originally published in 1884, the OED set out not only to list and define every word used in the English language since the 12th century, but also to trace their etymologies and evolving meanings and spellings throughout history. It was an extraordinary intellectual undertaking. The man tasked with overseeing the compilation and publication of the _OED_ was James Augustus Henry Murray. **The effort by Murray and his team covered half a dozen volumes, over 6,400 pages, and took over four decades to complete.**

Murray enlisted an army of amateur philologists to help him with the Herculean task, including the prolific bibliophile James Platt, who was said to have read 100 languages and claimed to read a complete book each day; and the eccentric American Dr. W.C. Minor, who made most of his contributions to the _OED_ from within the confines of a hospital for the criminally insane, where he had been sent after committing a murder while suffering from paranoid delusions. The final volume of the _OED_ wasn’t even published until 1928, more than a decade after Murray’s death.

With nearly half a million word entries, **the _OED_ was a staggering intellectual achievement, one of the greatest pieces of scholarship in world history.** Nothing comparable exists in another language. The _OED_ is as close to a complete roadmap of a language as we have. Thanks to it, and to the remarkable efforts of the individuals who created it (and still update it to this day), we know more about the history of English than we do about any other language.

(Shortform note: The _OED_ today contains over 615,000 entries. It’s updated quarterly, with new words being added every three months. In March 2020, some of the new additions included _coulrophobia_ , _man hug_ , and _pronoid_.)
