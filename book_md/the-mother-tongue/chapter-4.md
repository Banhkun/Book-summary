## Chapter 4: English Beyond England

So far, we’ve explored the history of the English language mostly as it pertained to its original home—the British Isles. We’ve seen how these historical processes gave rise to a language that is notable for its malleability and adaptability, able to be written and spoken in a wide variety of ways.

In this chapter, we’re going to take our survey of the language _beyond_ the British Isles. We’ll explore how American English came into existence, diverged from British English, and developed its own unique characteristics. Then, we’ll examine how English has evolved as a global language.

### The Legacy of the British Empire

English became a world language in large part through the political and economic power of the British Empire.

(Shortform note: At its peak in the early 20th century, the British Empire occupied nearly one-quarter of the world’s total land area and counted nearly proportion of the world’s people as its subjects.)

The British Empire exported the English language all over the globe. Very soon after the establishment of British colonies in far-flung territories, English quickly began to follow new developmental trajectories in these places. Indeed,**new twists on the English language developed with remarkable speed**. British visitors noted that Australians had developed their own unique English dialect (“Strine,” so named because of the way they pronounce the word _Australian_) just a few generations after their British ancestors colonized the continent.

The unique blend was aided by loanwords from the aboriginal peoples who inhabited the continent long before the arrival of white British settlers, as well as the astonishing array of new flora and fauna they encountered for which there were no existing words in English. Interestingly, Australian English today is more open to American influences than British English, sharing some common Yankee terminologies and spellings, like saying _mail_ instead of _post_ and spelling _labor_ instead of _labour_.

Some elements of **otherwise obscure English dialects have gone mainstream, largely due to the legacy of the British Empire**. The common American word _peek_ , as in “to take a peek,” was once confined to a small corner of East Anglia (most other English people would say _peep_ or _squint_), but because migrants from this region settled in the New World, the word got an unlikely new lease on life. Likewise, the ubiquitous American _yeah_ was, until the mid-20th century, an obscure local word used only in certain regions of southeast England.

### Divergence Between British and American English

Of course, we can’t discuss the evolution and influence of the English language without exploring the major role played by English as it’s spoken in the United States. **American English differs in many respects from British English**.

In Chapter 2, we saw how the first English settlers were arriving in the New World just as major linguistic changes like the Great Vowel Shift were sweeping the mother country. This was an immediate point of divergence between what would become the two main branches of the language.

Of course, this divergence was a long and slow historical process. **British English and American English once shared more in common with each other than they do today**. Soldiers fighting on opposite sides of the American Revolutionary War probably had similar pronunciations of words, although both sides likely sounded more like modern-day Americans than modern-day British (most 18th-century Englishmen still pronounced their _r_ ’s and used the flat _a_ in words like _bath_ and _path_).

### Hybrid English in the New World

The first English settlers in the Americas found themselves in a vastly different environment from the one they’d known, filled with plants and animals that didn’t exist in Europe. They needed to invent new words to describe the things they saw.

They often borrowed from the languages of the American Indians, creating anglicized words like _hickory_ , _squash_ , and _raccoon_. We also see this in place-names like Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Manhattan. They also drew upon words from earlier Spanish settlers, which had often themselves been adapted from the Indian originals by the Spanish. The English-Spanish hybrids include _bronco_ , _avocado_ , and _canyon_. Lastly, they sourced from the French, which we see in place-names like Illinois, Detroit, and New Orleans, as well as nouns like _chowder_ and _prairie_.

**Over time, English-speaking Americans developed their own unique vocabulary and pronunciations** , many of which became widely adopted in England, as well as in whole other languages. The ubiquitous _ok_ is maybe the best example, having worked its way into languages across every inhabited continent. Its history and origins are unclear, although linguists believe it may have arisen out the ironic wordplay of early 19th century American jokesters. Around this time, some well-educated young people in American cities led a fad of creating acronyms for deliberately misspelled phrases—thus, “ok” came from “oll korrect,” meaning “all correct.”

### Local Dialects of the United States

The United States is a far more heterogeneous society than the United Kingdom, with a far shorter history. The sheer geographic size of the country, moreover, dwarfs that of the UK. People come to America from all over the world, and no one’s ancestors have been in America as long as many people’s ancestors have been in Britain. **The influence of speech and language from other parts of the world is much more immediate and recent in America** and is spread over a vastly greater geographical area.

Given this, one might assume a far greater variety of American speech than actually exists. After all, we saw in

Chapter 3 how much speech variability there is in England, which is much smaller (both in terms of geography and population) and more ethnically homogenous than the United States.

But linguists have found the opposite to be the case—American speech is remarkably homogenized, to such an extent that speakers on the East and West Coasts (roughly 3,000 miles apart) speak with virtually indistinguishable accents. Of course, regional accents _do_ exist, as anyone who has been in northern New England or the Deep South can attest.

In 1949, Professor Hans Kurath divided the US into **four basic speech groups: Southern, New England, Northern, and Midland** , though regional subgroups exist within these categories. Kurath also observed that the main dividing lines in American speech ran east to west, with accents becoming more homogeneous and unified the further west one went. The “borders” between these speech groups are fluid, imprecisely defined, and run across vast stretches of the continental US, but they describe the variety of American speech reasonably well.

The speech groups feature differences in pronunciation and word choice. New Yorkers call sugary, carbonated soft drinks _soda_ , while Midwesterners call it _pop_. Californians are known for adding the definite article before the numbers of interstate highways, talking about “ _the_ 101” or “ _the_ 80,” which is not seen in other regions of the country. Famously, southerners elongate and drawl their vowels, while New Englanders shorten and clip theirs, rendering words like _park_ as _pak_. Certain words like _balm_ , _bomb_ , _caught_ , and _cot_ are great signifiers and can tell you easily where someone is from based on how they pronounce them.

The Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) records over **100,000 variations in the pronunciation and terminology for different words across the US** , indicating that there is perhaps far greater linguistic variation in America than Kurath originally observed. This is especially true when one considers the enormous racial and ethnic diversity of the United States, which adds a whole other layer to how English is spoken in the country (DARE under-sampled African-Americans in its initial language survey).

#### The American Linguistic Melting Pot

As we’ve seen, **the language became _more_ homogenous across the vast tracts of the United States**, populated by people from all across the globe, than in much-smaller and more ethnically homogenous England.

To be sure, there was an explosion of immigration to the US beginning in the mid-19th century and continuing well into the first two decades of the 20th century. This created ethnic and linguistic enclaves all over the country, with Pennsylvania Dutch speakers in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania; Germans in Midwestern cities like St. Louis and Chicago; Italian- and Yiddish-speaking neighborhoods in New York City; and speakers of Scandinavian languages in the states of the Upper Midwest.

**But over time, American speech patterns did not diverge; instead, they converged.** The movement of people within the US created a linguistic melting pot of intermingling, which homogenized speech patterns. As time went on, people faced social pressures to conform to “normal” American speech, especially the children of immigrants, who faced even stronger pressure to shed the accents and idioms of their parents.

#### The Myth of Antiquated Americanisms

It is sometimes said that the physical isolation of certain regions of the US, like the remote communities of parts of the Appalachians, has preserved antiquated dialects of English that date back to Elizabethan times. And it is true that many conventionally “hillbilly” expressions like _consarn it_ and _afeared_ bear the stamp of 16th-century England.

But to say that rural West Virginians are some sort of holdover from that era is to grossly overstate the case. The region wasn’t settled until long after the Elizabethan Age and it was never as isolated from outside influences as these theories suggest.

### American Influence and Resistance

**American English has exerted its own influence on British English** , with American words like _teenager_ and _commuter_ becoming commonplace in the British vocabulary. Indeed, most of the new words introduced into the language since independence have come from the American side of the Atlantic. British language purists have sometimes reacted to this influence with hostility and suspicion, treating it as a hostile foreign invasion and bastardization of their native tongue. Samuel Johnson—whose work as one of the great early lexicographers of English we explored in Chapter 2—reserved particular contempt for Americans and the American dialect of English, believing it to be nothing more than a crude and inferior facsimile of the superior original.

Figures like Johnson even fumed against words they wrongly believed to be Americanisms, like _jeopardy_ and _smolder_ , not knowing that these words had well-established roots in the British Isles. Many Americans of the time bought into these British notions of American linguistic inferiority, with newspaper editors in New York sometimes refusing to print words that they believed lacked proper credentials on the other side of the Atlantic.

But despite the prejudice,**America has continued to work its will on the mother tongue, especially as the reach of US media and Hollywood films has extended around the world**. American idioms like _don’t have_ are replacing _haven’t got_ in Britain, while _truck_ is gradually edging out the more uniquely British _lorry_. We can also see this in British spelling, as the _u_ in _humour_ and _colour_ is slowly becoming extinct in the UK.

Despite the convergence of the two dialects and the steady Americanization of British English, substantial differences remain between the two main branches of the language. In everyday speech, there are still some 40,000 words that are used differently in the US and the UK.

### English’s Competitive Advantage

We’ve seen the rise and spread of American English. Now, we need to take our study of English a step further and explore**the phenomenon of English as a world language**.

There are five important features of the language that make it easy for non-native speakers all over the world to adopt it. These features give English a competitive advantage over other languages.

  1. **English is relatively easy to spell,** with many spellings closely matching the phonetic pronunciation. While this, of course, does not make English “superior” to any other language, it may give it a slight advantage in its worldwide adoption, because it is generally easier to learn to read and write.
  2. **English does not have gendered nouns** like the Romance languages or tonal variations that can drastically alter meaning, like Chinese. 
  3. **English has few pronouns, suffixes, and prefixes whose proper use depends on the relative social standing of the speaker and the listene** r. For example, there is no English equivalent of the informal _tú_ form or formal _usted_ form used in Spanish.
  4. **The sentence structure of English is highly flexible** , allowing the same idea to be expressed in multiple ways—an active sentence like, “I kicked the ball” has the same meaning as the passive sentence “The ball was kicked by me.” Many other languages do not have this capability. 
  5. **English has mostly uninflected verbs with stable consonant** s (in other words, these verbs are mostly the same regardless of gender, tense, case, and mood). 



#### The Benefits of a Phonetic Alphabet

Moreover,**English is based on a phonetic alphabet.** **That is, the written characters correspond to particular sounds**. This is a great advantage and makes writing and pronouncing words simple, because there are only so many sounds that can be represented by the letters. It limits the number of characters that comprise the writing system.

The same cannot be said for many languages of the Far East, like Chinese and Japanese. They have a pictographic-ideographic system, in which the characters represent not _sounds_ , but _things_ or _ideas_. And there are far more things and ideas than there are sounds, which saddles the script with a baffling array of characters. In standard Chinese, there are over 50,000 characters (compared to the mere 26 of our Roman alphabet).

English is also not saddled with diacritical symbols like accent marks, umlauts, macrons, and breves, all of which subtly transform the pronunciation of written words. It also tends to leave intact the spellings and pronunciations of words like _garage_ and _buffet_ that are borrowed from other languages, instead of aggressively anglicizing them, which further assists those unfamiliar to the language.

### Global English

These features of English played a critical role in facilitating the spread of the language across every continent. While Mandarin Chinese certainly can boast more _fluent_ speakers than English, its _influence_ is far more constricted to a particular geographic area. **The reach of English, meanwhile, is simply unmatched**. It is an official language in 59 countries, a higher figure than for any other language. Of course, not everyone in these countries actually speaks English (many in the US and the UK don’t) but its widespread reach can’t be denied.

Moreover, it is the international language of advanced fields like science, business, and diplomacy. It has become what Latin was to the Roman world and French was to Early Modern Europe—a common denominator, a language that binds peoples and nations.

#### Foreign Adoption and Adaptability

We saw earlier how, even in its earliest stages, English was highly flexible in accepting new words from Norse and Norman French. The process also works the other way around—**English words are readily adopted by other languages, often with only slight modifications to fit the native tongue**.

The Japanese, in particular, are adept at adapting English words into their notoriously difficult and inaccessible language. These are known as _wasei-eigo_ , or “Japanese-made-English.” Thus, _smart_ became _sumato_ , _rush hour_ became _rushawa_ , _idol_ became _aidoru_ , and so on. Despite the differences between the two languages, Japanese has readily welcomed English words, with 20,000 estimated to have been adopted.

### Resistance to English

While we English speakers may flatter ourselves by thinking that the world has rolled out the welcome mat for English because of some innate superiority of the language, this is hardly the case. Speakers of other languages have done so because**it is convenient, advantageous, and expedient to have a working knowledge of English**. The residual historical legacy of the British Empire, plus the emergence of the United States as a global superpower played a major role in rendering English the global _lingua franca_.

Yet even within countries that have high levels of English proficiency, people are still quite proud of their native languages and wish to preserve them. If the Japanese have welcomed English influences with open arms, the French have tried (often unsuccessfully) to maintain a healthy distance. Official state commissions and acts of legislation have barred French people from using English words and phrases like _pipeline_ , _jet plane_ , and _hamburger_ , in an effort to maintain the “purity” of the language (although these measures are largely unenforceable and French authorities have seldom ever attempted to impose penalties on violators).

Indeed, many parts of the world view the English language itself as a symbol of western colonialism. This is especially true in countries, like India, that really _did_ experience occupation and colonization under the British Empire. Some Indian politicians have attempted to stamp out the use of English among the population, though without success, as there are still great economic benefits to having a large portion of the labor force fluent in such a universal language.
