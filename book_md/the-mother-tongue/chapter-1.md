## Chapter 1: The Origins of English

All human societies feature one crucial building block of social organization—language. The spoken and written word is what binds individuals together and helps us form stable communities. **In modern history, the English language has come to occupy a dominant position.**

(Shortform note: According to _The Economist_ , around 1.5 billion people across the globe speak English with at least some degree of proficiency, making it the world’s most-spoken language.)

At first glance, it might seem unlikely that the native tongue of a people occupying just one part of an island off the coast of northwestern Europe would become the international language of business and diplomacy. To understand how this came to be, we need to understand the history of English and the processes by which it evolved into the language we speak and write today. **What are the origins of English? What are the characteristics of the language that made it easier for people all over the globe to adopt and spread it? What quirks and features of English make it unique? And what is the future of the language?**

But before we can explore the history of how the English language came to be, we need to have some understanding of the processes by which _all_ languages develop.

### Origins of Language

Human language probably began with prehistoric Cro-Magnon man and became more complex with the arrival of _Homo sapiens_ tens of thousands of years ago. The bigger brains of _Homo sapiens_ likely helped the development and sophistication of language, which, in turn, provided an evolutionary advantage for _Homo sapiens_ over other hominids because it made communication and social cohesion a lot easier. The precise mechanisms by which humans first created language are unknown, though some linguists think that onomatopoeia (words like _boom_ or _clap_ that phonetically mimic the sounds they describe) may have played a role in catalyzing the process, as humans would have sought a way to communicate the natural sounds they heard.

Some of the most interesting and insightful work on language origins has been done through the study of how children first learn and acquire it. Noam Chomsky observed that even **newborn infants seem to possess some innate understanding of language** and a basic template for how words are supposed to be ordered and sequenced. For example, before they turn two, most children seem to grasp the difference between stative (“I like bananas”) and non-stative verbs (“I am liking bananas”) and rarely ever make this grammatical mistake again.

#### The Indo-European Language Family

Linguists have discovered that many of the languages spoken in Europe and Asia today, as well as many languages of the ancient world, belong to**one great Indo-European family of languages**. There are even linkages between languages separated by vast reaches of space, like the Basque spoken in some parts of Spain and certain Native American languages.

**Linguists have yet to discover a single master Indo-European parent language or identify the precise geographical area where it may have originated**. They believe that languages became differentiated and unique once the original tribal group began to spread out across the Eurasian landmass between 2,500 and 3,500 BCE, giving rise to languages across an area stretching from the Scottish Highlands to Sri Lanka.

#### The Legacy of Rome

Latin, perhaps the most famous language of the ancient world and the tongue of the Roman Empire, belongs to the Indo-European language family. The spread of the Empire across most of Europe kickstarted the historical processes that led to the Romance languages—those that have their roots in Latin—including French, Italian, Spanish, and Romanian.

**English is within the Germanic family of languages** (the West Germanic branch, to be precise), along with German and Dutch. English, although _not_ a Romance language, owes much of its origins to Latin and the Roman Empire.

### The Saxon Invasions

The story of English began when Germanic peoples known as the Angles and Saxons, hailing from what is now Northern Germany, began migrating to and conquering the Roman province of Britannia in the mid-5th century CE.

(Shortform note: This was happening during a period of great political turmoil, as the Western Roman Empire was crumbling under both internal pressures and waves of Germanic invasions. The last Roman troops vacated Great Britain around 410 CE, leaving the island exposed to invaders.)

**These Angles and Saxons brought their North Sea Germanic dialects to their new home**. The linguistic linkages between English and the dialects spoken in Northern Germany can still be detected today. They even gave their name to the new country—Angle-land, or England.

Different invading tribes settled in different regions of what is now England, lending their own unique linguistic stamp to different regions of the country. The echoes of this historical process of localized linguistic development can even be seen in the United States today, as different regions of North America were, in their turn, settled by people from different regions of the British Isles.

(Shortform note: _Albion’s Seed: Four British Folkways in North America_ by David Hackett Fischer explores this latter idea in greater detail, showing how migration to the Americas from different parts of Great Britain influenced the linguistic, social, economic, and political trajectories of different regions of what ultimately became the United States.)

These illiterate, war-like invaders certainly formed a stark contrast with the law-abiding, literate, and cultured Romano-British elite, who enjoyed a standard of living that would be unseen in the British Isles for nearly a millennium. Truly, the Dark Ages had arrived.

### Old English

**The proto-English spoken by the Angles and Saxons morphed over time into Old English**. Christian missionaries arrived in 597 and began the process of Christianizing the population (or, at least, the political elite of the country). The rise of a new priestly class that needed to be able to read and write in order to understand and teach the Bible aided in the spread of literacy and helped give Old English a written form.

Old English gradually supplanted the old Latin and Celtic influences in England. These latter linguistic traditions have left very little trace in modern England—astonishingly few English personal or place-names today have Latin or Celtic antecedents.

**Old English is largely unintelligible to speakers and readers of Modern English**. We can observe this by comparing lines of text. The Old English “Fæder ure şu şe eart on heofonum, si şin nama gehalgod” translates to the Modern English “Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name”—the opening lines of the Lord’s Prayer.

Despite the seemingly alien nature of Old English, it does have some similarities of structure and syntax to the language we speak and write today. Although influences from subsequent linguistic waves over the British Isles displaced much of the Old English language (only about 1 percent of our vocabulary can be traced to it) **some of our most fundamental words owe their origins to Old English** , particularly words related to family— _man_ , _wife_ , _child_ , _brother_ , and _sister_ , to name a few.

There was a great outpouring of Old English literature during the Anglo-Saxon period of English history. The Venerable Bede, a Northumbrian monk, was the first English historian and chronicler; Caedmon was the first English poet; and Alcuin was the first English scholar of international reputation, a leading figure at the court of Charlemagne. In addition to these, we have a rich trove of Old English letters, charters, and legal texts that point to the vibrancy of the language. Works like _Beowulf_ and _Caedmon’s Hymn_ are the starting points of English literature.

### The Vikings and the Scandinavian Influence

**From the 8th to the 10th centuries CE, the British Isles suffered a new wave of invasion and settlement**. This time, the invaders were Vikings from what are now the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Scholars are unclear as to why these invasions started when they did, but they left a profound and lasting influence on the English language. A political settlement with the Anglo-Saxon kings in the mid-9th century granted the Vikings a specified area in Northeastern England in which they could live and settle. This area was known as the Danelaw.

The linguistic stamp of the Danelaw can still be observed in England today, as the Viking invaders infused Old English with new loanwords taken from their Old Norse languages. Important words like _husband_ , _sky_ , and _leg_ can be dated back to the Viking Age.

(Shortform note: Many modern place-names in England are Scandinavian**.** Place-names like Grimsby, Derby, and others that end in “-by” are usually Viking-derived).

**The importation of Scandinavian words also made the Old English language more flexible** , because these words often _supplemented_ words that already existed in Old English instead of completely replacing them. This gave Old English a host of synonyms and doublets that allowed different words to be used to express slightly different ideas. Old English also absorbed syntax and grammatical structure from Old Norse, a testament to the language’s fluidity, even at this early stage in its development.

### The Norman Conquest

**In 1066, the Norman king William I conquered England and displaced the reigning Anglo-Saxon ruling elite**. The Normans were people from Normandy, in Northern France, themselves descended from Viking ancestors. The Norman Conquest, unlike the earlier Saxon and Viking invasions, was _not_ a mass migration. Instead, it was a replacement of one set of elites by another—the Old English _nobility_ was dispossessed and replaced by a new Anglo-Norman governing class, but life and language continued on normally for the vast majority of the English population.

Norman French, not English, was the language of the ruling elite in England for centuries after the Norman Conquest—after 1066, no English monarchs spoke English as their primary language until Henry IV’s coronation in 1399. The words imported into today’s English from Norman French distinctly show this social/linguistic split. It is no coincidence that the roughly 10,000 words that owe their origins to the Norman Conquest are disproportionately concentrated in subject matters like court (_duke_ , _baron_) and jurisprudence (_jury_ , _felony_), while words like _baker_ and _miller_ having to do with everyday life or ordinary trades are disproportionately Anglo-Saxon in origin.

Largely left to its own devices, English developed organically during the Middle Ages. The ruling Anglo-Norman elite took little notice of developments in English, because it was the language of commoners.

This was the era when English developed many of its more recognizable features, like uninflected verbs with stable consonants (inflection is a change in the form of a word, often the ending, to reflect different contexts like gender, mood, and tense). In English, however, verbs and other parts of speech tend to be the same regardless of these different contexts. As we shall see later, such developments were to prove greatly advantageous to English as it spread throughout the world.

### Medieval Developments

**By the mid-14th century, English had reasserted itself as a language of government and law** , likely due to the fact that the political links between England and France were severed over the course of the centuries. Moreover, we see a shift in the character of written English—Chaucer’s _Canterbury Tales_ is a clear departure from Old English. It is written in what we call Middle English, a form far more recognizable to modern readers.

**The biggest part of this change was the loss of inflection and gender, but other forms of simplification and unification were taking place**. For example, Old English had six noun endings to denote a plural, but only two survived into Middle and Modern English (“-s” as in _hands_ and “-en” as in _oxen_ , with the latter being extremely rare and used only for a handful of words). Verb forms were also being reduced, with fewer options to denote the tense of a word.

Although Medieval English dialects could vary widely even across short distances, **the language was becoming more standardized in the Late Middle Ages**. This had much to do with the influence of London. The relatively simple grammatical structure of the English dialect in this city as compared to other dialects, its large population, its role as the national seat of government and commerce, and its proximity to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge gave London English advantages that ensured its ultimate triumph over other, local forms of the language.

This was a long and uneven historical process—it didn’t happen all at once and it didn’t happen at the same speed everywhere. Vestigial irregular verbs (those whose conjugation does not follow the usual pattern remain in the language like _bear/bore_ and _wear/wore_. In addition, there are still parts of South Yorkshire in the north of England where archaic pronouns like _thee_ and _thou_ survive to this day. Lastly, non-English Celtic languages for a long time remained the primary mode of speech in the fringes of the British Isles, like Western Ireland, Wales, and Highland Scotland.
