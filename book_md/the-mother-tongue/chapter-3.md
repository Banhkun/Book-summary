## Chapter 3: Flexibility of English

We’ve seen how the English language, in its development and evolution over time, proved to be remarkably flexible and adaptable to innovations and influences from other languages. These characteristics gave English a versatility that would later be a major asset as it spread to nearly all corners of the globe. In this chapter, we’ll explore how variable and fluid English can be—in ways that can sometimes lead to real confusion.

### Complications of Versatility

For all the benefits of being a flexible and adaptable language,**English can sometimes be _too_ flexible**. Even simple words like _set_ or _fine_ can baffle speakers of other languages with their multiple meanings and contexts. Linguistic phenomena like polysemy—different meanings for a single word—are common (and confounding) properties of English. The language is also notorious for contronyms, words that appear the same but have multiple meanings that are the exact opposite—for example, _sanction_ can mean either to approve or to censure; _clip_ can mean either to bind or to detach.

Moreover, this same versatility can make English rules of grammar seem maddeningly arbitrary to non-native speakers. The subtle complexities of English can also bedevil even the most well-versed speakers. Even as ubiquitous a word as _what_ has far more meanings than you’d think—it takes the _OED_ a full five pages to define it.

Beyond grammar, **English spellings often bedevil non-native speakers, as well as those who’ve spoken the language their whole lives**. As we covered in the last chapter, pronunciation and spelling are frequently divergent. There are approximately 200 different ways of spelling all the different sounds in English (we’ll explore sounds in English in the next section). For example, the _sh_ sound can be spelled _sh_ as in mash; _ti_ as in _ration_ ;__ or _ss_ as in _session_. The _f_ sound, meanwhile can be spelled _f_ as _half_ or _gh_ as in _enough_.

Even the great lexicographers we met in the previous chapter failed to achieve a standard of uniform spelling. Spellings are not even fully standardized in works like _Webster’s New World Dictionary_ or the _American Heritage Dictionary_. Studies have shown that even college-level students frequently misspell words like _professor_ and _rhythm_ (ironically, _misspell_ itself is often written incorrectly, with spellers leaving out an extra _s_ or _i_).

#### Parts of Speech

Another compilation of English arising from its versatility is the variability of the parts of speech themselves.**In English, the parts of speech are quite loose and interchangeable.** Unlike those languages whose grammatical structures derived more from Latin, English mostly lacks hard and fast rules governing tense, split infinitives, or any number of thorny grammatical or syntactic issues. For example, many words serve as both verbs and nouns. You can take a _drive_ (noun) or _drive_ a car (verb); you can go to a _dance_ (noun) or you can _dance_ to the beat (verb). The “rules” governing which words are which parts of speech are largely arbitrary. They are what they are because of custom and historical usage, not because of any universally applied and immutable set of principles.

**Even the definition of what constitutes a sentence is fuzzy**. Nominally, a sentence has both a subject and a predicate clause, but even these most basic rules break down in common usage. Even though they don’t have both a subject and predicate, single- word questions or exclamations like “How?” or “What!” can be considered sentences because of the implied existence of unwritten or unspoken words.

Some of the chaotic structure of English is due to the fact that early grammarians sought to impose Latin rules on Old English—a West Germanic language whose structure bore little relation to Latin. As the language of the Roman Empire and of the Catholic Church, Latin reigned supreme for medieval scholars; for centuries, nearly all literary and scientific works were written in the language. Even texts about _English_ grammar were, incredibly, written in Latin.

### The Creation of Words

We’ve explored the historical forces that shaped the overall structure of the English language. But in our effort to understand how English became the language we speak and write today, we need to delve deeper and understand the processes by which individual _words_ themselves are formed. **There are six primary ways words have entered the English language.**

  1. **Words are born through accident**. Many English words are the product of simple mispronunciation, misspelling, mishearing, or misuse. For instance, _sweetheart_ was once _sweetard_ , but evolved into its present form through persistent misuse. In other cases, words are created through backfilling from plural to singular. For example, the word _pease_ was once the singular form of _pea._ The word _pea_ didn’t exist, but people mistakenly thought that _pease_ was plural, so _pea_ was created to correct this supposed error.
  2. **Words are adopted from other languages,** as we saw with loanwords from Old Norse and Norman French. English has proven to be a remarkably welcome home for “refugee” words. Even in Shakespeare’s time, English had already borrowed words from over 50 languages, a remarkable feat considering the difficulties of travel and communication in the pre-modern era. Indeed, loan words and phrases from other languages live on in English long after they have gone extinct in their native tongues (like _nome de plume_ or _double entendres_ , both of which no longer exist in their original French). Some words like _breeze_(derived from the Spanish _briza_) have become so thoroughly anglicized that we forget they are actually derived from foreign sources. 
  3. **Words are invented from nothing, with no known explanation as to their origin.** We’ve already seen how Shakespeare single-handedly introduced hundreds of words into the language. Even as ubiquitous a word as _dog_ only began to appear in the late Middle Ages; before this, the word for this animal was _hound_. Other times, new words come into existence as a by-product of new technologies—in our time, the internet has spawned its own mini-language.
  4. **Existing words shift their meaning over time,** even if they retain their spelling and pronunciation. Some words have undergone remarkable changes in definition over the centuries, even coming to mean the exact opposite of what they originally did. This latter phenomenon is called catachresis. Since Chaucer’s time, the word _nice_ has meant everything from foolish to strange to wanton to lascivious. Only in the mid-18th century did it acquire something akin to its present meaning. The word has changed so much that it is sometimes impossible for historians and linguists to divine its precise meaning in antiquated texts.
  5. **Existing words are altered or modified**. The rich tapestry of prefixes and suffixes in English gives it a flexibility that makes it easy to modify words into different parts of speech or give them a different tense. An adjective like _diverse_ can easily become a verb like _diversify_ or a noun like _diversification_. But this leads to the same double-edged sword we’ve seen with English before—its flexibility simultaneously makes it adaptable to non-native speakers, while populating it with a maddening array of exceptions to the rules and irregular forms. For instance, there are eight separate prefixes just to express negation alone (such as _non-_ , _ir-_ , and _in-_), but not _all_ words that begin this way are negatives, as anyone familiar with the shared and highly confusing meanings of _flammable_ and _inflammable_ can attest. 



### The Variety of English Sounds

Another way we can see the versatility of English is with its great variety of sounds. The most common sound in the English language is the schwa. You may not have ever heard this term before, but you use it all the time. It’s the _i_ sound in _animal_ or the first _a_ in _alone_. It corresponds roughly to an “uh”sound. And all five vowels in English can produce this sound.

Despite the omnipresence of this one sound, **the English language is rich with varied pronunciation** , filled with words spelled differently than how they are pronounced, which we touched on in the previous chapter. We see this in word pairs that have similar spellings, but wildly different pronunciations— _five_ and _give_ ; _wear_ and _hear_ ; and _doll_ and _roll_ , to name just a few. All 26 letters of our alphabet are capable of having different pronunciations depending on the word in which they’re used.

Linguists have debated just how many different sounds are present in English. The figures vary depending on how one defines a unique sound. One study has found 90 separate sounds for just the letter _t,_ but, regardless of the precise number, **English is vastly richer in the variety of its sounds than other widely spoken languages** (the whole Italian language, for example, has only 27 sounds).

#### Slurring

One of the most interesting ways for us to observe the evolution of the spoken language is with slurring—the addition, subtraction, or substitution of letters in spoken English that aren’t reflected in the spelling. For example, we say _gramfather_ instead of _grandfather_ , _sumpthing_ instead of _something_ , and _glantz_ instead of _glance_.

Linguists believe that slurring arose from the fact that **we can hear language much more quickly than we can speak it**. This disparity in our processing speeds accounts for the common phenomenon of not being able to get words out, even when you have them formed in your mind (or your mind’s eye, to borrow from Shakespeare). It also gives rise to slurring, as we rush to articulate the words that we’ve already articulated in our minds. The general trend is one of subtraction, losing letters and syllables over time and letting pronunciations become looser and more casual. This is a phenomenon common to most languages as they evolve over time.

English speakers cut off the beginning, middle, and end of words. Speakers of British and American English might do this in different ways (sometimes rendering their speech mutually unintelligible), but the phenomenon exists on both sides of the Atlantic. Interestingly, **the words that tend to be slurred the most are local and familiar place-names**. The pronunciation of English places like Gloucestershire, Worcester, and Leicester (pronounced “Gloster,” “Wooster,” and “Lester,” respectively) can baffle outsiders, but so does the way Marylanders refer to their state’s largest city (“Balamer” instead of “Baltimore”).

#### Local Dialects of Great Britain

Our discussion of the slurring of place-names by locals brings us to another demonstration of the remarkable malleability of English—regional dialect and pronunciation. **There is an astonishing variety of dialect within England alone**(let alone Wales, Scotland, and Ireland). The linguist Simeon Potter has observed that there is more difference in speech between two points 100 miles distant from each other in England than there is in the whole of North America (we’ll go into greater detail on American speech patterns, as well as those in the broader English-speaking world, in the next chapter).

Harold Orton’s _Linguistic Atlas of England_ demonstrated that even small areas of the country show great variation in their words for common items. Three neighboring villages in Berkshire each had a different word for a jacket—it was either a _greatcoat_ , a _topcoat_ , or an _overcoat_.

Unexplained enclaves of one region’s dialect mysteriously appear in another region. These dialects can be identified with great precision—Londoners are able to tell which side of the Thames a speaker comes from by hearing her dialect, while the people of Yorkshire can pinpoint someone’s home village with remarkable accuracy.

#### Socioeconomic Variation in Speech

In the 18th century, the English aristocracy began broadening the short _a_ sound in words like _bath_ , _rather_ , and _math_ to render their pronunciations _bahth_ , _rahther_ , and _mahth_. This is a feature that non-Britons instinctively identify with UK speech, although it’s of relatively recent vintage. This pronunciation forms a major dividing line between English and American speech, but also different socioeconomic groups _within_ the UK—with Britons from wealthier backgrounds tending to broaden their _a’s_ and working-class Britons retaining the short _a_.

The remnants of this pronunciation shift can still be seen even in the US. **Nineteenth-century, upper-class Bostonians and New Yorkers likewise began broadening their vowels in imitation of the British aristocracy** , while Americans further inland did not.

(Shortform note: Some older white Americans from wealthy Anglo-Saxon families still speak this way—it is the transatlantic or “Boston Brahmin” accent.)

Indeed, **social class can be as powerful an influence on English as geography and ethnicity.** The American dialectologist William Labov observed in the 1930s that middle-class New Yorkers were far more likely to pronounce the _r_ sound in words like _door_ , _car_ , and _more_ than were their fellow working-class New Yorkers (the variability in the pronunciation of _r_ sounds is known as rhoticity). The quintessential New York accent was clearly closely tied up with social class and income level. Pronouncing one’s _r_ sounds was an indicator of higher social status.
