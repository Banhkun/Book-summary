## Conclusion: The Road Ahead for English

In the United States, there have been many attempts throughout the years to “protect” and “preserve” the English language from the perceived threat of foreign or outside influence. **Interest groups have sought to establish English as the official language** (at least for government use) in cities, states, and even at the federal level. These groups claim that linguistic divisions have historically led to strife in other countries (like Belgium and Canada).

There is some truth to this claim, because **language is one of the main things that divides human societies from each other** and is closely tied to national and ethnic identity. The struggles between Flemish- and Walloon-speakers in Belgium, the Québécois separatist movement pitting Anglophone and Francophone speakers in Canada, and the persecution of Esperanto speakers in fascist states in the early 20th century all attest to language as a hot-button issue.

These same groups, however, ignore the reality that government-led attempts to encourage the survival and spread of minority languages usually fail, because **the evolution and death of languages is an organic process**. Indeed, despite the heavy efforts of the Republic of Ireland to keep the Irish language alive, only 4.2 percent of the population speaks Irish daily, according to the country’s 2016 census.

More to the point, efforts to “protect” or “save” English are entirely unnecessary. As we’ve seen, learning English confers such powerful social and economic advantages that few non-native speakers in America or any other English-speaking country would deliberately choose not to learn it. **The language is in no need of “protection.”**

So what is the future of the language? Will it remain a global language forever? Perhaps, but **English speakers should never be reduced to complacency by the seeming triumph of their language**. Things can always change, and the supremacy of English may one day be supplanted by a rival claimant.

**With America’s powerful economic and cultural influence over the world, the most likely trajectory seems to be a homogenization of English** to conform to the way it's spoken in the United States. These trends are reinforced by the influences of mass media, which expose us to dialects of speech that we would never have otherwise heard. Thus, a melting pot of English, rather than a polarization of different dialects, looks to be where we’re headed.

On the one hand, this is positive. Americans, Britons, Australians, Canadians, South Africans, Jamaicans, and all other English-speaking nations will understand one another better, creating stronger conditions for political, social, and economic cooperation. But, on the other hand, something irreplaceable would be lost—**the variety and flavor of our rich and beautiful language.**
