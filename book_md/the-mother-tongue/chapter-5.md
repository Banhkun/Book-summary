## Chapter 5: The Richness of English

We’ve looked at the emergence of English as a dominant language of global business and politics through the British Empire and the political and cultural influence of the United States. But English is also a language of literature and oratory, capable of eloquently expressing the most powerful human emotions and desires. It possesses a number of unique properties, quirks, and complexities that set it apart from other tongues. In this chapter, we’ll explore some of the language’s unique traits that make it so rich and evocative.

### English Place-Names

**One of the best ways to glimpse the richness and variety of English is to explore names, especially place-names and personal names**. Place-names in England are often perplexing to outsiders because of the divergence between their spellings and pronunciations: Leicester is pronounced “lester,” Worcester is pronounced “wooster,” and Postwick is pronounced “pozick.” These names are often the product of waves of conquerors—Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Vikings, and Normans twisting and reshaping the names of the places they encountered. Thus, British place-names bear the stamp of peoples from all across Europe.

**Many names of streets, pubs, and towns are remarkably colorful and evocative**. London boasts streets named Crooked Usage, Ha Ha Road, and Bleeding Heart Yard, to name just a few. Classic English pubs often have baffling names, like the Quiet Woman, the Nobody Inn, the Bunch of Carrots, and the Cat and Custard Pot.

Many English pub names harken back to old aristocratic heraldry and coats of arms, or were meant to signal loyalty to an old medieval political faction. Often, they needed to have colorful and unique names and symbols to make themselves identifiable to a population that was largely illiterate. Others, like the Bishop’s Finger and the Monk’s Head have names rooted in religious orders.

### American Place-Names

Not to be outdone, the United States has its own roster of names that bedevil non-natives. Like in England, many of these names are products of conquests of indigenous peoples. Thus did Missikamaa become Michigan and šhíyena become Cheyenne. Similar processes unfolded with place-names that had their origins in French, Dutch, and Spanish names. The United States also has colorful names in abundance, from Screamer, Alabama to Truth or Consequences, New Mexico.

**Some American place-names or nicknames have unknown or dubious origins** , like the Hawkeye State (Iowa) or the Hoosier State (Indiana). Perhaps the most famous misnaming of a place by outside conquerors is the West Indies. Europeans who first journeyed to this part of the Caribbean believed that they had arrived in India (largely due to a glaring navigational and cartographic error by Christopher Columbus). Hence the name for the place and the name that has stuck to the indigenous peoples of the New World ever since: Indians.

### Surnames

English surnames tell a rich and interesting story. **For much of the Middle Ages, ordinary people did not have any need for surnames.** They lived in small communities in which they knew everyone, so personal names like John or William were wholly sufficient: you might be the only John or William in the village.

This began to change in the later Middle Ages, as the royal government began to more aggressively and efficiently collect taxes, which required a more thorough way of tracking everyone who owed money to the crown. Registering individuals by personal name and surname turned out to be an effective way to do this.

Generally speaking, **surnames derive from place-names (John Lancaster), nicknames (John Whitehead), trade names (John Smith), or familial relations or patronymics (John Son-of-William, or John Williamson)**. Interestingly, smith-work was so common that Smith or its equivalents are today extremely common in every language, from the German _Schmidt_ to the French _Ferrier_ to the Italian _Ferraro_.

English surnames that are rooted in place-names often bear the names of obscure or thinly populated places. At first glance, this seems counterintuitive—shouldn’t there be a lot more Sarah Londons than Sarah Dovers? But it actually makes sense. People wanted surnames that distinguished themselves from others. Lots of people came from big cities like London and York, so these wouldn’t be good surnames to adopt, unless you were moving to a rural area, in which case your place of origin in an urban center _would_ be distinctive.

Although the most common names in America are of British origin, certain British names are far more common in the US than in the UK. Johnson, for instance, is more prevalent in America because the many Jonssons and Johanssens that came to America from Scandinavia and had their names anglicized to Johnson. When immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe came to America, they, too, often had their names changed at ports of entry, either voluntarily or by immigration officials.

### Obscenity and Blasphemy

(Shortform note: This section contains language that some readers may find offensive.)

One of the best ways to get a true flavor of the English language is through its swear words. Most languages feature swears, although some, like Japanese, do not.**Swear words derive their power from the fact that they are highly emotive, as well as forbidden**. We reach for these words to express extreme emotions: fear, surprise, joy, anger.

Swear words and phrases are remarkably varied from language to language, but they tend to be oriented around two themes: obscenity, which is either the disgusting and/or taboo (often having to do with bodily functions or sex); or blasphemy which involves sacrilege or invoking the name of God in vain. In English, _shit_ , _piss_ , _fuck_ , and _cunt_ would fall into the former category; _hell_ , _damn_ , _goddamn_ and _Jesus Christ_ (in certain contexts) would fall into the latter.

**Many taboo words in English are actually quite old, with some of them having origins in Old English** , from the days before the Norman Conquest. _Shit_ is very old, dating back to the _shite_ of the 1300s and the Anglo-Saxon _scītan_ before that. _Fuck_ may have Latin origins and was first printed in 1503, meaning that it was almost certainly widely used before that date.

Throughout the history of the English language, there have been shifting definitions of which words were and weren’t considered offensive. For much of the Middle Ages, the strongest words in modern English would scarcely raise an eyebrow. _Cunt_ is perhaps the most obscene word in the English language, but it was entirely commonplace and inoffensive a few centuries ago. It features in the works of Chaucer, and even Shakespeare had a famous winking reference to it through a double entendre in this memorable exchange from _Hamlet_ :

Hamlet: [To Ophelia] Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

Ophelia: No, my lord.

Hamlet: I mean, my head upon your lap.

Ophelia: Ay, my lord.

**Hamlet: Do you think I meant _country_ matters?**

Ophelia: I think nothing, my lord.

Hamlet: That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

Many English cities of the time had a Gropecunt Lane, streets where prostitution was common. This was entirely unremarkable, simply an extension of the practice of naming streets and boroughs after the economic activity that took place there, analogous to a Butcher’s Alley or Baker’s Court.

By contrast, words and phrases that seem relatively harmless today were considered extremely taboo during the pious Middle Ages. Many of these were blasphemous or sacrilegious in nature, taking the name of God in vain or making explicit reference to God or Jesus’s body. _Damn_ , _hell_ , or phrases like “by the blood of Christ,” “God’s blood,” or “God’s wounds” (the last of which was shortened to the minced oath _zounds_), were far more offensive than _shit_ or _piss_.

(Shortform note: _Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing_ by Melissa Mohr explores the origins and evolution of foul language, as well as the changing sensibilities over time over which words were and weren’t considered offensive.)

#### Victorian Euphemisms

By the Victorian Age (1837-1901), many English words that would have scarcely raised an eyebrow in the Middle Ages or in Shakespeare’s time were considered totally out of bounds. Indeed, **the Victorian Age was famous for its prudishness and squeamishness** , in both England and America. Self-conscious reformers sought to sanitize the language, often going to absurd lengths. Thomas Bowdler, a Scottish physician, took it upon himself to edit the great works of English literature by Shakespeare and Gibbon to remove any traces of what he deemed to be profanity, obscenity, or double entendre. His efforts even gave a name to this sort of overzealous expurgation of art: Bowdlerization.

**Even non-taboo parts of the body were considered too delicate to mention in polite society.** Thus, _legs_ became _limbs_ and _belly_ became _midriff_. People who had last names like Hitchcock or Alcock, meanwhile, suffered deep social discomfort and embarrassment when they had to introduce themselves. There are even reports (although possibly apocryphal) of some Americans covering the legs of their pianos out of squeamishness.

These attitudes continued well into the 20th century, when the Hollywood Production Code, responsible for censoring American films, was still banning words like _dame_ from the silver screen as late as 1949. We live with the legacy of such attitudes, even today. While British newspapers and magazines are, generally speaking, willing to print swear words, especially in the context of quotes, their American counterparts still evince a high reluctance to do so.

In its style guide, the _New York Times_ , says that _goddamn_ should be avoided unless absolutely necessary; even the transcript of an airplane cockpit conversation between a pilot and co-pilot moments before a deadly airplane crash was censored by the National Transportation Safety Board, which chose to omit the word _bitch_.

### English Wordplay and Wit

We can also see the richness of English in its wordplay. As evidenced by the popularity of crossword puzzles and anagrams in the United States and Great Britain, wordplay is highly popular in the English-speaking world. Whether it’s puns, rhymes, palindromes, doggerel, or onomatopoeia, **the language affords ample opportunity for creativity and wit.**

Of course, it’s not just English. There’s evidence of wordplay in much older languages, going all the way back to Ancient Greek palindromes and anagrams. There’s even evidence for them in the text of the Bible! But they have a long tradition in our language as well. Some of the earliest Old English poets like Cynewulf wrote acrostics, in which the first letters of each line of verse, when put together, forms a word or phrase. Shakespeare also loved his puns, with his works containing over 3,000 of them.

#### Palindromes, Anagrams, and Lipograms

The forms of wordplay are greatly varied. Palindromes (sentences spelled the same backwards and forwards) are among the most creative and most challenging to write. Consider how difficult it is to come up with a palindrome like “Rise to vote sir” or “A nut for a jar of tuna” that satisfy this criteria _and_ form coherent statements.

Anagrams (words or phrases made from rearranging the letters of other words and phrases) are also highly popular. Thus, one can turn Emperor Octavian into “Captain over Rome” or Osama Bin Laden into “Is bad man alone.”

Or, if you’re feeling up to it, you can challenge yourself to a lipogram, a sentence written without using a particular letter. Indeed, the French author Georges Perec once wrote an entire _novel_ without using the letter _e._

#### Holorimes

Pop music is a great source of another type of wordplay, the holorime. These are phrases that sound similar phonetically, but can be written using different words and form sentences with completely different meanings. If you’ve misheard Jimi Hendrix saying “Scuse me while I kiss this guy” or mistaken the opening verse of the US national anthem as “Jose, can you see...” then you’re familiar with holorimes.

#### Cockney Rhyming Slang

**Perhaps the most famous wordplay in spoken English is the phenomenon of cockney rhyming slang**. This is a linguistic characteristic specific to the cockneys of London’s East End, believed to have started around the mid-19th century. In this rhyming slang, the speaker replaces a word (like _mate_) with a multi-word phrase (like _china plate_), the last word of which rhymes with the word that’s been replaced. Thus, “How are you, mate?” would become “How are you, china plate?”

But in reality, it goes a step _further_. The second, rhyming word is often _dropped_. Thus, “How are you, mate?” would really become “How are you, china?” This renders the etymology of these phrases deeply obscure and often baffling to outsiders.
