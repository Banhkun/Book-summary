## Part 3: The Product: Roadmaps Versus Vision

We’ll now move from mostly discussing the _team_ to discussing the _product._ Part 3 will discuss how most companies develop products, the problems with this approach, and a better approach focused on _vision_ and _strategy._

### The Roadmap Approach

Most companies develop products by starting with an idea and creating a roadmap: a **series of orders handed down by executives that, if completed properly, should result in a desired output.** Roadmaps are lists of priorities. Generally, either upper management or the product manager issues a new roadmap every three months or so.

Roadmaps include big picture requests and due dates, but not where engineers need to fix bugs or address smaller technical questions. There are a few reasons why managers think that roadmaps are a good management technique:

  * They keep employees focused on what managers see as the most important tasks to the overall success of the company first.
  * They help managers liaise with stakeholders and colleagues, because they can plan, based on their roadmaps, when they think various tasks will be completed. 
  * Roadmaps help managers feel like they’re generally more in control of their employees. 



Roadmaps are popular for two reasons:

  1. They make sure that employees are properly prioritizing their tasks.
  2. They allow bosses to build a schedule around when they believe tasks will be finished.



However, roadmaps generally lead to waste. Here’s why:

  * At least half of product ideas are bound to fail. This is true for myriad reasons—for example, customers don’t respond positively, there’s an unforeseen technical issue, or customers like a product but it’s too complex to use regularly. 
  * Additionally, products are almost never complete after one try. There are always bugs to fix or unforseen questions that focus groups must address. 



Both of these issues throw off the timing of the roadmap. If, as previously stated, managers are relying on a roadmap to know when products will be finished, it’s more than 50% likely that the team won’t meet their expectations.

Additionally, roadmaps can lead to morale problems. If engineers—or, in some cases, product managers—feel as if they’re only getting orders, and they’re unable to complete them on time by no fault of their own, they blame their bosses for giving them unreasonable requests.

### The Vision and Strategy Approach

There is a better approach than roadmapping that maintains the beneficial aspects of the roadmap (again, that employees are properly prioritizing their tasks and bosses are able to schedule around when they think tasks will be finished) while eliminating the weaknesses.

This alternative approach focuses on _product vision_ and _product strategy._ Each is essential to product development— _product vision_ broadly allows companies to create a better understanding of their goals in building a product, and _product strategy_ helps companies reach those goals. They are more flexible than a roadmap, which is stringent about deadlines and often comes from the top of an organization without input. We’ll now discuss _vision_ and _strategy_ in depth.

#### Vision

Product vision is the overall goal of the company (or, in a large company, a component of the company). It is something that can be achieved only far in the future—somewhere between two and 10 years. Here are 10 principles for creating a product vision:

  1. **Ask _why:_** Your product vision explains why you’re building your product and why you think it will succeed.
  2. **Consider the problem rather than the solution:** Be more curious about the problem you’re trying to solve than the possibility that a solution could make you rich or noteworthy.
  3. **Think big:** Again, it’s not a three-month horizon, it’s up to a decade. Don’t be afraid to dream.
  4. **Disrupt your own company:** If you’re not constantly reinventing products, another company _will_ be and will take your market share or your goals.
  5. **Inspire:** Your vision should inspire your employees to be missionaries for the company. Build a vision that makes them excited to work for you. 
  6. **Consider trends:** Similar to point #4, constantly monitor trends in your field, and adjust your plans accordingly. 
  7. **Be ready for changes:** Even better than watching where the market is heading is _predicting_ the market. Being on top of trends can help a company understand where trends might be going next. This way, you can be proactive rather than reactive. 
  8. **Be willing to change the details but not the vision:** As we’ve outlined in the past few points, sometimes the details of your plan are going to change. But your overall vision should almost always stay the same. 
  9. **Understand that your vision is predicated on faith:** If the vision you create isn’t a leap of faith, it’s not ambitious enough. It will likely take a few years to know if what you’re doing is working. This shouldn’t panic you.
  10. **Spread the faith:** Constantly communicate your vision inside and outside the company. Get people excited about your plan, and it’s more likely to come to fruition. 



#### Strategy

Strategy is your plan to achieve the product vision. The product strategy can change more than the vision—it’s subject to fluctuations in the market, your team sticking together, or even where you’re competing geographically. There are four criteria for a sound product strategy:

  1. **Focus your attention on a target:** Pick one target and focus there before moving on. This could be a new geographic market or a new type of customer. If you’re trying to be all things to all people, you’re bound to fail.
  2. **Align the business and the product:** The business side of the company has to believe that the product will succeed, while the product-creation side of the company has to believe in the business strategy to _make_ the product succeed. The marketing/sales strategy, in particular, needs to make sense to the product people, who understand the product the best.
  3. **Consider the customers more than the competitors:** Often, companies can get into a death spiral because they’re simply reacting to their competitors’ actions. Instead, focus on the customers first. This will be the best buttress against competitors. 
  4. **Communicate:** Make sure that everyone within the company understands the product strategy. 



#### Business Context

In addition to implementing vision and strategy, employees developing a product can do a better job if they understand the _business context._ This understanding informs their decision-making, and it helps them to better understand the value of their tasks. At tech companies in particular, business context has two components:

  1. **The big picture.** This is the company’s strategy and how its vision was developed. This gives employees an understanding of why they’re building the products they’re building. 
  2. **The objectives.** This is, on a more granular level, what each team has to accomplish. Rather than giving teams a specific _task,_ it’s better to give them an _objective—_ like reducing onboarding time for a new customer from a few days to a few hours—and then letting the team figure out how to accomplish it. 



By providing employees with an understanding of the company and freedom to work out the solutions to goals themselves, employees are better able to properly prioritize their tasks. Employees will know even better what to prioritize than in the roadmap scenario, because they’ll understand why their objective is important and then create a strategy to get it done themselves, rather than relying on a strategy from up top that might not be as efficient, because the people at the upper levels of the company might not have a good technical understanding of how to solve problems.

#### High-Integrity Commitments

Next, we’ll discuss the benefit of creating a realistic product development _schedule or deadline._

Sometimes, especially in the later stages of product development when it’s obvious that customers like the idea, it _is_ in the best interest of companies to set a due date. However, companies have to be sure that this will work—this means making what is called a _high-integrity commitment_ , or a commitment that a team knows that it can fulfill because of research it has already done _._

What’s important to note about these commitments is that, unlike roadmap-based commitments, product teams **don’t make them too early.** There isn’t an exact science to finding high-integrity commitments, but it’s about finding a good balance between executives and stakeholders and product managers and other workers. Once the product managers have figured out how to solve their problem, _then_ it’s possible to set a soft due date on when they can deliver their work.

### Product Principles

At this point, we’ve explained how _product vision_ and _product strategy_ lead to success. Now, we’ll consider the importance of creating _product principles_ that guide what you build. When an organization has the same set of principles that govern everyone in it, employees feel they’re being judged on a fair standard.

#### Objectives and Key Results

Product principles can be broken down into “Objectives and Key Results,” or OKR. This is the system that Google has used almost since its inception. The system is meant to empower employees while also properly measuring their progress. (Shortform note: OKR is meant to track a company’s progress against measurable goals.) Here are some things to keep in mind when setting objectives and results metrics:

  * Make the objectives organization- or product team-wide. They shouldn’t be personal.
  * Maintain a small number of objectives that you feel confident you can complete.
  * Keep clear data on your progress toward completing objectives.
  * Maintain transparency across the company on teams’ progress.
  * Create accountability by establishing an incentive structure in the case that teams can’t accomplish their objectives.
  * Make all results measurable.



Individual employees, of course, can and should have their own goals. But the OKRs, again, should be at least product team-wide, and should be uniform across the organization, so that everyone knows that they are being judged on the same broad standard as their counterparts. Naturally, this is more difficult the larger the company is. When a company is scaling up, OKRs are useful, because they’re fairly conducive to scale; you can easily add objectives and new data points to OKRs while your company is growing. During a company’s scaling process, leadership needs to make sure that all OKRs remain aligned toward the same larger goal/vision.

#### Evangelism

As mentioned in the vision section, “spreading the faith” is essential to success. The more people there are inside and outside the company who believe in your idea, the more likely you are to succeed. On the other hand, if you can’t excite many people about your idea, you’re almost certainly doomed to failure. Here are 10 ways to get employees excited about a product:

  1. **Build prototypes.** Allow people to _see_ what you envision rather than having to imagine it from a description. 
  2. **Explain the pain.** Make clear exactly how your product will make people’s lives better, or reduce their pain and frustrations. 
  3. **Explain the vision.** Make sure your product vision is airtight before presenting it to anyone else, and make sure that you believe in the vision yourself.
  4. **Share what you learn.** Make sure that all stakeholders understand a product’s potential efficacy. Team members won’t understand the good of the product if leaders don’t share their vision.
  5. **Share credit.** When you find successes in focus groups, surveys, technological improvements, or anything else, give credit to your team and other stakeholders. 
  6. **Work on your presentations.** Make sure your presentations to your own team, customers, and other executives effectively sell the value of the product. 
  7. **Be prepared.** Make sure you know everything there is to know about your product and your industry. People trust those who know what they’re talking about.
  8. **Be excited.** Be aware of your own enthusiasm level—if it’s lagging, consider ways to increase it, like thinking about the final launch, or about how customers might respond. 
  9. **Show your excitement.** Make sure your team and your managers know that you’re excited. This could make them more excited as well.
  10. **Hang out with the team.** Be sure that your team likes and trusts you. Spend time with everyone on your team. 



### A Note on Structure

Even when teams are functioning properly and leadership is properly overseeing the company, if there are a lot of product teams that are working on different components of the same larger product, it can be difficult to keep everyone on track and aimed at the same goal. There are a few principles to rely on that can help to fix this issue.

  1. Leaders should communicate the vision of the company and the strategic direction down the ladder to the bottom rung of the company. Everyone should be aware of the company’s larger goals.
  2. In order to maintain a cohesive unit, leaders should have a clear investment strategy. They should know what products or divisions are succeeding and pour more money into those, while reducing investments in units or products that are starting to stagnate.
  3. Teams should share services and lessons learned with one another, but not depend on each other. This is a tough balance to strike, but leaders should encourage collaboration among teams while also stressing that each team is responsible for delivering on their own work and has the autonomy to do so without interference.
  4. Leaders should keep team size between two and 12 engineers to every product manager/designer.
  5. Develop and improve upon the structure/architecture of the company before attempting to engineer the vision. People should understand their roles and prove their competency at them before starting a huge project. Companies should also realize that in response to challenges, their structure may well change. The structure of a company should always be flexible.
  6. A company should know what its customers want before launch, and should have specific teams targeting specific groups of customers. If a company is, for example, serving as the liaison between real estate agents and first- time house hunters, part of the company should be responsible for dealing with the agents while another part will deal with the house hunters. 
  7. Leaders should continue to stress the importance of cultivating and keeping missionaries.
