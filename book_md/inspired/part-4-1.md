## Part 4.1: The Product—Discovery

After creating a vision and strategy, the next step in product development is**discovering products and getting them to market**. Once again, the product manager plays a key role. “Discovery” is the process by which a company identifies customer needs or problems and develops products to solve them.

Companies should focus on maintaining and updating the quality of their current products while continuing to experiment with new products and solutions. Usually, good engineers know how to do the former. But many have trouble with the latter. This section will establish a process of _continuous discovery._ Every part of the company should be involved with product discovery.

What follows are specific techniques used in the discovery process. This section will discuss the techniques of:

  * Framing an idea.
  * Planning an idea.
  * Building (or ideating) an idea.
  * Creating prototypes.
  * Testing an idea for value, usability, feasibility, and business viability. 



### Framing

**Framing helps us identify underlying issues with proposed products.** Some product discovery is straightforward—we know there is a specific problem to solve. However, for the more complex questions of discovery, framing is essential. It has two specific goals:

  1. **Make sure the whole team is aligned and understands what the objective** **is or what problem we’re trying to solve.**
  2. **Find the risks that the company will take on during discovery.** These could be risks related to value, usability, feasibility, or business viability. The risks can include questions ranging from whether the company has the money to pay for the creation and rollout of the product to whether the product is ethical. 



We’ll go over three framing strategies—from an _opportunity assessment,_ which is most helpful when asking simple discovery questions, to a _startup canvas,_ which works for companies trying a completely new product or strategy:

#### Opportunity Assessment

Opportunity assessments answer four questions to determine feasibility:

  1. **What’s the business objective of the product?** The product needs to help with one of your team’s objectives—for example, a tech company, which previously had most of its sales come from men, might launch a product that it hopes will interest women.
  2. **What does success look like?** Quantify this. Using the same example, success might be 40% of that company’s products are bought by women in the next calendar year, up from 25% before the launch.
  3. **What is the customer problem the product can solve?** Again, focus on the customers and the problems they have first and internal successes second. Let’s say the company is a sports gambling website that catered to men’s sports. The new product caters to other kinds of gambling, including on women’s sports, that interest women more. 
  4. **Who are the customers for the product?** What segment of your overall customer base, or the overall base of consumers around the world, are you targeting? The customers are generally young people with a disposable income. 



You’ll use this framing technique for most product discovery. It’s for the simpler questions of discovery.

#### Customer Letter

In the _customer letter_ technique, product managers imagine a letter from a satisfied customer, which helps them better understand their goals. Using the technique, you’ll _work backward._ Begin by writing a (fictitious) letter from a satisfied customer who has tried your new product. Why does she like it? What problems does it solve? Then, build your discovery strategy around the letter. Ask **how do we make this letter come true? How do we solve these problems?**

This technique is well-suited to larger projects with overlapping goals because in working _backwards,_ product managers can understand how their goals dovetail into customer satisfaction. A project may attempt to solve multiple problems for a customer in an effort to make her more satisfied overall.

#### Startup Canvas

The startup canvas framing technique is useful for quickly highlighting the biggest risks of starting a new company or product line.

(Shortform note: The startup canvas is a one-page template that allows you to examine your concept from various perspectives. Use a section or column of the page to define the problem you’re attempting to solve, and further sections for your solution, the unique value of your idea, and why customers will react well to it. You can add as many sections as necessary.)

Startups have many questions, like how to raise or make money, how to find customers, and how to build a new line/company from scratch. Rather than creating a full business plan, though, you can use the startup canvas as a leaner option.

The biggest risk for startups is generally related to _value._ You’re looking for something that your customers will buy, but it’s difficult to know whether they will be willing to do so. Plus, if you’re competing in an existing market (which the grand majority of companies, even the new ones, are), your product needs to be _substantially_ better than your competition’s in order for people to feel justified in switching.

Take a look at the market, the big players, the risks, your own product and financial stability, and answer all of the questions in the previous two frames as well. Once you’ve identified your risks, whether the effort is feasible will become clear.

### Planning

Step two in the product discovery process is figuring out how to create the infrastructure necessary to get a product to market. This is the _planning_ stage of the process _._ Useful techniques include story mapping and customer discovery.

#### Story Mapping

Story mapping is the creation of a more complex “to do” list. It’s a simple but useful technique that helps companies plan how to build products.

Create a 2D map of your product. From left to right along a line, place the activities your user can do on your product, basically in the order that they’ll do them. You might have dots like “open the app” or “sign in” near the beginning and “edit their profile” closer to the middle/end. Vertically, add the tasks necessary to make all of these activities work. The more complex the activity, the higher the vertical bar will be. This way, you can clearly see what to accomplish and what parts of your idea will be more or less difficult. As customers provide feedback on prototypes, you can add that to the map.

#### Customer Discovery

Customer discovery is a technique that helps to find _reference customers,_ or customers who are loyal to the product. These customers are the lifeblood of any company—they help you determine how to market the product, and they help spread the word about it to similar customers. They are people who would pay for a final version of your product and like it enough that they would recommend it to friends. The process is generally more complex than story mapping.

As few as six reference customers can help your company grow exponentially. Before fully launching, a company should _recruit_ between six and eight of these people. The best reference customers share these characteristics:

  * They are in the company’s target market/audience. 
  * The product helps them solve a significant problem in their life.
  * They are not obsessed with tech.
  * They are willing to help the company and have the time to do so.



Recruit these customers either from existing users who have a problem they need to have solved, or from surveys that determine whether potential customers could use your product. Once you find these people, treat them like colleagues or partners rather than test subjects. You both need one another equally.

Prospective reference customers will be excited by the idea of having some input into the product. The product team can use the reference customers to test out their products before launch. The product manager needs to identify **one solution that solves the problem that all reference customers had going into the test.** Otherwise, it’s possible the solution will be too specifically tailored.

All of this is a lot of effort, especially for the product manager running all of this. But if you have six people at the end of it whose problems are truly solved and who are willing to go to bat for the company, this almost _necessarily_ means that there are a lot more people in the target market who would benefit significantly from this.

### Ideation

Step 3 in the product discovery process is generating ideas for products and product features.

#### Interviewing Customers

Interviewing current or past customers can help the team generate ideas, because customers who regularly use the product may notice issues with it and consider how it can be better. If we know, from the customer, what our company needs to do to make them use our service, they’ve almost generated some ideas for solutions for us. In every interview, the interviewer should consider the following questions:

  * Does this person have an issue that we’re trying to solve?
  * How is this person attempting to solve their problem right now?
  * What could our company do that might make this person switch to our problem-solving mechanism?



Conduct many interviews with potential customers to help get the answers to these questions. Additionally, be open to hearing their answers, rather than advancing your own agenda. Finally, if possible, it is helpful to do these interviews in the subject’s home or a place where they feel comfortable. This will make them much more open to you.

At least one engineer, the product designer, and the product manager should attend these interviews. **The product designer can thrive in interviews,** because their focus is designing usable products.

After the interview, the team should debrief on what they learned right away. And once the team has the answers to the above questions, it’s much easier to generate good design ideas.

#### Concierge Testing

The idea behind concierge testing is that the company becomes the “concierge” for potential customers, helping them with their needs. After interviews with customers, product teams know their needs. The product teams then focus on helping specific customers with their problems. By trying to solve specific problems, the product teams are able to better understand these issues and how they might relate to more than one customer.

Again, an engineer, the product designer, and the product manager should do this together and debrief on their experience afterward.

#### Allowing Customer Exploration

In addition to generating ideas for designing new products, companies need to generate ideas for improving existing products. One way to do this is by observing how customers use a product, which may be different from the way its designers intended.

eBay’s “everything else” marketplace is an example. When eBay launched, they wanted to be a website that facilitated transactions mostly for collectibles and electronics. But they also created an “other” or “everything else” tab where people could buy/sell (mostly) whatever they wanted. EBay didn’t realize that their customers would sell items like cars on their site. But today, eBay has a huge market share in the used car industry.

EBay allowed their customers to behave in ways that they didn’t expect or prepare for with their service. By doing so, they grew their business exponentially, and in response to customer demand, they built up more infrastructure around customer interests like the used car market.

Obviously, this strategy only works in specific cases. If your product is ultra-targeted, it’s more difficult to pull off. But if done correctly, as we’ve seen, it can reap huge dividends.

#### Internal Hack Days

The final strategy for ideation is holding “hack days,” in which the company’s engineers, product managers, product designers, and senior executives spend the day brainstorming and solving problems. Hack days may focus on a specific issue or be unstructured.

The benefits include:

  * Involving engineers in generating ideas, in addition to their usual design role. 
  * Improving morale by generating creativity and enthusiasm for the company’s larger mission. 



### Prototyping

The next step in the discovery process after generating ideas is _prototyping._ People often think of prototypes as nearly complete products, but less elaborate prototypes are more useful and less expensive to produce.

While prototypes do take much less time, money, and energy than the final product to create, they still force teams to take the ideas in their heads and put them to work. They are a good balance between putting too much effort and too little effort into an idea.

This section discusses four types of prototypes.

#### Feasibility Prototypes

Sometimes engineers aren’t sure whether they can build a tech product—for instance, because of concerns like scale or whether it is possible to successfully code the version of the product they have in mind. The way to answer the question is to build a feasibility prototype.

In creating a feasibility prototype, engineers typically write just enough code for the project to know that they can complete it. The code doesn’t need to be perfect—it’s unlikely that it will go into the final build.

The feasibility prototype is done by the engineers and is for the engineers. The product manager needs to concern herself with it only insofar as she ultimately decides whether to move forward with it.

#### User Prototypes

While feasibility prototypes involve writing a minimal amount of working code, user prototypes are _simulations_ of the final product. They’re not actually functional—for example, a customer wouldn’t be able to buy anything via a user prototype for an online marketplace like eBay.

The simplest user prototypes often don’t look anything like the final product and serve only as the skeleton. Generally, simple user prototypes are for internal use only—to help the team visualize the product.

In contrast, more complex user prototypes called _high-fidelity user prototypes_ look and feel like the final product. They take longer to create, and they can be used both internally and externally on test subjects. However, high-fidelity user prototypes aren’t live, and can still be fairly basic—for example, a search function might generate only a few results, or an algorithm might still need building.

#### Live-Data Prototypes

A company pursuing a risky idea can get real data on whether a product will sell while in the discovery phase by creating a live-data prototype.

This prototype is a pared-down version of the final product—it’s not scalable, can’t take much traffic, and doesn’t have any SEO or analytics associated with it, but it does function. Test users can use the product and provide qualitative data on how they felt and quantitative data on how they used it and how well it worked.

Remember though, that at this point, the product still has a long way to go—the engineers have likely done less than 10% of the work needed for success.

#### Hybrid Prototypes

The final prototype is the hybrid, which is a combination of the first three types. A “Wizard of Oz” prototype is an example of a hybrid prototype—the name comes from what’s behind the curtain. Behind the product’s front-end user experience, an engineer manually performs the tasks that the front-end says the product can do. This saves time on automation, and can provide a sense of what people think of the product.

Most __ hybrid prototypes are the least scalable of the four types, as they’re meant to be built quickly and provide customer feedback without requiring unnecessary engineering work.
