## Exercise: Audit Your Personal Data Privacy Practices

Reflect on your technology use and how you could improve your data privacy practices in a world dominated by surveillance capitalism.

* * *

Describe the ways you utilize technology in your day-to-day life and list at least five products or services that you regularly use. (For example, maybe you use Netflix, Microsoft’s Cortana, UberEats, Life360, and Whatsapp.)

Next, describe the type of data you’re likely giving up by using each of those products or services. (For example, by using Cortana, you give Microsoft access to your calendar.)

Note down the practices you already use to preserve your privacy, if any. (For example, maybe you only give UberEats access to your location when using the app.)

Finally, reflect on what you could change moving forward. How could you better protect your privacy? (For example, perhaps you could swap out Whatsapp for a messaging service that has more end-to-end encryption, like Telegram.)
