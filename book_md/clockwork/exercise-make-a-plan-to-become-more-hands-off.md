## Exercise: Make a Plan to Become More Hands-Off

Reflect on how your current approach to leading your business compares to the ideal approach of a hands-off visionary, and make a plan for moving toward this ideal.

* * *

Is your approach to leading your business closer to a hands-on approach or a hands-off approach? Describe the evidence that you’re closer to one approach or the other. (Signs your approach is more hands-on include involvement in daily operations; operating in crisis mode; handling most decisions; and experiencing burnout. Signs your approach is more hands-off include employees handling most or all daily operations and decisions; being able to take days off work; and a large portion of your work involving overseeing metrics.)

Why do you think you use that approach to leading your business? (For example, perhaps you lean toward a hands-on approach because you like to feel essential to your business’s daily success; or perhaps you lean toward a hands-off approach because you want to prepare your employees to successfully run your business after you retire.)

What’s one long-term change you could make to move toward the ideal of the fully hands-off visionary? (Consider these changes: Identify your critical task and refine your company’s remaining tasks; reorganize your team so they’re better matched with tasks that motivate them; delegate tasks and/or decisions to your teammates; establish metrics that allow you to oversee your business outcomes.)

Finally, identify and describe a _specific_ step you can take to begin making that change. (For example, imagine you identified that you want to delegate more tasks to your team. Here, you could choose one or more tasks to delegate to a teammate, name which teammate you plan to assign that task to, and describe how you plan to train them.)
