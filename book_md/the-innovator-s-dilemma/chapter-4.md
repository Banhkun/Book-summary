## Chapter 4: Upward Mobility and Downward Immobility

Successful companies typically focus on growing and moving upmarket with higher-priced products, higher-tier customers, and larger profits. However, this **upward mobility makes firms downwardly immobile—it impedes them from adopting disruptive innovations, which always start downmarket.**

### Barriers to Downward Mobility

Established companies face three key barriers to downward mobility:

  1. Cost structures that favor seeking higher profit margins upmarket over cutting costs to remain profitable downmarket
  2. Organizational cultures that pull efforts toward upmarket projects
  3. The upmarket drift of a company’s customers and competitors



#### Barrier #1: Cost Structure

As discussed in Chapter 2, organizations develop cost structures that fit their value networks—value networks for higher-priced products require larger gross profit margins to cover higher overhead costs than value networks for lower-priced goods. These cost structures force companies to maintain profit margins to simply stay afloat.

In fact, **most companies aim to move to progressively higher-value markets.** This is especially true when disruptive technologies invade their markets, because the disruptive products generally enter the low end of the market and gradually climb to higher tiers. For example, when 3.5-inch disk drives ascended from the laptop to the desktop market, Seagate didn’t try to compete—instead, the company increased efforts to improve 5.25-inch drives enough to enter the market for minicomputers.

If an established company wants to invest its limited resources in the small, low-profit market for a disruptive product, company leaders would have to find a way to somehow cut costs. However, a company’s overhead costs include market research, product development, and marketing that’s critical to remaining competitive in its existing market. **Most companies find it impossible to bring in enough profits from existing products while also trimming overhead enough to invest in disruptive ones.**

#### Barrier #2: Organizational Culture

A company’s upward or downward mobility is determined by the projects it chooses to invest in, and most companies have processes that steer them toward high-profit projects. Although it may appear that senior managers are responsible for choosing the projects that a company invests in, middle managers actually play a more significant role in this process as gatekeepers.

Middle managers filter the ideas that come from engineers and other employees, carefully deciding which projects they’ll pitch to senior managers. **Middle managers want to pitch only projects with a high likelihood of success and profitability** —otherwise, they risk taking a hit to their credibilities and careers—**and upmarket projects are the surest way to achieve that.**

Under normal circumstances, a company’s success depends on having processes like this (formal or de facto) that weed out low-profit projects—otherwise, the company would waste too many resources on projects that don’t provide a return on investment. But these same processes steer companies away from disruptive technologies, making the firms vulnerable to being overtaken by the disruption.

#### Barrier #3: Upmarket Drift

Often, companies can drift upmarket without making a conscious effort to ascend to the next value network. **Companies drift upmarket when their customers are pursuing higher markets, and when their competitors are similarly leaning upmarket to meet customers’ needs.**

As companies move upmarket, they create openings in lower value networks for entrants to move in with disruptive products. Let’s look at how this played out in the steel industry.

### Case Study: Minimills Disrupted the Steel Industry

In the mid-1960s, steel minimills disrupted the steel industry. As the name suggests, the minimills were simply steel mills at a much smaller scale.

**When they emerged, the minimills could only produce lower-quality, lower-cost steel products than the established firms, the integrated steel mills.** The only product they could make with the lower-quality steel was reinforcing bars (rebars), which were used to strengthen concrete.

Rebars represented the lowest quality, cost, and profits of any steel products. Additionally, rebar customers were less loyal to manufacturers than customers of any other steel products, because price mattered more than any other attribute. As a result, integrated steel mills didn’t miss the rebar customers that the minimills took from them.

Over time, minimills increased the quality of their steel and invested in equipment to make different products. Minimills subsequently took over the next two highest markets:

  1. Larger bars, rods, and angle irons
  2. Structural beams



Paradoxically, integrated steel mills’ profits grew at the same time they were being pushed out of these low markets. **Ceding the lowest-profit products to the minimills allowed the integrated mills to invest in high-quality steel products, such as rolled sheet steel, that brought in the biggest profits.** As a bonus, the rolled sheet steel market was insulated from minimills’ threat because minimills couldn’t afford the equipment needed to make high-quality sheet steel—but that wouldn’t be true for long.

#### Thin-Slab Casting Causes Another Disruption

In 1987, the steel industry was disrupted again by a new technology called continuous thin-slab casting, which opened the sheet steel market to minimills. The technology offered a much more efficient way of producing sheet steel at a significantly lower cost than traditional methods, and it made it feasible for minimills to begin producing sheet steel.

However, the quality of thin-slab cast sheet steel was initially too low to appeal to high-end customers, such as car, can, and appliance makers. The steel was only suitable for the low end of the market, for products such as corrugated steel and pipes. Since thin-slab sheet steel would only attract limited customers—and bring in low profits—**integrated steel mills didn’t adopt the technology, instead investing in equipment to further improve the quality of their sheet steel for their high-end customers.**

Unrestrained by high-end customers and higher cost structures, a minimill called Nucor was the first to adopt the thin-slab casting technology. Within seven years of opening its first thin-slab facility, Nucor had opened a second mill and controlled 7 percent of the sheet steel market in North America.

With time, the technology improved and raised the quality of the sheet steel. (Shortform note:

Eventually, thin-slab casting could produce quality that traditional thick-slab casters couldn’t achieve. By 2017, only nine integrated steel mills were still operating in the U.S., and they produced about one-third of the country’s steel. By contrast, there were more than 100 minimills that produced nearly two-thirds of the country’s steel.)
