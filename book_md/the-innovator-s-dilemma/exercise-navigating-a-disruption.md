## Exercise: Navigating a Disruption

How would you lead your company through a disruptive innovation?

* * *

Imagine you’re the leader of an established company and a new innovation is emerging in your industry that threatens your current business. First, how would you determine whether or not it’s disruptive?

Now imagine that you’ve determined that the innovation is disruptive, and you decide that you want to spin-out an independent entity dedicated to the innovation. How do you make the case for investing in a risky, uncertain venture to your skeptical board of directors?

How involved would you be in the independent organization?

How would you ensure the entity was truly independent from the main organization (for example, staffing a dedicated team or putting the operation in a different physical location)?
