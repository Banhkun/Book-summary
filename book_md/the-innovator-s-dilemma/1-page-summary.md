## 1-Page Summary

Successful companies who pay attention to what their customers want and invest their resources in what generates the most profits usually continue to succeed. However, when a disruptive innovation shakes up an industry, these normally sound business practices can drive established market leaders to fail. This phenomenon is what Harvard Business School professor and leading expert on business innovation Clayton M. Christensen calls “the innovator’s dilemma.”

In _The Innovator’s Dilemma,_ Christensen first presents a theory to explain why disruptive innovations can cause business practices that normally bring success to bring failure instead, and then offers advice on how to adopt disruptive innovations successfully. Christensen published the first edition of The Innovator’s Dilemma in 1997, during the height of the era’s tech boom. The book was hailed as one of the best business books not only of that year, but ever written, and it was quickly adopted as a resource for CEOs and management leaders.

In this guide, we’ll examine Christensen’s theory and advice, and we’ll contrast it with the perspectives of other experts on the subject, such as Geoffrey Moore, W. Chan Kim, and Renee Mauborgne. Moore is the author of _Crossing the Chasm_ , which addresses the same issue from the perspective of a start-up company _trying_ to displace market leaders with a disruptive innovation. Kim and Mauborgne are the authors of _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , in which they present a strategy for introducing disruptive innovations to reshape the market in ways that make your competitors irrelevant and give your company room to grow.

### Why Disruptive Innovations Are Disruptive to Established Companies

To explore Christensen’s theory, we’ll first examine what a disruptive innovation is and the difference between _disruptive_ innovations and _sustaining_ innovations. Then we’ll discuss how these innovations disrupt markets and their characteristics that create problems for established companies.

#### Disruptive Versus Sustaining Innovations

Christensen defines a “**disruptive innovation** ” as **any new product that disrupts the mainstream market**. For example, in the early 1900s mechanical tractors took over the draft-horse market. He also calls “disruptive innovation” a “discontinuous” innovation because it causes previous technologies or business practices to be discontinued.

Christensen explains that typically, a disruptive innovation involves a drastically different approach to doing something, which, at first, doesn’t appeal to mainstream customers. Instead, it appeals only to a developing niche of customers with different needs. However, as the new product becomes more refined, its capabilities increase to the point where it offers greater value than traditional options in the mainstream market. At that point, he says, mainstream customers begin adopting it en masse, disrupting the market.

Christensen contrasts disruptive innovations with “sustaining innovations,” which he defines as incremental improvements to a product that don’t alter the market. For example, an early tractor manufacturer might switch from using two-cylinder engines to four-cylinder engines. This makes their tractors more powerful and efficient, but it doesn’t change who buys the tractors or why they buy them. Sustaining innovations are also called “continuous” innovations.

> **Comparing Definitions of Disruptive Innovation**
> 
> Geoffrey Moore provides a slightly different definition of the difference between sustaining and disruptive innovations.
> 
> According to Moore, a disruptive (or discontinuous) innovation is any new product that requires the customer to change how he uses a product in order to adopt it. For example, a farmer who sells his plow horses and buys a mechanical tractor now has to buy fuel for the tractor instead of feeding hay to his horses. Instead of having a ferrier periodically put new shoes on his horses, he has to have a technician perform maintenance on his tractor. He has to develop new skills and work with different suppliers to make use of the new technology.
> 
> Similarly, according to Moore, a sustaining (or continuous) innovation is a product that is improved in some way but doesn’t require the customer to change in order to benefit from the improvement. For example, a farmer who upgrades from a two-cylinder tractor to a four-cylinder tractor can still buy fuel from the same supplier and have it serviced by the same technician.
> 
> Thus, to Moore, a disruptive innovation is disruptive _to the customer’s life or routine_ , while to Christensen, a disruptive innovation is _disruptive to the market_. In principle, these are fundamentally different definitions. Hypothetically, if John Deere introduced an autonomous tractor that required farmers to learn C++ programming, and farmers gradually adopted it without disrupting the market, then Moore would call it a disruptive innovation, while Christensen would call it a sustaining innovation.

#### How Disruptive Innovations Reshape Markets

Christensen outlines the typical chronology by which disruptive innovations displace established companies:

  1. Someone invents a disruptive product, forms a start-up company, and begins producing it. 
  2. Established companies evaluate the product and decide it wouldn’t be profitable in their current market, so they don’t pursue it.
  3. Through trial and error, the start-up finds an emerging market for their product. 
  4. The start-up continues to refine their product. Eventually, its value (capabilities and reliability at its price point) surpasses traditional alternatives, and mainstream customers become interested in it.
  5. The disruptive product begins to dominate not only the emerging market that formed around it, but also the mainstream market, displacing traditional alternatives.
  6. Established companies realize that they are losing market share to the disruptive innovation, but by then it’s too late for them to defend their market share, even if they adopt the innovation themselves.



> **Comparing Chronologies**
> 
> Christensen presents his chronology of disruptive innovations from the standpoint of a business analyst and advisor to established companies. Moore presents a similar chronology from the standpoint of giving a start-up company a battle plan for conquering the mainstream market. Let’s consider Moore’s chronology and compare it to Christensen’s:
> 
>   1. You come up with a revolutionary product. (This is the first step in disruptive innovation according to almost any expert.)
> 
>   2. You sell your first few units to curious customers who try it out and corroborate the claim that you’ve created a novel product. These early enthusiasts probably won’t buy enough for you to make much money, but they help you refine the product and get the word out to a broader audience by word of mouth. In Christensen’s chronology, this is step three. His step two says that established companies first reject the new product—a step that Moore, in this chronology, doesn’t address.
> 
>   3. You connect with a few ambitious customers who see your product’s future potential. They want to use your product for something specific and have the capital to implement it. You sign a lucrative contract with them to improve and customize your product to meet their needs. A few such contracts make up the bulk of what Moore calls the “early market.” Moore’s “early market” corresponds to Christensen’s “emerging market,” so this step closely corresponds to Christensen’s third step.
> 
>   4. You select a single niche application for your product and refine it to provide indisputably better value in that application, allowing you to become the market leader in that niche. This corresponds to the first half of Christensen’s fourth step, though he doesn’t mention niche applications explicitly.
> 
>   5. You continue to refine your product and expand into an adjacent niche. Repeat. As you become the market leader in more and more sectors, eventually you dominate the entire mainstream market. This corresponds to the second half of step four and step five of Christensen’s chronology. At this point, Moore’s mission is accomplished, so he doesn’t go on to discuss the fate of the former market leaders that you displaced, as Christensen does in his sixth step.
> 
> 


#### Problems That Disruptive Innovations Cause for Established Companies

Why don’t established companies just embrace the innovation at step two and reap its benefits, instead of falling behind until step six? Christensen explains that there are a number of reasons established companies rarely adopt disruptive innovations before it’s too late.

##### 1\. Disruptive Innovations Get Started in Small Markets

As Christensen points out, it takes a big market to sustain a big company. However, when they first appear, disruptive innovations usually appeal only to a niche market that’s too small to be of interest to large, established companies. Thus, the companies that pursue disruptive innovations tend to be start-ups that are small enough to cater to small markets. If the market grows as the technology matures, the companies have a chance to grow with the market. However, by the time the market gets big enough for big companies to take notice, it may be too late for those larger companies to catch up.

(Shortform note: Marketing experts Al Ries and Jack Trout explain that in any given market, the first company to assume a position of market leadership in the minds of customers usually remains the market leader. Thus, market forces tend to prevent late adopters from claiming much of the market share, even in cases where the disruptive innovation doesn’t involve a significant technological learning curve.)

##### 2\. Disruptive Innovations Don’t Appeal to Existing Customers

Christensen explains that when a disruptive innovation first appears, an established company’s customers usually have no interest in it, because its performance characteristics are usually inferior to more mature technologies. Initially, the new innovation doesn’t compete for the same customers that buy the company’s current products. The few customers that it does attract have special interests that the new product uniquely addresses.

> **The Technology Adoption Life Cycle**
> 
> Christensen says that the market for disruptive innovations usually starts out as a small, niche market. Others have also studied this phenomenon and developed models to explain it.
> 
> Probably the best-known model is the “Diffusion of Innovations,” which was originally developed by two agricultural scientists George Beal and Joe Bohlen. This model was generalized and popularized by Everet Rogers, and then refined by Moore, who called it the “Technology Adoption Life Cycle,” or TALC.
> 
> As Moore presents it, the TALC predicts that the market for any disruptive innovation is made up of five groups of people, who become interested in the technology at different stages of its development:
> 
>   * **“Techies” or “Innovators”** love new technology for its own sake. They buy new products just to try them out and are happy to tinker with things in order to make them work, but they only represent about 2% of the population.
> 
>   * **“Early Adopters” or “Visionaries”** see emerging technologies as opportunities to gain revolutionary capabilities before anyone else does. They represent about one-sixth of the population.
> 
>   * **The “Early Majority” or “Pragmatists”** hope to benefit by keeping up with the state of the art, but they only buy proven products from reputable companies. They represent about a third of the population.
> 
>   * **The “Late Majority” or “Conservatives”** don’t care about keeping up with the latest developments, but they don’t want to be left behind either. They tend to value simplicity, convenience, and affordability over performance. They make up about one-third of the population.
> 
>   * **The “Laggards” or “Skeptics”** are innately skeptical of anything new. They never buy new technology if they can avoid it. They make up about one-sixth of the population.
> 
> 

> 
> Thus, when a disruptive innovation is introduced, the first customers are the “techies,” and so the initial market will be limited to a few percent of the overall population. Meanwhile, the majority of an established company’s customers will be members of the early and late majorities, who don’t become interested until the innovation has been refined and standardized.

##### 3\. Disruptive Innovations Can’t Demonstrate Potential Growth

As Christensen points out, most established companies are under pressure to maintain a steady, positive rate of growth to keep their stock prices going up and thereby keep their stockholders happy. Therefore, when investing in a new product, companies are expected to promise substantial growth to justify their investment. However, even if a company recognizes that the market for a disruptive technology may grow as the technology matures, they can’t show their shareholders and investors market data on markets that don’t exist yet. This makes it hard for them to justify investing in innovations, because established companies are used to making strategic decisions based on sound market research.

(Shortform note: Compounding the problem of predicting which innovations may offer long-term growth and which will not is the fact that not _every_ disruptive technology grows to take over the mainstream market. In fact, the majority of disruptive innovations only flourish briefly in an early market made up of techies and early adopters, after which they stagnate and die without making it into the mainstream market.)

##### 4\. Disruptive Innovations Require Retooling

Christensen asserts that established companies are often poorly positioned to produce or sell disruptive products because the new innovation takes a different approach, requiring different component parts or manufacturing methods. This, in turn, may require different supply networks. The company’s operations are tailored to its current products and thus are not optimized for new innovation. They may not even be able to accommodate it without an expensive overhaul.

For example, suppose a horse trader wants to start dealing in automobiles. The horse trader already has connections with ranchers and breeders who supply him with wholesale horses, but he’ll need to develop new relationships with automobile manufacturers. He also has stables to keep his horses in, and barns to store hay, but he’ll have to remodel them to store automobiles and spare parts. He currently pays stable hands to feed and water the horses every day, but that won’t be necessary with automobiles, so he’ll have to re-think his daily routines and operating procedures to keep his employees productive.

> **Retooling for Innovations in Sales Methods**
> 
> This principle applies to practically all disruptive innovations, not just physical products. In _The Challenger Sale_ , Mathew Dixon and Brent Adamson explain “solution selling,” a disruptive innovation in business-to-business sales: Instead of simply fulfilling purchase orders, you would sell the customer a complete solution customized to their needs.
> 
> But this changed the relationship between the customer and the salesperson. Instead of just delivering what the customer ordered, the sales rep had to assume a consultative role, challenging the customer to rethink their operations and showing them how they could benefit from a customized solution.
> 
> Dixon and Adamson observed that relatively few sales reps were able to transition to solution selling, because they struggled to mentally retool their role, just like a factory struggling to retool its production lines for a different product.

##### 5\. Disruptive Innovations Appear Down-Market of Established Products

Christensen argues that most companies tend to move up-market over time, appealing to increasingly demanding customers, and reaping higher profits from higher-end products as the company gains experience and refines its products. However, disruptive innovations usually start out down-market—they start out relatively simplistic and have to be priced at the lower end of the market spectrum.

(Shortform note: Al Ries and Jack Trout offer additional insight on why disruptive innovations start out down-market. They assert that budget-friendly versions of new innovations tend to sell better, because customers see the technology as unproven. The lower cost reduces the risk of buying it.)

Christensen points out that to adopt the new innovation, a company would have to shift its focus back toward the lower end of the market. This is financially problematic because of the lower profits per unit sold. It’s also culturally problematic, because it’s hard to give up the prestige that you’ve built up and start over.

> **Cross-Examining Up-Market Mobility**
> 
> Do companies really tend to drift up-market over time as Christensen says? It makes sense that, as you gain experience with making a particular product, you’ll figure out how to make it better. In principle your product should move up-market as it improves. However, in practice, the marketing concept of _positioning_ makes it difficult to move up-market or down-market.
> 
> Your “positioning” is how customers see your product or brand. For example, do they see you as the quality leader in your industry? Or the cheap knock-off? Or the environmentally-friendly option? Or the version made especially for a particular gender, age group, or other demographic?
> 
> Marketing experts assert that once customers have established your position on the market landscape, it is very difficult to change their perception of your product or brand. So if you start out selling entry-level products and customers recognize your place in the market, it may be difficult to move up-market, even if your quality improves over time.

### What You Can Do to Adopt Disruptive Innovations Successfully

We’ve explained what disruptive innovations are, how they disrupt markets, and why they’re a problem for established companies. Now let’s examine Christensen’s advice on how established companies can overcome these problems.

Christensen’s recommendation is to establish an organization that functions like a small start-up within the parent company. This works because, as we’ve seen, most of the problems that prevent established companies from investing in disruptive innovations are irrelevant to small start-ups.

You can create the organization either as a spin-off of your existing operations, or by acquiring an existing start-up. Either way, Christensen stresses that the new organization must have adequate autonomy to explore and develop disruptive innovations. It will struggle if it has to compete for resources with the company’s sustaining-innovation projects, because it operates in an emerging market where there’s less opportunity for high-volume sales. It may also need to develop supply chains and operating procedures that are incompatible with those of the parent company.

(Shortform note: In _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne argue that emerging markets with less opportunity for high-volume sales are actually the most secure path to eventual high-volume sales, as a company’s best chance to grow and succeed is when it operates in an uncontested market—as it would when introducing a disruptive innovation. They argue that although you may have difficulty in developing new supply chains and operating procedures, as Christensen mentions, your competitors will also. Thus, the challenges you might face as a start-up can end up being your strengths because they delay other players from entering the market.)

Christensen also stresses the importance of budgeting for multiple attempts at marketing the disruptive innovation. Recall that start-ups often have to find the emergent market by trial and error, because there’s no actual data on markets that don’t exist yet, which makes them impossible to accurately forecast. You may have to explore several different applications or niche markets before you find one where the product takes off.

> **Making Decisions Without Data**
> 
> Moore echoes Christensen’s observation that emergent markets are hard to forecast because you can’t gather metrics on them yet. However, where Christensen advocates mitigating the uncertainty by budgeting for multiple attempts, Moore suggests using customer characterizations to guide your planning.
> 
> Each customer characterization is a description of a hypothetical customer, complete with information about their age, job, goals, and so on. These descriptions should be as realistic and as lifelike as possible. Once you’ve created profiles for the archetypical customers that might want your product, you use them to think through hypothetical purchasing scenarios: What does the customer’s current situation look like without your product? How would having your product solve her current problems? Is the improvement enough to compel her to buy?
> 
> By anticipating how each hypothetical customer would behave in each scenario, you can assess which customer would be most likely to buy your product. According to Moore, this method works because your intuition is much better at predicting how a person would respond to a situation than it is at predicting the behavior of abstract entities like markets. And when you’re introducing a disruptive innovation, you have to make decisions based on informed intuition, because you don’t have enough data to make an analytical decision.
> 
> Of course, these two methods are not mutually exclusive. When you’re operating in uncharted technological territory, it’s prudent to inform your intuition with customer characterizations _and_ budget for multiple attempts whenever possible.

> **Managing an Acquired Start-Up (Or Spin-Off)**
> 
> Like Christensen, business and marketing consultant Regis McKenna points out that collaboration between a large, established company and a small, innovative start-up organization can be beneficial because of their different strengths and capabilities. However, he also points out that their differences can make collaboration difficult, so much so that many attempts at collaboration end in bankruptcy for one or both organizations.
> 
> McKenna notes that collaboration can take the form of a joint venture, an acquisition, or any other agreement to work together on something. He doesn’t specifically mention collaboration between a parent company and a start-up-like spin-off organization within the company, but since this relationship is very similar to that of an acquired start-up, we infer that the same problems would apply.
> 
> McKenna identifies two keys to effective collaboration between a start-up and an established company:
> 
> **1\. Adequate separation.** Both organizations must retain enough autonomy that they each have their own supply lines, customers, and unique culture. He warns that without adequate separation, the culture and resources of the larger organization tend to crowd out those of the smaller start-up, such that the start-up’s strengths are lost.
> 
> Christensen mirrors this idea by recommending that a start-up or spin-off have autonomy so that it can explore innovations without influence from the parent company. He also implicitly acknowledges McKenna’s advice by pointing out the problems that established companies have adopting disruptive innovations: Most of these are not a problem for a small start-up, but if the start-up gets absorbed into the established company (or is never sufficiently separate from it) then the established company’s problems will still apply.
> 
> **2\. Adequate communication.** While maintaining autonomy, the two organizations also need to communicate enough that they both have a clear understanding of who is responsible for what. McKenna warns that when organizations try to collaborate without adequate communication, important tasks are often left undone because each org assumes the other is taking care of it.
> 
> Christensen doesn’t address this, likely because he considered only collaboration between an _acquired_ start-up or a spin-off organization, and doesn’t address collaboration between _separate companies_. We might infer that collaboration between separate companies more often fails due to inadequate communication, while collaboration between two organizations of the same parent company is more likely to fail due to inadequate separation.
