## Chapter 7: Principle #3—There’s No Market Research for Unknown Markets

Most companies and managers make strategies, plans, and decisions based on analyses of market trends and projections based on those trends. Using this data, managers make detailed plans for executing new projects.

The problem is that this approach doesn’t work for disruptive technologies, because **disruptive products sell to markets that didn’t previously exist, so there are no data to measure past patterns or make projections about future needs.**

Exacerbating the problem is the fact that success in disruptive innovations favors companies that move quickly—so companies must act fast, but they have little information to create a plan of action.

### Solution: Focus Your Strategy on Learning, Not Executing

To accommodate the inherent lack of information, company leaders confronting disruptive innovations need to make strategies and plans around _learning_ , not _executing_.

Instead of outlining how to execute the production and launch of a product—as they would in sustaining technologies—**managers leading disruptive innovations must acknowledge what they don’t know, identify what data they need, and in what order they need it.** This discovery-driven planning prevents companies from committing too many resources before they have adequate information.

Additionally, teams launching disruptive projects should:

  1. **Assume forecasts are wrong.** Disruptive markets are unpredictable, meaning that the correct marketing strategies are unknowable. Accept that trial and error is inevitable.
  2. **Plan—and budget—for multiple attempts.** It’s almost guaranteed that a company will initially choose the _wrong_ strategy to market a disruptive technology, so managers shouldn’t hedge all their bets on the first attempt. Instead, build flexibility into project strategies and conserve enough resources to adjust the product and the strategy as they learn more about the market. 
  3. **Watch customers’ behavior** as they begin to use disruptive products. Don’t listen to what customers _say_ they want. Until a disruptive product spends some time on the market, neither companies nor customers know who will use a disruptive product or how they’ll use it.



Now let’s look at some case studies in the disk drive, motorcycle, and microprocessor industries.

### Hewlett-Packard Bet Everything on Plan A

In the early 1990s, Hewlett-Packard’s Disk Memory Division (DMD) pitched a 1.3-inch disk drive that they named Kittyhawk.

As a $20 billion company, HP had high profit goals to meet, so executives demanded that the product reach $150 million in revenue within three years. DMD employees were confident they could reach the goal, because **they were targeting the emerging market of personal digital assistants (PDAs), and they expected PDAs to boom.**

HP worked with PDA makers to determine the capabilities Kittyhawk would need to suit the devices. Many of the PDA makers—including Apple, IBM, and Microsoft—also designed their new products to fit Kittyhawk.

**Neither HP nor the PDA makers predicted that the PDA market would largely turn out to be a flop.** As we talked about, Apple’s Newton had sales that would’ve excited a small company, but they fell far short of expectations. The same was true across the industry, and Kittyhawk’s sales suffered.

However, a different market for Kittyhawk materialized. HP sold the drives to makers of electronic cameras, miniature cash registers, industrial scanners, and portable Japanese-language word processors.

Then Kittyhawk got an opportunity for redemption: Video game system makers approached HP about using Kittyhawk in their devices, which would’ve been a significant sales boost. But the drive would need to be less robust so it could have a lower price point.

**By that point, HP had already invested so many resources into tailoring Kittyhawk to PDAs that executives weren’t willing to spend the time and money on redesigning it to fit the video game system market.** They hadn’t expected that it might take multiple iterations of the disruptive product to get it right.

A discovery-driven approach would have kept the Kittyhawk team from betting big on PDAs. Instead of tailoring the drives so specifically to the needs of PDAs, the team could have made the design flexible enough to allow them to easily add or remove features for other customers that emerged. And instead of investing in a high-volume, automated production line, the team could have built smaller production facilities and been open to the possibility of building more later if necessary.

### Honda Couldn’t Compete with Harley-Davidson, So It Sold Smaller Bikes

After World War II, Honda produced small, rugged motorbikes called Supercubs in Japan that were popular for businesses making deliveries in crowded urban areas. The bikes became so successful that their annual sales rose from 1,200 in 1949 to 285,000 in 1959.

Company leaders wanted to expand to North America, but they saw no market for the Supercub. Americans favored larger, more powerful motorcycles—like Harley-Davidsons—that were designed for long distances.

**Honda designed a motorcycle that fit the American market’s demands, but the product didn’t catch on.** Motorcycle dealers were reluctant to sell an unproven product. Among the motorcycles that sold, many developed mechanical issues when faced with the long distances and high speeds American customers demanded. Not only were sales low, but the company was also losing money shipping warrantied replacement bikes from Japan.

At the start of the North American motorcycle project, Honda had sent three employees to Los Angeles to manage American sales, and each had brought his own Supercub to ride around locally. One day, one of the employees—frustrated by the struggling sales—rode his Supercub through the hills near his home to let off steam. He started making a habit of it, and he eventually invited his coworkers to join him with their Supercubs.

Soon, their neighbors wanted to know where they could get their own Supercubs, so the Honda employees special-ordered a few bikes. Over the next few years, the Supercubs gradually expanded this way, but **Honda was so focused on trying to sell its motorcycles that it didn’t recognize the growing off-road market for Supercubs.** The company even denied a request from Sears to purchase the Supercubs for its outdoor power equipment departments.

Eventually, Honda’s employees in LA realized that the company needed to shift its focus. Instead of trying to enter the American motorcycle market with its inferior long-distance bike, the company needed to develop the emerging off-road market for Supercubs, a product Honda had fine-tuned through years of production.

Traditional management philosophies call for managers to assess unexpected _failures_ , but the key to finding the markets for disruptive technologies is to recognize unexpected _successes_ —that’s how Honda finally caught on to the off-roading market for its Supercub bike. **Honda’s first attempt at targeting the North American market was wrong, but its success would depend on how agilely it could pivot to another strategy based on customers’ behaviors.**

#### Serving the Supercub Market

After company leaders got on board, Honda struggled to find dealers to sell the Supercubs—there were simply no retailers that carried anything like it. Eventually, Honda managed to find some sporting goods dealers that would sell the bikes.

Over time, Honda improved the Supercub’s performance while lowering its price and increasing production volume. **Honda released bikes with increasing engine power, and the Supercubs started creeping upmarket.**

Feeling the competition, Harley-Davidson produced a small motorbike with less power than its traditional products. But the company faced a few obstacles: First, Harley-Davidson had nowhere near Honda’s experience and expertise in producing small bikes.

Second, **the dealers that sold Harley-Davidson’s motorcycles didn’t want to sell the smaller bikes** , because:

  1. Bigger, more expensive bikes brought in higher profit margins than the new low-end models. 
  2. The small bikes would jeopardize Harley-Davidson’s image among its loyal customers.



Harley-Davidson’s experience illustrates how established firms can be held captive not just by their customers, but also by fellow members of their value networks (as we talked about in Chapter 2)—in this case, the dealers.

### Intel Unknowingly Invested in the Microprocessor

In the 1970s, Intel successfully navigated the rise of disruptive microprocessing technology—though it was not through strategic decision-making by management.

Microprocessors emerged at a time when standard computers relied on complicated circuitry. Although microprocessors had less capacity than standard circuitry, they were also smaller and simpler—typical assets of disruptive products.

Intel first developed the microprocessor for a project with a Japanese calculator manufacturer. After the project was over, Intel bought the patent from the Japanese company. Intel had no plan for marketing the technology, so it just sold it to customers upon request.

Intel was a leader in the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market, and that’s where the company’s executives focused. However, **the personal computer market was emerging, and microprocessors turned out to be perfect for the rising technology.**

The company used an automated system to determine how it allocated resources and, unbeknownst to executives, the system saved the company from stumbling in the face of disruptive technology. **Microprocessors were earning high gross margins while DRAM’s margins dipped, so the automated system shifted increasing resources to microprocessors.** Ultimately,**** Intel became the leading microprocessor maker in the world.

Intel’s forecasts about the market for microprocessors were completely wrong, and the company’s automated system was its saving grace. After IBM decided to use Intel’s microprocessors as a critical component in IBM’s new personal computer model—which was a major victory for Intel—Intel’s forecasts still didn’t list PCs among the 50 top applications for the microprocessors.
