## Exercise: Success Is Relative

A company’s profits and achievements are relative to the organization’s overall size and level of success.

* * *

If you’ve been with your company for a while, what was a milestone achievement that the company reached during your first year? If you can’t remember specifically, what was the nature of the company’s goals and achievements?

How does that compare with the kinds of goals the company sets and accomplishments it celebrates now?

How would company leaders react now if you pitched a project that would bring the level of success you described in your first answer?

How would you pitch a project like this to managers if it were also tied to a disruptive innovation?

If your company is currently working on a disruptive project, how have company leaders approached this project differently than other projects?
