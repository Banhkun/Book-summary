## Chapter 9: Principle #5—Customers Don’t Always Want the Newest Technology

As we’ve mentioned, technology often advances more rapidly than customers’ demand for bigger, better, faster products. When companies aren’t in tune with their customers’ needs, they continually update their products with new features and performance improvements—and the prices reflect the upgrades. This gap between technology performance and customer demand is called performance oversupply. **Customers don’t always want the very best; they just want good enough to get the job done.**

The problem for established companies is that performance oversupply creates an opening for disruptive technology to forge a place in the market. **Disruptive products that meet customers’ needs and offer lower prices, convenience, and more simplicity can edge existing products—and established firms—out of the market.**

### The Evolution of Product Life Cycles

Technology oversupply triggers products to enter the next phase in their life cycles. Each phase is characterized by the primary reason customers choose one product over another. The phases include:

  1. **Functionality** : Which product does the job best? 
  2. **Reliability** : Which product does the job most consistently? 
  3. **Convenience** : Which product is easiest to buy and use? 
  4. **Price** : Which product is the most affordable? 



Once products satisfy the needs of the current life cycle phase, the product evolves to the next phase.

For example, the 3.5-inch disk drive followed close to this model. By the time the drive’s capacity had increased enough to meet the needs of the desktop computer market, the 5.25-inch drives offered almost three times the capacity customers needed. When 3.5-inch drives became _good enough_ , desktop makers suddenly had a choice between the two drives.

Until that point, capacity—in other words, functionality—had been the main priority. But **once both drives met desktop makers’ capacity needs, the 3.5-inch drives’ smaller size attracted the computer makers** , because it allowed them to make smaller computers. Within four years of hitting the market, 3.5-inch drives captured 60 percent of drive sales.

After 3.5-inch drives had gotten as small as desktop makers needed them to be, the focus shifted to the drives’ reliability, and finally to price. At this point, the 3.5-inch drives became a commodity, meaning the product had gone through all four phases of its life cycle.

#### How Disruptive Innovations Impact Product Life Cycles

Although uncertainties are inherent in developing disruptive products, companies can make more informed decisions by understanding product life cycles and how they’re impacted by disruptive innovations.

In addition to performance oversupply, there are two aspects of disruptive technologies that impact product life cycles:

1) **The features that make the disruptive innovation _unattractive_ in the existing market are precisely what make it _attractive_ in the emerging market.** For example, the Hydrohoe excavator’s small bucket capacity was unappealing to traditional excavation contractors, but it was perfect for a new market of homebuilders who needed to dig narrow trenches.

Established companies often fail because they frame disruptive innovations as _technological_ challenges, because they get stuck on the product’s functionality. Established companies tend to think that they must improve the new technology until it meets the existing market’s needs.

By contrast, entrant companies succeed because they look beyond functionality alone, understanding that other attributes in the product life cycle attract customers, as well. Startups frame disruptive technologies as a _marketing_ challenge—they simply have to find the right market to fit the product.

2) **Disruptive products are typically more reliable, convenient, simple, and affordable than existing products** —falling into later stages of the product life cycle—because established companies often fall into the trap of continually improving products to target higher-tier markets. For example, HP’s disruptive effort failed with the 1.3-inch Kittyhawk drive because the company tricked it out with features and functionality to fit PDAs, but it wasn’t simple or affordable enough to meet the needs of the video-game market that emerged.

### Solution: Three Options for Companies Facing Performance Oversupply

Companies that may be facing performance oversupply should evaluate how the technology and customers’ needs will likely progress.

Is the technology likely to continue advancing, or will it soon be plateauing on the S-curve? And will customers have a need for additional improvements, or are there limitations for how they can use the technology? For example, car makers may be able to make engines more powerful, but drivers still have to abide by speed limits.

By assessing these two trajectories, managers can determine the likelihood of performance oversupply. Companies that face performance oversupply have three options:

  1. **Climb upmarket** , continually adopting sustaining technologies and pursuing higher-tier customers, while leaving lower-tier customers open for disruptive innovations. This is the course most companies take. 
  2. **Keep pace with customers** , meeting their needs even as their focus shifts from functionality to reliability to convenience to price. This is difficult to do successfully, for reasons we’ve talked about throughout this summary (for example, companies’ processes and values impede them from producing lower-cost products). 
  3. **Leverage marketing to make customers want higher-performing products.** However, it’s unclear how long a company can sustain this approach before a lower-tier disruptive product invades the market. 



Any of these strategies can work if a company executes it with a clear understanding of the trajectories of its customers’ needs and of the technological advancements.

### Case Studies

Performance oversupply is straightforward in theory, but it requires managers to be acutely tuned into their customers and the market as a whole.

Throughout a product’s existence up to that point, the managers have maintained success by asking the same question: How can we make this product perform better? Managers must recognize when that is no longer the most important question.

We’ll look at two companies that succeeded by _not_ making functionality their top priority.

#### Intuit’s Simple Software Disrupted the Market

The company Intuit exploited performance oversupply in the financial software market. Intuit disrupted the market with Quicken for personal finances and Quickbooks for small business accounting. Both products were far easier and more convenient to use than competing products.

Existing financial software was robust, capable of producing detailed reports and analyses—but the individuals and small-business owners using the software didn’t need (and often didn’t know how to use) that level of sophistication. The performance oversupply made space for Intuit to take over, and Quickbooks dominated 70 percent of the market within two years of its debut.

**Over time, the company maintained its dominance by making the software increasingly simple and convenient—not by adding features.** Engineers took their cues from watching how customers used the software, and identifying aspects that might be confusing, instead of acting on the results of market surveys and expert analyses.

#### Convenience Eclipsed Quality in the Insulin Market

In a far different market, two companies took vastly different approaches to disrupting the market for insulin, which diabetics use to stabilize their blood sugar.

Insulin manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company spent decades leading the industry. The company continually made sustaining innovations by increasing the purity of insulin, which was extracted from cows’ and pigs’ pancreases. By 1980, Eli Lilly reduced the impurities to .02 percent of the levels in 1925.

However, the tiny amount of impurities that remained caused a negative reaction in a small portion of users. To resolve this, Eli Lilly invested nearly $1 billion in developing 100 percent pure insulin. But when the company introduced its product, which cost 25 percent more than competing products, sales were disappointing. **It turned out that most of the market was satisfied with slightly impure insulin.**

Around the same time, a smaller company, called Novo, introduced a truly disruptive product in the market: insulin pens. These pens made taking insulin much easier and faster than the existing technology. Although the pens cost 30 percent more than other insulin products, sales soared.

The reason Novo’s innovation outperformed Eli Lilly’s may seem clear in retrospect—**the pens made the daily task of taking insulin far easier for all customers, while the purer insulin simply reduced the risk to a small number of customers.** However, in the midst of things, it’s difficult for executives to have the clarity to recognize when a product is entering the next phase of its life cycle.
