## Chapter 8: Principle #4—A Company’s Capabilities Determine Its Disabilities

Established firms become successful by developing certain capabilities that help them to efficiently and profitably develop, market, and sell their goods or services. Each company’s capabilities are specific to its product and the value networks.

However, the same characteristics that define a company’s strengths in one context constitute weaknesses in another. In this way, a company’s capabilities and disabilities are two sides of the same coin.

**Disruptive innovations require a different context—** a different value network, cost structure, and production process—**than existing products, which turns established companies’ _capabilities_ into _disabilities_ when confronting disruptive innovations. **

### Defining Capabilities

Capabilities fall into three categories:

  1. **Resources** , such as people, money, technology, knowledge, customers, and relationships with suppliers and distributors. When assessing a company’s capabilities, managers tend to focus primarily on resources. 
  2. **Processes** , such as patterns of communication, coordination, and decision-making. Processes are the methods by which the company turns resources into output and ensures the goods or services are uniform. 
  3. **Values** , which dictate how the company and its employees make prioritizing decisions. Values impact how every employee makes decisions, big and small—from how to manage their time to which new projects to take on. 



#### Resources

**Resource-based disabilities are the easiest to remedy** : You can hire new people, implement new training, bring in new technology, and raise more cash.

Established companies tend to have ample resources. By comparison, entrants typically have few resources, but its people resources—specifically founders, managers, and employees—often constitute their biggest capabilities. A startup’s people are so critical to its early success, that losing just one person can derail the company’s progress.

#### Processes

Processes ensure that everything from manufacturing to payroll operates in the same way every time, whether the employee performing the task is a new hire or a veteran. Processes can be explicitly defined protocols, or they can be implicitly understood.

**Reliable processes are essential to a successful business, but they become major disabilities in the face of disruptions—since they’re meant to _prevent_ change, processes themselves are very difficult to change. **

While the visible processes relating to customer service, production, and development are important, the processes that most significantly determine a company’s capabilities or disabilities are the subtler processes that influence investment decision-making, such as market research methodology and how the company creates budgets and strategies. These background processes have a powerful effect on resource allocation, and they are especially difficult to change.

**Entrants have the flexibility to develop processes that meet the needs of the disruptive technology and its market** , unlike established firms, which are already entrenched in their established processes.

#### Values

**Values inherently reflect a company’s cost structure, because they influence a company’s decision-making about what kind of projects to prioritize.** If a company’s cost structure requires high gross margins, then its values influence investments in projects that promise large profits—which impede the company from investing in disruptive innovations.

Values influence which projects executives pursue, which tasks employees prioritize, and which products the sales team pushes. For example, if a company’s cost structure requires 40 percent profit margins to cover overhead costs, achieving those profit margins is a company value; executives reject projects expected to bring less than a 40 percent profit margin, employees prioritize tasks that support high-earning projects, and salespeople emphasize products that typically earn that profit margin.

Values are difficult to change on a whim, but, as a company grows, its values naturally evolve.

As a company targets higher-end customers, it often adds features to its products, which, in turn, adds to the company’s overhead cost. Increased overhead changes the cost structure, which changes the values. **This value change constitutes a major disability in adopting disruptive technologies, because they offer low initial revenues.**

Startups’ values naturally reflect the cost structure that the disruptive product and its market demand.

#### Processes + Values = Culture

While startups initially rely on their people resources to find success, over time, the young companies develop processes and values that maintain and improve upon that success.

**Essentially, processes and values put certain aspects of the business on autopilot, so that the company has the capacity to use its resources to develop new products and updates.** Startups that fail to shift their capabilities from their resources to processes and values burn out because they can’t keep up with new products and updates while maintaining a standard of quality.

When a company’s processes and values are so deeply ingrained in its managers and employees that they can carry out their jobs more or less autonomously, those processes and values have become the company’s culture. Effective company culture is key to maintaining quality and consistency as a company grows larger. However, **when it comes to confronting disruptive innovations, disabilities that are rooted in a company’s culture are the most difficult to change.**

### Solution: Create Capabilities in an Independent Organization

When a company considers adopting a disruptive innovation, managers must assess whether the company has the capabilities to do so. If it doesn’t, they have three options:

  1. Try to make changes within the company to create the necessary capabilities
  2. Buy a smaller company to take on the project
  3. Spin off a separate organization that has autonomy from the main company to establish its own processes and values



Let’s look at the pros and cons of each option in more detail.

#### Option #1: Create Capabilities

A company’s leaders might be tempted to try altering the company’s assets to create new capabilities, but this method is extremely difficult.

It’s relatively simple to resolve resource disabilities, but companies’ disabilities are often in their processes and values, and those are much more difficult to change.

Two factors make processes particularly difficult to change:

  1. **A company’s structures are often built around enabling its own processes and impeding other processes.** Communication flows, management structures, workflows, and other organizational pillars can make implementing a new process unfeasible.
  2. **Company leaders and employees may be reluctant to replace processes** that have consistently worked to make the company successful. 



Given the difficulty of changing processes, companies may attempt one of two alternatives:

  1. Forcing existing processes to support the disruptive innovation. However, one set of processes simply can’t fit two different types of business models (the established and the disruptive). 
  2. Creating a second set of processes to support its disruptive business. This approach can only work if a team is assigned specifically to that project and those processes, and the team remains separate from the company’s other processes. 



#### Option #2: Acquire a Company

Instead of fighting against a company’s existing culture in order to make the significant changes necessary, **it’s easier and more effective to acquire an existing company that already has the capabilities to adopt the disruptive technology.**

When a company acquires another firm, managers must be clear about which capabilities the acquired firm offers. Identifying whether the acquired company brings necessary resources, processes, or values helps determine how to structure the new organization.

For example, **if the acquired company has valuable processes and values that the parent company needs for the disruptive project, the acquired company shouldn’t be integrated into the parent company.** If the acquired company is integrated, its processes and values will simply dissolve into the parent company’s existing processes. Instead, the parent company should let the acquired company operate independently, and the parent company should merely contribute additional resources to the acquired company.

**On the other hand, if a company chooses to acquire another firm because of that firm’s resources** —such as money, people, or relationships with suppliers—**the parent company should integrate the acquired firm.** In this case, the parent company’s processes and values are better suited for the project, so the acquired company simply boosts the parent company with its resources.

#### Option #3: Spin-Out Organization

Instead of acquiring another firm, a company can spin out an independent entity from its own organization. As we talked about in Chapter 5, this entity must have the separation and autonomy to develop its own processes and values.

**The parent company can simply support the spin-out organization with resources, as long as the spin-out doesn’t have to compete for those resources against the parent company’s existing projects.** If the disruptive organization is forced to compete, it will always lose to the higher-profit products.

For a spin-out organization to be successful, it needs the full support and attention of the parent company’s chief executive. The CEO can ensure that the entity is allowed the independence it needs to create its own processes and values, and that the entity is getting adequate resources to succeed.

### Determining the Team/Organizational Structure for a Disruptive Project

When a manager evaluates her company’s capabilities and disabilities in order to take on a new project, it’s critical that she chooses the right team organization to manage it.

These are the most effective organizational structures based on capabilities:

  * **The values are compatible, but not the processes** : If the project is a sustaining technology—meaning it fits the company’s values—but it’s radical enough to require new processes, the project can be executed within the company. However, it needs a heavyweight team, which has the autonomy to create new workflows and patterns of communication that become processes specific to that team. Heavyweight team members must each act as a sort of general manager to make decisions that are in the best interest of the project. 
  * **The values and processes are both compatible** : This project can be executed within the company by a functional or lightweight team, which simply has a project manager overseeing the project. 
  * **Neither the values nor processes are compatible** : If the project is disruptive, it’s incompatible with the company’s values as well as its processes. This kind of project requires a spin-out or acquired entity managed by a heavyweight team.
  * **The processes are compatible, but not the values** : If the project fits the company’s existing processes, but not its values, because the innovation requires a different cost structure, there are two options: First, the project could be executed within the company, as long as company leaders ensure that the project develops independent budgeting and management processes. Second, the project could be carried out in a spin-out or acquired organization. 



### Digital Equipment Corporation’s Values and Processes Caused Its Failure

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was a major minicomputer maker from the 1960s to the 1980s, but the company failed to adapt when personal computers disrupted the industry.

Let’s look at each of the sources of capabilities and disabilities to see why DEC struggled.

1) Resources: DEC had ample resources—including money, competent engineers, and advanced technology—to transition to the personal computer market.

2) Processes: **DEC’s processes were tailored to the minicomputer market, which became disabilities in the personal computer market.** DEC designed and manufactured many custom components for their minicomputers, which they sold directly to customers. As a result of this highly detailed and hands-on process, the company turned out a new product every two to three years.

Personal computers required very different processes. The market and cost structure demanded that computer makers order components from suppliers, manufacture the computers in high-volume assembly lines, and sell the products via retailers. Additionally, companies had to turn around new products once or twice a year.

3) Values: DEC’ valued projects that brought in 50 percent gross margins or higher. Its processes and the nature of the minicomputer market created high overhead costs that required high gross margins. However, **personal computers didn’t fit that cost structure, making DEC’s values a disability.**
