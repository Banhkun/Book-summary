## Exercise: Stop Caretaking and Start Empowering

Beattie’s caretaking cycle is based on the Karpman Drama Triangle and its roles of rescuer, persecutor, and victim. You can escape the Drama Triangle by shifting your mindset to the Empowerment Dynamic and its roles of coach, challenger, and creator.

* * *

Describe a time you started the caretaking cycle by “saving” someone from their responsibilities and what happened when you “saved” them.

What could you have done differently to be a coach rather than a rescuer in this situation?

Now, describe what happened when you shifted to the anger stage. What could you have done differently to be a challenger rather than a persecutor?

Finally, describe what happened when you moved to the victimization stage. What could you have done differently to be a creator rather than a victim?
