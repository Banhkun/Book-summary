## Exercise: Release Unhealthy Guilt

Many codependents struggle with unhealthy guilt. Unhealthy guilt is based on thoughts and feelings rather than actions, and it makes you anxious instead of motivating growth. Releasing unhealthy guilt will let you grow as a person and live a happier, more authentic life.

* * *

Make a list with two headings: Healthy Guilt and Unhealthy Guilt. Think about times you felt guilty, or things you feel guilty for right now. Ask yourself, “Is this guilt based on an action (healthy) or a feeling (unhealthy)? Does it motivate (healthy) or paralyze (unhealthy) me?” and divide the situations under the headings accordingly.

Look at the situations under the Unhealthy Guilt heading. Describe why each situation is unhealthy. (For example, you might say, “I feel guilty for being angry at my wife and feel anxious and paralyzed because of it. This is unhealthy guilt because I reacted appropriately to my anger. I stayed calm and discussed the issue instead of lashing out, so I have nothing to be worried or guilty about.”)

Look at the situations under the Unhealthy Guilt heading and write out a plan for letting go of the unhealthy guilt. (For example, you might write down the reasons for your unhealthy guilt on a piece of paper and tear it up to find closure, or you might repeat a mantra to release guilt every day.) Be specific and schedule times to put your plans into action.

Look at the situations under the Healthy Guilt heading and write out a plan for dealing with each one. (For example, maybe you need to make amends, apologize, or plan how to do better in the future.) Be specific and schedule times to put your plans into action.
