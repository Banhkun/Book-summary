## Exercise: Trust Your Mind

Many codependents struggle to trust their own judgment. You are more capable than you think, and reminding yourself of times you’ve succeeded in the past can build your confidence and help you make decisions in the present.

* * *

Describe a decision you’re worried about making and why you’re worried about it. What do you think will happen if you make the wrong decision?

Now, think about three good decisions you have made in the past. Describe those situations and how you felt before making the decision. Were you worried or confident?

Describe why those situations turned out well and what made the decision the right one.

How can you take those good experiences and apply them to your current situation?
