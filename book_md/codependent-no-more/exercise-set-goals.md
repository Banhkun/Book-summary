## Exercise: Set Goals

Goals let you look forward to the future: They are a healthy method of acknowledging your desires. By examining your goals and planning how to complete them, you can improve your self-esteem and find motivation to live for yourself.

* * *

Write down a list of your goals. Be creative and don’t limit yourself. You can put down wants, needs, pipe dreams, anything you’d like! (If you’re not sure about your goals, pick some of the example ones discussed in the previous chapter.)

Pick one of your more immediate goals. (“Have fun” is a more immediate goal than “Enjoy peace,” for example.) Write about what this goal looks like for you and why you want to achieve it.

Have you done any work to reach this goal already? If so, describe the work you’ve done and how effective it’s been. If not, describe why not.

Now, make a plan for reaching this goal. (If you choose the “Have fun” goal, for example, you could write about the different clubs and activities you’re going to try. If you choose the “Take care of your body” goal, you could talk about donating clothes you don’t like, buying some new clothes, or trying out a new hygiene routine.) Be specific, with small, actionable steps that you can realistically take.
