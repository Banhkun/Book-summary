## Exercise: Practice Detachment

According to Beattie, detaching means focusing your energy on your own needs and wants and allowing other people to fulfill their own responsibilities. Learning to recognize situations where you’re attached to someone can help you prioritize self-care.

* * *

Think back to a situation where you prioritized someone else’s responsibilities over your own wants and needs. (Maybe you did your teenage son’s laundry, rather than reading the book you’ve been looking forward to.) What happened? What did you need or want, and what did you do instead?

Next, describe what would have happened if you had prioritized your wants and needs instead. (Be realistic: Your son might be upset, but it wouldn’t be a disaster if he had to do his own laundry or wear dirty clothes to school.)

Finally, write out a plan for the next time you encounter this situation. (You might send your son a text reminding him to do his laundry, put your phone away, and then go enjoy your book.) Be specific with actionable steps.
