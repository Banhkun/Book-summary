## 1-Page Summary

_Codependent No More_ is a guide to reclaiming your life from **codependency: a reaction to stress in which a person becomes obsessed with another and loses sight of themself.** Codependents forget to take care of themselves in their attempts to manage other people’s lives, and they are often wracked by stress and guilt. Melody Beattie encourages readers to overcome codependency with powerful messages of finding yourself, recovering self-esteem, and living a life that is free and full of joy.

Known as the “queen of codependency,” Melodie Beattie introduced codependency to the wider world. She draws on her own experience as a codependent, addict, and counselor to present a realistic yet compassionate image of codependents and their struggles.

In this guide, we’ll first explore what codependency is and how it forms, and then we’ll discuss how to overcome it. Finally, we’ll discuss Beattie’s primary recommendation for codependents: joining a 12 Step Program.

### What Is Codependency?

According to Beattie, **codependency is a stress-induced pattern of behavior that dictates how a person treats another and how she allows that other person to influence _her_.** The codependent obsesses over the other person and seeks to control them.

(Shortform note: Defining codependency is a difficult task, even decades after Beattie’s work first brought attention to the condition. Part of this difficulty is that codependency is not technically a mental illness according to the DSM-5, which provides information for diagnosing mental illnesses. There is no single, clear definition agreed upon by experts.)

#### Characteristics of Codependency

We’ve synthesized Beattie’s characteristics of codependency into three critical categories:

**1) Codependents put responsibility in the wrong place.** They see themselves as responsible for everyone else but don’t take responsibility for themselves. (Shortform note: Taking too much responsibility for others comes from thinking yourself so independent that you have to control everything. In reality, no one controls everything. Simultaneously, the inability to take responsibility for yourself comes from low self-esteem: You base your worth on your actions, so admitting a mistake damages your esteem. If you focus on other people, though, you don’t have to worry about yourself.)

**2) Codependents neglect themselves in favor of others.** They focus on other people so much that they struggle to take care of themselves or let others help them. (Shortform note: Codependents neglect themselves and can’t ask for help because they fear being a burden. You can combat this fear by being open about your needs and boundaries.)

**3) Codependents can’t see themselves clearly.** They can’t receive help or take responsibility because they’ve repressed their feelings, needs, and personality. (Shortform note: You can avoid repression by expressing your needs, feelings, and personality instead of pushing them away.)

#### What Causes Codependency?

Beattie states that **codependency is a reaction to prolonged and often extreme stress**. This stress leads to unhealthy coping mechanisms, which become habitual over time. These habitual coping mechanisms result in “reaction mode”: You’ll react to things in both healthy and unhealthy ways, but you’ll almost never _act_ on your own volition.

(Shortform note: When a habit forms around a stressful situation, your brain makes a connection between the situation and your stress. The next time you’re in that situation, you’ll feel stress even if the situation doesn’t call for it, and the connection will be strengthened. To stop this process, identify the habitual stress connection. If you start to feel stressed because of the connection, do something enjoyable: This alters the connection your brain makes and reduces your stress.)

Codependency is associated with substance abuse because substance abuse is a clear cause of stress. However, the source of stress can be subtle, too, Beattie explains, such as underlying family systems. All families have unspoken rules that govern how members behave and interact with one another. **Families that discourage open communication are at high risk for codependency.**

> **Why It’s Important to Recognize Your Family System**
> 
> Underlying family systems like those Beattie describes are also called rules of engagement, and you learn them through trial and error. When you engage in a certain behavior and receive negative reactions, your brain prohibits the behavior in the future.
> 
> If you know your family system discouraged communication, caused stress, and therefore left you at high risk of codependency, be proactive in preventing codependency by using the techniques discussed in this guide. This is important because there aren’t established solutions for healing family systems like there are for addiction, so you need to take charge of your healing.

### Practice Self-Care Through Detachment

Now that we’ve established what codependency is and how it forms, let’s discuss how to overcome it. Beattie notes that the most important step in recovery for codependents is detaching from other people by practicing self-care. Codependent people are often attached to others. According to Beattie, **being attached to someone else means that all your energy goes into their life, leaving none for yourself.**

(Shortform note: Some writers disagree with Beattie’s assertion that attachment is entirely negative. For instance, Amir Levine and Rachel Heller argue that attachment is necessary and important. This seems to contradict Beattie’s point. However, Levine and Heller simply use the word “attached” differently than Beattie. Levine and Heller define attachment as a healthy connection with other people, while Beattie defines attachment as unhealthy dependency. At their cores, both sets of authors agree with each other, maintaining that everyone needs healthy connections with other people.)

#### Practicing Detachment and Self-Care

Beattie believes that **self-care is living a responsible life** by being mindful of your needs, wants, emotions, and responsibilities toward yourself and others. (Shortform note: Beattie’s definition of self-care might surprise some people as traditional definitions don’t mention the need for personal responsibility. However, her definition is bolstered by the American Psychological Association and the National Institute of Health: Both agree that self-care is being mindful of your physical and mental needs. By adding responsibilities to others into her definition, Beattie ensures people don’t go too far past self-care into irresponsibility.)

According to Beattie, **an important part of self-care for codependents is detachment**. Detachment means taking responsibility for yourself and letting others be responsible for themselves. (Shortform note: Beattie’s understanding of detachment is similar to the Buddhist belief of non-attachment. Non-attachment revolves around getting rid of _unhealthy_ attachments: You can have nice things and relationships as long as you don’t let those things control you.)

According to Beattie, the most important way to detach and practice self-care is to ask yourself, **“What do I need or want in this moment?”** Once you know what you need or want, you can work to attain it yourself, ask others for help in attaining it, and prioritize yourself by saying “no” when you don’t have the time or resources to say “yes.” (Shortform note: Codependents think putting their needs and wants first or saying “no” to people is selfish or being a burden, but it’s not. Selfishness is taking things away from other people for yourself, and being a burden is making others provide for you, but self-care, including saying “no,” is providing for yourself.)

### The Importance of Nurturing Self-Esteem

Codependents struggle to detach themselves from others because of a lack of self-esteem.**People with low self-esteem rely on others to validate their worth** , Beattie explains. Relying on external validation is dangerous, but **strong self-esteem lets you control your own life** and act in your best interest.

(Shortform note: Social media has turned over-reliance on external validation into an epidemic. As it becomes easier to validate others and receive validation, people crave it in every aspect of their life. They have become so attached to other people’s reactions that they can’t recognize their own feelings. The best way to relearn self-validation is to get rid of social media. Rather than focusing on other people’s reactions, ask yourself how _you_ feel about your situation.)

According to Beattie, low self-esteem leads to three problems:

**1) Attachment**. Many codependents believe they can’t take care of themselves,**** which leads them to attach to other people. To escape this cycle, you must find worth in yourself, knowing that you can succeed. (Shortform note: You’re more capable than you think. Instead of thinking “I can’t,” shift your mindset to “maybe I can.” This simple shift gives you the space to try, which is often enough to lead to success.)

**2) Bad communication.** Codependents learn that open communication is not allowed, so they turn to manipulation, guilt-tripping, and lying to get things done. (Shortform note: In families with bad communication, there is a constant fight for recognition and power. Being unheard makes people feel powerless, so they use manipulation to regain that power.) You can foster good communication by improving your self-esteem. (Shortform note: Improve your self-esteem by speaking with self-respect, maintaining good eye contact and posture, and being authentic.)

**3) The caretaking cycle.** Many codependents try to find validation by taking care of others. This leads to the caretaking cycle. First, the codependent “saves” other people from their responsibilities, which makes them feel good about themself. Second, the codependent feels angry and resentful toward the other person for “using” them, even though the codependent freely assumed the responsibility. Finally, the codependent feels bad for themself, making themself the victim to avoid responsibility.

(Shortform note: You can escape the caretaking cycle through the Empowerment Dynamic, which shifts the mindset of the three caretaking cycle stages to something constructive. Instead of caretaking, the codependent believes the other person can solve their own problem and offers them advice. Instead of becoming angry, the codependent focuses on motivating themself and the other person through accountability. Finally, instead of becoming a victim, the codependent focuses on their goals and motivations, working with what they _can_ do, rather than obsessing over what they can’t.)

#### Nurture Self-Esteem

Trusting yourself is the first step to nurturing self-esteem, Beattie says. There are a few ways you can practice trusting yourself:

**1) Remind yourself of your skills, positive attributes, and past good decisions**. (Shortform note: This self-validation increases resilience: the ability to heal and learn from difficult situations. If you’ve made good decisions before, you can do so again.)

**2) Practice making small, enjoyable decisions.** (Shortform note: Making low-stakes “micro-decisions” gradually builds your confidence until you can make big decisions.)

**3) Don’t force yourself to forgive and forget or to trust people over your own judgment.**(Shortform note: You don’t have to forget someone’s transgressions to forgive them. Forgiveness is healing, but remembering past hurts lets you protect yourself from suffering similar hurts again. On the same note, don’t trust people unless they earn it by changing their behavior. You don’t owe anyone your trust, and withholding it lets you protect yourself.)

Loving yourself is the next step to nurturing self-esteem, Beattie says. There are a few ways you can practice loving yourself:

**1) Release unhealthy guilt.** While healthy guilt prompts change and growth, unhealthy guilt just lingers and causes pain and anxiety. (Shortform note: Unhealthy guilt is also called shame, and it damages your sense of self and makes you less likely to change in the future. To overpower shame, redirect your self-hating thoughts to ones of self-love: Remember that everyone makes mistakes, make amends to the wronged person, and consider what acts of kindness you can do for yourself.)

**2) Let go of perfectionism.** It’s only once you’ve embraced yourself as you are that you can grow as a person.

**3) Believe in yourself.** How you feel about yourself changes how you act and how others see you. If you believe you are funny, charming, or beautiful, other people will too.

> **Healthy Striving vs. Perfectionism and Self-Loathing**
> 
> Research supports Beattie’s suggestion that letting go of perfectionistic behavior is part of healing. Perfectionism is a defense mechanism against shame. Doing things perfectly is the source of your emotional security and self-worth. When you fail to meet your impossible standards, you feel worthless.
> 
> The cure to perfectionism is “healthy striving,” the practice of setting reasonable goals based on your wants and needs rather than external validation. Meeting these reasonable goals will arguably help you to believe in yourself. Healthy striving can also help you decide how to present yourself to other people. For example, you could wake up half an hour earlier so you can do your hair rather than rushing. The goal is not to change who you are, but to strive to be your best.

### Surrender Control and Take Responsibility

Another way to overcome codependency is to surrender control of others. Beattie explains that **codependents spend their time and energy trying to control people.** (Shortform note: People control to avoid losing things. They're more afraid to lose their remaining security than they are excited to gain freedom by stopping their controlling behavior.)

When you try to control everyone and everything around you, **you’re really the one being controlled,** Beattie says. (Shortform note: This can look like letting other people project their opinions on you because you’re too nervous to express your own opinions, constantly asking for advice or approval, or not taking care of yourself. These situations invite someone else to take control, since you’re not doing so yourself.)

In addition, by taking control, you prevent the other person from taking responsibility for their actions. (Shortform note: People won’t take responsibility unless they’re forced to. You must let your loved ones experience the consequences of their actions and learn to take care of themselves.)

#### Take Responsibility for Yourself, and _Only_ Yourself

According to Beattie, the opposite of trying to control others is taking responsibility for yourself. Even if the situation you find yourself in is the fault of another, **your behaviors relating to that situation, including your negative behaviors, are up to you**. (Shortform note: Blaming other people instead of taking responsibility can actively harm you. Focusing on the negative, which blaming naturally involves, pushes you toward depression and low self-esteem. On the other hand, focusing on the positive and practicing gratitude can make you happier. If you see the best in everyone, you won't need to control them, and you’ll be more likely to see the best in yourself too.)

That said, resist the urge to blame yourself for things out of your control. Beattie stresses that **you are not responsible for the behavior of others.** Internalizing this message is an essential step to healing from codependency. (Shortform note: The best way to internalize this is to recognize what you’re taking responsibility for, examine whether you can actually control those things, and discard responsibilities you can’t control.)

### Move Through Grief to Acceptance

Another way to heal from codependency is to reach a state of acceptance. According to Beattie, **acceptance means understanding and working with reality**. Accepting reality is the only way to change your situation, and the only way to reach acceptance is to grieve. (Shortform note: Some people confuse acceptance with approval. Acceptance is about acknowledging what happened in the past, while approval is about the future and what you will or won’t allow.)

There are five stages to grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. You must pass through all the stages before you can move past a loss or painful experience, Beattie says.

The first three stages are defense measures, but they become maladaptive over time: **Denial stops painful information from overwhelming you** until you’re safe enough to process it, Beattie maintains. (Shortform note: Denial becomes maladaptive because it’s only effective as a short-term safety net. You need a long-term safety net of backup plans and external support as well.)

According to Beattie, once the painful information has been acknowledged, **anger protects you from being sad.** (Shortform note: Anger feels safer than sadness because it provides a sense of power and control. However, turning sadness into anger does not make the sadness go away: It merely hides it, and it can damage your relationships while it does so.)

**Bargaining recognizes reality, but it tries to stop it from affecting you** by striking deals, Beattie explains. (Shortform note: There are two types of bargaining: bargaining for a change to the end _result_ and bargaining for a change to the _timing_ of the result. The second is closer to acceptance because it accepts that reality cannot be stopped or altered.)

**Depression occurs when the painful information fully sinks in,** Beattie says. Most people try to avoid this stage because it’s so painful, but you must let it progress naturally. (Shortform note: The depression stage is so painful because you’ve used up all your energy in the defense stages. Its length depends on the severity and timing of the loss, as well as on your personality.)

Acceptance is the final stage of grief and the state of mind you should be living in, according to Beattie. **It is the first step toward change** : In a state of acceptance, you have made peace with what is true right now, so you can work to change what will be true in the future.

> **How to Reach Acceptance**
> 
> In Radical Acceptance, Tara Brach defines acceptance as embracing everything you are experiencing. This is similar to Beattie’s definition, although Beattie adds that acceptance is the first step toward change. Brach does not include this element, focusing on the _act_ of acceptance rather than what comes after.
> 
> Here are a few tips from Brach on achieving acceptance:
> 
>   * **Recognize and name your negative emotions or fears.**
> 
>   * **Ask yourself friendly questions about what you feel, need, or want.**
> 
>   * **Feel your emotions without letting them control you.**
> 
> 


### Process Emotions Healthily

The next step in addressing codependency is processing emotions healthily. According to Beattie, most codependents repress their emotions because it seems safer not to feel anything than to risk being hurt again. (Shortform note: Repression can also be caused by a lack of confidence or a desire to keep a relationship.)

However, repressing feelings doesn't work. **When you don’t process your emotions, they start controlling you.** Once you learn how to process your emotions, you can take back control. (Shortform note: How can you stop repressing your emotions? The key is in feeling the emotions in the moment. Picture your emotions like a wave: If you float along with the wave, you’ll return to balance quickly. If you try to fight the wave, you’ll be crushed under the water. The wave controls where you go and if you can come up for air. Instead of fighting, ride the wave of emotion by focusing on the present, feeling the emotion, and then letting it go.)

#### How to Process Emotions Healthily

Beattie suggests four main steps to processing your emotions healthily:

**1) Remember your emotions are important.** Your emotions tell you things about yourself and your situation. (Shortform note: Your emotions are inherently connected with your physical and neurological experiences. They help you interpret and react to the world.)

**2) Remember your emotions don’t define you.** Your feelings don’t dictate who you are—your actions do. (Shortform note: Emotions can’t define you because they’re not always based on reality. Emotions are based on your perception of events, while actions have an objective effect on the world, which is why they _can_ define you.)

**3) Take responsibility for your emotions.** The situation or other people's behavior might influence your feelings, but your emotions are your responsibility. This doesn’t mean that others can’t hurt you: You can feel hurt, but don’t let those feelings control your actions. (Shortform note: Some people turn the valid mantra of “don’t let your emotions control you” into “they’re not hurting you, you’re choosing to be hurt.” Beattie is not advocating for this: It removes responsibility from the hurtful party and shames the victim, while Beattie advocates for personal responsibility and leaving shame behind.)

**4) React healthily to your emotions.** Distance yourself from the emotional situation and learn from your emotions. (Shortform note: You can distance yourself from an emotional situation by using second- or third-person pronouns when discussing it. The change in pronouns forces your brain to make a distinction between you and the emotions. After you’ve distanced yourself, you can use emotional agility to gain a more precise and nuanced view of your own emotions. You can practice emotional agility by looking deeper into your emotions.)

### Set Healthy Goals

According to Beattie, setting goals is another important part of recovery for codependents. Goals let you look forward to the future: They are a healthy method of acknowledging your desires. For many codependents, **goal-setting can revitalize their will to live** for themselves.

Beattie maintains that **needs and wants make the best goals** because they let you live the life you want. Unfortunately, many codependents base their lives on “shoulds” instead. Anytime you think, “I should be doing this,” or “I shouldn’t be enjoying this,” you are falling for should-based thinking. Shoulds suck the joy from life. They disparage your actions and goals as not good enough and pressure you into doing things you don’t want.

> **Defeating “Shoulds” and Negative Pressure With Self-Care**
> 
> Research confirms that setting goals helps codependents by generating positive pressure. Positive pressure motivates you and keeps you focused, rather than inspiring anxiety. When these goals are based on your needs and wants, this positive pressure keeps you focused on yourself and your healing.
> 
> In contrast, should-based thinking exerts negative pressure. It is based on external pressure and obligations, so it inspires anxiety instead of motivation and imposes unhealthy guilt for any want- and need-based goals. You can overcome should-based thinking with Beattie’s method of self-care: Ask yourself what you want and why, and then let the “shoulds” go.

#### How to Set Goals

We’ve synthesized Beattie’s advice for setting goals into three main ideas:

**1) Write your goals down and cross them off.** It’s easier to work toward your goals when they’re concrete and specific. Crossing your goals off when complete gives you a physical representation of success and shows you how far you’ve come. (Shortform note: Writing goals down also improves your brain’s encoding ability: how well your brain analyzes information and transfers it to long-term memory. Writing your goals down means your brain will be able to better grasp, remember, and implement your plans.)

**2) Trust that what should happen _will_ happen.** Take what actions you reasonably can to complete your goals, but don’t obsess. Be patient and focus on the present. (Shortform note: Some people recommend setting a timeline for each goal, but Beattie disagrees. She recommends patience because codependents struggle with perfectionism and controlling behavior, and giving themselves deadlines can exacerbate that problem.)

**3) Be flexible.** Set enough goals that you have a direction and a plan, but don’t worry about hitting specific numbers. (Shortform note: Some people disagree, arguing that setting goals daily is important for success. Writing down your goals every morning will reinforce them, allow your subconscious to work on them, and give you a boost of energy and creativity.)

### Try a 12 Step Program

Beattie’s final recommendation for codependents is trying a 12 Step Program. According to Beattie, **12 Step Programs help codependents start living for themselves**. They work**** because of three elements: the lack of requirements, the focus on fellowship, and the length of the programs. The lack of requirements means you can work through the program at your own pace, the fellowship encourages honesty and accountability, and there are no graduations because codependency is a chronic disorder and needs ongoing treatment.

> **Are 12 Step Programs Really That Great?**
> 
> Beattie claims that 12 Step Programs are almost magical. However, researchers disagree. 12 Step Programs are better than no treatment, but they are no more effective than other treatments like inpatient care or talk therapy. In fact, the very qualities Beattie says make the programs successful can drive people away.
> 
> While Beattie stresses the importance of going at your own pace, some people benefit from more intensive treatments. For these individuals, the slower pace could be detrimental. In addition, for some, fellow program members can actually be a deterrent. Minorities especially may feel uncomfortable or unsafe being the only POC, female, or LGBTQ+ member of the group. Finally, some experts argue that codependency doesn’t need ongoing treatment. Instead, you simply need to understand that recovery is important and have the desire to do so.

#### The Principles of 12 Step Programs

While these programs have 12 steps, we can synthesize these steps into four broad principles:

**1) Accept your codependency and ask for help.** This means giving up your need to control and having faith that you can improve with help. (Shortform note: Most people demonstrate this acceptance by labeling themselves as codependents. However, some argue that labeling yourself traps you in the identity of a codependent and makes you less likely to recover.)

**2) Connect to a higher power.** Humans are spiritual beings, so the treatment for their illnesses must also be spiritual. (Shortform note: The spiritual attitude of 12 Step Programs has persisted for decades, but opinions on this attitude are shifting. There is an increasing number of secular 12 Step Programs, which teach that you can find the strength to live a healthy life through yourself and your community rather than a higher power.)

**3) Make reparations.** This principle requires paying close attention to yourself, your ideals, and your actions. (Shortform note: Making reparations is difficult because it forces you to pay attention to your ideals and the times your actions did not uphold those ideals. However, doing so lets you release guilt and improve your relationships.)

**4) Share your experience.** Showing others the healing you experienced can encourage them to find that same healing. (Shortform note: For new members of the program, seeing that you were in the same position and that you healed gives them hope. Sharing your struggles demonstrates that you’re a normal person who put in the work to heal, and they can too.)
