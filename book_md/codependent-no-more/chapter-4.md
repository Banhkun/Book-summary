## Chapter 4: How to Nurture Self-Esteem

Now that we’ve explored the harm low self-esteem can cause, we’ll discuss how to increase your esteem. As a codependent suffering from self-esteem issues, you need to learn to trust and love yourself, even when other people won’t. In this chapter, we’ll look at some strategies for doing this.

### Trust Yourself and Your Mind

Beattie explains **that many codependents were taught that they can’t trust their own minds.** They don’t believe they can assess a situation or make decisions. This doubt paralyzes them from making even minor decisions. They cope with this anxiety by ignoring or passing off decisions, hoping someone will rescue them.

Beattie adds that this self-doubt also inspires perfectionism. If you believe you shouldn't be trusted to make decisions, then every time someone trusts you anyway, you feel pressured to be perfect so they don’t regret their trust. **Impossible standards further increase anxiety and self-doubt.**

> **Gaslighting and Perfectionism**
> 
> While Beattie doesn’t put a name to it, being taught that you can’t trust your own mind is gaslighting, a form of emotional control. Robert Greene identifies gaslighting as a form of passive aggression in _The Laws of Human Nature._ By being passive-aggressive, the aggressor can pretend you’re being irrational if you’re upset. Overt aggression is much harder to ignore. Greene suggests keeping a journal of your experiences so that you have a record when you start doubting yourself.
> 
> Beattie argues that gaslighting causes perfectionism. Amy Marlow-MaCoy acknowledges that there is a connection between perfectionism and being made to doubt your mind. She maintains that imposter syndrome is a type of self-gaslighting, where you don’t believe you are as talented or successful as you are. When suffering from imposter syndrome, you convince yourself that other people are seeing you incorrectly, and you ignore evidence to the contrary. You’re also terrified of people seeing “the real you” and strive to be perfect. However, she does not make a connection between traditional gaslighting by another person and perfectionism.

#### Learn to Trust Yourself

Let’s look at a few strategies for learning to trust yourself: (Shortform note: We have synthesized Beattie’s ideas into internal and external strategies for finding peace.)

Seek peace internally by detaching from the situation that is causing you to doubt yourself. Remind yourself of your skills and positive attributes. This **self-validation will help combat doubt and remind you of times you have made good decisions in the past.**

Seek peace externally by making small, enjoyable decisions. This will help you trust your decision-making skills. Gather the information you need to make good decisions, and then express those decisions to others without worrying about being perfect. Finally, don’t be afraid to ask for help**** from other people or your higher power.

> **Seeking Peace Internally and Externally**
> 
> Research supports Beattie’s suggestion to self-validate to find internal peace. In addition to increasing your confidence, remembering your skills and past good decisions increases resilience (the ability to heal and learn from difficult situations): If you’ve been in a difficult situation and survived it, or made good decisions before, you can do so again.
> 
> Beattie’s strategies for external peace are also supported by modern advice, as making low-stakes “micro-decisions” gradually builds your confidence. However, some writers disagree with her suggestion to ask for help: They argue that asking for help is delegating your decisions, which means you’re not making them yourself. In addition, they add a caveat to Beattie’s advice to collect information: Don’t include other people’s opinions in that information.
> 
> Another writer who advocates the use of both internal and external strategies is Brené Brown. In Dare to Lead, Brown has a few other suggestions for increasing confidence and trust in yourself. Let’s look at a few examples:
> 
>   * **Be aware of your own thoughts, feelings, and reactions towards other people.** This is an internal act that helps you to accurately judge your decisions and determine for yourself if they were good or not.
> 
>   * **Put your values into practice.** This is an external act that lets you find peace and confidence in your convictions.
> 
>   * **Approach life with curiosity rather than fear.** This is an internal mindset that changes the way you act externally, and it allows you to face uncertainty and errors with greater confidence.
>

#### Stand Your Ground

Beattie maintains that trusting your mind also means standing your ground and doing what you think is best, even if it means refusing to forgive and forget, withholding your trust from a person, or finding a new therapist when you feel you're not benefiting from your current treatment.

Forgiving and forgetting is something many codependents feel pressured into doing, Beattie explains. **Forgiveness is good and healing, but you shouldn’t forget how others mistreated you,** because it can play into denial of how bad a situation really was.

> **Forgive, But Don’t Forget**
> 
> Forgiving and forgetting are often conflated, as Beattie explains, but you don’t have to forget someone’s transgressions to forgive them. Forgiveness is an act of healing where you accept what happened and allow yourself to release any anger you have about the situation.
> 
> Forgetting, on the other hand, can harm your relationships and well-being. Remembering past hurts lets you protect yourself, and keeping track of red flags helps you determine whether the relationship should continue.
> 
> In addition, remembering past arguments and disagreements can strengthen your relationships: If you and the other person both improved since that argument, you’ve proven how much you care about the other and shown the effort you’re willing to put into your relationship.

##### Don’t Trust Blindly

In the same vein, codependents struggle to trust others, Beattie adds. Their loved ones have betrayed them and behaved badly for so long that trust is impossible. And yet, codependents’ loved ones sometimes use this lack of trust to levy unearned guilt. **You don’t have to trust anyone over your own judgment.** Accept that you don't trust the other person and it’s a reasonable reaction to their past behavior. Withhold trust until they back up their promises of good behavior with action.

(Shortform note: Talking about change is a classic manipulation technique used by people who have no intention of actually improving their behavior. It works by stalling you: The manipulator knows what you want to hear, and they give you hope that they will change. While you wait, the manipulator avoids consequences. This behavior will not change as long as you keep giving them your trust. You must demand they change their behavior, and hold them accountable.)

Beattie points out that many codependents have the tendency to trust their doctors over themselves. They might stay in unhelpful and even unhealthy situations because of this trust. Don’t doubt yourself: There are many kinds of therapy, and it’s okay to explore your options until you find a good fit. Remember, your therapist might have more psychological knowledge, but **you know yourself best.**

> **Sometimes Your Doctor Is Wrong**
> 
> The urge to trust the expert over yourself that Beattie discusses gets codependents in trouble, but they’re not the only ones who experience it. Overweight individuals experience similar pressure when interacting with medical professionals. Bias is still present in the medical field, and doctors have the tendency to ignore any symptoms an overweight patient reports in favor of telling them to lose weight.
> 
> Besides being rude and unhelpful, this advice becomes dangerous when the ignored symptoms stem from a disease or genetic condition. When experts won’t take their problems seriously, patients are more likely to dismiss those problems themselves. Even when patients continue seeking treatment, the delay can cause complications. A problem the first doctor could have fixed if they looked past their own bias can progress into a dangerous condition that affects a patient’s entire life.
> 
> For the codependent, this means being your own advocate and trusting yourself. If you feel that your therapist isn’t helping you, find one you can trust and who will listen to you.

### Release Unhealthy Guilt and Embrace Yourself

According to Beattie, codependents’ low self-esteem is usually caused by impossible standards and unhealthy guilt. You need to release those standards and guilt to truly love yourself.

#### Release Unhealthy Guilt

**Healthy guilt prompts change and growth, while unhealthy guilt just lingers and causes pain and anxiety,** Beattie clarifies. Thoughts and feelings trigger unhealthy guilt, rather than actions. For example, you feel unhealthy guilt over being angry, even if you don’t react to your anger in any negative ways. Feeling guilty for your anger is pointless, as you handled the emotion in a healthy way.

In cases of unhealthy guilt, the codependent’s tendency to give so much of themself without receiving anything in return is a form of self-punishment. You feel the need to atone for your very existence, so you help others as much as possible and refuse the help of others.

Beattie is adamant that **who you are is good, and you deserve a life free from guilt.** Your problems and mistakes do not define you, and you shouldn’t be plagued by guilt over them. And while it isn’t your fault that you have low self-esteem, so you shouldn’t feel guilty about that either, is it your responsibility to work toward healing.

(Shortform note: The best way to live a guilt-free life is to focus on the present rather than the past, determine what values are important to you, and develop a growth mindset, as discussed previously.)

> **Guilt, Shame, and Self-Punishment**
> 
> Research supports Beattie’s idea that healthy guilt prompts change, while unhealthy guilt just hurts. This is because healthy guilt is directed at actions, while unhealthy guilt attacks your self-esteem. Brené Brown refers to this as “shame” in _Daring Greatly._ She argues that shame is counterproductive because it damages your idea of self, which makes you less confident and less likely to change in the future. If you think you’re doomed to be a bad person, you’re not going to try to change.
> 
> Shame often leads to punishing yourself through denying yourself good things, speaking negatively about yourself, or self-harm. Usually this happens because you feel like you’ve done something wrong and you take the responsibility to correct yourself. When motivated by healthy guilt, this is a good thing. When motivated by shame, however, this response becomes unhealthy: You punish yourself excessively and further internalize the idea that you’re a bad person.
> 
> To overpower shame, redirect your self-punishing thoughts to ones of self-love. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and you’ll do better next time. If you can, make amends to the wronged person. Finally, consider what acts of kindness you can do for yourself. This will retrain your brain to practice self-love rather than wallowing in shame.

#### Embrace Yourself

How can you heal from unhealthy guilt and embrace yourself? Remember that **all you can be is yourself, and all you can do is your best,** Beattie says. Let go of the impossible standard of perfection: it’s only once you’ve embraced yourself as you are that you can grow as a person.

Beattie maintains that your worth is your own, just like your actions. It doesn’t depend on others’ behavior or acceptance. You are still worthwhile if someone rejects you. The way others treat you is a reflection on them and their situations, not you.

(Shortform note: While there are certainly times this is true, it isn’t always the case. In Chapter 2 we talked about mirroring, where people will mimic your behavior toward them. Hold people responsible for their actions, but monitor your own behavior to see how they might be reflecting off you.)

Beattie concludes that how you feel about yourself changes how you act and how others see you. If you believe you are funny, charming, or beautiful, other people will too. This isn’t a trick or a way to fool other people into thinking you’re something you’re not. **Loving yourself means living authentically**. You’ve always had humor, charm, and beauty inside of you: now you’re learning to let them shine.

> **Healthy Striving vs. Perfectionism and Self-Loathing**
> 
> Research supports Beattie’s suggestions that letting go of perfectionistic behavior is part of healing. Brown argues that perfectionism is a defense mechanism against shame. You seek approval externally and believe you can reach perfection if you try hard enough. Doing things perfectly is the source of your emotional security and self-worth. When you fail to meet your impossible standards, you feel worthless.
> 
> The cure to perfectionism is “healthy striving,” the practice of setting reasonable goals based on your wants and needs rather than external validation. Meeting these reasonable goals will arguably help you to believe in yourself.
> 
> There are three major ideas underpinning healthy striving:
> 
>   * **Focus on what you learn and how you grow during the process rather than just the goal.** This will let you find meaning in the experience, even if you don’t meet your goal perfectly.
> 
>   * **Assign goals and standards for yourself in a sequential, step-by-step format.** This will let you experience success and will keep you from getting overwhelmed.
> 
>   * **Ask yourself, “What is the worst that could happen if I don’t succeed perfectly?”** Consider how realistic this is and what more likely options are.
> 
> 

> 
> Healthy striving can also help you decide how to present yourself to other people. For example, you could wake up half an hour earlier so you can do your hair rather than rushing. The goal is not to change who you are, but to strive to be your best.
