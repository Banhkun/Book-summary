## Exercise: Apply the Mentors’ Advice

Since the advice in _Tribe of Mentors_ is so wide-ranging, something in the book is likely relevant to your life situation. Complete and repeat this exercise whenever you need to translate some of the wisdom in this guide into productive action.

* * *

Which piece of advice from _Tribe of Mentors_ feels the most useful for your current life situation, and why? (For example, perhaps Drew Houston’s advice to track how you spend your time resonated with you because you can’t seem to find the time to make progress on the side business you want to start.)

Use that piece of advice to identify one small task you could do to improve your life. Make this task something that takes 15 minutes or less to make it easy to motivate yourself to do it. (For example, perhaps you want to make a daily log of how you spend each hour. That way, you can identify places where you can replace meaningless actions, like scrolling social media, with ones that help you progress your side business.)

Make a plan to turn this task into a habit. How often would you ideally want to repeat this task? How could you motivate yourself to stick with it? (For example, perhaps you want to review your previous day’s schedule for 15 minutes every single morning. To get yourself to stick with it, you set your morning alarm 15 minutes earlier and reward yourself by listening to your favorite song every time you do it.)
