## Chapter 13: The Lackses (and HeLa) in the 80s

Deborah divorced Cheetah in 1976 and remarried in 1980. Her second husband, James Pullum, was a mechanic, and he’d been a petty criminal before finding Christianity. He’d begun moonlighting as a preacher shortly before he and Deborah wed.

Zakariyya, for his part, had been released from jail early, having served about half of his fifteen-year sentence. He was effectively homeless: His anger issues made keeping a job difficult, and he resented Day so intensely for leaving him to Ethel’s abuse that he refused to sleep in Day’s house. **He would often sleep on the steps of a church across the street from Day’s** ; it wasn’t uncommon for Day to pass his own son sleeping on the concrete when he left the house.

Desperate for money, Zakariyya began volunteering for scientific studies at Hopkins. **Among other experiments, he allowed himself to be infected with malaria to test a new drug**. The researchers had no idea he was Henrietta Lacks’s son because of his new name.

Sonny, meanwhile, was in jail for selling drugs; and Deborah’s son, Alfred, had been arrested multiple times for crimes like breaking and entering. Alfred enlisted in the Marines but went AWOL, and even a stint in a minimum security prison did nothing to scare him straight: He continued to steal and frequently came home on drugs.

In 1985, while Deborah was struggling to deal with Alfred, she discovered a book written about the scientific community’s effort to contain the HeLa contamination. **A chapter of the book drew heavily on Henrietta’s medical records—records which no one in the Lacks family had seen or had permitted others to see**. The chapter narrated Henrietta’s excruciating decline and death in vivid detail, causing Deborah incredible anguish.

(When Skloot questioned Michael Gold, the journalist who’d written the book, he claimed that either McKusick or Jones had given him the medical records. When Skloot questioned Jones, Jones couldn’t remember the book or the journalist and denied his or McKusick’s sharing them.)

**At the time, medical records weren’t confidential**. Although various ethical codes, including the American Medical Association Code of Ethics and the Hippocratic Oath, stipulated that patient information be kept confidential, there was no federal law regarding its confidentiality. And although some states had passed laws of their own to protect patient information, Maryland wasn’t one of them.

> **Hippocratic Oath**
> 
> Taken by doctors upon receiving their degree in medicine, the Hippocratic Oath includes several commitments Henrietta’s and her family’s doctors failed to uphold, including provisions for patients’ privacy and economic wellbeing.
> 
> “ _I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:_
> 
> _I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow._
> 
> _I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures [that] are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism._
> 
> _I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug._
> 
> _I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery._
> 
> _I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God._
> 
> _I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick._
> 
> _I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure._
> 
> _I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm._
> 
> _If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help_.”

### HeLa, HPV, and Human Evolution

While Henrietta’s surviving family was suffering, her cells were still thriving—and helping to study and treat viruses like Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

About a year before the appearance of Gold’s book, a german virologist discovered an especially virulent strain of HPV: HPV-18. Once he discovered that the HeLa cells in his lab tested positive for the strain, he requested a sample from Henrietta’s original tissue to rule out the possibility his HeLa cells were contaminated. **He found that Henrietta had been infected with _multiple copies_ of HPV-18**.

As HPV research progressed throughout the 80s—the German virologist would eventually be awarded the Nobel Prize for developing an HPV vaccine—scientists were able to determine precisely how Henrietta’s cancer started. HPV infects cells by inserting its DNA into its host and causing the host to turn cancerous; **in Henrietta’s case, the HPV DNA in her cervical cells turned off a tumor suppressor gene**.

Although scientists were able to discover the root cause of Henrietta’s cancer, they were at a loss to explain why her cells flourished so incredibly in culture. Henrietta’s Clover relatives, however, had their own theories: Divine punishment for leaving Clover or original sin, or malevolent spirits. **Henrietta’s cousin Sadie even wondered whether Henrietta’s insides had been colonized by something from outer space**.

Ironically, some scientists at the time were asking a related question: Were HeLa cells even still human? The scientists argued that HeLa cells, because they’d been reproducing (through cell division) and evolving separately from the human species for so long, had become _their own species_. (Most scientists dismissed this argument, with one observing that, if Henrietta were still alive and able to provide a sample, her DNA would match HeLa’s.)

HeLa cells also contributed to renewed speculation about the possibility of everlasting life. Whereas healthy human cells inevitably died in culture after dividing about fifty times, cancerous cells—as exemplified by HeLa—divided indefinitely. One indication that healthy cells are nearing their end is the progressive shortening of their chromosomes’ “telomeres”—strings of DNA at the end of each chromosome. In the early 90s, a Yale researcher studying HeLa cells discovered that HeLa produces a particular enzyme that prevents the telomeres from shortening, thereby enabling the cell to continue dividing.
