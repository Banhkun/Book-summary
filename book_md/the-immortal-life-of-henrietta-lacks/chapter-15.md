## Chapter 15: Getting in Touch with the Lackses

Around the same time that Deborah was learning about the traumas her mother and sister had endured, Skloot was conducting research into Henrietta. In 1999, on her twenty-seventh birthday, Skloot came across a collection of papers delivered at Pattillo’s conference dedicated to Henrietta.

Skloot immediately called Pattillo. She explained she was writing a book on Henrietta Lacks and asked Pattillo if he could put her in touch with Henrietta’s surviving family. Pattillo, skeptical of Skloot’s intentions, asked her what she knew about African-Americans’ historical experience with medical researchers in the US. Skloot described the Tuskegee syphilis study, “Mississippi Appendectomies,” and the lack of funding for sickle-cell anemia.

> **Mississippi Appendectomies**
> 
> An outgrowth of the eugenics movement of the 1920s and 1930s in the US, “Mississippi Appendectomies” were involuntary hysterectomies performed on black women, typically in the Deep South. These surgeries were performed to prevent African-Americans from reproducing as well as to allow doctors “practice” in performing the procedure. Between the 1930s and 1970s, thousands of African-Americans, men and women, were sterilized involuntarily.
> 
> **Sickle-Cell Anemia**
> 
> Sickle-cell anemia is a hereditary blood condition that causes fatigue, pain, swelling of the extremities, and other symptoms in the affected. Between 8% and 10% of African-Americans carry the sickle-cell trait (due to intraracial procreation, not biological difference). Despite sickle-cell anemia’s affecting millions of Americans of a variety of races, nationalities, and ethnicities, its research is chronically underfunded.

Pattillo wasn’t convinced immediately, but after three more days of Skloot’s persuading, he relented and gave Skloot Deborah Lacks’s number.

The first time Skloot called Deborah, mere weeks after her breakdown, Deborah was extremely enthusiastic about the book and alluded to all sorts of events in the family’s history—Skloot could barely keep up. The second time, Deborah was reticent. Deborah told Skloot that she couldn’t continue talking to her unless Skloot spoke to the men in the family: Day, Lawrence, and Sonny.

For days Skloot couldn’t get in touch with any of them. **Finally, when she reached Day, he told her to leave him alone and hung up**.

### Skloot Visits Turner Station and Clover

Tired of seeing Skloot’s number on his pager, Sonny finally agreed to meet her. He’d spoken to Pattillo—although Skloot didn’t know this at the time—to ask about Skloot, and he promised to take Skloot to meet Lawrence, Day, and, possibly, Deborah, when they met up.

Skloot travelled to Baltimore from Pittsburgh. Unable to get in touch with Sonny upon her arrival, she decided to visit Turner Station and see if she could locate the Lackses’ old house (she’d come across the address in an old newspaper article). The article had also mentioned Courtney Speed’s foundation and her grocery store.

Turner Station in 1999 was no longer the bustling neighborhood it was in the 40s. The streets had been rezoned for commercial purposes—there was now a massive power plant in the middle of the neighborhood—and most of the residents had moved elsewhere.

Skloot drove around the small neighborhood several times, passing by both Henrietta’s old home and a run-down mobile home where Speed’s Grocery was supposed to be. Through a chance meeting with a local pastor, she discovered that the mobile home _was_ Speed’s Grocery, and she was quickly thereafter introduced to Courtney Speed.

When Skloot mentioned that she was writing about Henrietta, Speed clammed up, referencing the trouble with Cofield. Although Speed refused to say anything more about the Lackses until Skloot met with the family, she did supply Skloot with the BBC documentary, which Skloot had been trying to find for months. The documentary featured Henrietta’s cousins from Clover, and when Sonny finally returned Skloot’s calls, saying that the family had decided not to meet her after all,**Skloot resolved to visit Clover herself**.

The population of Clover had dwindled to around 200 when Skloot arrived in 1999. What she found was nearly a ghost town: Although all the stores were seemingly abandoned, there was still brand new merchandise in the clothing stores, and there were half-full shopping carts in the aisles of the grocery store.

Lacks Town, the Lacks’s ancestral farm, was separated from the rest of Clover by a two-lane road. Lacks Town consisted of a single road fronted by dozens of houses of various styles and in various conditions—alongside collapsed shacks that once housed enslaved people were cinder-block homes with modern accoutrements like satellite dishes.

Skloot drove the length of Lacks Town several times before being flagged down by Hector Henry—“Cootie”—Henrietta’s first cousin, who invited Skloot into his home.

Cootie told Skloot that Henrietta was kind and generous—Cootie had had polio in his youth, and Henrietta always told him she wanted to fix it. **Cootie also told Skloot that Henrietta’s sickness might have been the result of voodoo, cast either by a person or an evil spirit**. Cootie believed that spirits haunted Lacks Town.

Another cousin, who lived just down the road from Cootie and whom Cootie recommended Skloot talk to, took Skloot to see Henrietta’s grave. **It was unmarked, and the cousin couldn’t tell Skloot exactly _where_ Henrietta lay**.

While Skloot was in Clover, she encountered firsthand the racism that persisted in the South. When she visited the oldest white Lackses still living in Clover—they were distantly related to Henrietta Lacks’s great-great-grandfather and so distantly related to Henrietta Lacks herself—**they denied their kinship with the black Lackses and disdained the mixing of the races**. And when Skloot spoke with Henrietta’s sister Gladys, she informed Skloot that their youngest sister Lillian had “converted to Puerto Rican”—Lillian was light-skinned and had married a Puerto Rican man, and she was tired of being black.
