## Chapter 8: More Trouble for the Lackses

In the 60s, while HeLa cells were occupying a central role in scientific research and being shot into space, **Henrietta’s children were struggling with the repercussions of their traumatic childhood**.

By 1966, 18-year-old Deborah had embarked on a relationship with Cheetah Carter, the boy she’d been walking with when Galen punched her, and become pregnant with their first child, Alfred, Jr. Deborah’s pregnancy notwithstanding, Bobbette insisted Deborah finish high school and get a job, and Bobbette helped take care of Alfred Jr. so Deborah could do so.

Lawrence, the eldest Lacks child, had a convenience store, and Sonny had joined the Air Force—they were thriving. Joe, however, the youngest, was struggling. The abuse Ethel had heaped on him had caused him to develop severe anger management issues. His tendency to pick fights resulted in his dropping out of high school and, later, getting thrown out of the army.

Back in Baltimore, Joe—who’d earned the nickname “Crazy Joe” around the neighborhood—began to be threatened by a local man named Eldridge Ivy. One night Ivy, who was taller and heavier than Joe, beat him severely for no reason.**The following evening, Joe stabbed Ivy in the chest, killing him**.

Joe fled to Clover, where he drank heavily and threatened to kill members of his own family. Eventually he decided to return to Baltimore and turn himself in. He was sentenced to 15 years rather than the maximum 30—there is some indication that the judge took his psychological difficulties into account—in a medium-security prison. There, he converted to Islam and changed his name to Zakariyya Bari Abdul Rahman.

Meanwhile, Deborah had married Cheetah. Shortly after the birth of their second child, LaTonya, Cheetah began using drugs and abusing Deborah. He also began selling drugs out of the house in front of their children.

One day Cheetah, drunk and high, began beating Deborah. On a previous occasion when Cheetah hit her she’d threatened him with a knife; now, when he stumbled toward the steps of their apartment, she pushed him down them. When she saw he was still alive, she dragged him outside—it was frigid and snowing—and left him on the ground without a coat to freeze.

When she woke the next morning, she found Cheetah still alive, sitting on their building’s front stoop. He thought he’d been jumped. Deborah put him in bed and then called Bobbette. **She told Bobbette that she was going to kill Cheetah in his sleep with a monkey wrench**. Bobbette convinced her not to, and the next day, while Cheetah was at work, Deborah and children moved out.
