## Chapter 14: Deborah’s Breakdown

1996 was a triumphant year in the Lacks family story. The BBC began filming a documentary about Henrietta and HeLa, and Roland Pattillo, a gynecologist at Morehouse School of Medicine and one of George Gey’s only African-American students, organized the inaugural HeLa Cancer Control Symposium. The symposium featured research presentations on cancer in minority populations,**and Pattillo even managed to get the city of Atlanta to declare October 11, 1996, Henrietta Lacks Day**.

The Lacks family was invited to the conference and welcomed as honored guests; people even asked for their autographs. It was a pivotal moment for Deborah, who gave a heartfelt speech about how much she missed her mother.

The BBC filmed the conference, and shortly thereafter visited Turner Station to interview residents about Henrietta. Their presence piqued the interest of Courtney Speed, the owner of a local grocery store and beauty parlor, who’d just founded an organization devoted to raising Turner Station’s profile by touting famous residents of the past.

Speed and a colleague named Barbara Wyche began writing letters to federal and state politicians, as well as the Smithsonian museum, urging them to recognize Henrietta’s contribution to science. After an intimate event at the Smithsonian, which the Lackses attended, a curator advised Speed and Wyche to found a museum in Turner Station devoted to African-American health. Speed and Wyche created the Henrietta Lacks Health History Museum Foundation with Speed as president and began planning events and making Henrietta Lacks merchandise. Deborah wasn’t given an official position in the foundation, but she spoke at the group’s events and grudgingly gave her blessing to their using her mother’s name and fundraising (she hoped their efforts would help her learn more about her mother).

Speed and Wyche’s lobbying on Henrietta’s behalf continued to bear fruit:**The Maryland State Senate offered an “official congratulations” to Henrietta Lacks, and, in 1997, a congressman from Maryland paid formal tribute to Henrietta in the US House of Representatives**. Speed and Wyche had also petitioned Hopkins for help in celebrating Henrietta’s life, and although the institution wasn’t sure what role to play, a small committee began meeting informally to discuss ways to commemorate Henrietta’s contribution to science.

Their efforts were derailed, unfortunately, by the appearance of Sir Lord Keenan Kester Cofield. Cofield claimed to be distantly related to Deborah by marriage—the family wasn’t exactly sure how—and when he called Deborah out of the blue, he told her he was a lawyer and that the family should copyright “Henrietta Lacks” and sue Hopkins for medical malpractice. **He believed that Hopkins had made millions off of HeLa and that the Lackses were entitled to their share**. (In his response to Speed and Wyche’s petition about Henrietta, an assistant to the president of Johns Hopkins emphasized that the school had never made any money from the culture and distribution of HeLa.) If the Lackses wanted his help, Cofield would work for free and only accept payment if he won.

Soon enough Deborah was introducing Cofield as the family’s lawyer. He began visiting Hopkins daily to search through the medical school’s archives. He reported terrifying details to the Lackses: That Henrietta had been treated by unqualified or incompetent doctors, that her cancer had been misdiagnosed, that her death might have been caused by a radiation overdose rather than the cancer.

One day Cofield attempted to view Henrietta’s medical records. When he was denied—only doctors and family members were allowed access to the records—he claimed he was a doctor. This tipped off a Hopkins lawyer, who discovered Cofield was neither a lawyer nor a doctor but a long-time conman who’d spent time in prison for fraud and sued anyone he could to make a buck. The lawyer immediately notified Deborah, and Cofield was barred from seeing Henrietta’s records.

**Realizing his relationship with the Lackses was over, Cofield sued everybody** : Deborah and Lawrence, Courtney Speed and her foundation, and a host of Hopkins employees. Among Cofield’s many accusations, the most absurd was that, because Henrietta Lacks’s birth name was Loretta Pleasant and no official record existed of her changing her name, Henrietta Lacks didn’t truly exist and her family had no right to her records.

As Deborah received legal document after legal document, she took out her fear and frustration on Speed. One day she barged into Speed’s Grocery, yelled at Speed, and demanded everything she owned related to Henrietta Lacks. The irony was that Speed herself was frightened. She too had received mountains of legal documents—they were piling up in the store’s backroom.

Around this time the BBC documentary aired, and Deborah began fielding calls and requests from reporters. She decided that she needed to see her mother’s medical records for herself and went to Hopkins to request a copy. While she was there, she met with the Hopkins lawyer who had warned her about Cofield, and he assured her that Hopkins would handle Cofield’s litigation (Hopkins eventually would get the case dismissed). **Unfortunately, Cofield’s behavior had worried the small group hoping to commemorate Henrietta, and the group dropped the idea**.

The ugly episode with Cofield took a toll on Deborah. Even though the case had been dismissed, Deborah worried that Cofield might try to steal from her to hurt her further. She became a shut-in, only leaving the house to work her job as a bus driver for children with special needs. After a teenager on the bus attacked her on two separate occasions, the second time injuring her spine, her mood darkened even further.

During this period, Deborah read her mother’s medical records. She discovered the name of the institution that her sister, Elsie (Lacks’s second child), had been committed to: Crownsville. When she called the institution for Elsie’s records, a staff member related that most of the facility’s documents prior to 1955—the year of Elsie’s death—had been destroyed. Deborah feared that the institution was hiding something terrible from her, just as she feared Hopkins was.

Mere hours after she got off the phone with the institution, she broke out in hives all over her body and became disoriented and short of breath. She went to the hospital,**where her doctor discovered that her blood pressure was high enough to have caused a stroke**.
