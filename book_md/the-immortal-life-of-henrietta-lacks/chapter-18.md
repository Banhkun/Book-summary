## Chapter 18: Deborah Sees HeLa and Learns About Elsie

In April 2001, almost a year after Skloot and Deborah finally met in person, Deborah received an invitation to the National Foundation for Cancer Research’s annual conference. The conference would be held in Henrietta’s honor, and the president would present Deborah a plaque to commemorate her mother’s contribution to science. Deborah decided that she needed to see her mother’s cells before she attended the conference.

Unfortunately, on the same day that Deborah called Skloot about the conference, she also learned her son Alfred had been arrested. He and a friend had robbed several liquor stores at gunpoint, and the police apprehended Alfred at his house in front of his son, Alfred Jr.

A month later Deborah, Zakariyya, and Skloot met on Hopkins campus to visit Lengauer’s lab. The others Skloot had invited weren’t in attendance. Even though Day had long wanted to see his wife’s cells, he wasn’t able to join them.**His health was in bad decline—he was eighty-five, had heart problems and high blood pressure, and had had a leg amputated due to Diabetes**. Sonny had to go to his job, and Lawrence, for his part, had become convinced that Skloot was working with Hopkins to spy on the family.

First, Lengauer brought his visitors to the freezer room, where Henrietta’s cells were stored. Lengauer approached a particular floor-to-ceiling freezer and opened it, releasing a cloud of vapor. Inside the freezer were thousands of vials, each filled with HeLa cells.

Lengauer explained that there was always the danger of contamination—which Deborah knew about from her research—then gave Deborah a vial to hold. She began blowing on it and warming it between her hands, saying that her mother was cold.

Their next stop was the small lab where Lengauer incubated HeLa cells. There were gallon-sized jugs in the room, and he explained that, once the cells were incubated, they would start growing indefinitely, filling the jugs. He removed a dish of cells from the incubator and placed it under a microscope. The microscope was fitted with a monitor, and as Lengauer increased the magnification, the HeLa cells came into greater focus.

Deborah asked about the difference between DNA and cells, and Lengauer explained that DNA were _in_ the cells, in the cell’s nucleus. He also explained how Henrietta’s cancer developed: Her HPV virus caused a change in her cells’ DNA that turned them cancerous. When it became clear that Deborah thought some of the cells they were looking at were normal and others cancerous, Lengauer informed her they were _all_ cancerous.

After a bit of searching, Lengauer was able to find a cell in the middle of dividing. Zakariyya and Deborah were transfixed. The conversation shifted to Hopkins’s ill-treatment of the Lackses, and Lengauer agreed with Deborah and Zakariyya that Hopkins had done wrong by them. **Showing them the catalog from which he ordered HeLa cells, which were priced at $167 a vial, he compared the cells to crude oil and said the Lackses should be getting at least a cut of the proceeds**.

### Visiting Crownsville

In addition to accompanying Deborah to see her mother’s cells, Skloot had promised to help Deborah find information on her sister Elsie. The day after the visit to Lengauer’s lab, Skloot and Deborah began a weeklong trip that would take them to Crownsville, MD, Clover, and Roanoke, to the house where Henrietta was born.

The institution where Elsie lived most of her life, the Hospital for the Negro Insane, was now the Crownsville Hospital Center, a state-of-the-art medical facility. As Skloot and Deborah walked the halls, the place appeared to be abandoned; and when they came across room labeled “Medical Records,” they found that the room was empty.

Eventually they found someone to help them: a bushy-bearded man named Paul Lurz. After Deborah told him about Elsie—that people thought she was disabled but that Deborah suspected she was just deaf—Lurz rose and went to a storage cabinet. Although most of Crownsville’s medical records from between 1910 and the late fifties had been destroyed—the documents had become contaminated with asbestos—Lurz had saved some clothbound books full of autopsy reports.

Miraculously, he had a book that contained reports from 1955. Even more miraculously, there was a record for Elsie Lacks. **And even more miraculously than that, the record contained a picture of Elsie as a girl**. In the picture, Elsie is screaming and crying, her head held in place against height measurements on a wall by a white staff member. The report itself revealed that Elsie was diagnosed with “idiocy” likely because she and/or her mother was syphilitic, and that, for six months prior to her death, she’d forced herself to vomit by sticking her fingers down her throat.

As Skloot, Deborah, and Lurz were reading the report, a man burst into the room and questioned them. Deborah presented documents proving she was a relative of Elsie’s and had a right to view her medical records.

Deborah submitted a request to have copies made of Elsie’s records, and Lurz left Skloot and Deborah with some archival documents to look through while he made the copies. A 1958 article from the _Washington Post_ revealed that Crownsville in the ’50s was more awful than Skloot and Deborah had imagined. **In 1955, the facility was 800 patients over capacity. Patients with all sorts of diagnoses—from dementia and TB to “low self-esteem”—were grouped together in airless rooms, and many patients had to share beds, sleeping head to toe on twin mattresses. Some rooms had drains on the floor rather than toilets**.

Skloot would later learn that doctors had performed experiments on Crownsville patients without their consent. One study concerned pneumoencephalography, a procedure that allowed for crisp X-rays of the brain by draining the natural fluid that surrounds and protects the brain. The side-effects of pneumoencephalography were many, including seizures, nausea, headaches, and permanent brain damage. **When Skloot consulted Lurz about the study, he said that, given the years the study was conducted, it was likely Elsie had been one of the subjects**.

After learning about Crownsville and what had happened to Elsie, Deborah was surprisingly upbeat. Lurz had informed them the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis had any surviving records that weren’t on the Crownsville grounds, and Deborah was keen to go there immediately (despite Skloot’s gentle probing of her emotional state).

There were no further records concerning Elsie in Annapolis, so Deborah and Skloot drove on to Clover. Each time they stopped, Deborah would approach strangers and, apropos of nothing, present them with the picture of Elsie and introduce Skloot as her “reporter.” Deborah would also pull over occasionally to relate to Skloot her latest idea about her mother’s legacy; on one occasion, Deborah was near tears: She said she couldn’t keep her eyes on the road because she kept looking at the copy of the picture of Elsie.

Meanwhile, Deborah had promised that when they stopped for the night, she would let Skloot look at her mother’s records. When they checked into a hotel, she gave the records to Skloot before going to her own room to sleep.
