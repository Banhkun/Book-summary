## Chapter 11: The Lackses Learn the Truth

It wasn’t until a _Rolling Stone_ reporter named Michael Rogers visited the family in 1975 that the Lackses finally understood the full significance of their mother’s cells.

Rogers knew immediately that the family had been kept in the dark about HeLa contamination and the doctors’ reasons for drawing blood. He explained cell culture and the stakes of the HeLa outbreak to the best of his ability.

At the time, no one besides Deborah was too disturbed by their mother’s cells’ wide spread. **But that changed when Rogers’ story was published and the Lackses discovered that HeLa cells were not only distributed for free by nonprofit institutions but also sold by commercial firms**.

This revelation caused Sonny and Lawrence to believe that Hopkins and George Gey had gotten rich selling their mother’s cells. **The truth, however, was that Gey was a terrible businessman and never rich at all** : He patented neither the HeLa cell line nor the roller drum he created to culture cells—either of which would have made him a multimillionaire—and at times had trouble making payments on his modest house. And Hopkins has issued multiple statements asserting the institution has received no financial reward from HeLa cells.

**Other entities, however, have made fortunes on HeLa cells**. Microbiological Associates, one of the first commercial cell culture companies and earliest sellers of HeLa, was later incorporated by two of the largest biotech companies in the world. One of these companies, Invitrogen, sells HeLa-derived products for anywhere from $100 to $10,000 per unit. And the ATCC, which still exists, currently sells HeLa cultures for $256 per vial.

**Deborah, for her part, was more concerned with how her mother had been treated than recouping money**. She bought books to educate herself on cell science and recorded heartbreaking journal entries imagining how lonely her mother must have been in the hospital. She also personified her mother’s cells, and every time she read about their being subjected to new diseases and experiments, she imagined it was her _mother_ undergoing those trials.

With the appearance of the _Rolling Stone_ article came further media inquiries, including from publications like _Jet_ and _Ebony_ that were marketed to African Americans. Given the historical moment, when memories of the Tuskegee syphilis study were still fresh and the Black Panthers were accusing the white-dominated medical establishment of racism, a story involving the improper collection and commodification of a black woman’s cells was timely news.

At the same time that Henrietta was becoming a known figure, McKusick and Hsu were publishing the results of their research into the Lacks’ genes.**Incredibly, the authors presented the Lackses’ genetic information with labels like “Husband” and “Child 1” alongside Henrietta’s real name, which would allow anyone to know whose genetic information was whose**. A breach of privacy like this would, in the present, be a crime under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that could trigger fines of up to $250,000 or jail time.

The Lackses were totally oblivious to McKusick and Hsu’s publication. They didn’t even know that Hsu had drawn blood for a gene study; they thought the doctors were still researching cancer. **If the Lackses had known what was going on and had the resources to consult and hire a lawyer, they might have been able to sue Hopkins. Unfortunately, they didn’t**. But another human subject who’d been studied without consent, a white man named John Moore, did know what had been done to him; and he was about to bring the topic of scientific ethics into the mainstream.
