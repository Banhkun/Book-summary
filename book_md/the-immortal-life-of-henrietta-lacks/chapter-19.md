## Chapter 19: Henrietta’s Records

Minutes after Skloot closed the door to her room, Deborah reappeared: She wanted to look through the records with Skloot.

The records filled an entire bag. When Deborah upended the bag over the bed, Skloot saw a hundred-plus pages in complete disarray fall onto the coverlet. And Deborah refused to allow Skloot to photocopy the materials: She insisted that Skloot sort through the papers and take notes in front of her.

As they sorted through the documents, Deborah alternated between excitement and panic; sometimes she would hand Skloot documents to read, other times hide documents under Skloot’s pillow. Finally, she curled up on Skloot’s bed, staring at the picture of Elsie and occasionally providing comment about what she thought Elsie must have been feeling.

After hours of reviewing the material, Skloot sat back, exhausted. Deborah, who had been poring over her sister’s autopsy, came across an unfamiliar word and asked Skloot what it meant. When Skloot told her, Deborah asked that Skloot not put the word in her book. Skloot agreed and smiled at Deborah’s protectiveness of her sister. But Deborah, who was already out of sorts over Skloot’s review of her mother’s records, misinterpreted Skloot’s smile. **She thought Skloot was lying about not putting the word in and began throwing her mother’s records back into the bag**.

Skloot attempted to calm Deborah down, but suddenly Deborah charged Skloot and pushed her up against the wall. She interrogated Skloot, asking her if she was working for Johns Hopkins and, if not, who was paying her.

At first, Skloot tried to explain as she’d done before, but then she lost her temper. **She freed herself from Deborah’s grasp and cursed her**. To Skloot’s surprise, Deborah calmed down; she even straightened Skloot’s hair. As an explanation for her paranoia, Deborah told Skloot for the first time about Cofield.

After Deborah made Skloot promise not to copy down _all_ the information from her mother’s records—she wanted some aspects of her mother to remain private—she went back to her room. She was still agitated, however, and she appeared intermittently at Skloot’s door, making a number of excuses for her visits. The final time she summoned Skloot to the door before finally going to sleep, she’d broken out in hives from anxiety.

Skloot was able to sleep only one hour before Deborah woke her at six for the hotel’s complimentary breakfast. Once they were in the lobby, Deborah told Skloot that they were “OK.” Skloot concurred, but she wasn’t sure she believed it.
