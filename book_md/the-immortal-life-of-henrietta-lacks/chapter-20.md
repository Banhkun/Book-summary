## Chapter 20: Clover and Back to Baltimore

By the time Skloot and Deborah arrived in Clover, Deborah’s hives had worsened and she was swigging from a bottle of Benadryl to manage the reaction. Their first stop was the home-house, where Henrietta had grown up. Deborah had Skloot take pictures of her holding up Elsie’s pictures—in front of the home-house, by Henrietta’s favorite tree, and in the family graveyard near where Henrietta was supposed to have been buried.

They then visited Deborah’s aunt, Gladys. Even though it was relatively warm outside, inside Gladys had a large wood stove burning so hot she perspired. Soon after Skloot and Deborah’s arrival, Gladys’s son, Gary, came through the front door. Deborah immediately showed Gary the newly discovered picture of Elsie and began pacing around the room, rambling about Elsie and Henrietta and random news headlines.

Gary, who’d sat in a large recliner, attempted to calm Deborah. He managed to get her to sit, but only for an instant—soon enough she was up and pacing again, talking a blue streak about what she and Skloot had learned about her mother. Gary made frequent references to scripture, urging Deborah to trust in God and worry more about her herself and less about her mother.

When it became clear that Deborah was losing control, Gary, rising from his chair, explained that God was speaking to him. He approached Deborah with his arms open, and once she touched him, he clasped her head between his hands and brought it to his chest. **He began shaking, singing, and preaching, inviting God into Deborah’s body to heal her**. He summoned God because Deborah needed help “lifting the burden” of her mother’s cells.

Soon Deborah and Gary were crying and beseeching God together, begging him to take the cells from her. **Then Gary looked at Skloot and said that God had sent Skloot to lift Deborah’s burden—to take the cells**. Skloot was shocked.

Immediately Deborah separated from Gary and sighed with relief. She thanked Gary, but Gary gave all the credit to God. At that moment, the rain, which had been a drizzle when Gary first embraced Deborah, suddenly became a downpour. Gary said it was a sign that the Lord had been listening.

### Deborah’s Stroke

The next morning Deborah returned to Baltimore—her hives had improved, but there was still swelling around her eyes and she wanted to see her doctor.

Skloot stayed in Clover to speak to Gary about the previous day’s events. Shortly after she entered Gary’s home, he handed her a bible and commanded her to read some passages aloud. **As she read, Gary told Skloot that Henrietta had been chosen by God to do his work—that she was an angel**.

One of the passages referenced the mortality of the physical body and the immortality of the spiritual body. Skloot asked Gary if he thought HeLa was Henrietta’s spiritual body and he nodded.**And Skloot suddenly realized how and why some in the Lacks family believed Henrietta was an immortal being anointed by God**. Counter-intuitively, that explanation was much simpler than the one McKusick—or any other scientist or doctor—had provided them with. **Just like HeLa, angels were immortal, floated through the air, and cured diseases**. These parallels were much easier to grasp than explanations involving DNA, HPV, and unusual malignancy.

**Deborah, meanwhile, when she arrived at her doctor’s office, was told that her blood pressure and sugar levels were dangerously high—enough so that she was in danger of having a stroke**. The doctor urged her to avoid any stress at all for the near future, so Deborah and Skloot decided that Deborah was better off staying at home when Skloot went on reporting trips. As Skloot’s knowledge developed over the subsequent months, she only told Deborah the positive things she discovered.

At the same time that Skloot was unearthing an array of details about Henrietta’s early life, Deborah was preparing for her speech at the National Foundation for Cancer Research. She was also determined to take college classes—to understand better the science of what happened with her mother—and was taking placement tests and signing up for classes to help her reach tenth-grade reading and math proficiency (which would allow her to register for community college).

Deborah seemed calm and eager, but other aspects of her life weren’t as hopeful. Her son was in prison and would be put on trial shortly after the conference, and one of Lawrence’s sons had been arrested for robbery as well. **And then, the day after she heard about Lawrence’s son and mere days before the conference, terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. It was 9/11**.

Skloot, who’d left early that morning to drive from Pittsburgh to Washington D.C., had to turn back. She and Deborah processed the attacks together over the phone, and Deborah worried that the conference, which had been cancelled, would never be rescheduled.

The Sunday after 9/11, Deborah was in church. Pullum was preaching, and her grandson, nine-year-old Davon, sat with the church choir. At a certain point in the service, Deborah realized that she couldn’t move her arm. She noticed Davon looking at her and tried to signal him that something was wrong but couldn’t. When the service ended and the parishioners stood, Deborah fell to one knee just as Davon rushed off the choir platform, yelling that something was wrong with his grandma.

**Pullum immediately recognized what was ailing Deborah: a stroke**. As soon as Davon heard the word, he dug Deborah’s car key from her purse and raced outside. He opened all of the car doors wide and started the car himself. Pullum drove them in the direction of a nearby fire station; while he drove, Davon kept slapping Deborah to keep her awake.

When they arrived at the fire station, the firefighters administered emergency treatment and put Deborah in an ambulance. They told Davon that he’d saved Deborah’s life by keeping her awake.
