## Chapter 6: HeLa and Medical Ethics

In 1954, a Sloan-Kettering cancer researcher and virologist named Chester Southam who’d worked extensively with HeLa cells began to wonder—and to worry—whether researchers could develop cancer through contact with HeLa cells.**And so he began a series of experiments to determine HeLa cells’ effects on living human subjects**.

His first experiments were conducted on patients who already had cancer. **He injected HeLa cells into these patients’ arms, telling them that he was testing their immune systems, and then monitored the results. Within days, cancerous nodules formed on the patients’ arms**. Some of these patients’ nodules went away on their own, others Southam had to remove. But in four patients, the nodules came back again and again after removal; and in one patient, the cancer spread to her lymph nodes.

**Despite the obvious health risks, Southam continued to experiment with HeLa cells on human subjects**. The shortcoming of the first experiment, according to him, was that it was conducted on patients who already had cancer. In order to get a true sense of the effects of HeLa cells, he needed to test them on healthy patients.

Which he did. In 1956, he recruited 150 inmates in the Ohio prison system to participate in a study similar to his first. (Later, prisoners would be considered a vulnerable population unable to give informed consent.) He injected the inmates with HeLa; but in this instance, the subjects were able to fight off the cancer. In fact, the more HeLa he injected, the more quickly the subjects were able to defeat the cancer.

**In subsequent years, Southam injected HeLa cells into 600 people without their consent, some with cancer, some without. If he explained at all to the patient what he was doing, he said he was “testing for cancer.”**

In 1963, Southam’s ethically questionable practices finally came to light. He’d partnered with Emanuel Mandel, the director of medicine at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, to inject 22 patients with HeLa cells, but three Jewish doctors, who knew about the “research” Nazi doctors had performed on their patients as well as the Nuremberg Code, refused.

> **The Nuremberg Code**
> 
> In 1947, seven Nazi doctors were sentenced to death by a US-led tribunal for performing monstrous experiments on imprisoned Jews. Among other horrors, these doctors had sewn siblings together in an effort to create Siamese twins and dissected living people to study organ function.
> 
> The tribunal proposed an ethical code, composed of ten points, to govern human experimentation across the globe. Dubbed the Nuremberg Code, the document’s first line mandates the “voluntary consent” of any human subject.

The problem was that the principles outlined in the Nuremberg Code weren’t _law_ ; **in fact, at the time,_there were no_ laws __ governing scientific research**. For, although the notion of “informed consent” had been present in the law since 1957, it only applied to medical procedures, not scientific research.

So, over the objections of the doctors, the director of medicine ordered a resident to deliver the injections. The three doctors resigned and notified the press. Soon enough, the public outcry was vociferous enough to cause Southam’s and Mandel’s medical licenses to be suspended for a year.

Although the suspensions were stayed and Southam’s and Mandel’s punishment was downgraded to probation, the case made the public aware of researchers’ practices. The NIH discovered that only a small portion of their grantee institutions had policies to protect research subjects, **and a study in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ revealed that researchers had injected children with hepatitis and exposed anesthetized subjects to poisonous levels of carbon dioxide**. In response, research institutions began to create and implement policies that protected subjects’ fundamental rights.
