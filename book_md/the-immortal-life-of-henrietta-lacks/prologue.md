## Prologue

Author Rebecca Skloot was introduced to Henrietta Lacks—or, rather, her remarkable cells—in a biology class when Skloot was 16.

Her teacher was describing the parts and functions of cells. Cells resemble nothing so much as fried eggs: the white of the egg is the _cytoplasm_ , which contains water and proteins to nourish the yolk of the egg—the _nucleus_ —which contains the genetic material that dictates the cell’s function.

Cells divide through a process called _mitosis_. If something goes wrong during mitosis, even something minuscule, it can result in a cell growing and dividing uncontrollably— _cancer_.

Scientists’ understanding of how cancer operates increased enormously through the study of a particularly robust set of cancer cells taken from an African-American woman named Henrietta Lacks, who died in 1951 from cervical cancer. (Henrietta has also been known as Helen Lane and Helen Larson.)

Henrietta’s cancer cells reproduced unlike any other cells in human history. **Whereas all human cells prior to Henrietta’s died when removed from the human body and placed in a test tube or petri dish, Henrietta’s reproduced consistently and continuously in culture: They were “immortal.”**

Henrietta’s cells, dubbed “HeLa” (pronounced _hee-lah_) cells, have been used widely in scientific research. They were integral to the development of drugs to treat diseases like herpes and Parkinson’s and to the study of ailments like STDs and appendicitis. In fact, **HeLa cells have been so heavily relied upon that a scientist believes, if you lined up every HeLa cell ever grown, you’d be able to circle Earth _three times_**. (For scale, Earth’s circumference is 131.48 million feet, a single HeLa cell has a diameter of approximately 20 micrometers, and 304,800 micrometers make a foot.)

Skloot’s impromptu introduction to Henrietta’s incredible cells when she was 16 spawned a lifetime obsession. As Skloot studied biology in college and writing in graduate school, she continued to hear about and research Henrietta, discovering that her surviving family (1) didn’t approve of the massive reproduction of HeLa cells and (2) had been researched themselves for reasons unknown to them.

Among Henrietta’s family, one person stood out to Skloot as she performed her research: Deborah, Henrietta’s daughter, whose voice was curiously absent from interviews and articles about the Lacks family.
