## Chapter 9: The HeLa Epidemic

With the creation of the CCCC and its cell bank, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), scientists assumed that they’d protected their most cherished cell cultures from contamination.

But in 1966, at a major conference of cell scientists, a geneticist named Stanley Gartler announced that the 18 most-frequently-used cell cultures—which were ostensibly distinct from one another—all exhibited a rare genetic marker that had only been found in African Americans. **Since some of these cell cultures had been taken from caucasian subjects, Gartler’s conclusion was that all of the cell cultures had been contaminated—with HeLa**.

When Gartler revealed that six of his samples came directly from the ATCC, the mood at the conference shifted dramatically. Many of the scientists had believed they were working on discrete, unique cell cultures, when in fact they were just working on HeLa.

This revelation was especially devastating for scientists working under the assumption that healthy cells could “spontaneously transform” into cancerous ones. If cells could spontaneously become cancerous, scientists could study that process and, potentially, develop a therapy to stop it cold. Now, it was clear that that theory was wrong: Healthy cells didn’t spontaneously become cancerous; they simply became contaminated with HeLa. **In the blink of an eye, decades of research and millions of dollars in funding had been rendered worthless**.

After the conference, a cadre of the top cell scientists returned to their labs to test their cultures for the marker Gartler had found. Many of the cultures tested positive.

**This group’s and Gartler’s findings notwithstanding, many cell scientists simply refused to believe their cultures were contaminated**. It wasn’t until 1972 that the scientific community was presented with insurmountable evidence that HeLa contamination was a major threat to cell research, when a Naval researcher discovered that a Russian lab’s culture too was contaminated with HeLa.

With the discovery that HeLa contamination was a global phenomenon, the story made the leap from specialized science journals to the popular press.**And with that transition came renewed interest in the woman behind the “immortal” cells**.

**As it happened, only a year before the Naval researcher discovered that HeLa had crossed the Atlantic, Henrietta’s real name had appeared in print for the first time**. Her doctor, Howard Jones, and several of his colleagues had published a tribute to George Gey, who had passed away from pancreatic cancer in 1971. In that tribute, which ran in a little-known obstetrics journal, the authors revealed that (1) Henrietta’s cancer had been misdiagnosed—it was an adenocarcinoma, not an epidermoid carcinoma—and (2) HeLa’s real name was Henrietta Lacks. But it wasn’t until 1973 that Henrietta’s name became widely known: A journalist for _Science_ , one of the most prestigious journals in the world, issued a correction that the “Helen Lane” she’d referred to in her article was actually “Henrietta Lacks.”
