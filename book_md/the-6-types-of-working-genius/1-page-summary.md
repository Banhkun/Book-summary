## 1-Page Summary

Patrick Lencioni’s _The 6 Types of Working Genius_ argues that everyone possesses certain “geniuses,” or intelligence types, and that all successful teams consist of members possessing a combination of each type. By identifying which traits your team members have, you can maximize both productivity and individual fulfillment.

Lencioni is an entrepreneur, best-selling author, and speaker. In 1997, he founded the Table Group, a consultancy firm designed to coach organizations toward optimal health. Since then, Lencioni has dedicated himself to helping businesses cultivate sounder management practices and workplace happiness.

Lencioni begins the book with a fable, a common feature in his works (including _The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive_ , _Death by Meeting_ , and _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_). It tells of a businessman who, despite many professional shifts and successes, still finds himself consistently drained and irritable towards the people around him. After one of his employees delivers some particularly critical feedback regarding these shifting moods, the businessman and members of his team ultimately divulge what tasks they most love and despise at work, thus revealing their particular natural strengths—the framework for the 6 Geniuses is born.

In this guide, we’ll describe:

  * The six types of “genius” (what we’ll call “intelligence”) and how each is ideally placed within the stages of any project
  * How every individual has one of three ability levels with each intelligence type
  * How to identify your team members’ intelligence types
  * How Lencioni’s intelligence model promotes organizational health



We’ll also situate Lencioni’s framework within the larger conversation surrounding the relationship between talent, intelligences, and workplace efficiency and address several challenges you might experience in universalizing Lencioni’s system.

### Six Geniuses and the Phases of a Project

Lencioni explains that an intelligence type is intrinsic to the individual, meaning the types reflect what that person is naturally good at. Each intelligence helps people excel at one of six essential activities required during any project, from developing your next product to planning a family vacation to establishing a summer fundraiser for your local charity group. These are Lencioni’s names for the six intelligences as well as the descriptions we’ll use to reference them:

  1. Wonder: Perceiving Opportunity
  2. Invention: Innovating Solutions
  3. Discernment: Vetting Ideas
  4. Galvanizing: Mobilizing People
  5. Enablement: Supporting
  6. Tenacity: Seeing Things Through



We’ll describe each intelligence type in more detail below. For now, it’s important to understand that Lencioni argues that each individual excels in only two intelligence types, that the intelligences are mutually complementing, and that all intelligence types must be represented for a team to succeed.

> **Fixed Vs. Growth Mentality?**
> 
> Some may argue that Lencioni’s insistence that everyone celebrate and stick to their natural geniuses—and thus leave all remaining tasks predominantly to others—fits into a _fixed_ mindset approach, where you stick to what you know, believing what you’re good and not good at are essentially unchangeable. In _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck argues that such a _fixed_ mindset can limit you to believing you can never evolve to succeed at anything new.
> 
> For example, a person who is self-observably good at literature may determine that they will never be good at science. According to Dweck, this can lead to insecurity and complacency. Alternatively, people with a _growth_ mindset believe they can improve any skill through hard work, persistence, and the right learning strategies.

Lencioni argues that each of these six intelligences has either a _responsive_(passive) or _disruptive_(active) quality and that this stems from the source of the intelligence’s inspiration. Passive intelligences draw inspiration from the surrounding world and formulate approaches to changing or reorganizing it—in other words, they _respond_ or react to situations. Active intelligences rely instead on their own internal powers to instigate change or impact behaviors—they create, innovate, and pull ideas from thin air.

(Shortform note: Managers can benefit from considering passive vs. active personalities in determining how they approach tasks including training, motivating, and giving feedback. For example, passive employees may require more prompting to share opinions, whereas active personalities thrive in free-form, open conversations. Additionally, passive employees typically avoid conflict, making a lighter, supportive work environment more conducive to their success. On the other hand, active personalities embrace conflict, making it important to provide them with venting opportunities while also tempering tendencies to dominate discussions or offer excessive pushback.)

Moreover, each intelligence is defined by its role during one of three stages of work that Lencioni defines: ideation, activation, and implementation. From here on out, we’ll refer to these as the brainstorming, set-up, and follow-through phases, respectively, and we’ll describe them in more detail below. Each of these three phases comprises two intelligences—one passive and one active.

Lencioni illustrates the three phases on a downwardly sloping gradient he calls _elevation_. The earliest phase of work (brainstorming) is at the top, descending through the remaining phases toward the project’s completion. This gradient has a metaphorical quality, where the earliest phases of work occur when our heads are in the clouds and activities are most conceptual. The process then eventually gains practical definition as it descends.

Lencioni emphasizes that one phase of work or intelligence is not better than another—only that they are most effective in a specific sequence in the life cycle of a project. For instance, early-stage discussions typically can’t tolerate too much task-mastering, because they’re meant to be more open and imaginative. Similarly, abstract creativity in later-stage discussions can distract the focus from the project’s execution and last-minute problem-solving. This means that putting team members in positions that don’t capitalize on their unique intelligence can derail the project.

> **The Cycle of Life**
> 
> Lencioni’s three-phase system offers an alternative approach to the widely-recognized project management lifecycle, which typically has four phases:
> 
>   * **Initiating** entails outlining all of the necessary goals and logistical components for a project, and requires everyone to be on the same page
> 
>   * **Planning** seeks to flesh out those logistics, applying actual processes, making them practical to achieve
> 
>   * **Executing** refers to the direct management of the project as it unfolds. This involves honoring the initial vision, while also making any necessary adjustments that become necessary
> 
>   * **Closing** pertains to delivering the final result to whomever it was designed for, often a customer. It also offers an important juncture for reflection upon what went well but what might also need improvement in the future
> 
> 

> 
> While there are substantial overlaps between the lifecycle model and Lencioni’s own—particularly in the order of conceptualization, planning and logistics, and execution—Lencioni’s first stage places much more specific emphasis on harnessing an individual's unique powers of creation. Additionally, the Lifecycle model does not assign any particular forms of intelligence to its phases.

In this section, we’ll study the six intelligences and their essential traits within their respective phases of work.

#### Phase 1: Brainstorming

Lencioni says the brainstorming stage begins any working process. It involves seeing a need or opportunity and devising ways of addressing or capitalizing on it.

##### Intelligence #1: Perceiving Opportunity

_Category: Passive_

The person with this intelligence gets the ball rolling. She recognizes an opportunity in the status quo and contemplates what’s possible. This intelligence is passive because it reacts to external challenges calling out for solutions and is required to catalyze projects.

For example, imagine your company wants to develop a new razor blade for personal care, but that particular market is saturated. This person sees where your competitors are going wrong and why their products don’t fully satisfy consumer demands: because their prices are staggeringly high. Instead of seeing difficulty, the person with this intelligence sees an opportunity—if you could lower production costs while maintaining quality, your company could make its mark.

(Shortform note: Based on Lencioni’s description, people with the Perceiving Opportunity intelligence might be particularly good at letting their minds wander. Psychologists say that see-sawing between daydreaming and task-focused thinking throughout the day bolsters creativity. The daydreaming interval allows you to break away from time-bound concerns and escape into imagination. Then, when your thoughts return to the task in front of you, you see reality through a new lens.)

##### Intelligence #2: Innovating Solutions

_Category: Active_

The teammate with this intelligence thinks outside the box. After the person with Perceiving Opportunity intelligence identifies the problem or opportunity, the person who innovates solutions provides an approach to fixing or seizing it through her industrious imagination. This intelligence type is active because it relies on its own inherent creativity and vision and is adept at leading brainstorming sessions with onslaughts of new ideas. The person with this type of intelligence is likely the one who will come up with an ingenious design solution for your new product, and because this intelligence is active. she’ll do so without the need for prompting or direction. Perhaps this person sees how to use a lower-cost but high-quality alloy for your company’s razor blade and that machining this alloy with precision will also take less time than the competitor’s expensive, conventional blade.

(Shortform note: For Lencioni, this intelligence represents the consummate “outside-the-box” thinker. But what happens physiologically when someone thinks this way? Research suggests that every individual has multiple innovation centers in the brain, including the hippocampus, the frontal cortex, and the basal ganglia. Increased activity in these areas—and thus more creative thinking—can often be due to intrinsic ability. However, there is also evidence that various activities—including deliberate thought breaks, brainstorming with other creative people, and even hanging around young children—can bolster these abilities. It seems nature _and_ nurture can help you break conceptual boundaries.)

#### Phase 2: Set-Up

This is the critical middle phase of work. This is the time to troubleshoot ideas raised in the previous phase and evaluate their integrity and applicability. This is also the point where the organization must fully commit to the project.

Organizations that dedicate ample time and resources to this phase tend to experience both expedited _and_ positive outcomes. However, according to Lencioni, set-up is typically the most neglected of the three stages of work. When teams rush this phase, they tend to:

  * Deliver under-performing outcomes
  * Forfeit critical steps that can aid in realizing projects
  * Create cycles of mutual blame and resentment among the teammates who lead the previous brainstorming phase and subsequent follow-through phase 



> **Maintaining Momentum**
> 
> Lencioni’s second phase is, in many ways, all about momentum. But what are some methods for maximizing this and keeping the lifeblood flowing through a project?
> 
>   * First, experts suggest consistently reminding your team about the _why_. Reconnect them at each stage of effort with the ultimate significance of their work: its end result or purpose.
> 
>   * Keep creative juices flowing throughout the life of the project. Although Lencioni emphasizes this in his first phase, consider challenging your team to continue taking conceptual risks during this phase as well. Encourage it to experiment and adapt working models.
> 
>   * Share small, incremental triumphs with your team; this helps assure them things are moving forward. Give them concrete and satisfying proof of these victories.
> 
> 


##### Intelligence #3: Vetting Ideas

_Category: Passive_

The person with this intelligence is the one who determines if the proposals suggested during the brainstorming stage meet the criteria of reality. In other words, are they achievable? This person might be the one to question the feasibility of producing your new item on a competitive scale or warn about how much time and money will go into its development.

This intelligence is passive because it requires the existence of ideas outside itself to evaluate; yet, this person is vital in helping organizations select ambitious yet realistic projects. These are the people in your organization who you constantly look to for their intuition and honesty. The person with this intelligence might point out that supplies of your new alloy are not always reliable, making long-term use an issue, or that engineers have already tried and failed to use it. She may suggest that the company find its own supply source and specific engineering talent to make that avenue safe.

> **Building Transparency and Trust**
> 
> Lencioni insists that one of the factors that makes the Vetting Ideas intelligence so critical is its honesty—a willingness to call things for what they are. But there are a number of concerns that can inhibit employees from exhibiting this same kind of frankness on a regular basis:
> 
>   * A fear of offending others (especially their boss!)
> 
>   * Anxiety that they could face blowback for their feedback
> 
>   * Cynicism that such constructive criticism will actually change anything
> 
> 

> 
> To mitigate these concerns, managers should assure team members not only that they are receptive to critical feedback, but also that managers can meet their personal and organizational goals far more easily with this input.

##### Intelligence #4: Mobilizing People

_Category: Active_

The teammate with this intelligence encourages teammates to buy in to projects and is indispensable to getting almost any process off the ground. The intelligence is active because it generates energy and enthusiasm and then passes them along to others. This teammate will get everyone oaring in the same direction and to the same tempo, ensuring that effort is concerted and morale is strong. She will relay to your entire staff how revolutionary your new razor design is (how your organization is the first to use that alloy, in particular) and that the price point you’re going to offer will change the entire market.

These attributes make this intelligence of motivating critical to the central phase of work; in essence, it is a cheerleader archetype.

(Shortform note: In _The Tipping Point_ , Malcolm Gladwell conjures a similar archetype to the Mobilizer __ whom he calls the “Salesman.” Gladwell’s Salesman gets people enthusiastically behind these ideas, leaning on a keen mastery of non-verbal communication, social cues, and emotional reflexes.**** And although Gladwell’s Salesmen function to _spread ideas_ that help create social epidemics (when ideas, messages, or products spread quickly through the public masses) while Lencioni’s mobilizer _spurs action_ on a project, the similarities suggest that they may draw on the same social-emotional strengths.)

#### Phase 3: Follow-Through

Lencioni's final phase involves seeing work to completion. It requires intelligences that supply teams with the resources, guidance, and attention to detail necessary for seeing things through in alignment with the organization’s plan: meeting deadlines, ensuring quality, and holding people accountable.

##### Intelligence #5: Supporting

_Category: Passive_

The person with this intelligence notices when teammates require assistance and jumps in to help them. Lencioni says that this person often recognizes that their teammates need help before they realize it themselves, making them indispensable to the team during fever-pitched moments. For instance, this person might observe that machinists in your manufacturing department are having trouble applying the specs given to them by engineering and then obtain clarification for them. Or, they could help the marketing department express the benefits of your chosen alloy in laymen’s terms so investors and customers understand and become intrigued.

According to Lencioni, this intelligence is passive because it involves responding to others on the team who need assistance.

(Shortform note: The person with the Supporting intelligence is the quintessential team player, and Lencioni underscores their perceptive abilities in recognizing the needs of others. Beyond just their positive attitude and desire to help, however, team players such as these often have an enhanced ability to balance their own needs for success, well-being, and recognition with those of the group. Moreover, they have special abilities to listen actively, seek out opportunities for compromise, and openly celebrate the success of others. This is an intelligence frequently exhibited by successful team athletes and military veterans.)

##### Intelligence #6: Seeing Things Through

_Category: Active_

The person with this intelligence is the taskmaster. She always keeps the end goal in mind, making sure efficiency, timing, and quality are on point. People with this intelligence love to check boxes—they are relentless, nuts-and-bolts thinkers. This is the person who makes sure your new razor blade is ready for that vital sales quarter, that everyone knows the quality and uniqueness of what they’re selling, and that the product itself delivers value, precision, quality, and durability. She’s often focused on late-stage problem-solving, making her territory the least conceptual and most pragmatic stage of work.

This intelligence is active because its personality provides the drive and focus required to see things through. The principal distinction Lencioni describes between this person and someone with Mobilizing intelligence—the person who energizes and motivates the team during the set-up phase of work—is that mobilizing is about inspiring _teammates_ , whereas seeing things through is about doggedly pursuing the _goal_.

(Shortform note: The person with Seeing Things Through intelligence not only gets your team’s project across the finish line but also helps the team gain larger psychological benefits. Psychological investigation recognizes that human beings thrive when experiencing closure—it allows people to feel safe and secure within environments and relationships. On the other hand, failed projects can lead to disappointment, cognitive stress, and reduced faith in the legitimacy of those processes and others’ promises. Therefore, this intelligence conceivably closes a vital circuit in human expectations.)

### Genius, Competency, and Frustration

According to Lencioni, the average individual excels in two of the six forms of intelligence. For the other four, she is _competent_ or proficient at two, and she is _frustrated_ or drained by two.

Proficiency means a short-term ability to perform that task. People may be able to use their proficient intelligences when the team experiences shortfalls with related tasks, but when they do so for an extended time, they become exhausted and irritated. Work quality and morale eventually suffer.

The intelligences that drain a person are those that require tasks they struggle with. If your teammates hold authority over tasks that drain them, Lencioni says it will harm their professional happiness and the work’s successful outcome. Additionally, the rest of the team may misinterpret the person’s failure as being the result of low motivation, team spirit, ability, or the like, when in reality it’s due to their being less naturally inclined to that form of labor.

> **Gone With Red Tape**
> 
> In distinguishing between the categories of _Genius_ , _Competence_ , and _Frustration_ , Lencioni highly values a supervisor’s ability to perceive different intelligences operating within her team. This expectation is part of a broader trend in business literature that seeks to portray modern leaders as more orchestrators of talent than dictators of process.
> 
> One reason for this might be that bureaucracy, which tends to favor top-down organization and direction, tends to stifle creativity and hamper process, as Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini explain in _Humanocracy_. On the contrary, if leaders enable individuals to pursue their own goals and determine a larger portion of their own processes, the organization will benefit. For example, to avoid bureaucratic smothering, a company might consistently encourage individuals to explore new work territories and increase the level of accountability they accept, for both successes and failures. They may also push team members to have more regular encounters with customers, which allows them to see the impact they’re having on other people’s lives through their work.

Balanced teams recognize a person’s skill levels across all three categories, allotting tasks and leadership accordingly. To this end, team managers must strive to create transparency regarding what teammates’ competencies and frustrations are. Put differently, employees should feel safe offering feedback regarding the types of work that most drain and discourage them. Indeed, Lencioni insists these deficits are natural to any individual’s range of abilities—just as their intelligences are.

(Shortform note: Some organizations may experience difficulty applying Lencioni’s model if it absolves team members of the need to observe hierarchy as a necessary feature of leadership. In _The Culture Map_ , Erin Meyer argues that values such as leadership through consensus tend to resonate more effectively in societies and organizations where egalitarianism and individualism are also valued, as is common in the West. However, this approach is often deemed less desirable, even destabilizing, in communities where top-down structure and obedience are more highly prized, such as in parts of Asia, where every team member will likely not feel comfortable voicing all opinions or personal preferences.)

### Mapping Genius

After determining each of your team member’s intelligence types, Lencioni encourages mapping them out. This allows you to evaluate your team’s current skillset and where improvements and/or additions are advisable.

To do this, Lencioni suggests listing each intelligence type in the order it appears in the phases of work: Perceiving Opportunity, Innovating Solutions, Vetting Ideas, Mobilizing People, Supporting, and Seeing Things Through. Alongside each, place a field with two columns. In the left-hand column, put the team members who excel in that intelligence; on the right, list those who struggle with it.

Lencioni doesn’t map team members’ intelligences here. Instead, Lencioni emphasizes that you should use the map primarily to visualize major strengths and weaknesses.

> **Making the Most of Maps**
> 
> Lencioni asserts that using his team map is one of the most potent possible tools to engage employees with his intelligence model. As a result, it is a vital vehicle for enabling mutual understanding. Team mapping in itself is a popular implement for managers seeking to better understand their people. Forms of assessments and resulting maps are quite diverse in approach, topic, and complexity, and often entail financial investment to perform. Here are some best practices in administering them:
> 
>   * Research beforehand to discover your options and find the right fit.
> 
>   * Inform employees beforehand for suggestions and to allay any concerns they may have about taking the evaluation.
> 
>   * Whenever possible, make participation voluntary.
> 
>   * Let the team know how and when the results will be delivered.
> 
>   * Make sure to allow yourself ample time to digest the results and apply them to tangible management strategies.
> 
>   * Engage each team member on their own concerning the results, optimally providing the most non-threatening environment possible.
> 
> 


#### Harvesting the Map’s Information

Lencioni insists that the benefits of mapping go well beyond knowing who’s who. You can visually conceptualize where your organization is adequately staffed—in other words, how deep is your proverbial bench? In studying the map, you can then ask key questions:

  * Is anyone over-extended because they’re the only one on your team possessing one of the intelligences? 
  * Likewise, is anyone burning out because their competencies too often have to compensate for deficits of intelligence?
  * Who might be “under-utilized” because their true skill set remains unacknowledged? And how can this add balance and bandwidth to the team?



Takeaways from these and similar questions can inform big choices or, at least, important follow-up questions:

  * Can you fill gaps solely by moving around existing personnel?
  * Can you transfer/borrow people from other departments or teams?
  * Is hiring an option? If so, for which intelligences and competencies?



> **To Hire or Not to Hire**
> 
> Lencioni makes clear that identifying intelligence types can lead to opportunities for reorganization _and_ hiring of employees, both of which have intrinsic benefits. Nonetheless, some of the most significant benefits of reorganization over hiring pertain to cost. For instance, it can frequently take between eight to ten weeks just to hire a new employee, forcing the manager to seriously consider the urgency of the work they’re hiring _for_. Leaders must weigh the investment involved in advertising, screening, interviewing, and potentially relocating possible candidates. And many of the other costs of hiring are not so obvious, including the resources you must divert—particularly the time of some of your most productive employees—to onboard new people.

We’ve now made it through the many layers of genius, work phases, and their interlocking requirements. Next, it’s time to put everything together with an eye toward big-picture organizational health.

### Genius and Overall Organizational Health

Lencioni argues that the implementation of his model, including the mapping techniques mentioned above, will lead to dramatic improvements in your team’s performance, particularly in areas of leadership, productivity, employee retention/morale, and meeting integrity.

#### The Benefits of Recognizing Genius

First, leadership that follows an intelligence-based approach leads far more organically; it’s better poised to tap into the resources right at its fingertips. It doesn’t shoehorn people into boilerplate job descriptions; rather, it encourages people to follow their talents instead of conventions. Lencioni identifies the following chief benefits for any organization:

  * People don’t feel forced to be good at all things, all the time; this means they can focus primarily on the things at which they’re best.
  * Team members have greater insights into everyone’s strengths and weaknesses. And instead of blaming one another for those gaps, they embrace them as a natural function of any team.
  * Productivity and efficiency increase accordingly. 



> **Parts of the Whole**
> 
> Lencioni concludes that leaders who embrace his intelligence model not only produce teams that are more cohesive, but that also contain members who are more willing to go above and beyond for the success of mutual endeavors. In _Extreme Ownership_ , Jocko Willink and Leif Babin agree on the importance of individual team members understanding their role within the broader scheme of things, as well as the specific tasks they answer for. According to Willink and Babin, this recognition of the purpose and justification behind team members’ specific roles builds trust in leadership, lessens ego, and pushes individuals towards enhanced ownership of the results they produce.
> 
> Moreover, this sense of ownership over a specific portion of the work process frees individuals to make more intuitive and on-the-spot decisions in their particular arena, also allowing those higher in the leadership structure greater room to focus on big-picture concerns. Assuredly, Willink and Babin’s model depends much more on an assumption of hierarchy than is obvious in Lencioni’s collaboration between intelligences.

The benefits are just as striking, Lencioni continues, for employees themselves, as well as for how ensuing morale reflects upon the company. Employees who regularly engage their intelligences and avoid tasks for which they’re less equipped are simply happier. They exude more enthusiasm, stay on the job longer, and the company acquires a reputation as a great place to work.

> **Keeping Your Key People**
> 
> Lencioni argues that allowing employees to tap into their natural strengths and apply them meaningfully to group outcomes is a critical component of employee retention. However, research suggests that the primary driver of such retention may be more obvious – for example, one result shows that, as of 2022, 65% of individuals leaving a current job are simply seeking enhanced salary opportunities.
> 
> Other areas you can focus on to boost employee retention include:
> 
>   * Emphasis on the quality of hiring and onboarding processes
> 
>   * Wellness options and other perks
> 
>   * Continuous feedback, professional development, and mentorship options
> 
>   * Flexibility (i.e. blends of on-site and remote work) and prioritization of work-life balance
