## Part 1: Introduction to High-Frequency Trading

In _Flash Boys_ , Lewis exposes Wall Street and its use of high-frequency trading to exploit investors. He argues that high-frequency trading makes money using advantages that regular investors don’t have access to, meaning anyone with a retirement account, investments, or plans to invest is at a disadvantage.

Lewis focuses the narrative on a Canadian trader named Brad Katsuyama, who investigated high-frequency trading after noticing changes in his ability to trade. After learning about high-frequency trading, Katsuyama and his team used this knowledge to found the Investors Exchange (IEX), a new stock exchange designed specifically to prevent unfair high-frequency trading tactics and take action against Wall Street’s unfairness.

Lewis is a journalist and bestselling author of over 30 books, revealing unfair systems in finance, economics, and business. He wrote _Flash Boys_ in response to the increase in high-frequency trading throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

In this guide, we’ll briefly explain what high-frequency trading is and how both Lewis and Katsuyama learned about it. Then we’ll discuss how changes to the stock market and electronic trading created the six conditions for high-frequency trading to exist. Then we’ll examine the six tactics that resulted from high-frequency traders exploiting each of those conditions. Finally, we’ll discuss the solutions to these tactics that Katsuyama and his team developed to make stock trading fair for investors.

Along the way, we’ll look at how other experts have weighed in on the practice and some differing views on whether or not these changes have been beneficial. We’ll also we’ll provide updated information about trading research and regulations that have come into effect since the book’s publication.

In Part 1, we’ll start by examining what high-frequency trading is, how Lewis was introduced to it, and who first brought attention to the problems it was creating for the stock market.

### What Is High-Frequency Trading?

Lewis describes high-frequency trading (HFT) as a type of electronic trading platform that uses automated computer algorithms to very quickly buy and sell large quantities of stocks. High-frequency (HF) traders and firms own these high-powered computers and algorithms. These HFT algorithms gather market data and use this information to buy and sell stocks, completing this process in microseconds, or one-millionth of a second, thus using a different strategy than long-term buy-and-hold investing positions. This speed advantage makes HFT algorithms faster than any human trader, giving them a powerful edge over traditional investors and traders by enabling them to accrue billions of dollars through HFT trades that traditional investors and traders can’t.

(Shortform note: While Lewis doesn’t detail the history of high-frequency trading, who started it, or when it started, this may be because experts don’t agree on how it started. Experts have traced the practice back to the 1830s, 1930s, 1970s, and 2005. Some researchers attribute HFT’s creation to former finance professor David Whitcomb, while others believe the SEC’s deregulation of the stock markets started the practice.)

### How Was Lewis Introduced to High-Frequency Trading?

Lewis learned about high-frequency trading following the arrest of a Russian immigrant named Sergey Aleynikov. His trial received media attention and boosted public interest in HFT. Aleynikov was an HFT programmer for Goldman Sachs and was considered one of the best programmers on Wall Street. His job was to make HFT software faster, but he was unaware of the full effect of his work. When he left Goldman Sachs in 2009, the firm accused him of stealing HFT code and he was arrested by the FBI.

Aleynikov was put on trial and sentenced to eight years in prison. After a year in prison, he was acquitted, but his trial exposed Wall Street’s questionable trading practices and sparked public interest—as well as Lewis’s—in HFT.

> **Another Programmer Was Arrested for Stealing Code**
> 
> Not long after Aleynikov was charged for stealing code, another programmer named Samarth Agrawal was also arrested for replicating HFT software after leaving his Paris-based HFT bank for a hedge fund. But while Aleynikov was eventually acquitted, the US courts ruled differently for Agrawal, who was sentenced to three years in jail. So why was Aleynikov acquitted and not Agrawal?
> 
> While Agrawal cited Aleynikov’s case, the jury found a small difference between the two cases. In Aleynikov’s trial, the court considered the code itself as the stolen product for commerce. But in Agrawal’s trial, the jury argued that the stocks traded by the bank—not the HFT code—were the products of commerce. Because Agrawal’s HFT code helped facilitate those traded stocks, Agrawal was found guilty. The courts also noted that Agrawal printed out the code he stole, thus transforming it into a tangible stolen product under the National Stolen Property Act. The decision—which seems largely influenced by the medium of the code—may support Lewis’s argument that the legal system has done little to keep up with or understand changes in technology.

### Who Brought Attention to High-Frequency Trading Problems?

In the late 2000s, in the years leading up to Aleynikov’s trial, a Canadian trader with the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Brad Katsuyama, was starting to notice changes in the stock market that clued him in to systemic problems caused by HFT. While Katsuyama wasn’t the first person to learn about HFT and its tactics, he was one of the first to identify and raise awareness of how HFT was a problem.

While working at RBC, Katsuyama noticed that he couldn’t trade successfully anymore, because in the time between sending out his customers’ orders and actually buying stocks, the stock market would change, forcing him to pay more money. Katsuyama asked RBC executives for permission to investigate why he was losing money in his trades, and they agreed.

(Shortform note: In _21 Lessons For The 21st Century_ , Yuval Noah Harari argues that as algorithms like HFT software provide increasingly accurate suggestions, their convenience is almost irresistible—but relying on algorithms to make your decisions denies you the freedom and ability to make your own choices, which may explain why Katsuyama felt he couldn’t trade successfully anymore. In addition to threatening jobs, technology threatens human liberty, as algorithms learn so much about people that they gain an immense power to influence and manipulate.)

#### Katsuyama Builds His Team

Lewis explains that Katsuyama first learned about HFT when HFT executives asked RBC to provide them with access to the Canadian stock market. Katsuyama thought this was a bad idea, since he couldn’t find anyone who could explain HFT to him, and he suspected that HF traders might be the reason why he was paying more for his trades.

Katsuyama assembled a team to help him investigate the practice. He recruited Ronan Ryan, a telecommunications expert who helped trading firms increase their signal speed. After pooling their knowledge, Katsuyama and Ryan met with different Wall Street executives, educating them about how HFT tactics exploited the stock market.

Katsuyama also added John Schwall to his team. Schwall was a product manager, the intermediary between programmers and traders. Soon after joining the team, Schwall investigated the history of the stock market and its regulations. (We’ll discuss these findings in Part 2 of the guide.) This information supplemented Katsuyama’s knowledge of the stock market, its conditions, and how HFT exploited those conditions.

As part of their investigations, Katsuyama’s team ran experiments to understand how HFT worked. As a result of these experiments, Katsuyama came to understand the six tactics of HFT and how it impacts the market, as we’ll discuss in Part 3.

> **Qualities of a Great Team**
> 
> By building a good team, Katsuyama was able to research and find effective solutions to problems. But what makes a great team? Experts identified three key qualities of effective teams:
> 
>   * **Intellectual Diversity** : when the members of your team have a range of different experiences, backgrounds, and education, thus leading to more creative solutions. Gender and racial diversity also fall under this category.
> 
>   * **Psychological Safety** : when teammates feel safe enough to share their thoughts and ideas. When all members of the team are comfortable speaking up, the team can work better together as a whole.
> 
>   * **Shared Purpose** : a goal that the whole team believes is worth fighting for. A shared purpose can also help create a shared identity.
> 
> 

> 
> These characteristics fit Katsuyama’s team: They came from different intellectual backgrounds, brought different individual strengths and experiences to the company, and felt comfortable enough to honestly share their ideas. Most importantly, each was committed to finding out what had changed in the stock market and how they could make trading fair.
