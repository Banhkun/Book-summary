## Exercise: Reflect on Your Procrastination and Identify Solutions

According to Burka and Yuen, we procrastinate to experience short-term relief from our fears. Identifying your fear(s) will help you choose an appropriate strategy for beating your procrastination.

* * *

Think back to a time you recently procrastinated on an important task. Describe it below.

Which of these fears fueled your procrastination: your fear of imperfection, your fear of losing love, or your fear of restrictions? Describe a few past incidents in which this fear caused you to engage in unhealthy procrastination. (Feel free to name more than one of these fears or identify another type of fear not listed.)

The next time you experience that fear in anticipation of an important task, how can you overcome your tendency to procrastinate by engaging in a healthier behavior? Consider choosing from these behaviors Burka and Yuen share: engage in mindfulness, exercise, set a goal, manage your time more effectively by developing your sense of time, make the most of short blocks of time, or prioritize life’s most important tasks.

Now, describe why you think that specific strategy will help you manage the fear you named. (For example, imagine you’ve procrastinated on contributing to your retirement fund because of your fear of time, specifically your fear of aging. Prioritizing life’s most important tasks may help reduce this fear by reassuring you that you still have time to achieve many of your aspirations.)

Finally, identify the first step you’ll take to engage in that behavior—rather than procrastinating on it. (For example, to begin prioritizing life’s most important tasks, you could identify three unhealthy behaviors you want to quit to make those tasks possible, such as wasting time on social media before bedtime, spending time with your overly pessimistic friend, and smoking.)
