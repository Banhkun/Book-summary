## Part 1.2: Clarity

You now understand the importance of simplifying your writing by being intentional about your word choice and eliminating clutter. Now we’ll discuss Zinsser’s second principle of writing: clarity. We’ll define clarity, talk about being logical and consistent, and discuss a few guiding questions you can ask yourself as you write.

### What Is Clarity?

Once you’ve achieved simplicity in wording and structuring your sentences, focus on bringing clarity to your writing. Clarity occurs when you logically explain your idea to a reader. Zinsser believes that it’s your job as a writer to guide the reader through your thought process rather than forcing them to dissect disorganized or underdeveloped writing.

For example, consider how the second sentence loses clarity: “Megan and Courtney walked to the end of the street before parting ways. Then she walked into a nearby coffee shop.” Who is “she” referring to—Megan or Courtney? Something as simple as a vague pronoun can disrupt the clarity of your writing.

Zinsser believes **to write clearly, you must clearly understand the topic you’re writing about.** If you don’t understand the topic, you’ll never be able to explain it well to your reader.

> **Occam’s Razor and Writing**
> 
> Another way to think of Zinsser’s idea of clarity is through the principle of Occam’s razor, or the idea that the simplest solution is often the best one. In writing, this means you should discard as much unnecessary information as possible and just stick to the essential facts. This principle can be applied to any kind of writing: marketing copy, an essay, or a sales proposal. To apply this principle, keep these four questions in mind:
> 
>   * What’s your central message?
> 
>   * What’s the best structure to communicate this message?
> 
>   * What background does the audience need to know?
> 
>   * How long should each point or topic be?
> 
> 

> 
> To answer these questions in a useful way, you need to fully understand the material you’re writing about.

### Follow a Logical Sequence

To write with clarity, follow a logical sequence of ideas. **Each sentence should build off of the idea in the previous sentence**. To lead your reader to your next thought, Zinsser recommends anticipating what the reader will ask and answering their question in the next sentence, rather than repeating the previous sentence in a different way.

If you’re having trouble writing with clarity, Zinsser recommends writing about a scientific or technical subject, such as how Bluetooth works or the migration pattern of monarch butterflies. The purpose of this exercise is to clearly explain how something works. First, you’ll need to fully understand the subject, otherwise there will be holes in your logic. Then, explain the steps you used to understand the topic. With scientific subjects, you’re less likely to omit key steps since you won’t assume your reader already knows certain facts. If you assume a reader already knows something and omit defining, explaining, or connecting your ideas, you lose clarity and confuse your reader. By completing this exercise, you’ll learn to clearly explain a logical process.

> **Elements of Logical Writing**
> 
> Truly logical writing answers a reader’s questions before they have a chance to ask them. To make your writing more logical, experts recommend this general formula:
> 
> 1) **State eachpremise or thought**, or**** an idea that supports your main idea or conclusion. For example, in an email to your company, you might write, “As a company, we want to support our employees to the best of our ability.”
> 
> 2) **Provide evidence to support this premise.** Following the previous example, you might say something like, “Research shows that a four-day work-week improves productivity, increases employee happiness, and saves time and money. Employee salaries will remain the same.”
> 
> 3) **Draw a clear connection to the conclusion.** Connect your premise and evidence to your main point. This shouldn’t feel like stating the obvious—rather, you’re completing the idea. For example, “For these reasons, we will now close our offices for the weekend at the end of the day on Thursday. Employees will now have Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off.”
> 
> This formula works for any kind of argument or proposal, making it useful in business proposals, copywriting, and technical writing. But the formula can also be applied to creative nonfiction like memoirs or travel writing. Your evidence will probably come in the form of the detail you give the reader to back up your claims. For example, instead of just stating someone’s name and occupation, you could describe their uniform. This description would provide evidence to support the idea of their occupation.

#### Signposts

Zinsser believes that you can increase the clarity of your writing with signposts. Signposts are words that connect ideas and indicate the progression of your thoughts, such as “first” or “finally.” Signposts tell your reader what direction you’re going next, guiding your reader through your logic.

For example, imagine you write, “I made the cake. I poured in the milk, melted butter, and eggs. I mixed it all together. I put the batter in a pan. I baked it at 350 degrees.” While these sentences are all simple, they lack clarity because they don’t connect to each other. To bring clarity to these ideas, include signposts: “I made the cake. _To do this_ , I poured in the milk, melted butter, and eggs. _Next_ , I mixed it all together. _Then_ I put the batter in a pan _before_ baking it at 350 degrees.” The italicized signposts indicate the sequence of events, providing clarity.

While signposts signal the progression of logic, they can also signal changes in tone. For example, your boss sends you an email, and the first paragraph congratulates you on your most recent project. But the second paragraph begins with, “however.” This signals that your boss’s tone and topic change in this paragraph. From “however,” you know that the tone of the second paragraph will no longer be congratulatory, and the topic will change from commenting on your presentation to something else.

> **Choose the Right Type of Signposts**
> 
> Zinsser mentions a few examples of common signposts but doesn’t discuss the different _categories_ of signposts, which can direct and organize our next thoughts. Knowing where your sentences are heading, and what category your next thought falls into, can help you choose the right signpost. There are several types of signposts:
> 
>   * To add more ideas: again, furthermore, in addition, moreover
> 
>   * To compare or contrast ideas: alternatively, contrastingly, conversely, whereas
> 
>   * To prove something: evidently, for this reason, because, inevitably
> 
>   * To show exceptions: however, nevertheless, yet, in spite of
> 
>   * To repeat or refer back to something: as mentioned earlier, or as previously discussed
> 
>   * To show that you will include something later: this will be discussed in detail later
> 
>   * To emphasize something: definitely, obviously, inevitably, undeniably
> 
>   * To give an example: for instance, in this case, in particular, notably
> 
>   * To show chronology: previously, following this, initially, subsequently, finally
> 
> 

> 
> However, experts warn that you shouldn’t over-signpost. Too many signposts can make your writing wordy and give the impression that you don’t trust the reader’s ability to make connections. Also, don’t substitute logically building off of your previous sentence with a signpost. You should still thoroughly explain your ideas.

### Be Consistent

Being consistent will help you write with clarity. Consistency, or what Zinsser calls unity, is when certain key elements of your writing stay the same throughout your writing, even as your idea develops. For example, tone is one key element to keep consistent in a piece of writing, as we’ll discuss. Zinsser believes consistency eliminates unwanted confusion because your reader won’t have to keep up with unnecessary changes in your writing.

Zinsser explains that while you can take some artistic liberty with your writing, you have to stick with whatever decisions you make. As you write, you can change your mind, but make sure that change is reflected throughout the rest of your writing. For example, you may start writing a piece in third person, only to decide midway through that you think first person would work better. It’s okay to change your mind, but be sure to go back and change the parts you’ve already written in third person to first person.

> **Be Consistent With Punctuation and Spelling**
> 
> Zinsser points out the importance of consistency with big decisions like tone, main idea, tense, and point of view. But it’s also important to be consistent for small decisions like punctuation and spelling. Experts cite several reasons to be consistent about these small decisions:
> 
>   * Consistency makes writing easier on you. For example, if you make a conscious decision to use the Oxford comma, you won’t have to keep deciding whether or not to use one later in your piece.
> 
>   * Consistency makes you seem like a more credible writer. When a reader notices inconsistencies, such as using “judgment” and “judgement” in the same piece, she might consider the writing amateur.
> 
>   * Consistency makes your writing look polished and professional—it’s a subtle way to show your reader that you’ve paid attention to the details.
> 
> 

> 
> To ensure consistency in writing, some publications and businesses adhere to a style guide. Some of the more common style guides are AP style, Chicago style, APA style, and MLA style. You can use these guides as a reference to answer certain consistency questions about spelling, word hyphenation, punctuation, and more.

Zinsser discusses four decisions you should make to ensure you’re consistent. These decisions are your promise to the reader that you won’t try to confuse or trick them. To ensure you stay consistent in your artistic decisions, ask yourself these four guiding questions:

#### What’s Your Main Idea?

Zinsser believes that to bring clarity to your writing, the most important question you should ask yourself is, “What’s the main idea?” Your main idea is the most important takeaway from a piece—it’s your whole reason for writing that specific story.

Zinsser explains that your main idea will guide your writing and prevent unrelated tangents. When you have a clear main idea, all of the creative decisions you make will focus on clearly communicating it. This doesn’t mean you can’t explore other ideas in your piece, but those ideas should support your main point.

Zinsser contends that you’ll be better off writing in-depth about a specific idea than writing vaguely about a broader topic. You’ll have more space to explore details and discuss the topic thoroughly. So when deciding your main idea, be more specific than you think you need to be.

For example, imagine a writer who wants to write about life in New York City. Following Zinsser’s advice, he narrows his focus to writing about life in the Bronx in New York City. He narrows it further to one neighborhood in the Bronx. Finally, he narrows it to one family in the neighborhood. By taking a specific focus, he’ll be able to write a more realistic description of their lives. In doing so, he’ll reveal more about life in New York City than if he tried to write more broadly about the many different experiences of people living there.

> **Identify Your Main Idea**
> 
> If you’re still struggling to narrow down your main idea, ask yourself a few questions:
> 
>   * What made you start writing the story in the first place? What was your motivation to write?
> 
>   * What is the main conflict in your story?
> 
>   * Can you summarize your story in one sentence? What keywords stand out to you?
> 
> 

> 
> Ask yourself these questions _before_ you start writing. Some experts believe many writers make the mistake of writing prematurely. They advise against using writing to work out your thoughts, which can make your writing unorganized and repetitive. Instead, ask yourself what you want your reader to gain from your writing, and don’t start writing until you have a clear answer.

#### What Point of View Will You Use?

The next clarifying question you should ask yourself is, “What point of view will I use?” Your point of view is how you narrate your piece. Your point of view establishes a relationship with the reader since it’s how you’ll refer to yourself throughout the story.

There are three points of view: first, second, and third person.

  * **First person** uses self-referential pronouns, such as “I” and “we.” In first person, the writer is an active participant in the story since her observations are included.
  * **Second person** uses pronouns like “you.” In second person, the writer is more removed from the story than in first person. 
  * **Third person** uses pronouns like “he,” “she,” and “they.” In third person, the writer is the most removed from the story, acting as an observer rather than a participant. 



Whatever point of view you decide on, make sure it’s consistent throughout your piece so your reader doesn’t question your reliability as a narrator. If you switch points of view in your writing, you’ll confuse your reader. For example, if your friend Beth emails you about her trip to the beach and says, “I had such a great time! The water was freezing, but Beth still went swimming,” it would be confusing as she switches from first person (“I had such a great time!”) to third person (“Beth went swimming”).

> **How to Choose a Point of View**
> 
> In addition to being an important constraint in writing, other experts believe point of view can help you create certain effects. When choosing a point of view, consider what elements you want to highlight:
> 
> 1) **First person** : As Zinsser notes, using “I” and “me” is the point of view that will bring you closest to the story. Use first person to create a closer relationship with the reader. But the story will also be limited to your knowledge and experience, which means the reader will find out information along with you. If you want to describe how someone else felt or thought, you’ll do so through your own words and understanding of their feelings.
> 
> 2) **Second person** : This perspective refers to a general “you,” which requires the reader to suspend their disbelief and become another “you.” Second person is commonly used in instruction manuals. But other times, second person narrators refer to themselves (not the reader) as “you” instead of “I.” This lets the writer distance themselves from the narrative.
> 
> 3) **Third person** : This perspective will create distance between the narrator and the story. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—perhaps you _want_ to create a sense of distance or objectivity in your story. Third person also has two forms:
> 
>   * **Third person limited** : This point of view focuses on only one person’s thoughts and feelings, and it might be a good choice if you’re writing a biography.
> 
>   * **Third person omniscient** : The narrator offers an objective look at multiple peoples’ points of view. It’s a common point of view in journalistic articles.
> 
> 

> 
> Additionally, while Zinsser believes you should keep your point of view consistent through a piece of writing, some authors change perspective for artistic effect. For example, in the semi-autobiographical novel _We the Animals_ , Justin Torres initially writes in plural first person: “We were six snatching hands, six stomping feet; we were brothers, boys, three little kings locked in a feud for more.” Then later in the book, he transitions to first person singular, using “I” more than “we.” This choice is meant to represent the boys’ coming of age and one brother’s feelings of isolation. If you decide to experiment with points of view, make sure you do so with a specific purpose in mind, as Torres did.

#### What Tense Will You Use?

Next, create clarity by deciding what tense you’ll write in and using that tense consistently throughout your piece. Zinsser notes that tenses help your reader situate themselves in the timeline of events.

Zinsser discusses the two most common tenses: past and present.

  * Past tense discusses events that happened in the past. Write in past tense when you’re looking back on an event. For example, “I walked to the store,” or “Lauren turned to Joe and asked him a question.”
  * Present tense discusses events in the current moment. Use present tense when you’re writing about things as they’re happening. For example, “I’m walking to the store,” or “Lauren turns to Joe and asks him a question.”



(Shortform note: Although Zinsser doesn’t discuss it, there is also the future tense, which discusses events that haven’t—but are expected—to happen. In English, our version of future tense uses “will” and a verb, such as in, “I _will_ go to the store.”)

Zinsser explains that you should choose one main tense to tell your story, and use different tenses as appropriate. For example, if you’re telling a story using present tense and someone tells the narrator (in the present) about a story that happened to them (in the past), writing in a different tense for this dialogue is warranted.

But, if you switch your _primary_ tense, you’ll confuse your reader because they won’t be sure of the chronology of events. Using the example from the previous section, let’s say Beth wrote, “I had such a great time! The water is freezing, but I’m still swimming.” At first she speaks in past tense, and then she switches to present tense. Switching the second sentence to present tense throws off the logic of Beth’s story.

> **How to Choose a Tense**
> 
> While Zinsser discusses the importance of a consistent tense in eliminating reader confusion, each tense can also create certain effects in your writing.
> 
> Present tense:
> 
>   * When done correctly, present tense creates a cinematic effect. Like watching a movie, reading in present tense creates a sense of viewing the action as it unfolds.
> 
>   * Present tense creates a closeness with the writer. The reader may feel like she’s there with the writer as events happen.
> 
>   * Because of this closeness, present tense intensifies the emotions of a story. Readers find out information with the writer, so readers feel the same frustration, surprise, or betrayal that the writer does when writing the story.
> 
>   * Finally, present tense is more action-oriented. Thus if your story centers around action, rather than a person, place, or idea, present tense might be a better choice for you.
> 
> 

> 
> Past tense:
> 
>   * You can use past tense to create suspense. Since you know how your story unfolds, you can choose what context to give the reader rather than telling the reader information as you learn it.
> 
>   * Past tense can be more natural to read and write. Many readers and writers prefer past tense instead of present tense since writing is an act of reflecting on the past.
> 
>   * While present tense primarily builds a narrative through present actions, past tense offers more opportunity for narration, such as exploring other time periods or other peoples’ perspectives.
> 
> 

> 
> When writing, consider what effect you can achieve with your tense.

#### What Tone Will You Have?

Finally, your tone will affect the clarity of your writing. Zinsser explains that tone signals what you think or how you feel about your topic. For example, you could take a lighthearted, nostalgic, or formal tone toward your writing.

(Shortform note: While tone signals your attitude toward a topic, your tone can also contribute to how the reader feels from reading your piece. So tone is important not only for reader understanding but also for reader response.)

Zinsser advises keeping your tone consistent throughout a piece of writing to eliminate confusion. If the reader doesn’t know how you feel about a subject, she’ll be confused by your writing. Thus avoid switching between tones in your piece. For example, if a journalist wrote about a devastating tsunami and switched from a serious, concerned tone to a light, humorous one within that piece, he’d get backlash from confused readers.

> **Tips for a Consistent Tone**
> 
> While Zinsser notes the importance of having a consistent tone, he doesn’t offer advice on _how_ to achieve this. Other experts offer tips for maintaining a consistent tone throughout a piece:
> 
> 1) Before you start a writing session, read a good piece of writing that uses the tone you want for your piece. You’ll naturally mimic this tone and the ways a good author might convey it. For example, for a dry or reserved tone, you might read a passage of Joan Didion’s work.
> 
> 2) Compare how you started and ended your piece. Did your tone change throughout your piece? If yes, read through your piece and identify where your tone differs from the one you intended.
> 
> 3) Be specific with descriptions. Usually the details you include—and how you describe these details—affect the tone of the piece. Notice what kind of tone your descriptions give off. For example, a description of a broken antique table might evoke nostalgia from one writer and a sense of hopelessness or decay from another.
