## Shortform Introduction

In _On Writing Well_ , William Zinsser argues that, like any craft, good writing can be learned. Writing is a form of communication, and most of us have to communicate via writing in our lives or jobs. If you want to write an intelligent email, a best-selling novel, or an instruction manual, Zinsser’s principles of writing will help you communicate effectively.

After years of writing professionally and teaching writing courses, Zinsser distilled his main ideas about good writing into _On Writing Well_. In this guide, we’ll break down Zinsser’s principles of writing: simplicity, clarity, and identity. We’ll also explore his advice on constructing good writing and on common challenges of different nonfiction genres. In addition, we’ll examine how his principles align with or differ from other writing experts, and we’ll explore how his ideas can play out in specific examples.

### About the Author

William Zinsser was an American writer, journalist, and teacher. He wrote 19 books, including _On Writing Well_ , _Writing to Learn_ , and _Writing About Your Life_. He frequently contributed articles to _Life_ and _The American Scholar_ magazine.

Zinsser taught writing classes at Yale University and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. This book distills much of the information he taught in his lectures on creative nonfiction.

After losing his eyesight, Zinsser began one-on-one coaching for aspiring and professional writers. Writers would read him their work, and he’d critique it—for the small price of a sandwich. In 2015, he passed away at the age of 92.

### The Book’s Publication

_On Writing Well_ was originally published in 1976 by HarperCollins. The book is now in its 30th edition. In 2004, Zinsser published a book called _Writing About Your Life_ , which expands on his advice on writing memoirs.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

Zinsser initially published _On Writing Well_ in response to the popularization of nonfiction as a genre throughout the 20th century. Zinsser explains that World War II exposed people to the harsh realities of life, making Americans more fact-minded. People became disinterested in the slower pace and long-winded descriptions found in fiction novels. This shift was reflected in the popular works of the time, such as _Silent Spring_ (which launched the environmental movement) and _In Cold Blood _(a true crime story about the murder of a Kansas family). Both books shifted away from the flowery, detailed language of the 19th and early 20th centuries toward a more direct and journalistic style of writing.

Because of this genre shift, demand for both nonfiction writing and writers increased, encouraging new forms of writing, such as blogs and email. Zinsser notes that more people became writers—whether as a profession, hobby, or necessity—and he wanted to share the fundamentals for good nonfiction writing.

After publishing the first edition, Zinsser also frequently updated the book to account for cultural changes and new insights on writing. For example, in response to more women exploring writing in the 20th century, Zinsser updated the book to warn writers against sexist pronoun usage in their writing. As he continued teaching nonfiction courses to students, he learned about new problems writers faced that would be beneficial in _On Writing Well_. For example, he included a section about enjoying the process of writing, since he noticed his students worrying about the finished product.

#### Intellectual Context

Zinsser explains that he wrote _On Writing Well_ as a nonfiction-focused follow up to _The Elements of Style_ by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. Some of Strunk and White’s elements of style are clarity, conciseness, coherence, unity, correctness (grammar), precision (word choice), and taste (style). Zinsser explores many of these same principles. Zinsser also follows a similar organization to Strunk and White’s structure, discussing usage and various writing forms.

#### The Book’s Impact

_On Writing Well_ is a popular writing reference for all disciplines of nonfiction. Many readers appreciate the book’s practical advice and back-to-basics approach and have found the book helpful for writers of all skill levels.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_On Writing Well_ has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is widely regarded as an essential guide for writers. Many writers note that the book is one of the best references for nonfiction writing, and they cite Zinsser’s advice to simplify writing and eliminate clutter as particularly helpful. Reviewers agree that _On Writing Well_ is most effective as a general guide to writing, rather than as a comprehensive guide to learning specific techniques such as humor or grammar rules.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Zinsser follows his own advice and writes with simplicity and clarity, making his writing accessible and enjoyable to read. He describes important elements of writing using his own writing background, examining work from other good writers, and discussing his experiences teaching students how to write.

Zinsser also takes a conversational approach to discussing writing. He doesn’t talk down to writers, taking the role of a supportive mentor or professor instead. He describes a back-to-basics approach, which focuses on honing essential skills rather than trying to employ complex stylistic techniques.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Zinsser organizes his book into four main sections: Principles, Methods, Forms, and Attitudes. The first discusses general concepts of writing, such as simplicity and style. The second part discusses specific pieces of advice, such as the functions of different word types. The third part explores the different types of nonfiction writing and the common problems writers encounter in those genres. The final section discusses a writer’s identity, how to approach writing, and creative decisions.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Within this overall organization, we’ve reorganized and grouped similar concepts into two main parts. In Part 1, we discuss the general writing principles of simplicity, clarity, and identity. Zinsser primarily discusses simplicity in his Principles section, clarity in his Methods section, and identity in his Attitudes section, but these ideas are themes throughout the book.

In Part 2, we describe Zinsser’s specific advice for nonfiction writers, which he discusses in his section on Forms. Throughout the guide, we’ll explore insight from other writers and experts. We’ll also provide actionable tips on how to apply Zinsser’s principles of writing.
