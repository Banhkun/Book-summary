## Exercise: Implement Your Story

There are five ways to implement your story into your marketing materials.

* * *

Brainstorm some possible loglines for your company. Remember that loglines should include the hero (customer), problem, plan, and positive stakes.

What would be an effective lead generator for your company? For example, you might offer a free trial or a downloadable guide.

What valuable information might you share with potential customers in a nurturing campaign? What format (email, video, and so on) would you use?

Which of your satisfied customers might you approach about writing you a testimonial?

To encourage referrals, what could you offer customers who send their friends your way? For example, you might offer existing customers a discount on their next purchase or a sample they can share with their friends.
