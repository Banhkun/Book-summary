## Part 1: Clarify Your Message | Chapter 1: Why Most Marketing Doesn’t Work

In _Building a StoryBrand_ , marketing expert Donald Miller explains how to create effective marketing messages and materials:

  * He first covers what _doesn’t_ work—marketing that’s confusing, overwhelming, narcissistic, or takes too much energy to understand.
  * Next, he covers what _does_ work—framing your message as a story using a method called the StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7). 
  * Finally, he covers: 1) how to implement your SB7 story into a variety of marketing materials and 2) how to leverage the power of story to create company culture and increase employee engagement.



### Why Most Marketing Doesn’t Work

If you find that your brand is stagnant, it probably isn’t because your product is flawed. It probably _is_ because there’s a problem with the message you’re sending out in your marketing. **The only thing customers care about is how your brand can solve their problems**. As a result, marketing that’s unclear or confusing, that doesn’t explain how your product solves problems, or that is self-centered and obsesses about the company's image, is doomed to fail.

#### Noise

Noise is the massive amount of distracting, confusing information that permeates the world. An example of noise is the 3,000 marketing messages the average person is exposed to every day. While outside noise is something your brand will have to compete with, **your biggest enemy is actually the noise your brand creates itself.**

**Brands often don’t realize they’re creating noise.** They think that customers like hearing about their backstory, the non-profits they support, the eco-friendly features of their office building, and so on. But customers don’t care about any of these things. They just want to know how your brand will help them solve their problems.

For example, one StoryBrand client ran an industrial painting company that painted cars, concrete, and hospitals. The website was crowded with text that tried to explain all three arms of the businesses but ultimately just created noise. The author suggested starting over. The new website would have only a few words of text along the lines of “We Paint Stuff” and a button that said, “Request a Quote.”

### How the Brain Works

Many messages are noisy because they don’t accommodate the way the human brain works. **Subconsciously and by nature, the human brain is interested in things that will help us survive.** This results in two behaviors:

**Behavior #1: The brain focuses on things that will help it meet survival needs.** According to Abraham Maslow, the brain prioritizes needs in this order:

  * Nourishment—water and food.
  * Security—shelter and feeling emotionally safe.
  * Relationships—partners, lovers, and friends. They are a network of people (a tribe) who will help keep us safe, for example, by banding together into an army to fight off enemies.
  * Meaning—spiritual, physiological, and psychological needs.



**Behavior #2: The brain ignores anything that’s complicated because parsing complexity uses up energy and calories.** Those calories could be better spent on something that will help with survival, such as finding food or a mate.

### Attracting the Brain’s Attention

To catch the brain’s attention, you need to cater to how it works. Therefore, your marketing needs to both:

  * Frame the message as survival-related.
  * Keep the message simple and easy to digest.



#### Frame the Message as Survival-Related

There are several ways to frame your offerings around survival. Show your customers that your product or service will help them:

  * **Save or acquire money and resources.** Money helps us survive because we use it to buy resources such as nourishment.
    * For example, Walmart’s tagline is “Save Money. Live Better,” which not only tells a customer that she’ll save money, but that saving will improve her life.
  * **Save time.** Time helps us survive because, like money, we use it to acquire other resources. 
    * (Shortform example: If a powerful vacuum helps you clean your house faster, you’ll have more time to spend with your family and friends and develop your tribe.) 
  * **Build community.** Community helps us survive because: 1) being part of a tribe gives us automatic allies and 2) being nurtured and nurturing meets the need for meaning—nurturing gives our lives purpose.
  * **Acquire status.** Status helps us survive because it scares off enemies and attracts allies and mates.
    * For example, having a high-status car such as a Mercedes might help you get a date.
  * **Create opportunities to be generous.** Being generous helps us survive because: 1) it makes us more likable, which increases our ability to form relationships, and 2) helping others gives our lives meaning
  * **Find meaning.** Meaning is one of our fundamental survival needs, and a brand can offer it directly by giving customers the opportunity to make the world a better place. (When we lack meaning, we distract ourselves with pleasure, which isn’t always conducive to survival—if we always choose to play instead of work, we won’t earn the money to buy the resources we need to survive.)
    * (Shortform example: Buying a product from a company that gives 1% of its profits to environmental causes makes us feel like we’re helping the world.)



#### Keep the Message Simple and Easy to Digest by Telling a Story

**Story is one of the most simple and digestible ways to transmit information** because it organizes information into a predictable, formulaic format that both 1) doesn’t take very much energy to understand and that 2) holds an audience’s attention. Neuroscientists discovered that people daydream more than 30% of the time, except when they’re engrossed in a story.

The author has encountered people who think storytelling is fanciful or impractical. This isn’t the case—storytelling is a concrete formula that’s as valid as any management or manufacturing formula.

To understand why stories communicate so well, consider the difference between music and noise. Both are sound, but music is organized and follows certain rules. This allows the brain to more easily retain it. For example, if you listened to shoes bouncing around in a dryer, you wouldn’t remember the sounds, but if you listened to the latest pop song, it would probably get stuck in your head. **Music is like story—it puts random information into a structure that aids comprehension.**

We’ll cover how to create your story in Part 2.

#### Clear Communication Always Triumphs

**Brands that communicate the clearest are the ones that succeed, whether or not they have the best products or leadership.**

For example, **Apple became successful only _after_ it started using a storytelling approach.** In 1983, when Steve Jobs helped release a computer called Lisa, he took out a nine-page newspaper ad that talked about Lisa’s technical specifications. No one understood it, no one cared, and Lisa failed.

Jobs went to work for Pixar, a company whose entire business revolves around story. Jobs picked up a few things, and when he returned to Apple, his first campaign was only two words: “Think Different.” Apple made their advertising about the customer and what she could do with a computer, rather than about the computer itself.

Apple’s computers and phones probably aren’t the best technology the world has to offer. However, Apple _is_ the best at making people understand what they’re selling, so they’re a very successful company.
