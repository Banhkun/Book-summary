## Chapter 14: Story and Company Culture

As you’ve seen in previous chapters, you can use stories to clearly communicate with and engage your customers. **You can also use stories to communicate and engage with your _employees_.**

First, we’ll look at storyless workplaces with weak culture. Then, we’ll look at storied workplaces with strong culture.

### Narrative Void

**The “narrative void” describes a plotless, empty expanse within an organization.** When there’s no story, people don’t know what roles they play, what they’re supposed to do, or why they should care.

If your company has a narrative void, all the different divisions and departments are disconnected. Only people within a department understand what that department does, and everyone’s making decisions from their own point of view. No matter how much people think their decisions affect only their departments, they do affect the rest of the organization. As a result, corporate communication becomes internal noise, social media shares confusing messaging, and local marketing descends into frantic discounting.

#### Culture at Void Workplaces

If a company is plagued by a narrative void, disengagement often starts straight from onboarding. At a plotless workplace:

  * On an employee's first day, she meets someone in HR for an hour who gives her keys, has her watch a video or skim a manual about the company, and goes over the mission statement.
  * Over the next few years, the employee meets the status quo. She hits performance management metrics, gets promoted, and learns how to interact with others in the company.
  * One day, a headhunter offers her a job. Her current company suffers from disengagement and weak culture stemming from a narrative void, so she leaves, hoping things will be better elsewhere.



#### Gallup Polls

Gallup polls, which measure employee engagement, give some insight into both the presence of a narrative void and employee effort. **Disengagement is a symptom of narrative void, and when employees are disengaged, they don’t work as hard and they’re less productive.**

When Gallup started collecting data in the 1990s, they discovered that four out of five employees in the US weren’t interested in their work. Disengaged employees take more sick days and leave companies for other opportunities. Employers pay employees the same amount whether they’re invested or not, and in 2012, Gallup estimated that each year, disengagement costs the US between $450 to $550 billion.

Unless you fill the narrative void at your company and prevent disengagement, your company may suffer from some of these issues.

#### The Mission Statement

Many companies try to fill the narrative void with a mission statement. _Missions_ bring people together, but _statements_ aren’t as effective as stories. **Mission statements aren’t very engaging and are often too complicated for people to process or remember.** As we’ve learned, a story is a more effective way to communicate.

Additionally, even once you employ a story, just because the executive knows the story doesn’t mean everyone does. **The most important thing an executive can do is keep repeating the story until everyone gets it.**

### Narrative Cohesion

Instead of promoting your mission statement, try to create narrative cohesion (Shortform term). If your company has narrative cohesion, **the customer, company, and team’s stories all align, employees are engaged, and the organization is successful.**

#### Filling the Void

To fill a narrative void and create culture and engagement, you’ll follow a two-step process:

  1. Share the customer-centered story you developed using the SB7 Framework with everyone in the organization.
  2. Create and implement an employee-centered story. 



##### Step #1: Share the Customer-Centered Story

To implement the customer-centered story throughout the organization, you'll use the StoryBrand culture program. This program has five steps:

  1. Write a BrandScript.
  2. Evaluate the company culture.
  3. Create a custom plan for implementation.
  4. Create internal communication material that aligns with the implementation plan.
  5. Create a team to improve the culture.



(Shortform note: The author doesn’t explain these steps in further detail. For more information about culture, read our summaries of Daniel Coyle’s The Culture Code or Patrick M. Lencioni’s The Five Dysfunctions of a Team.)

After completing the steps, everyone at the company will use the same BrandScript and can succinctly explain the brand’s story. All the different divisions and departments will be connected and **everyone will understand how their role fits into the story.** For example, corporate communication becomes an empowered mission and engaging messages, social media shares brand sentiment, and local marketing becomes targeted.

**Extended Example: Fast-Food Chain**

Ben Ortlip, a StoryBrand director, worked with a fast-food chain to improve their story. The chain was doing well but Ortlip thought they could be doing better. As he toured the company, he noticed that their operations, product, and marketing were solid. The problem was that the company was complacent and had lost its plot.

To get it back, Ortlip helped the company create a narrative and share it with all stakeholders. They created a video curriculum and organized a convention, retreats, and events such as beach concerts at which attendees discussed the narrative. **Once people understood the company’s story, they re-engaged and the company’s growth increased 25% in under three years.**

##### Step #2: Create an Employee-Centered Story

In this story, **the employee or team will act as the hero and the company’s leadership as the guide. Compensation, events, and professional development are the plan** the guide gives the heroes to help them overcome the problem (disengagement) and achieve the positive stakes (narrative cohesion). (Employee engagement is based on the employee value proposition—what the employee gets from their workplace, such as compensation, flexibility, and the chance to star in a story.)

**Leaders, like companies, often think they want to be the heroes, but the outcome they want actually comes from their acting as the guide.** The guide is the competent, respected character.

#### Culture at Cohesive Workplaces

Recall the plotless workplace that stems from a narrative void. At a company with a story, the onboarding goes very differently:

  * A prospective employee has heard about the company before she even applies for a job. Everyone who interacts with the company, whether as an employee or a customer, likes it.
  * In the first interview, the prospective employee hears the same story—everyone likes the company. The interviewer presents working at the company like an adventure. The prospective employee, were she to come aboard, wouldn’t just be getting a job, she’d be cast in a role that would transform her.
  * In the next interviews, with other people at the company, the prospective employee hears the same story again and realizes she needs to be part of it.
  * On her first day, she meets multiple people at the company including a facilitator and the CEO, both of whom tell her the story. The onboarding focuses on the customer and the fact the customer is the hero and the company wants to make the customer’s life better.
  * Over the next few years, the employee never gets complacent. She regularly learns new things and her coworkers and customers are part of a community.
  * Headhunters offer her jobs but she always turns them down.



**Employing both customer- and employee-targeted stories not only increases an organization’s success, it improves the lives of everyone involved.** Every time a customer’s life gets better, the world gets a little bit better.
