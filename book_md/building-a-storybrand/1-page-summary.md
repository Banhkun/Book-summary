## 1-Page Summary

In _Building a StoryBrand_ , marketing expert Donald Miller explains how to create the most effective marketing messaging and materials: by plugging your brand’s details into a story structure that casts your customer as the protagonist and shows how your brand will help them reach their story’s happy ending.

Miller devised his own formula of story structure into which you can enter the details of your company to create a _storyline_ : a document telling the story of how your brand helps customers achieve their goals. You can then draw from the storyline to craft every piece of marketing collateral for your brand. The result will be cohesive, concise, and clear marketing that resonates with customers.

In this guide, we’ll discuss the two major errors most brands make in their marketing and how marketing stories correct those errors. We’ll then cover the seven parts of Miller’s story structure and show how you can implement your finished storyline across your marketing channels.

### The Two Errors That Cause Marketing Material to Fail

Miller says that when creating marketing material, most brands make two fatal errors because **they fail to understand or take into account how the human brain processes information**.

(Shortform note: Miller’s idea that marketers must understand how the human brain works hasn’t always been a foregone conclusion. It wasn’t until the 1960s and 70s that psychologists—notably Ernest Dichter and David McClelland—explored consumer drives and the idea that businesses could market products to cater more effectively to the way we process information.)

The two errors marketers most often make are:

#### Error #1: Brands Don’t Articulate How They Help People Stay Alive or Prosper

**If a brand’s marketing can’t articulate how it helps humans either stay alive or prosper, it will fail** , Miller asserts. The human brain is wired to stay alive—by securing shelter, food, and community—and, once survival is secured, to prosper—by building self-esteem and a sense of purpose, and by self-actualizing. Customers therefore pay attention only to marketing that proves a brand can help them stay alive or prosper and overlook anything that doesn’t, concludes Miller.

(Shortform note: Byron Sharp, author of _How Brands Grow_ , may agree that _good_ marketing speaks to humans’ need to stay alive or prosper because appealing to these needs makes the marketing appeal to _everyone_. Sharp argues that demographic divisions, which marketers usually tailor content toward, aren’t accurate and that there’s more overlap between divisions than is commonly thought. In other words, almost all brands have the potential to sell to everyone, not just a specific segment of the population. Thus, to earn the most, their marketing should appeal to universal needs like those Miller identifies.)

#### Error #2: Brands Force Customers to Waste Calories Parsing Information

Miller writes that the second error brands make is **forcing customers to expend calories sifting through irrelevant information**. Many brands include excessive confusing or unhelpful information in their marketing, which doesn’t show how the brand helps customers stay alive or prosper. Trawling through this information burns calories customers would rather save for survival-related activities, so they tune out.

(Shortform note: Miller argues that we stop paying attention when faced with seemingly irrelevant, excessive information. In _Blink, _Malcolm Gladwell takes the idea that too much information is harmful even further by saying that when we take less information into account when making choices, we often make better choices. He calls such choices “snap decisions” and claims they’re fast, unconscious, and usually accurate. When crafting your marketing, you might consider that your customers are trying to make snap decisions about whether or not to buy your product and therefore only give them the minimum information they need to make the snap choice to _buy_.)

### How to Correct the Errors: Create a Story

Now that we understand the two common errors brands make, what can we do to correct those errors? According to Miller, **the best way to succinctly present brand information that’s conducive to staying alive and prospering is in a _story format_.** Miller explains that a story format corrects the two errors by 1) forcing you to focus your message on how your brand helps customers stay alive and prosper, and 2) eliminating unnecessary information from your message.

(Shortform note: As Miller suggests, all good stories _should_ focus on how a protagonist learns to stay alive or prosper and _shouldn’t_ contain unrelated scenes or chapters. Still, despite following a story format (which we’ll discuss in the next section), many seasoned storywriters fall into the trap of including scenes or chapters they like but that don’t contribute to the overall narrative. Both writers and marketers in such cases must “kill their darlings”: Writers must eliminate redundancy and witticisms, and marketers must cut copy that sounds nice but doesn’t tell the customer how the brand helps them stay alive or prosper.)

#### Create a Story Using a Marketing Outline

To create a story, Miller advocates using his StoryBrand 7-Part Framework, which we’ll refer to simply as the _marketing outline_. This is a simplified version of the most common storytelling structure used in commercial films. Using this, you’ll create what Miller calls a “BrandScript,” which we’ll refer to simply as the _storyline_ : a document describing your customer’s story. Once you’ve created your storyline, you’ll draw on it to create content to use in your marketing materials.

(Shortform note: Miller proposes that a seven-part marketing outline is the ideal foundation for your marketing material. Other specialists propose a different, more complex marketing foundation: In _The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, _Al Ries and Jack Trout claim _22_ laws determine the success of a marketing campaign. While there initially doesn’t seem to be much overlap between Miller and Ries and Trout’s approaches, many of the 22 laws speak to the need to create a consistent story about your brand in the minds of your customers, like selecting just one word to define your brand identity.)

##### Three Benefits of Using the Marketing Outline

The marketing outline has three benefits, claims Miller:

  1. **Ease of use:** Simply plug details of your company into the outline to create your storyline. 
  2. **Cohesiveness** : The marketing outline will give you a single message, which you can tweak for different products, services, or divisions of your company. This cohesiveness reduces customer confusion about what you do by eliminating contradictions across your marketing. 
  3. **Repeatability** : Once you have a message, you can communicate it across all marketing platforms and to your employees. 



(Shortform note: While Miller positions the marketing outline’s ease of use, repeatability, and cohesiveness as advantages, they arguably combine to present a drawback of his method: It’s not very flexible. When you have only a single, easily repeatable marketing message, it becomes difficult to reposition or reframe your brand for different markets and audiences. This means a company with a flexible marketing strategy may have a competitive advantage because it can shift its messaging to appeal to different markets. Still, Miller might argue that a marketing-flexible company sacrifices cohesiveness across markets and audiences. It may be that a company must choose between cohesiveness and flexibility.)

### The Seven Parts of the Marketing Outline

Now that you understand the importance and benefits of the marketing outline, let’s look at each part in more detail:

#### Part 1: The Customer-Protagonist Wants Something

**Start the story by telling your customer-protagonist what they want and the gap that exists between them and fulfilling that want** , writes Miller. Pointing out that gap to the customer elicits an urge in them to fill it.

For instance, you might point out that your customer wants to have a fully landscaped backyard. The customer will feel urged to fill the gap between their currently undesigned backyard and a landscaped backyard—by purchasing or learning about your design services.

(Shortform note: The implicit logic behind the first part is that when you tell the customer what they want, they _will_ want it, no matter what the product is. But this isn’t necessarily the case. For a product to create a desire in consumers that didn’t previously exist, some argue that it must have five characteristics: newness, surprise, intricacy, mystery, and it must raise questions in the customer. The iPhone is a notable example of a product that created a consumer desire that hadn’t existed before.)

##### The Want Must Be Related to Staying Alive or Prospering

Beyond merely pointing out your customer’s want, **ensure the want helps the customer stay alive or prosper** , adds Miller. As previously discussed, showing how your brand enables staying alive or prospering is critical to the success of any marketing campaign.

Here are six wants you can raise that Miller claims promote staying alive and prospering:

  * **Want #1: Save or acquire money.** Money helps customers stay alive because it pays for resources like food.
  * **Want #2: Save time.** Saving time lets customers dedicate it to survival-related activities. 
  * **Want #3: Build community.** Community helps customers stay alive because 1) it gives them allies and 2) being nurtured and nurturing helps them prosper.
  * **Want #4: Acquire status.** Status helps customers stay alive and prosper because it scares off enemies and attracts allies and mates.
  * **Want #5: Create opportunities to be generous.** Being generous helps customers prosper because: 1) it makes them more likable, which increases their ability to form relationships, and 2) helping others gives their lives meaning.
  * **Want #6: Find meaning.** A brand offers meaning, a key survival need, by allowing customers to be part of something greater than themselves.



> **Marketing Wants Based on the Need for Love and Acceptance**
> 
> The wants Miller lists above are based on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. According to this psychological model, humans first are driven to address basic survival needs for food, shelter, and rest. Once we’ve addressed those, we move on to higher-order needs for security, acceptance and love, esteem, and personal fulfillment.
> 
> Interestingly, Miller omits a crucial element of Maslow’s hierarchy in his list of marketing wants: the need for _love and acceptance_. Brands that might benefit from raising such a want in their marketing include beauty and personal care brands. These can promise to fill the gap between the customer and their wish to be loved by making them more desirable or appealing to others.
> 
> For example, the popular Old Spice commercial speaks directly to peoples’ desire to be loved by showing a more desirable version of the average man and claiming that to be like the attractive, gentlemanly man in the commercial, they just need to use Old Spice body wash.

#### Part 2: The Customer-Protagonist Encounters a Problem

Once you’ve stated the customer-protagonist’s want, **identify a problem standing in the way of achieving their want that your product or service overcomes,** writes Miller. Without a problem or conflict, customers lose interest in your narrative. What’s more, the more specific and realistic the problem, the more the customer will invest emotionally in the story because they see themselves reflected in your brand.****

(Shortform note: Miller writes that you should identify a real problem your customer faces to maintain their attention to your story. You could alternatively see this step as _showing compassion toward your customer_. Everyone has problems, so if you can prove your brand perfectly understands your customer’s problems and can help resolve them, you’re extending compassion toward them. And compassion in turn feels good to the customer and engages them in your narrative.)

Make it easy for the customer to grasp the problem by presenting or personifying it as a villain, continues Miller. For instance, you could present waiting in line at grocery stores as a villain. Your online grocery delivery tool then defeats the villain.

(Shortform note: Miller’s advice to personify problems as a villain speaks to humans' general tendency to personify objects from an early stage in life. Personification in children is a form of playfulness, and in adults, it can reduce the emotional impact of loneliness.)

##### Three Levels of Problems

Now that you know to include a problem in your storyline, let’s look at the three levels of problems that Miller claims exist:

  * **Level #1: External.** According to Miller, an external problem is tangible, like long lines at grocery stores. These are the most straightforward for brands to identify and solve.
  * **Level #2: Internal.** Internal problems are unpleasant internal states—usually frustration or doubt—the customer wants to be rid of, writes Miller. These are greater motivators to take action than external-level problems but are harder for brands to identify. For instance, on an internal level, the problem of long grocery store lines would be: “I never have enough time to do everything I need to do each day.” 
  * **Level #3: Philosophical.** Philosophical problems are universal problems all humans ponder, writes Miller. They often relate to questions of meaning and justice and can usually be expressed using “should” statements. On a philosophical level, the problem of long grocery store lines might sound like: “Life _shouldn’t_ just be about work and chores. I _should_ have time for friends and fun, too.”



> **Understand Your Customer’s Problems by Asking Questions**
> 
> In _To Sell Is Human, _Daniel Pink supplements Miller’s idea that there are three levels of problems with information on how to _identify_ which level the customer’s problem exists on.
> 
> Pink writes in the context of personal selling, meaning a setting in which salespeople can have a dialogue with the customer to uncover what their problems are. According to Pink, salespeople should ask thoughtful, targeted questions to understand the customer’s problems. Thorough questioning makes it more likely the salesperson will grasp which level(s) the problem exists on and be able to explain how the product resolves the problem on those levels.
> 
> For instance, a customer may tell you upfront that their current software has bugs (external problem). However, they won’t always tell you how frustrating they find it when their work is constantly interrupted by system failures (internal problem) or that they believe that a service should deliver what it promises to do (philosophical problem). By asking good questions, a savvy salesperson can uncover those other problem levels and then build a pitch that targets them all.

##### The Best Stories Address All Three Levels of Problems

To build an exceptional story, **show how your product or service resolves the customer’s problem on _all three levels_** , advises Miller. Let’s use the example of the grocery delivery service to illustrate this. The service solves a physical, real-world problem (external): keeping the customer from wasting time standing in lines at grocery stores. It also resolves a frustration (internal): relieving the customer’s annoyance of not having enough time to get through all their chores. Finally, it addresses a broader human problem (philosophical): restoring the balance the customer’s life _should_ have.

(Shortform note: Miller recommends revealing how your product can resolve your problem on all three levels. But _do_ all products resolve a problem on all three levels? Marketer Seth Godin might argue that all products _can_ do anything if the marketer convinces the customer that they can: He believes that if brands tell the right story about the product, and customers believe the story, then the story becomes truth. If your brand therefore can weave a convincing narrative that your product can resolve the customer’s internal, external, and philosophical problems, then the product _does_ resolve those problems, according to Godin.)

#### Part 3: The Brand-Mentor Steps In to Help

We’ve begun the storyline by revealing the customer-protagonist’s want and their obstacle to achieving it. Now is when your brand steps in, writes Miller. **Position your brand as your customer’s mentor in the story: a figure who helps them overcome their obstacles and attain their desires**. As a mentor, your brand is an all-knowing, experienced being who encourages and supports the struggling, self-doubting protagonist, explains Miller.

(Shortform note: Even outside of stories, humans love having mentors who do the same things Miller’s story mentors do in Part 3. Mentors greatly increase the chances of the mentee’s success by contributing valuable knowledge and experience that could take the mentee years to acquire on their own. What’s more, they can use their connections to grow the mentee’s network or simply boost their confidence.)

Before a brand-mentor can help a customer, it must earn the customer’s trust: Trust encourages a customer to further engage with the brand, writes Miller. Your brand can earn this trust by displaying two qualities:

##### Mentor Quality #1: Compassion

**Be compassionate by showing that you understand your customer’s problem** —and even that you have the same problem, writes Miller. Then, communicate to them that you want to help. This compassion encourages trust in your brand.

(Shortform note: To effectively position themselves as a compassionate mentor, brands need to put in the work necessary to understand their customers. For example, delivery service Postmates’ 2018 campaign in Los Angeles began with thorough market research. Postmates learned as much as possible about its customers and where they lived by tracking ordering trends across LA’s neighborhoods over time. Then, the company created a campaign featuring specific problems Los Angelenos faced—like wanting an açai bowl but not knowing how to pronounce it—followed by the words “we get it,” showing compassion by implying Postmates understood the customer and would fetch the product for them.)

##### Mentor Quality #2: Competence

Demonstrate your brand’s competence as a mentor **by showing that you’ve mentored others before** , asserts Miller. When customers sense you have a strong track record, they trust you. One way Miller recommends establishing competence is by displaying customer testimonials in your marketing materials.

(Shortform note: Miller recommends establishing competence using testimonials. But do testimonials convince customers of a brand’s competence and generate trust? It seems so: They can generate a 62% increase in revenue from every customer, every time they buy from you.)

#### Part #4: The Brand-Mentor Presents the Customer-Protagonist With a Plan

Once you’ve positioned yourself as your customer’s mentor, **present them with a step-by-step plan to overcome their problem—in this case, the plan to purchase and implement your product or service** , counsels Miller. Customers are always looking for reasons not to take the risk of making a purchase, and confusion and fear are two common reasons. A plan eliminates confusion and fear, clearing the way for your customer to make the purchase.

(Shortform note: A step-by-step plan may reduce confusion and ambiguity for _salespeople_ as well as customers. Mike Weinberg, author of _New Sales. Simplified, _argues that in face-to-face sales calls, salespeople must come prepared with a plan, rather than improvising. This avoids losing the customer’s attention on confusing or irrelevant side-points and keeps the salesperson in control. Weinberg outlines eight specific stages of a good sales call, starting with building a relationship with the customer and ending with setting up next steps.)

You can create two types of plans for customers:

##### Plan Type #1: The Instructional Plan

According to Miller, **instructional plans walk customers through the concrete steps to either purchase your product, implement it after the purchase, or a blend of both**. The aim of an instructional plan is to eradicate customer confusion about how to purchase or use your product. Miller advises including three to six steps in your instructional plan and communicating it to customers in your marketing material.

If you sell meal kits, for instance, your instructional plan might be: “Step 1: Log into our website and customize your meal kit. Step 2: Receive and unpackage your meal kit. Step 3: Cook delicious meals for your family.”

(Shortform note: The key values of simplicity and clarity, which Miller emphasizes in the instructional plan, appear again and again in other advice on marketing. The more you can eliminate ambiguity and complexity around your product in the mind of the customer, the greater your chances of making a sale. You might consider adding clarity and simplicity to your business by paring down your product selection, pricing, or features or by simplifying store or website layouts to facilitate buying.)

##### Plan Type #2: The Promise Plan

**The promise plan lists the promises you make to your customer about how you’ll do business with them** , writes Miller. This plan makes purchasing from you less risky and scary in the customer’s eyes. An example of a promise plan for your meal kit company might be: “You’ll only receive food that’s locally sourced. You’ll be able to responsibly recycle our packaging. If you’re not satisfied with our product, we guarantee your money back.”

(Shortform note: Miller writes that a promise plan explains how you’ll do good business with the customer. Such plans are usually easier to create for products than for services because you often can’t redo a service in the same way you can repair a product. Nonetheless, service-centered companies can get creative when thinking of ways to guarantee customer satisfaction. For example, you could provide a voucher for free future services, refund money, or pay for services from another company. An advantage of a strong promise plan is that you can charge more for your services upfront because removing customers’ risks reduces their fear, making them willing to pay more.)

#### Part 5: The Brand-Mentor Calls the Customer-Protagonist to Action

Now that you’ve outlined how your customer can solve their problem with your product, **call them to action to buy** , instructs Miller. It won’t be clear to the customer what you want them to do—buy your product or service—if you don’t explicitly and repeatedly tell them.

(Shortform note: Not only do customers need calls to action to buy, as Miller claims, but they also expect them. This is because customer expectations are shaped by past experiences and beliefs, known as perceptual sets. Because most consumers have visited websites with calls to action before, they have a perceptual set that tells them the next website they visit should have a call to action describing what to do.)

Don’t fear appearing insistent or too bold in your marketing materials, presses Miller. Repetition and boldness are signs of confidence in your product. Customers usually opt for the brand that’s clear about what they want the customer to do.

(Shortform note: While Miller insists that repetition and boldness signal confidence in your product, others advocate for a more self-deprecating approach to marketing: making fun of themselves or their product. This is because being self-deprecating shows customers you’re authentic and honest, two appealing brand traits.)

According to Miller, marketers should implement two types of calls to action: calls to buy and calls to engage. Let’s look at each:

##### Call to Action #1: A Call to Buy

**A call to buy leads to a purchase or is the first step toward a purchase** , writes Miller. These are unambiguous, direct calls, like “Buy Now!,” “Schedule a Consultation,” or “Apply Now.” Miller stresses that you shouldn’t be afraid to ask for the business you want from your customer.

When creating a call to buy on your website or marketing materials, draw attention to it by:

  * Placing the “Buy Now!” or similar button in the top right corner of your website at all times
  * Using a different color, font, or size for your call to buy button
  * Incorporating the call to buy into every piece of marketing material



(Shortform note: While Miller’s strategies might be a good starting point to _draw attention to_ your call to buy, they won’t be effective at generating purchases if the call to buy _itself_ is weak. Other marketers argue there are additional, more specific rules dictating how to create the ideal call to buy. One piece of advice is to start the call with a strong, specific imperative verb, like “subscribe,” “learn,” or “buy.” Also, create a sense of urgency by using time-specific words and phrases like “now” or “before it’s too late.” Wherever possible, induce an emotional reaction. Do this by simply adding an exclamation mark to the end of the call or by referencing a positive outcome of taking action: saving money, for example. Finally, if possible, tailor your calls to action by device. On your mobile site, which customers access on their phones, ask them to “ _call_ to get started,” for example.)

##### Call to Action #2: A Call to Engage

**A call to engage offers your customer helpful information that presents you as a competent mentor,** writes Miller. A call to engage doesn’t directly funnel your customer toward a sale. Rather, it positions you as a worthy brand in their mind so they’ll think of you when they do need your product. An example of a call to engage might be an educational PDF or video series, a sample of your product, or a test run.

(Shortform note: Gary Vaynerchuk discusses the concept of the call to engage in detail in _Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook_. In the book’s titular boxing metaphor, calls to engage are “jabs” and calls to buy are “right hooks.” Vaynerchuk believes that before you present the call to buy, you must first establish a relationship of trust with the customer using calls to engage. He adds that calls to engage work best when they’re funny, raise questions, or entertain. Unlike Miller, Vaynerchuk writes exclusively in the social media world, meaning that for him, calls to engage are always social media posts. For Miller, calls to engage can be a number of differing offerings.)

#### Part 6: The Negative Stakes of Not Taking Action

Once you’ve called your customer to action, **tell them what’s at stake if they _don’t_ act**, advises Miller. Without a sense of negative consequence from not buying your product or service, the customer won’t feel compelled to buy. For instance, you can tell customers that your chiropractic services will improve their posture, but unless you _also_ tell them that bad posture can lead to back problems, they likely won’t feel enough of an urge to engage your services.

(Shortform note: You can use comparative advertising to point out a negative consequence of not buying from you—in other words, compare your brand to lesser competitor brands the customer should avoid. In this context, the other, inferior brand is the negative consequence for the customer to avoid. For this marketing tactic to be ethical, ensure your claim is objective (“market-leading” is considered an objective claim, while “best” is not). Also, be sure you’re comparing to brands that offer products with the same purpose so the comparison is fair. Finally, ensure any claims you make are verifiable by indicating what information you’ve based the claim on and where the customer can find that information.)

Miller adds that it’s important to elicit only a _moderate_ amount of anxiety about the negative stakes for your customer. If you overplay the negative stakes (”You’ll damage your back irreparably without my services!”) you’ll repulse your customers, but if you underplay the negative stakes (“There’s a small chance your back might hurt occasionally without my services”) you won’t create enough of an urge to buy.

(Shortform note: Miller claims that a moderate amount of fear motivates consumers to act while an excessive amount of fear turns them off from buying. This principle arguably applies outside of a marketing context, too: Humans seem to function best under moderate, not extreme, conditions. This also applies to the level of stress in our lives. Moderate stress can bolster focus and motivation, while too much stress kills motivation and creates a feeling of overwhelm. Likewise, without any stress at all, we may not feel motivated enough to do anything.)

#### Part 7: The Happy Ending of Following the Plan

In this _most important_ part, **show the specific, simple, positive outcome—or happy ending—of buying your product** , writes Miller. Your customer won’t understand how your product will improve their life unless you show them. Miller advises being _specific_ and _simple_ because it’s hard for customers to desire a _vague, complex_ positive outcome.

For example, to advertise your bone-strengthening supplement, don’t write “these supplements will improve your life,” (vague) but rather: “supplements to make you feel 10 years younger” (specific). Further, don’t explain how having stronger bones will reduce customers’ health insurance premiums (complex). Instead, show people moving easily and enjoying life (simple).

(Shortform note: In _The $100 Startup, _Chris Guillebeau not only advocates showing your customer the positive outcome of buying your product but also advises focusing on the experience of the positive outcome, rather than the specific attributes of it that are less emotionally resonant. For instance, this means you should present the happy ending of purchasing bone supplements as the _experience_ of being active and free and not as the specific attributes of having better hip mobility.)

#### The Transformation: How Do You Help Your Customer Change for the Better?

We’ve just walked through all seven parts of the marketing outline, but there’s one remaining, overarching part of the story for you to think about, writes Miller: your customer’s _transformation_.

The strongest motivator of human action and behavior is the desire to transform into someone better, explains Miller. **If you position yourself as an enabler of your customer’s transformation, you become more than simply a brand: You become a way of life.**

(Shortform note: Miller claims that all humans are inherently interested in improving themselves. Yet studies show that different generations have differing levels of commitment to bettering themselves. Millennials are more interested than previous generations in self-improvement, possibly because all their basic needs have generally always been met, leaving plenty of time to think about more complex concerns. Another reason may be that millennials’ expectations of themselves are higher than those of previous generations, as research seems to indicate.)

To understand what your customers want to transform into, identify their aspirational identity, suggests Miller. This is how your customers would _like_ to see themselves. For instance, if you offer exercise boot camps, your customers’ aspirational identity is someone fit and rugged.

(Shortform note: To discover what your customers’ aspirational identity is, you might consider interviewing them. If you do speak face to face to customers or potential customers, be sure to pay attention to silences and omissions as much as to what they _do_ say, recommend Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles in _Raving Fans. _These are often more telling of what customers really want or mean.)

Once you know what your customer wants to become and they’ve joined your story by purchasing your product, tell them when they’ve achieved their desired transformation, writes Miller. For example, mark your customer’s transformation into a fit, rugged person after a certain number of months by offering them a reward, like a free class or a social media shout-out.

(Shortform note: In _The $100 Startup, _Chris Guillebeau describes the importance of customer transformation in the context of _product creation_ , not marketing. He recommends designing your product so that customers feel superior after using it. In the same way that marketers should reflect on how to _explain_ how products transform people, product designers should reflect on how to _make_ products that transform people.)

### Implement Your Storyline

Now that you have a storyline, transfer the ideas and content in that storyline to your marketing materials, writes Miller. **The more you implement your storyline in your marketing, the more customers will sign up to star in your story.**

Miller recommends implementing your storyline in six ways:

#### Implementation #1: Overhaul Your Website

Your website, a key piece of your marketing,**should include only the minimum amount of information to convince customers you have the solution they’re looking for and are trustworthy** , asserts Miller. What’s more, ensure every image, idea, and word on your website is inspired by your storyline, and eliminate anything that’s not.

> **Improving Your Website’s User Experience**
> 
> Even if you implement Miller’s advice for overhauling your website, your site may fall flat and your customers may not trust you unless you implement the basic tenets of _user experience_ : in other words, making your website frictionless and easy to navigate. Here are some tips for improving user experience and creating an easy-to-browse website that inspires trust in your customers:
> 
>   * **Make your navigation easy to use**. When customers easily understand how to move around on your site, you eliminate confusion and build trust. Do this by using a maximum of seven main menu buttons.
> 
>   * **Double-check your site for errors**. Errors, like dead links, images that won’t load, and typos, reduce customer trust.
> 
>   * **Reduce the number of choices the customer must make**. When customers face too many options on a page, they become confused and are likely to leave.
> 
>   * **Encourage customers to scroll down**. When customers scroll, they become more invested in your site and product, and this makes them more likely to buy. To encourage scrolling, make sure the information above the fold—what you see before you scroll—is engaging enough to encourage deeper interest.

#### Implementation #2: Write a Brand Logline

Miller also recommends writing a _brand logline_ : **a short, repeatable phrase or sentence that answers the question: “What does your company do?”** When writing your logline, use the following elements from your storyline: the customer-protagonist, the problem, the plan, and the happy ending.

For example, if you sell a line of herbal teas your brand logline might be: “Find serenity in your hectic workday with our customizable, pre-packaged tea blends.” The customer here is a busy office worker, the problem is the hectic workday, the plan is to use easy, hassle-free pre-packaged blends, and the happy ending is finding serenity.

(Shortform note: Other marketing specialists have devised alternative ways to succinctly describe your business to others. In _To Sell Is Human, _Daniel H. Pink outlines four different pitches that vary in length. These are more situation-specific than Miller’s logline, which he advises using across all marketing platforms. Pink’s recommended pitches are: the single-word pitch (which simplifies your message to its absolute core), the question pitch (phrased as a question to the customer, which inspires connection), the email subject-line pitch (which makes the recipient curious enough to open an email), and the longest: the Twitter pitch (which inspires a base of followers to act).)

#### Implementation #3: Start an Automated Email Campaign

**Implement a four-email, prewritten, automated campaign that begins when an email address is added to your email list** , advises Miller. The first three emails should simply be calls to engage. The fourth email should contain a call to buy. Repeat this sequence every month. The goal of the email campaign is simply to get your brand into customers’ consciousness, assures Miller. That way, when they do need a product or service, they’ll think of you first.

(Shortform note: Miller alludes to the fact that most marketing emails go unopened (which is why your only goal with an email campaign should be to get your customer to see your brand name). Indeed, in most industries, email open rates hover around 20%. That said, unsubscribe rates are also low, usually around 0.20%. This supports Miller’s claim that email is a good way to at least get your brand name out there because while few customers will read the email, most of them will stay subscribed and continue to see your brand name in their inboxes.)

Structure emails around the customer’s problem, counsels Miller: Describe the problem, how you’ll solve it, and how much better life will be once it’s solved.

(Shortform note: We’re beginning to see that even in the small pieces of your marketing, Miller believes you should continue telling truncated versions of the storyline. His recommendation for structuring your email is, in essence, a condensed version of the storyline. It’s worth bearing this in mind as you explore different forms of marketing, like social media marketing: Implement your storyline _everywhere_.)

#### Implementation #4: Showcase Testimonials of Transformation

**Solicit and share customer testimonials that describe how your product transformed their life for the better** , recommends Miller. As we’ve already explored, people are most motivated by the desire to transform and will want the same transformational experience you’ve provided others. Just asking customers for testimonials won’t give you the stories of transformation you want, though, warns Miller. Instead, ask pointed questions that prompt the reader to describe or allude to a transformation: for instance, “how has our product changed your day-to-day life?”

> **How Much Can Brands Shape Testimonials?**
> 
> Miller suggests you ask customers targeted questions to solicit the information needed to create a compelling story of customer transformation. While this is a far cry from outright lying or inventing a customer testimonial, it nonetheless begs the question: How do potential customers know that a testimonial is objective, rather than unduly influenced or even created by the company requesting it?
> 
> Fortunately, in the US there are legal safeguards that ensure customer testimonials are based on a real person’s experience. Fake testimonials are illegal because they confer an unfair advantage over competitors and mislead customers. Additionally, in most cases, paid testimonials are also illegal, unless the testimonial clearly states that the customer is being paid but that their contribution is nonetheless truthful.

#### Implementation #5: Build a Rewarding Referral System

**Finally, implement a referral system that enables happy customers to recommend your product to others and rewards them for it,** advises Miller. The easiest way to do this is to send an automated email to customers who’ve made one to two purchases containing a video or resource they can pass to friends. If they refer a new customer, offer existing customers a reward, such as a commission, a gift, or membership in an affiliate program.

(Shortform note: Marketing specialists extol the virtues of referrals because they have the highest return on investment compared to other marketing tactics and generate leads who already have a strong level of interest in your product. However, specialists advise companies to ask for referrals early in the customer relationship, when the customer is still impressed with your product. Wait too long, and they lose the excitement that would cause them to refer you to a friend. Miller’s recommendation to present an opportunity to refer another customer after only one or two purchases is likely early enough.)
