## Chapter 13: Two Portfolios: Wealth Accumulation and Wealth Preservation

Now that you know the basics of investing, this chapter focuses on designing your portfolio. Two stages in your investing life determine the mix of assets in your portfolio: the **wealth accumulation stage** , and the **wealth preservation stage**. If you answered the three questions for investors in Chapter 10, you have already determined your current investing stage.

### The Wealth Accumulation Portfolio

When you’re young, you should focus totally on building wealth. In that regard, do two things:

  * Accumulate your F-You Money as soon as possible.
  * Then, focus on stocks, which, as we have seen, provide the best performance of all asset classes. Your best and simplest wealth-building vehicle is VTSAX, Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund. 



Remember that the stock market goes up and down and discipline yourself to not panic and sell during downtowns. You may want to invest _more_ money during downturns because stock prices are lower, but if you primarily focus on adding regularly to your nest egg over time, you’ll become wealthy.

Investing only in stocks at this point is aggressive but appropriate for the early wealth accumulation stage—it will deliver the greatest return over time. Don’t worry about bonds until you’re preparing to start living on your investments.

### The Wealth Preservation Portfolio

When you’ve built your wealth and are ready to retire, your focus should be on preserving it so you can continue to live on it. You want to see fewer ups and downs in your portfolio value, even with the tradeoff of lower overall returns from taking a more conservative approach.

While the wealth accumulation stage is simple—put all your money in a stocks index fund—wealth preservation requires a few more steps:

  * Adding a bonds index fund
  * Determining the asset allocation—that is, what percentage of your money should be in stocks and what percentage should be in bonds. Also, you should review and adjust your allocation—referred to as rebalancing—once a year. It typically takes a few hours. Chapter 14 looks at asset allocation in more detail.



In semi-retirement, Collins allocates his assets this way:

  * Stocks in VTSAX: 75%
  * Bonds in VBTLX: 20%
  * Cash in a bank account: 5%



This is a typical wealth preservation portfolio. You can adjust it to your circumstances: If you want less volatility, increase the percentage in bonds; if you want more growth and can tolerate market fluctuations, boost the percentage in stocks.
