## Introduction

Most people realize money is important for getting what you want out of life—but they don’t want to spend a lot of time thinking about it. _The Simple Path to Wealth_ grew from a blog series Collins wrote in response, simplifying money and investing for his young adult daughter. To get along in the world, your options are to take charge of your money—put it to work for you as your “servant”—or be mastered by it.

**Ignoring money leaves you open to being taken advantage of by financial advisors who profit from your ignorance** by, first, convincing you that you need help, then by selling you complex and costly investments that perform poorly.

In contrast, _The Simple Path to Wealth_ argues that investing isn’t complicated—you can do it yourself. **Collins’s “simple path” is: Spend less than you make, invest the extra in index funds, and stay out of debt.** If you follow this prescription, you’ll end up wealthy and live a more fulfilling life. The majority of the book focuses on exactly _how_ to invest.

Accumulating wealth requires changing the way you handle and think about money, including:

  * Rejecting a consumer-oriented lifestyle focused on spending and borrowing. **Anything you borrow money to own actually owns you.**
  * Saving half of every dollar you earn
  * Understanding that investing isn’t complicated
  * Avoiding financial advisors who put their interests above yours
  * Accepting that there will be ups and downs in the market, but if you stay the course, it will pay off because the market always goes up over time



### ‘F-You Money’

In addition to spending less, investing, and avoiding debt, you should save until you have “F-You Money,” a financial cushion that gives you the ability to make choices about what _you_ want to do rather than being a victim of your circumstances. For example, having F-You Money allows you to walk away from a job you hate, take a “sabbatical” to do something you dream of, or to avoid poverty if you’re laid off. (The term comes from James Clavell’s 1981 novel _Noble House_.) Collins accumulated enough F-You Money early in his career to take extended time off work. Later, he was laid off and lived on his F-You Money for three years without a job.

F-You Money, plus the money you invest for your long-term future, both buy you freedom—and **your** **freedom is the most important thing your money can buy.** Ultimately, your goal is financial independence, the point where you can live on 4% of your nest egg a year without having to work for the rest of your life. (Your nest egg remains stable or grows if you withdraw only 4% a year and the market grows.)

The more you save and invest, the sooner you’ll have F-You Money and the sooner you’ll be financially independent. **_Saving and investing_ _half your income is achievable_ when you learn to live modestly on the other half and don’t borrow.**

Financial independence is as much about living frugally as it is about having savings and investments. If you’re laid off after 20-plus years and quickly find yourself broke, you haven’t learned to live within your means. But you _can_ learn to live so that you’re not a slave to money because of your lifestyle and thus, not a slave to your job.

Collins and his family achieved financial independence and retired early by doing three things: avoiding debt, saving 50% of their income, and investing in Vanguard index funds. In this book, he shows you how easy this path to wealth and freedom can be.

### Two Caveats About the Numbers in This Book

  1. **Things change:** Some numbers used in examples may be outdated, but will still illustrate broader concepts.
  2. **Market returns:** You shouldn’t treat the average market returns quoted in the book as expected returns for you. They’re not predictions; they’re included to show the value of investing over time. For example, from 1975-2015, the market returned an average 11.9% a year (but during this 40-year period, there were ups and downs). 



(Shortorm note: This summary follows the sequence of the book, but some chapters are combined or omitted to reduce repetition and enhance clarity and focus.)
