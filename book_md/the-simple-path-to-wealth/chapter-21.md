## Chapter 21: Health Savings Accounts

**Besides saving for financial independence or retirement, you should also save for out-of-pocket health care expenses.** The best way to do that is to open a Health Savings Account or HSA (this is different from an FSA or Flexible Spending Account).

Here’s why you should open an HSA: If you have a high-deductible health care plan, which is increasingly common, you’ll need to have a significant amount of money available for paying the deductible.

HSAs, which are similar to an IRA, were created to enable people to set aside money tax-free for potential out-of-pocket expenses as well as other qualified medical expenses. (Shortform note: In 2020, you can set aside up to $3,550 for an individual and $7,100 for a family each year; if you’re 55 or older, you can add another $1,000 in each case.)

Here are the HSA basics:

  * Your contributions are tax-deductible.
  * You can have an HSA regardless of your income or any other contributions you make.
  * You can only have an HSA if you have a plan defined as high-deductible. 
  * You can withdraw the money for qualified medical expenses (including dental and vision) anytime tax-free. The expenses can be for a spouse or dependents even if they’re not on your insurance plan.
  * You can roll over to the next year anything you don’t spend in a year. (With an FSA, you forfeit anything leftover.)
  * You’ll pay tax and a 20% penalty if you withdraw the money for non-medical purposes, unless you’re 65+ or become permanently disabled (then you’ll owe only the tax due).
  * A spouse can inherit an HSA to use for medical expenses, but for other inheritors, it will be taxed as income.
  * You may choose to pay your medical bills without dipping into your HSA and just let it grow.
  * You can invest your HSA anywhere, but if you expect to use it in the short term, it’s best to keep it in a bank savings account.
