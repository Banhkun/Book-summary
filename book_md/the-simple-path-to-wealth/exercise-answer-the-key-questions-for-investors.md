## Exercise: Answer the Key Questions for Investors

Before you begin investing, Collins recommends answering three questions.

* * *

First, what investment stage are you in: the wealth accumulation (income-producing) stage, the wealth preservation (post-working) stage, or a combination (for instance, if you’re between jobs)? Do you expect this stage to change in the next decade? (If so, how?)

Next, what level of investment risk are you comfortable with and why? How concerned are you about potential market drops, and how would you react to them?

Finally, what’s your investment horizon—how many years do you plan to spend accumulating wealth? How does your horizon affect your views on risk?

How prepared do you feel to begin investing and why? What steps might you take to prepare further?
