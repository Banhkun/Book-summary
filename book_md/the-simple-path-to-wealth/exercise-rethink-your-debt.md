## Exercise: Rethink Your Debt

Debt is the biggest obstacle to building your wealth because when you’re making debt payments, you can’t save. If you have debt, Collins advises you to focus your full attention on getting rid of it by following the steps in this exercise.

* * *

Step 1: List all your debts, in order of interest rate (with the highest rate first). How much do you pay a month on debt? How does this affect your spending and saving options?

Step 2: Eliminate all unnecessary spending so you can put as much money as possible toward paying off debts. What are some expenses you can eliminate? (For example, what are some things you could pay less for?) How much money do these changes free up per month?

Step 3: Make the minimum monthly payments required on all debts, then apply all remaining discretionary money to paying down the debt with the highest interest rate first. Which debt will you work to pay off first? How long will it take to pay off? What can you do to keep yourself on track to pay it off?
