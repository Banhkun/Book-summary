## Exercise: How Much Are You Investing?

If your employer provides a 401(k) or 403(b) investment plan, Collins recommends contributing the maximum amount the government allows, especially if your employer provides a match.

* * *

If you have an employer-provided 401(k) or 403(b) plan, what percentage of your income are you investing in it and why?

Are you making the maximum allowable contribution? If not, why? (The maximum annual contribution to a 401(k) or 403(b) in 2020 is $19,500. The catchup contribution is $6,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or over.)

How could you reduce your lifestyle expenses to give you more money to contribute to your 401(k)?
