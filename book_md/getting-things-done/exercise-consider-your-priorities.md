## Exercise: Consider Your Priorities

Reflect on your workflow and method of prioritizing.

* * *

Think of something thatâ€™s currently on your to-do list. What role and responsibility does that task serve?

How does successfully completing that task contribute to your short-term goals?

How does this short-term goal relate to your long-term goals?

How does this long-term goal fit in with your larger vision and purpose for your life?
