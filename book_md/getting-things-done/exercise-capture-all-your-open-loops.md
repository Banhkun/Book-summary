## Exercise: Capture All Your Open Loops

Open loops can lurk in all corners of your life. Use this exercise to uncover them.

* * *

If you don’t have an in-tray, where do you collect most of the items you need to deal with (such as mail, notes, and forms)?

Where are other places in your home where these kinds of items tend to land (for example, the kitchen counter)?

Where do you collect items like receipts and business cards that you gather while you’re on the move (for example, your purse or the center console of your car)?

Take a mental tour of your home, office, and other physical spaces. Are there any other places you should check for open loops?
