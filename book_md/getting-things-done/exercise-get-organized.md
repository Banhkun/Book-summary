## Exercise: Get Organized

You’ve done the hard work of capturing and clarifying everything. Now organizing it in an easily accessible and navigable way is key to making this system work.

* * *

What are two or three categories you might use to sort your next actions?

Take a look at your calendar and Next Actions list. Write down any previously overlooked projects you can identify based on tasks or upcoming appointments.

Off the top of your head, what are two or three items you’d put on your Someday/Maybe list or two or three subcategories you’d create?

Think of the mail and notices you’ve gotten in the past week or so. What’s one item that would be useful to mark as a reminder on your calendar (e.g. an event you might want to attend)?
