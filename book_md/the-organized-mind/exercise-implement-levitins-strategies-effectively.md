## Exercise: Implement Levitin’s Strategies Effectively

Levitin suggests that you organize your physical and digital things, your thoughts, and your relationships so that you can use your brain power more efficiently and make better decisions. We’ll help you decide which of these areas to tackle first so that you maximize the reduction in overwhelm that you feel.

* * *

What do you feel most overwhelmed by right now? For example, if you’ve recently moved, you may feel overwhelmed by the number of boxes to unpack or the number of services you still need to register for.

What state would that overwhelming thing need to be in so that it felt more manageable? For example, unpacking the boxes in your kitchen or signing up for just electricity, internet, and water might significantly reduce your overwhelm.

What’s a strategy you learned from Levitin that could help you achieve that state? For example, you might designate zones in your kitchen (for plates and bowls) to make unpacking easier, or you might write down all the services you need to sign up for so that you can stop getting distracted and focus on signing up for the most important three.
