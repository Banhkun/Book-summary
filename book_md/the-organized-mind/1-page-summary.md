## 1-Page Summary

How can we live less stressfully in the modern world, where we have more demands on our attention than ever before? In _The Organized Mind_ , author and neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin suggests that the key lies in **sorting and externally storing your thoughts and organizing the things around you** , which means writing down your thoughts and arranging your physical environment so your brain has less information to manage. Levitin argues that doing so allows you to use your brain power more efficiently and make better decisions.

Levitin garnered national attention with his first book, _This Is Your Brain on Music_ , which spent over a year on several best-seller lists. Since then, he has written four other books—three of which were _New York Times_ best sellers, including _The Organized Mind_.

In this guide, we’ll first explain how the modern world overwhelms us and why Levitin says this is problematic. Then, we’ll describe our current approach to dealing with overwhelm, why it doesn’t work, and why you should sort and externalize your thoughts and things instead. Finally, we’ll discuss strategies for sorting and externalizing your thoughts, things, and relationships so that you can make better decisions. Along the way, we’ll discuss other experts’ recommendations for dealing with overwhelm and their practical tips for sorting and externalizing your thoughts, things, and relationships.

### Our Big Problem: The Modern World Is Overwhelming

In this section, we’ll describe how the modern world overwhelms us and why this hampers our ability to make decisions.

Levitin explains that our brain can only process a limited amount of information at once. However, **the modern world constantly exposes us to more information than our brains are capable of processing.** There are three reasons for this. First, due to globalization, we’re exposed to more news than ever before. Second, technology grows so quickly that we’re forced to regularly learn new information to keep up. Third, technology has allowed companies to offload tasks to their customers. For example, many restaurants ask that customers—not waiters—tap in their orders on their phones.

(Shortform note: Many people are exposed to massive amounts of information due to social media. Younger generations get most of their news from social media, which allows them access to information that mainstream news may not cover—even in a globalized world. Additionally, people learn how to use new social media platforms constantly; for example, TikTok became the world’s most popular social media platform in just two years. And although most people use social media for recreational purposes, companies profit from their activities by selling their data (and sometimes the posts they create), allowing social media companies to offload the task of content creation onto consumers.)

This increase in stimuli hampers our ability to make decisions. Levitin explains that when we’re bombarded by information, we must make decisions _all_ the time, which is tiring. At a minimum, we must decide whether we’ll engage with this information. Most of these decisions are unimportant—like whether to check a phone alert or ignore it and keep working. However, your brain can only decide on a limited number of things per day, and it doesn’t distinguish between important and unimportant ones. Moreover, it spends the same amount of energy on every decision, no matter how big or small. So if you’ve already reached your limit, you can’t make any more decisions—even if that next decision is the most important one that day.

(Shortform note: How can you tell if you’ve made too many decisions? Contrary to Levitin’s argument that you’ll lose the ability to make any decisions when you’re exhausted, some experts suggest that you may simply try to save your energy by putting off the decision, waffling, or acting on impulse. So if you have an important decision, consider making it early in the day. The fewer decisions you’ve made, the more cognitive energy you have available to make a difficult decision—such as choosing which house to buy.)

### Why Our Current Approaches Don’t Work

Now that you know how the modern world hampers your ability to make good decisions, how can you improve your decision-making skills? You must first understand what you’re _currently_ doing. In this section, we’ll discuss how the neurobiological realities of attention and memory mean that two common approaches to handling information don’t work.

#### How Attention Works

Levitin explains that we have two modes of attention: **Our brains operate either __ in the “central executive” (CE) mode or the “mind-wandering” (MW) mode. **CE mode is what you’re using to read this guide; it takes over when you’re trying to focus on a particular task. If you’re not in CE mode, your brain naturally reverts to MW mode: You're not focused on anything in particular and are instead letting your thoughts flit among various topics.

Levitin explains that your brain chooses your mode of attention using two mechanisms: the “attentional filter” and the “attentional switch.” Your attentional filter is a group of neurons that constantly assesses your environment and guards against unimportant information. But sometimes, your brain _does_ decide that something is immediately relevant: In particular, it will do so if it detects something _new_ or something _significant_. In that case, your attentional switch kicks in—and directs your attention to something else. (This can happen within or outside of your conscious awareness.)

For example, say you’re reading this guide in CE mode at a coffee shop. Your brain is registering countless stimuli—like the sound of the radiator and the smell of espresso—but your attentional filter is keeping it all at bay so that you can focus on reading. However, if you were to spill hot coffee on your pants, your attentional switch would alert you to the hot sensation (which is both new and important because it’s dangerous) so that you could jump up and clean it off. After that, you might decide to observe your fellow cafe-goers and relax for a few minutes—in which case you would consciously use your attentional switch to shift to MW mode.

(Shortform note: Levitin noted in a blog post that Donald Broadbent was one of the scientists who identified the “attentional filter.” This suggests that Levitin took the term from Broadbent’s filter model of attention, which was the first theory that posited that you filter out unimportant information so that you can pay attention to the things that matter. Additionally, Levitin is one of the few authors to use “attentional switch” to describe both the neural mechanism that redirects your attention and the process of redirecting your attention; other authors tend to use “attentional shifting” to describe the process of redirecting your attention.)

> **How Switching Between The Brain’s Modes Helps You Solve Problems**
> 
> In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Barbara Oakley also explains that your brain naturally alternates between two modes, but she calls them by different names. Focused-mode thinking is Levitin’s CE mode: It occurs when your attention is focused on something, and it allows you to process detailed information. Diffused-mode thinking is Levitin’s MW mode: It occurs when you relax your focus or let your mind wander.
> 
> While Levitin focuses on how these two modes differ, Oakley, whose text is geared toward learning, focuses on how you can use these two modes in concert. Oakley explains that solving any difficult problem requires an exchange of information between these modes. So you should start by focusing on the problem, then deliberately divert your attention (for example, to exercising or doing routine tasks) so that your brain can switch to diffuse mode and approach the problem creatively. In other words, you must first employ your attentional _filter_ to keep out irrelevant information so you can focus in CE mode, then deliberately use your attentional _switch_ to move into MW mode.

The reality of how attention works explains why **multitasking doesn’t work**. When faced with too many demands on your time, you may try to multitask. However, you’re _incapable_ of multitasking: You may think you’re doing two things at once, but you’re actually alternating your focus between the two demands. This constant shifting takes a serious toll: It tires out your brain faster, which evidence suggests results in reduced mental abilities. Moreover, multitasking necessitates that you make several little decisions (like which task to focus on at any given moment)—and, as we discussed previously, the more decisions you make, the worse your ability to make them gets.

> **When Multitasking Works**
> 
> Unlike Levitin, who argues against multitasking in all its forms, _Hyperfocus_ author Chris Bailey suggests that you can easily perform some simple tasks simultaneously. Since these tasks take up so little attention, you’re able to focus on them simultaneously instead of shifting your attention, and so you don’t get tired. This is especially true if these tasks are _habitual_ tasks you perform in autopilot mode—which means you make minimal decisions about them, and thus you don’t tire yourself out. For example, if you perform your skincare regimen while listening to a podcast every night, you don’t need to decide when to apply lotion or turn on the podcast; you automatically turn on the podcast when you walk into the bathroom and reach for the lotion after you wash your face.

#### How Memory Works

Now that we’ve discussed how attention works, we’ll explore how memory works—specifically, how the brain uses _associative access_ and the _altering of memories_ to recall something. Together, these properties of memory reinforce Levitin’s view that keeping and processing complicated information in your head is risky.

Levitin explains that each time you encounter a stimulus, you encode a representation (a mental concept) of that stimulus in your brain. When you want to recall that stimulus or concept, you can do so via “associative access,” which means that you can use any number of features to recall that particular stimulus.

For instance, you’ve encountered several balls in your lifetime, so you know what a “ball” is because you have a representation of “ball” in your brain. Using associative access, you could call that representation to mind by thinking about round things, or sports equipment, or things that bounce—all properties of a ball.

Associative access works because the representations of these stimuli are all linked to each other in your brain, and recalling one stimulus automatically activates several other representations.

(Shortform note: In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Oakley explains that you can use the associative nature of memory to your advantage when you’re trying to learn something. The more existing chunks of information you can associate with a new piece of information, the easier it will be for you to remember (presumably because you have more potential stimuli you can use to activate and thus access that information.) For example, say you memorize your friend’s April 28 birthday by noting that she has a mathematical birthday (since 4 x 2 = 8). If you want to recall your friend’s birthday and know that it’s in April but can’t remember exactly when, recalling that it’s a mathematical birthday might help you think of the exact date.)

Another important feature of memory, according to Levitin, is that **each time you recall something, you risk unintentionally altering the memory** —so when you remember the same event again later, the memory may no longer be accurate. For example, if you have a conversation with both your brother and sister about a dinner you had with just your sister, you may then later misremember that your brother was also there.

The associative and alterable nature of memory explains why, as Levitin notes, **keeping and processing complicated information in your head** **is risky.** The fact that certain representations are linked to and thus automatically activate other representations can confuse your brain—which may lead you to make poorer decisions.

For example, if you wanted to buy a house, you might view several properties. If you try to remember every detail of each house instead of writing them down, you might get confused as to which house was which; for example, you may think the house with the black door had a porch when really it was the house with the red door. If porches are important to you, you might then decide to take another look at the house with the black door, only to discover upon arriving at the property that you’re looking at the wrong house. But if you keep a list of each house and its relevant features, you’re less likely to make such a mistake.

(Shortform note: Levitin presents the malleable nature of memory as a problem, but other neuroscientists argue that your brain rewrites memories to _help_ you: It updates the information so that your memories become more relevant to the current moment. Theoretically, this would allow you to make _better_ decisions, although it doesn’t always work out that way in practice if making a good decision relies on accuracy.)

### What to Do Instead: Sort and Store Outside Your Brain

Since multitasking is impossible and storing information in your head is problematic, how should you deal with our modern influx of information? Levitin suggests the answer lies in **conserving your mental resources** so you have more brain power and energy to deal with the decisions that matter. You can do so via _categorization_ , or sorting, and _externalization_ , or storing information outside your brain by writing it down.

> **Other Ways Externalizing Information Can Help You**
> 
> Like Levitin, _Building a Second Brain_ author Tiago Forte asserts that the best way to deal with our modern influx of information is to externalize it. However, Forte argues that you should do so not to avoid decision fatigue, but because externalizing information improves your ability to do knowledge work—creating, interpreting, and applying information—which he contends is your most valuable asset in today’s society.
> 
> Your ability to do knowledge work hinges on how creative and productive you are; building an external storage system in which you store every important idea you encounter in an easily accessible way increases both. But if you don’t externalize information, you can’t remember all the ideas you encounter, which reduces your creativity (ability to draw connections between ideas) and your productivity (ability to quickly access information).

#### Sorting Into Categories

According to Levitin, **one way to preserve your brain power is to** **take advantage of your natural tendency to sort** , meaning classifying things into groups by _function, appearance, or situation_. This tendency helps you preserve your mental resources by allowing you to **focus on only the most salient details** at any given moment instead of juggling several bits of information in your head at once.

For example, you could sort your dinnerware by function: You can designate one shelf for bowls and another for plates. You could also sort them by color, with white dinnerware on one shelf and those with patterns on another. And lastly, you could sort them by situation: dishes for the family on one shelf and dishes for when guests come over on another. Doing so saves you from having to figure out where to find each dish you need when setting the table.

> **How Sorting Helps People With ADHD**
> 
> Sorting may be especially beneficial for people with ADHD, who are likely to spend too much time making decisions and thus may use even more brain power. However, this tendency extends to the creation of categories; people with ADHD are more likely to create so many categories (that focus on non-salient details) that they stop being useful. For example, they might split the bowl shelf into soup bowls and cereal bowls—even though they regularly put cereal in all their bowls. To combat this tendency, people with ADHD should consider enlisting a friend’s help when creating categories or setting a time limit on how long they’ll spend creating categories.
> 
> Sorting also helps people with ADHD deal with large amounts of information they’ve stored in the physical world; people with ADHD sometimes write long to-do lists but never do anything on them because they don’t know where to start. In this case, sorting things by importance or by deadline (rather than function, appearance, or situation) can help them decide what to do and improve their productivity.

#### Storing in the Physical World

Another way to preserve your brain power is to **store information in the physical world** rather than in your brain. Sometimes, this storage process occurs _before_ the sorting process. For example, if you’re trying to decide whether to buy a computer, you might externalize all the relevant features of the computer (by writing them down) so that you can sort them into “pros” and “cons.” Since you don’t have to remember every relevant feature, you now have more brain power available to focus on deciding whether to buy the computer

Other times, **you store _after_ you sort**. For example, you might sort all your pencils and rulers into the category of stationery, then externalize this category by collecting all of them in a single drawer. This reduces the amount of information you have to remember: You no longer have to remember where you keep every pencil and ruler you own; you only need to remember that you keep stationery in a drawer and that both pencils and rulers count as stationery.

(Shortform note: In _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ , Marie Kondo emphasizes the importance of sorting all your things _before_ storing them when organizing your home. Kondo notes that many people organize by room; however, she argues that doing so leads us to do the same type of work over and over again, which leads to burnout. Instead, Kondo recommends tidying by category so that you do one kind of work in totality, no matter where the objects are in your space. For example, instead of first organizing your clothes from the bedroom closet and then tackling your clothes from the hall closet, gather _all_ your clothes from the whole house, eliminate what you don’t love, then store the rest.)

One effective way to externalize information is by **writing down tasks you don’t need to deal with at the moment**. By doing so, you free up mental space so that you can focus on the task at hand. For example, if you’re thinking about doing your laundry and thus not focusing on an important conversation, writing “do laundry” in your calendar releases this task from your brain so you can focus on your conversation. And now you don’t have to remember “do laundry” as an individual item; rather, you just have to remember “check your calendar”—because now laundry is one of many things on your calendar.

(Shortform note: Tasks you want to accomplish someday but don’t need to do immediately are essentially short-term goals, and studies show that writing down your goals increases the chances you’ll achieve them. This is because writing something down increases the chances that you’ll remember it—both because you can now access it in an external format and because your brain is primed to remember information you personally create, and it treats writing something down as a form of creation. In turn, the more easily you can remember your goals, the more likely you are to achieve them.)

#### Sorting and Storing Increases Creativity

Levitin asserts that, in addition to helping you keep track of your life, sorting and externalizing information can also improve your creativity for two reasons. First, when you work in a well-organized environment, you know exactly where everything is. As a result, you don’t spend time on the stressful task of searching for things you need and are thus able to reduce your stress levels and save your brain power for creative thinking.

(Shortform note: Contrary to Levitin’s assertion that clutter _harms_ creativity, studies suggest that clutter may improve creativity. One theory posits that messy places signal your brain that it’s OK to generate more unique, out-of-the-box ideas.)

Second, sorting and externalization improve your creativity by allowing you more opportunities to browse. When you look through a collection of some type (such as a group of files), your brain reverts to MW mode. Often, this mind-wandering leads to a creative insight—which might help you solve an issue you’ve been facing.

> **Why Browsing Leads to a Creative Insight**
> 
> In _Hyperfocus, _Chris __ Bailey elaborates on _why_ browsing might lead to a creative insight. We naturally remember things we haven’t yet completed much better than the things we’ve completed—so when you’re mind-wandering, your brain subconsciously works on problems it hasn’t solved by connecting all the stimuli it encounters to your problem. Sometimes, the stimulus your brain encounters reminds it of something else it already knows. It connects this old information (or the new stimulus, which may itself be the information you were missing) to your problem—and solves it.
> 
> For example, Greek mathematician Archimedes reaped the benefits of browsing while he was in the bath. He was tasked with determining whether the king's crown was made of gold, but he didn't know how to solve this problem—until he switched from focusing on the problem to taking a bath and noticed that water splashed out of his tub when he got in. He realized that immersing the crown in water to see how much water it displaced would help him determine its mass and therefore whether it was solid gold (he discovered that it was not).
> 
> Browsing may maximize the possibility of encountering the stimulus you need for a creative insight: The more you browse, the more stimuli you encounter, and the greater the likelihood you will encounter the stimulus you need to gain your creative insight.

### How to Organize Your Thinking

Now that you understand the importance of sorting and externalizing information, how do you actually do it? In this section, we’ll first discuss how to sort and externalize your thoughts so that they don’t distract you. Then, we’ll discuss how to sort and externalize your information in specific circumstances, such as when making difficult medical decisions. Finally, we’ll review a potential pitfall of externalizing information—and how to ensure it doesn’t lead you to make bad decisions.

#### How to Externalize and Sort Distracting Thoughts

As mentioned previously, our brains naturally want to wander—which often leads us to think of random but important thoughts at inopportune times. Sometimes, these thoughts distract you from a more important task; other times, they merely arise when you can’t do anything about them. For example, you might remember that you need to call the dentist on the weekend when the dentist’s office is closed.

**To deal with intrusive thoughts, Levitin recommends using a notecard system** to externalize and sort your thoughts to ensure you get to them eventually. To do so, carry a pack of 3 x 5 notecards. Every time you think of something unrelated to your current task, write it down. For even more dramatic results, spend a few minutes before difficult tasks writing down other things that might grab your attention. Doing so will clear your mind of internal distractions and improve your ability to concentrate. Crucially, only put _one_ thought on each card so that you can sort them more easily in the second step. For example, if you need to find recipes and go grocery shopping, write each task on separate cards.

Second, Levitin suggests that you sort these cards daily. If you only have a few cards, you can sort them by priority. But if you have many, sort the cards into categories, then order them by priority within each category. These categories can be anything you like; some people divide their cards by urgency, while others divide them by topic. For best results, Levitin recommends you keep these cards relatively loose (for example, not in a binder) so that you can reorganize them easily as your priorities change. If you struggle to find a particular category within your pile of loose cards, add one colored title card per category so you can find them easily.

> **How a Notecard System Improves the Quality of Your Ideas**
> 
> In _How to Take Smart Notes_ , Sonke Ahrens describes a similar notecard-based system, or “slip-box system.” This system is also designed to make you more productive—not by helping you stay on track and keep up with your tasks, but by helping you keep track of your ideas so you can more easily have original insights.
> 
> Ahrens recommends that you use 3 x 5 notecards to record any random, potentially useful ideas (but not to-dos or potential distractions, as Levitin suggests) that occur to you throughout your day; he calls these “fleeting notes.” Store each day’s cards in one place, or an inbox.
> 
> Each day, review your inbox and ask yourself: How might these ideas connect to each other? Once you hit upon an original thought, create an “evergreen note,” which is a loose index card containing _one_ fleshed-out, original idea. Regularly discard your fleeting notes, and place each evergreen note in a slip-box (a cabinet). Rather than dividing them by category or priority, file your evergreen note behind a) a note it connects strongly to (for instance, an argument it supports) or b) your most recent note. Then, go through your slip-box to see if this note is connected to any other notes, and write that down (for example, if Note #1 and Note #3 are connected, write on each note that they’re connected to the other).
> 
> The loosely connected nature of the slip-box facilitates original ideas: The process of browsing through the slip-box increases the likelihood you’ll have a creative insight, and since each evergreen note contains only _one_ idea, it’s easier to connect these notes to other potential ideas.

#### How to Organize Medical Information Effectively

According to Levitin, one area in which externalizing information is particularly helpful is when making difficult medical decisions. Although your doctors can advise you on what to do, you are ultimately responsible for your own health. Oftentimes, this requires you to make decisions based on probability—like whether to take a particular medication that has some risk of harming you.

Levitin warns against trying to _intuit_ this decision, as many of us do, because we are notoriously bad at intuiting probabilities. There are several reasons for this. First, our brains often ignore the general likelihood, or “base rate,” of something. Second, we focus too much on the worst-case scenario because similar disasters stick out in our memories, even if they’re statistically unlikely. Third, the way an issue is presented dramatically affects our judgment of it. All these phenomena can lead us to judge the probability of something incorrectly—and thus lead us to make poor medical decisions.

For example, some women decided to get tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations after actress Angelina Jolie’s viral 2013 op-ed on how her own test results prompted her to have a preventative mastectomy. They likely did so _despite_ the generally low base rate of having these mutations (which can lead to cancer), because they wanted to prevent the worst-case scenario of having breast cancer and because journalists focused on the benefits of Jolie’s surgery and not her statement that most people _don’t_ have the mutation. But this wasn’t necessarily a good thing: Most of these women didn’t need the test, which led to millions of dollars in unnecessary health care spending.

(Shortform note: Other experts recommend several strategies for improving your ability to judge probabilities. First, the more you learn about statistics and probability, the better you get at not ignoring something’s general likelihood. Second, the authors of _Thinking, Fast and Slow _imply that vividly imagining both the worst-case and the best-case scenarios will decrease the likelihood that you’ll focus too much on the worst-case scenario because both the good and bad will stick out in your memory. Third, the more you know about a particular topic, the less your judgment of it will be affected by how something is presented.)

##### Externalize Probability

To make better medical decisions, Levitin recommends that you stop _intuiting_ probabilities. Instead, externalize them using a “fourfold table” for statistically analyzing data, also known as a 2 x 2 contingency table. This allows you to calculate the likelihood of several possible specific outcomes _given_ their base rate. When you write down the relevant numbers, you’re able to _see_ the probabilities, which allows you to rely on calculations rather than incorrect hunches when making medical decisions—and thus allows you to make better decisions.

(Shortform note: Several reviewers criticized Levitin’s detailed description of how to calculate probabilities and make better decisions, arguing that his methods were too technical and required too much math for the average reader. Other experts recommend more accessible techniques for making better medical decisions. Notably, take your time: Oftentimes, you feel pressured to make a decision quickly since you have limited time with your doctor, not because you need the medical decision right away. The more time you can give yourself to make the decision, the better you’re able to rationally evaluate the pros and cons and the less likely you’ll give into impulse.)

However, Levitin clarifies that you should _not_ rely exclusively on your own calculations when making medical decisions. An experienced doctor is often able to seemingly intuit accurate diagnoses and offer good treatment—not because she’s guessing but because she’s recognizing something with which she’s familiar. She’s spent years looking at similar cases, so she has far more experiential data regarding how likely a particular outcome is, and she’s intuitively able to compare your symptoms to her experience to generate a diagnosis and treatment. For example, if she’s seen 2,000 cases of cancer, and 80% of people with a medical history like yours responded well to a particular treatment, she’ll likely recommend that treatment to you, too.

(Shortform note: How can you ensure that your doctor has enough experience in your medical condition to be _able_ to pattern match effectively? Experts recommend that you ignore their official credentials (like what school they attended) and simply ask them how many similar cases they’ve seen or ask other hospital staff about the doctor: If other staff don’t like your doctor, you should switch. If you need a different person to treat you, look for doctors who teach other doctors (known as fellowship directors); you’ll find several at a teaching hospital.)

#### How to Avoid the Pitfalls of Externalized Information

Although Levitin focuses primarily on the benefits of externalizing information, he warns that externalized information can also have pitfalls. Levitin considers the internet to be a mostly useful external depository of information. However, he warns that the _existence_ of a source doesn’t guarantee its accuracy. Therefore, to ensure that externalizing information _helps_ rather than harms you, develop the ability to evaluate that information well.

First, Levitin suggests that you learn to **critically evaluate your sources.** Pay attention to the legitimacy of the source and whether they might have an ulterior motive; for example, a water filtration company’s article about the dangers of unfiltered water may not be totally reliable. And remember that even legitimate sources—like major newspapers—still tend to have some bias; for example, a journalist may choose not to report on a story that would damage the newspaper’s owner. Be especially careful during breaking news events: During such events, we often rely on the word of citizen journalists, who usually aren’t as careful about verifying information before sharing it.

(Shortform note: If you’re struggling to find good sources about a particular topic on the internet, consider visiting your local library and speaking to the reference librarian. A good reference librarian can point you to both internet _and_ non-internet sources you may not otherwise have access to, whether that’s a book in the library catalog or a paid academic database. She is professionally trained to evaluate a source’s legitimacy. If she’s familiar with a particular source, she may even be able to tell you what biases this source may have. And while you should be wary of the accuracy of citizen journalists, don’t totally discount them: If you’re interested in hyperlocal breaking news, they may be the only people covering it online.)

Second, Levitin suggests that you learn to **critically evaluate data**. In particular, Levitin warns against confusing causation and correlation. When A and B happen together, we tend to believe that A caused B, but they may simply be related by chance. Alternatively, there may be some _other_ factor C that caused both A and B (or is correlated with A and caused B). For example, if trees live longer in neighborhoods with worse roads, you may suspect that something about damaging paved roads improves tree health. But in reality, it may be that these neighborhoods simply can’t afford to do any maintenance—so they don’t fix their roads and don’t alter the trees.

> **Understanding the Relationship Between Two Variables**
> 
> How can you tell whether two variables are merely correlated __ or may have a causal relationship? This usually requires further research. In _Naked Statistics_ , Charles Wheelan explains that statisticians often decide their next step based on a value called the correlation coefficient, which communicates the strength of the relationship between two variables: A coefficient of one means a “perfect correlation” while a coefficient of zero means “no meaningful relationship.” For example, if researchers investigating lead poisoning find a correlation coefficient of 0.8 between the amount of city water people drank and lead levels in their blood, these findings wouldn’t prove that city water is causing lead poisoning—but it would warrant investigating the city’s water quality.

### How to Organize Your Things

In the previous section, we discussed how to externalize and sort information to make various mental processes easier. Similarly, Levitin suggests that you use the power of externalization and sorting to track your things—and thus free up more mental energy to focus on other tasks and make better decisions. In this section, we’ll first discuss how your brain keeps track of your stuff. Then, we’ll discuss how to work with your biology to better organize your things—and how to plan against potential issues.

Levitin suggests that, when thinking about how to keep track of your stuff, there is a neurological trait—in addition to your brain’s tendency to sort—that you should keep in mind: **You are great at remembering _where_ things are**. This is because you have an entire brain region devoted to doing so: your hippocampus, which evolved to remember where important things (like the nearest source of fresh water) were in a pre-map era.

(Shortform note: In _Moonwalking with Einstein_ , Joshua Foer argues that your brain is also good at remembering images due to ancient evolutionary needs: Back when our memory evolved, the most important things to remember were the routes between food and home (which your hippocampus takes care of) and which vegetation was edible (which depended on your ability to remember what it looked like). So if you need to remember an abstract concept, you should turn it into a creative image—ideally something you’ve never seen before since you’re less likely to remember a specific instance of something you’ve already seen. For example, if you need to remember to charge your phone, imagine your phone and charger having a silly conversation.)

So how can you work with your biology to organize your physical objects? Levitin names two strategies.

**1) Designate a place for everything.** Thanks to your fantastic spatial memory, you’re more likely to lose things that move rather than things that don’t; for example, you likely often lose your phone but never the clock on your bedside table. When designating these spaces, take advantage of categories: You don’t need to know where every fork you own is as long as you know where all the silverware is. And if you own things that move regularly, either buy duplicates (if that’s feasible) or assign them a place to live. For example, if you regularly carry your laptop around your house, always return it to your desk when you stop using it.

(Shortform note: Designating a place for everything is particularly important if you have ADHD, as you may be especially prone to putting down items without paying attention—which makes you more likely to lose them. Experts recommend establishing a habit of walking through your home each evening to pick up stray items and return them to where they officially live. You might also consider using gadgets to keep track of things that move regularly; for example, if you put a Tile on your keys, you can make it ring using an app to help you find your keys if you lose them.)

If you have no idea where to put something, or you’re just not sure where it goes yet, Levitin suggests**having a junk drawer** or a miscellaneous file. You’ll inevitably encounter things you don’t know what to do with and that don’t warrant a single place; for example, you probably don’t want to designate an entire drawer just for matches. Placing these items in a junk drawer will save you time and energy as you build your organized system.

(Shortform note: Remember that your junk drawer still needs to be somewhat organized. It should be a last resort for small items you’re not sure what to do with, not a chaotic mess of trash (like old take-out menus) and things that __ actually belong somewhere else (like pens). Organization experts recommend purchasing drawer dividers so that you can easily see what’s in your junk drawer.)

**2) Adjust the environment so that it reminds you what to do**. This can be built into the organization system you select; for example, you might purchase a silverware organizer that’s labeled with a picture on each slot that denotes which utensils go there.

Alternatively, you can temporarily _change_ the environment based on your needs—which will help you remember where something is because your attentional filter will pick up on it. For example, if you want to remember to send a letter, put it in front of the coffeemaker so that you’ll see it in the morning. However, remember that this only works because it’s _unusual_ ; if your mail usually lives by the coffeemaker, or if you forget to take the mail out and leave it there for a week, you’ll stop noticing it because your attentional filter will get used to it and thus ignore it.

(Shortform note: Changing the environment so that it reminds you what to do is a type of "signifier." In _The Design of Everyday Things, _Don Norman explains that a signifier is a product feature that advertises how to use a product—like the "push" sign on a door. If you don’t want to change the environment, you can also use technology to remind you what to do, and your attentional filter will pick up on the notification. For example, if you keep forgetting to send the letter in your car, you might set a location-based reminder so your phone reminds you to send the letter the next time you’re near the post office.)

#### How to Organize Your Digital Information

You’ve learned how to organize your _physical_ objects—but how should you deal with the _digital_ spaces in your life?

Just as with the real-life spaces, Levitin suggests that you **take advantage of your spatial memory** when organizing digital information by designating different _virtual_ spaces for specific tasks. You can do so either by purchasing separate devices or by visually altering the same device to trick your brain. For example, you could purchase one computer for work and another for personal tasks, or you could create two separate users on the same computer for your “work self” and “personal self,” and place different desktop backgrounds on each account. Then, when you need to find something (like a receipt), you’ll know where to look based on whether it was for business or pleasure.

(Shortform note: If you work from home, it’s especially important to designate different virtual spaces for your personal and business tasks—whether that’s by having separate devices or separate user accounts—and not just because doing so will help your brain know in what mode to operate. Notably, if your company owns the hardware you’re working on, they may be able to monitor (and can potentially leak) your personal activity. And even if you’re working on your personal computer, if you ever change jobs, trying to decide what work information you need to delete in a timely manner can increase your stress in an already stressful time.)

Levitin adds that if you’re using your computer to track important files, you should **sort them by type**. This allows you to easily find your file in the computer even if you don’t remember the exact file name. To sort your files, consider what higher-order group each file might fall into, then separate them into folders accordingly. Levitin recommends that you have no more than 30 files in each folder. And when creating these files and folders, think about _how_ you’ll eventually look for them to make these classifications easier. For example, if you tend to remember _when_ you did something, subdivide your “Business Receipts” folder by date; if you tend to remember _what_ you paid for, sort them by task (like “lunch receipts” or “utilities receipts”).

> **How Other Experts Recommend Sorting Your Digital Files**
> 
> Other experts agree that sorting your digital files can make your life easier, and they have several recommendations for doing so. Consider mapping out your folder structure on paper _before_ you start separating your files; that way, you won’t waste time moving files only to discover later that a different file structure works better. Decide on a naming convention to make it easier to look for these files later, like whether you’ll name your folder “lunch receipts” or “receipts - lunch.”
> 
> Although they don’t specify how many files you should have in each folder, they do recommend that you sort them in a way that minimizes overwhelm. For example, if you need to keep several years’ worth of receipts, consider storing older files in a folder labeled “Receipts Archive.”

Levitin warns that keeping digital files has one major drawback: They’re not as permanent as paper. Unless it burns or you lose it, paper lasts forever. In contrast, you might lose your digital file either because your computer breaks or because the format becomes outdated. To avoid losing these files, Levitin suggests that you **regularly back up your data** to two _separate_ drives: While one might break, it’s unlikely that both will. Be wary of using cloud storage; if the service goes out of business, you’ll lose all your files. Additionally, **track your file types.** Prior to updating your software, test your files to make sure they still work well on the new system. If they don’t, convert them into a format that does before updating.

> **How to Save Your Files**
> 
> If you’re doing work you want to last for several years, paper may be a better choice. Biographer Walter Isaacson was able to chronicle Leonardo da Vinci’s life relatively easily due to the artist’s extensive diaries, but Isaacson struggled to reconstruct Steve Jobs’s early process because many of his digital notes had been destroyed when the operating system of the computer they were stored in became obsolete.
> 
> If you prefer digital files, consider backing up your data on both the cloud and external hard drives for maximum protection and convenience: The cloud allows you to access your data from practically anywhere, while the hard drive gives you access even if you don’t have access to the internet. Don’t try to save your access to old files by not updating your software: Many software updates fix bugs that hackers exploit to gain access to your personal data.

### How to Organize Your Relationships

We’ve now discussed how to externalize and sort your _things_ , but how can you use the power of externalization to improve your relationships? In this section, we’ll explore why modern relationships can overwhelm us and how to externalize them to make them better and improve your decisions.

Levitin suggests that we struggle to keep track of and maintain fulfilling relationships with the people who matter because we know so many people. In past eras, we spent time with a limited number of people—and when our connections changed, they did so slowly and because they were no longer relevant to our lives. But in the modern world, we know way more people: Many of us live in cities where we encounter far more people than our ancestors did. We regularly change jobs and move, so our connections change at far greater speeds, which only increases the number of people we have to keep track of at any given moment. And thanks to social media, we’re able to keep track of people with whom we might otherwise have fallen out of touch.

(Shortform note: It’s possible that we're cognitively incapable of maintaining the many and ever-changing relationships we have in the modern era. Based on his examination of hunter-gatherer societies and several modern artifacts (including companies and address books), anthropologist Robin Dunbar posited that we can only have meaningful relationships with 150 people—a figure known as Dunbar’s number. Moreover, he also suggested that we can have up to 500 acquaintances and can recognize a maximum of 1,500 people. Dunbar argued that this limit is biological: The number of people we can know depends on the size of our neocortex (a brain region related to language) relative to our physical size.)

Levitin suggests dealing with the increase in social connections in two ways. First, **create a database of your connections** that includes information you’d like to remember about them—like where you met them or their spouse’s name. You might create your own database; alternatively, if you already have an external depository where you store your contacts (like your computer’s address book), just add relevant information in each entry. Second, **set an external reminder** to contact important people in your life, such as by creating a recurring weekly event to “Call Mom.”

Levitin contends that these two methods help you make better relationship-related decisions for two reasons. First, you’ll remember more information about your connections, so you’ll make better decisions about what to talk about with them. For example, if you remember that your friend’s birthday is in January, you can ask her about that when you talk to her that month. Second, you’ll contact them more regularly—which is in itself a good relationship-related decision as you’re choosing to spend more time connecting with people you care about.

(Shortform note: Like Levitin, other experts agree that noting information about your contacts and remembering more information about them can improve your relationships. Ensure that you note down this information while you still remember it; if it’s a new contact, asking how to spell their name will buy you the time you need to write down notes about them. Unlike Levitin, experts warn that even if using an external reminder increases the frequency with which you contact your loved ones, this may not necessarily improve your relationships since not everybody prioritizes frequency of contact. For example, if your long-distance friend hates talking on the phone, she may prefer that you catch up more rarely but in person.)
