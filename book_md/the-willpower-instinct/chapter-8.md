## Chapter 8: How Social Connections Influence Willpower

We think our behaviors are under our own self-control, but we're social animals, so we’re also subject to social control. No matter how independent we may think we are, we're influenced by the people around us. **Hang out with the right people and your willpower will increase;** hang out with the wrong people and you'll give in to temptation more frequently. ****

**The research:** A 2010 report from the National Bureau of Economic Research showed that one out-of-shape Air Force Academy cadet in a squadron of brand new cadets could bring down the fitness levels of the entire squadron. In other words, physical fitness is contagious—and so is the lack of it. In a much larger study, two scientists examined 32 years of health data from more than 12,000 residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. Specifically, they looked at weight gain, and what they discovered was an epidemic. Over time, obesity was spreading within families and groups of friends at an alarming rate. If your friend became obese, your risk of becoming obese increased by 171 percent.

Further analysis revealed that not just weight gain but also excessive alcohol consumption spread through social connections. But there was good news—self-control was also contagious. If a family member gave up cigarettes, their relatives had a much higher chance of doing the same.

### Our Brains Have Mirrors

Whether we like it or not, both good habits and bad habits spread within social and family circles. **Our brains have specialized cells, called mirror neurons, that keep track of what others around us do, say, think, feel, and want.** When we see someone trip and fall, we wince and “feel their pain” for a moment. It’s because our mirror neurons are creating a theater in which a trip-and-fall play is unfolding, and for a moment, we’re starring in the play. It almost seems like it’s happening to us. Mirror neurons are the basis of our empathy instinct, which makes us understand other people’s feelings.

**Our mirror neurons can respond to other’s pain and also to their emotions.** This is also why television shows utilize laugh tracks—your mirror neurons will think the show is funnier because we hear other people laughing. But this mimicry of emotions also comes into play when we see others indulging. If you watch your spouse eat a giant bowl of ice cream because he or she has had a hard day, your brain starts craving a reward, too—even if you don’t particularly like ice cream. Your brain is empathizing with the emotional craving that’s occurring in his or her brain—“I had a hard day, so I deserve to eat something delicious.”

It’s also why if you go out to lunch with a friend who orders a glass of wine, you’re more likely to order a glass of wine, too—even if your willpower goal is no alcohol before 6 p.m.

**The research:** Studies have examined what happens in a smoker’s brain when they watch actors in movies smoke cigarettes. The regions of the brain that control hand movements actually light up—the brain is preparing the hands to pull out a cigarette and light up. Studies have also shown that gamblers will bet more money after seeing someone else win, and most of us will spend more money when shopping with others and eat more calories when eating with others.

The oddest part of this self-control epidemic is that it isn’t activity-specific. **Any time we see people behaving badly—whether it’s breaking rules, disobeying laws, or just indulging in unhealthy habits—it lowers our self-control.** If your friend cheats on their taxes, you may be more likely to cheat on your spouse. If someone paints graffiti on your street, you may be more inclined to litter.

### People You Love Exert the Most Influence

Not surprisingly, the people you know and love are bigger influences on your behavior than strangers. **Social epidemics spread most aggressively through friend and family networks**. In other words, you probably won’t “catch” a behavior from your neighbor or co-worker, but you might from a close friend or a sibling. That’s because our brains view people whom we love and cherish as not entirely separate from us. When our brains consider who we are, we include our friends and family in that picture. In a way, they’re part of our sense of self.

#### Willpower Hack: Mirror Your Own Goals, Not Someone Else’s

Since we can’t give up all of our social interactions, we must learn to dispel or at least diminish others’ influence on our behavior. Here’s one technique to help you stay focused on your goals: At the start of each day, spend a few minutes focusing on your goals. Consider the various temptations you face—especially social influences—that can dissuade you from pursuing them. Use this focusing time to become more self-aware and reinforce your resolve.

### Social Proof Theory: We’re All Lemmings

It seems reasonable that our families and close friends influence our behavior, but we should also consider how much complete strangers influence our choices. For example, do you ever look to see what movies are popular or what the bestselling books are? Do you look at customer reviews for products you’re thinking about buying?

Our brains trust the tribe of humanity—we believe that what others enjoy must be good. The theory known as “social proof” sounds a lot like what your mother used to say: “Would you jump off a bridge just because your friends did?” Indeed you might. **Humans are wired to do what others around them do.**

“Everyone else is doing it” is one of the strongest marketing messages in the world (even though most of us believe it doesn’t apply to us). We may brag about our independent thinking, but the truth is that the human social instinct is overpowering—and our brains are wired to find a way to fit in, which means doing what others do and liking what others like.

**The research:** Poll takers went door to door asking people about their energy use, and handing out door hang-tags that encouraged energy-saving activities like turning off unnecessary lights. Each door tag included a motivational message like “It’s good for the planet” or “Save money on energy bills” or “Save energy for future generations.” But the message that had the biggest impact on people’s behavior was founded in social proof: “99 percent of people in your community turned off unnecessary lights to save energy.” In other words, “everyone else is doing it” was the most influential message.

#### Willpower Hack: Use Social Proof to Your Advantage

It’s tough to be under the influence of others, but this can also help us boost our self-control. If you imagine yourself being evaluated by others—especially people you admire—you may decide to make less impulsive choices. For example, if you know your eight-year-old wants you to quit smoking, imagine his disappointed face when he catches you sneaking a cigarette in the backyard. Or imagine how proud he’ll feel when you reach your one-year no-smoking anniversary.

#### The Normalizing Influence

Most of us want to secure a spot in the tribes that matter most to us. Media statistics about American health are grim: The average adult consumes 100 pounds of sugar each year. Forty percent of Americans never exercise at all. Only 11 percent of Americans get vigorous exercise five times a week. If you’re in the other 79 percent, you may find yourself thinking something along the lines of: “It’s okay that I rarely exercise because that’s normal—I’m in a very big club.” These kinds of statistics may help you normalize or justify your behavior—even if your behavior is contrary to your goals.

**Example:** Many people overestimate the number of people who cheat on their tax returns, and this makes them more inclined to cheat on their taxes. But when they find out that the number of tax cheaters is actually very small, they are more likely to file an honest return.

### Religion’s Influence

Telling some people that God wants them to eat healthier is enough to get them swearing off corn dogs and cooking broccoli-kale casseroles. When devout Christians are asked to consider Bible passages that condemn certain behaviors or praise others (like “Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat”) and apply them to their own behaviors, they’re often motivated to change. People who consider themselves religious don’t like seeing a disconnect between God’s will and their actions.

### Self-Control Through Pride, Not Shame

In Chapter 6, we saw that feeling bad about ourselves is more likely to lead to self-sabotage than self-control. When we feel bad, our desire to make ourselves feel better _right now_ is overwhelming. Because of this, shaming ourselves for willpower failures isn’t an effective way to increase our willpower. (It usually leads to worse failures.) **But pride has the opposite effect of shame. Feeling proud of yourself actually increases your heart rate variability, a.k.a. your willpower reserve** (discussed in Chapter 2).

To make pride work for us, we have to play into our need for social approval. We must believe that others are witnessing our “good” behavior, or that we’ll have a chance to tell others about the five miles we ran or the 200 pounds we bench-pressed.

**The research:** People are much more likely to buy green, good-for-the-planet products in a brick-and-mortar store than when shopping privately online. We want the gratification of knowing other people saw us make our earth-friendly purchases. It helps us to feel good about ourselves.

### Support Your Tribe

By now it should be clear that if you want help with your willpower challenge, you should look around at your tribe—what they do or don’t do will affect your chances of success. It’s also important to remember that **you’re involved in other people’s willpower challenges—and your behavior can help them or hurt them.** Willpower failures are often impossible to hide—think of bankruptcy, obesity, or addiction—and they often have a stigma attached. Sometimes people with these problems are socially rejected, and that only further decreases their willpower.

You’ve probably heard the quote: “If shame worked, there would be no fat people.” **The best thing you can do for others who are struggling with willpower issues is offer your full support.** Just checking in and encouraging each other can make a big difference in someone’s life.
