## Exercise: Pay Attention to Daily Stress

Science informs us that stress depletes our self-control. Stress also blinds us. When we’re stressed, we become distracted and stop attending closely to the choices we’re making. Pay attention to any stressing situations that come up in the next day or two and see what you can learn.

* * *

Make a list of three situations or times when you felt worried, overworked, tired, angry, lonely, hungry, or distracted.

In any of these situations, did you need or want to exercise willpower? If so, did your willpower feel depleted or diminished?

When that stressful situation occurred, did you give in to a craving or impulse, or did you maintain your self-control? Describe your actions as they relate to willpower or lack of it.
