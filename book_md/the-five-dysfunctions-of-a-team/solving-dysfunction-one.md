## Solving Dysfunction One: Building Trust

Now that we’ve identified the dysfunctions and examined their causes and effects, we can work through some strategies for overcoming them.

The overall goal is to build a healthy environment where all five dysfunctions are solved. **Picture this high-functioning team:**

  * They trust one another and are comfortable sharing weaknesses and knowing other people have their best interests at heart.
  * Given this trust, they have healthy conflict and discussions to arrive at the best ideas.
  * Given that everyone feels heard, they confidently commit to the final plan.
  * Given the commitment to the plan and clear responsibilities, they hold each other accountable for executing the plan.
  * Given the accountability, they pull together as a team, rather than focusing on individual outcomes.



This needs to be approached from the ground up, starting with the first dysfunction.

* * *

To review, Dysfunction 1 is an absence of trust, where people are uncomfortable being vulnerable with one another. This leads to people withholding feedback from each other, being unwilling to ask for help, and playing politics.

The general theme to fixing this is to**provide structured environments for team members to exchange feedback, without threat of retaliation**. Once team members get used to being vulnerable, they can do it freely in less structured environments.

Here are specific strategies to accomplish this:

### Sharing Personal Histories

This exercise requires teammates to answer personal questions about themselves and reveal some basic details about their lives (like how many siblings they have, where they went to school, and their hobbies). By revealing even these innocuous details to each other, teams can go a long way toward breaking down the barriers that inhibit trust. **It is easier to trust someone and be vulnerable in front of them when you see them as a complete person,** with their own unique life story, anxieties, and aspirations.

### Team Effectiveness Exercise

Here, every member of the team identifies the most important contribution _and_ the biggest area for improvement for every other member of the team. All team members share their thoughts, focusing on one person at a time, usually starting with the leader.

In a trustless environment, this could be dangerous, but the **structure of the exercise makes it safer than usual to identify weaknesses**. And on the positive side, **everyone gets to see the talent and experience of their colleagues.** This also breeds self-confidence, fosters assertiveness (since teammates can act knowing that they are respected and admired by the group), and checks egos (since everyone is laying their weaknesses on the table in front of their teammates).

### Personality and Behavior Preference Profiles

These are diagnostic tools that provide behavioral and cognitive descriptions**and insights into individual behavior**. They can be useful in identifying how people think, speak, and act. Examples include the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), Big Five Personality Test, Extroversion Introversion Test, and 16 Personalities Test.

Once you understand that someone’s psychology is wired a certain way, it becomes easier to interact with them, and see their behavior through a new lens. You can empathize with how they feel and how they behave.

These should be approached with some caution: people are far more complicated than a score on a test, and the tests shouldn’t be used as a guide for how to deal with individuals in _all_ situations. They should always be administered and the results explained by a licensed, third-party professional.

### 360-Degree Feedback

Here, teammates issue specific judgements on their peers’ performance and engage in multiple rounds of constructive criticism. It’s called 360-degree because each person receives feedback from their supervisor, colleagues, subordinates, and from themselves.

As a warning, **this should only be used as a _developmental_ tool**, separate from the formal performance evaluation process. Otherwise, politics will sneak in.

### The Leader’s Role

Leaders must demonstrate their _own_ vulnerability by being willing to lose face in front of the team. They should create an environment that does not punish vulnerability and let people take advantage of others who expose weaknesses.

Leaders should also encourage team members to admit mistakes, ask for and offer help, and reveal their shortcomings.

### Benefits

**Teams that make use of these strategies build trust and develop the ability to be vulnerable with one another**. As a result, they are able to ask for help and admit mistakes (which helps nip nascent problems in the bud), make better use of each other’s talents, and avoid personal politics. These teams look _forward_ to meetings as opportunities to learn from their colleagues.

### Example

Kathryn uses both the personal histories and the team effectiveness methods. They end up learning a lot about each other that they hadn’t known before—that Carlos is the youngest of nine kids, that JR is a twin, and that Nick had played high school basketball against Kathryn’s husband! **They also come clean about their own shortcomings** , like Jeff and his fear of failure, Nick and his arrogance, and Martin and his difficulties with emotional connection. All this helps each team member understand each other on a more human level and feel safer interacting going forward.
