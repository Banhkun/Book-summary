## Dysfunction Four: Avoidance of Accountability

Effective teams hold other accountable in order to correct problematic or counterproductive behavior and maintain consistent high standards.

Dysfunctional teams, however, are unable to call out their peers for unproductive behavior and falling below standards

**This avoidance of accountability stems from the first three dysfunctions.**

  * Lack of trust inhibits constructive pushback, since every criticism in such an environment would either be taken personally, cause interpersonal discomfort, or be met with defensiveness and retaliation.
  * Fear of conflict makes teammates unwilling to puncture the false harmony they’ve created and shy away from any controversial topics.



Lack of commitment has the most powerful effect in fostering avoidance of accountability. Without clarity and buy-in, teammates feel they have no right to call others out over team priorities that were either 1) unclear or 2) never bought into in the first place. Moreover, when a team is suffering from the indecision that defines lack of commitment, **there simply won’t _be_ any goals or priorities to which teammates can hold each other accountable.**

**Avoidance of accountability leads to low standards.** When team members know they won’t face peer pressure for shirking their responsibilities or delivering poor results, there’s less of an incentive to put in the effort to do a good job.

This, unsurprisingly, has a harmful effect on team performance. Mediocrity comes to set the standard across the organization as people realize that they won’t be criticized or reprimanded for poor results. Even those who might otherwise be motivated to achieve at a high level quickly become discouraged from doing so—after all, **why work hard when your peers are slacking off and facing no repercussions?**

In this scenario, achievement-driven individuals leave the organization, with the few high performers that remain resenting their colleagues for their poor standards and failure to adequately pull their weight. Within this vacuum of accountability, it falls to the leader to be the sole source of discipline, placing an undue burden on them and further eroding morale and group cohesion.

### Example 1

Kathryn notes that Martin has a habit of pulling his laptop out during meetings, answering emails, and engaging in other work, instead of focusing on the discussion. This is distracting, interrupts the flow of the discussion, and signals that he is not taking his commitments to the team seriously. When Kathryn reprimands him for this behavior, the rest of the team is relieved—**they had been too fearful of interpersonal discomfort to address it themselves,** and so they let the destructive and problematic behavior continue.

### Example 2

Nick does not make his team available for a meeting that Carlos has called. Not only does Nick not hold these subordinates accountable for _their_ unresponsiveness, but Carlos does not confront Nick either..**This avoidance of accountability leads to poor performance—Carlos simply _doesn’t_ hold the important meeting. **Even worse, none of the other executives think to criticize Carlos for failing to complete a task that he had committed to.
