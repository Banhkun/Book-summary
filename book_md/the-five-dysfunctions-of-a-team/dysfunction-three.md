## Dysfunction Three: Lack of Commitment

Teams need to be committed and on the same page in order to succeed. There can be no ambiguity around what goals the organization is trying to achieve, and all team members must fully buy in to the plan. **Most importantly, they must _decide_**.

Dysfunctional teams, however, fail to achieve commitment and lumber from one non-decision to the next.

This problem stems from a fear of conflict. When teammates haven’t had the opportunity to hash out disagreements through productive, ideological debate, they feel that their ideas haven’t been proper consideration. It is also harder to make any decision when alternative points of view have not been considered, because it feels there might be better options that lay undiscovered. The result is a lack of commitment: ambiguity about goals, confusion regarding individual responsibilities, and indecision.

Lack of commitment also stems from a desire for consensus and certainty.

**Consensus—universal agreement—is impossible to achieve and is actually _counter_ productive. **Striving for it will only waste valuable time and end up producing _false consensus**,**_ in which alternative points of view remain undiscussed (which also increases the possibility that flaws in the plan will go undetected).

**Certainty** —or wanting to know 100% what all the effects of any decision will be—is likewise impossible to achieve. Teams that try to achieve this end up wasting time and energy in round after round of analysis and delay. As a result teams, lose focus and confidence in their decision-making, and become unable and unwilling to commit to anything. **_A_ decision is better than _no_ decision.**

Teams that suffer from a lack of commitment squander opportunities through their indecision, fail to keep their members on the same page about priorities and results, waste time revisiting the same topics over and over again, spread confusion to subordinates within the organization, and over time, lose the ability to commit to _any_ decisions at all.

### Example 1

Kathryn shares an anecdote about her how her husband’s high school basketball coaching methods. While he is the leader and has final say on how games and practices will be run, he allows each member of the team to voice their concerns and objections to any particular plan. **He always provides an _explanation_ for why he’s making a decision—creating the conditions for buy-in and clarity.**

### Example 2

Kathryn demonstrates to the team that there is no clarity around what the overarching goal should be**** for the rest of the year. **Each member of the team believes that _their_ area of expertise is the most important** and should receive highest priority (i.e., Martin in engineering believes that it’s product improvement, Jan in finance says it’s cost containment, JR and Nick push for market share). Since they don’t trust each other and don’t resolve their disagreements through constructive debate, the result is a lack of buy-in and total ambiguity on what their priority should be. Everyone continues to work in silos, individual efforts are not harnessed to a common purpose, and the same discussions continue to take place with no resolution in sight.
