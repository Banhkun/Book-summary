## Dysfunction Five: Inattention to Results

Functioning teams are focused on achieving results. They have an ultimate mission and clear, defined objectives along the way to help them achieve that mission.

**Dysfunctional teams, however, don’t** **define their goals or establish clear, universal benchmarks for success**.

This stems directly from the fourth dysfunction: without clear decisions, defined goals, and well-articulated responsibilities for everyone, teammates will be unable and unwilling to hold their teammates accountable to high standards. In the absence of accountability, people will naturally pursue whatever is best for themselves.

If individuals know they can get away with blowing off deadlines on team projects without having their feet held to the fire by their colleagues, **individual egos will rule the roost**. This leads to the team devolving into a collection of individuals working at cross-purposes, rather than a cohesive group working together to achieve common goals.

The effects are crippling for a team. The predominance of individual egos will prevent the team from taking advantage of new opportunities or growing to meet new challenges (because **changes to the _status quo_ might impact someone’s _status_**), they will fall behind their competitors (because they haven’t even articulated how they should measure success), and they will easily lose focus as **the excessive focus on** **individual ego and status pulls the organization back and forth between competing priorities.**

### Example 1

Kathryn draws the analogy between the DecisionTech executive team and a basketball team with a roster of star players. While on paper, these teams laden with individual talent ought to crush the competition, in reality they frequently don’t. With all of the stars focused on achieving individual records, they don’t pay attention to team results. She points out that a good sports coach can focus a team on results because there is a clear and easy-to-define benchmark: the win-loss record. **The key for DecisionTech is to define what “winning” is to them.**

### Example 2

Martin becomes defensive when Jan and Carlos point out that the company may have over-committed resources to engineering, while under-investing in marketing and sales. He ultimately admits he has overstated the resources needed to build the company’s core technology because he doesn’t want DecisionTech’s potential failure to be blamed on his department— _not_ because he thought that this commitment of resources was necessarily in the company’s best interests. **He put his pride and ego before the good of the company—a textbook display of inattention to results.**
