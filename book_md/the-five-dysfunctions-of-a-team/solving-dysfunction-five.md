## Solving Dysfunction Five: Delivering Results

To recap, Dysfunction Five is inattention to results. It’s when teammates let their personal ambitions and egos get in the way of achieving team priorities. Inattention to results leads to a failure to capitalize on new opportunities, lost ground to competitors, and whipsawing back and forth between competing personal agendas.

The best way to resolve this dysfunction is to **define clear goals for the organization and articulate how _each_ individual’s work aligns with these broader goals.**

### Public Declaration of Results

Clearly express and publicize results and expectations. This brings clarity, as **everyone knows precisely which goals the organization is working toward** , and how their work fits into the overall goals.

### Results-Based Rewards

**Link rewards to the achievement of specific outcomes** , rather than vague behaviors like “working hard” and less useful metrics like hours worked.****

This provides a financial incentive to get things done for the team. Teams should be cautious about relying _too_ heavily on this approach, since it reduces motivation to a simple function of financial incentives (when, in reality, they’re far more complicated than that).

### The Leader’s Role

A leader needs to make it clear that **results, and nothing else, are the sole measurement of success**. Those who receive recognition should be those who contribute toward defined objectives. The leader needs to avoid playing favorites and rewarding anything other than results.

### Benefits

By having tangible measures of success,**teams become better able to attract and retain achievement-focused employees.** It also becomes easier and more efficient to evaluate performance. Lastly, teams that focus on results avoid the distraction and wasted energy that comes from individual team members pursuing their own agendas at the expense of the team.

### Example

The DecisionTech executive team decides (after much passionate, ideological debate) to focus on closing 18 new deals with customers as the overarching goal for the coming year. They are drawn to this goal because it is clear, ambitious (yet still achievable), addresses the main problems facing the company, will involve commitment from every member of the team, and will facilitate the achievement of future goals.
