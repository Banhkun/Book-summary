## Solving Dysfunction Three: Fostering Commitment

As a refresher, Dysfunction Three is lack of commitment. This is when teams don’t have clarity around priorities and fail to get their members to buy in to the plan. It leads to ambiguity around team and individual priorities and wasted time, energy, and opportunities due to indecision.

To solve this dysfunction, teams need to create clarity around specific responsibilities and expectations and encourage decisiveness. Below are some tools that can help teams move in this direction.

### Cascading Messaging

At the end of every meeting, review key decisions and agree on what needs to be communicated to stakeholders who were not at the meeting. Think through the messaging to each successive layer of the organization. **This reveals any points of disagreement between the team and fosters clarity about next steps.** It also**** gives clear instructions on what should be conveyed to subordinates, so that all parts of the organization are receiving the same message.

### Deadlines

Assign clear timing around project deliverables. This will reduce ambiguity, since **everyone will know when and what they are expected to deliver.** Deadlines must be rigorously enforced, both for final and intermediate decisions, so that team members can remain in sync throughout the full life cycle of a project.

### Contingency and Worst-Case Scenario Analysis

Explore alternative courses of action, while modeling for the worst possible outcome.

Doing so**encourages teams to make decisions** , since they will know that there is always a way to change course if they’re on the wrong path.

Worst-case scenario analysis demonstrates that downsides to a decision are seldom as bad as an overly cautious team might think they are. This **eliminates the need for absolute certainty before committing to a decision** and increases decisiveness.

### Low-Risk Exposure Therapy

Display decisiveness in low-risk areas before applying it to more consequential decisions. Start with decisions that have lower stakes, where the worst-case scenario is not all that bad.

Like the tactics above, **this can demonstrate how much teams underrate their own decision-making capacity.** By grabbing this low-hanging fruit, teams develop the confidence to apply their new, bold approach to _everything_.

### The Leader’s Role

A leader must be comfortable making wrong decisions. Since **more is lost to inaction than to wrong action** , leaders must reinforce the fact that consensus and absolute certainty are unattainable, and instead encourage action and decisiveness. The leader should push for decisions and sticking to deadlines once agreed upon.

### Benefits

Teams that use these tools are more decisive and clear about priorities. **They are aligned on common objectives,** able to**** learn from mistakes, confident in their ability to make decisions, and able to pivot quickly and effectively should those decisions turn out to be wrong.

### Example

Kathryn makes use of cascading messaging and deadlines with the DecisionTech team. When they finally decide on their overarching goal, she summarizes what the team has agreed to and **guides them in assigning specific responsibilities to each department for the achievement of this goal**. She also provides clarity around her expectations, telling the team that she will not accept behavior that is at odds with good teamwork practices. Furthermore,**she assigns clear deadlines** : the team will reconvene in two weeks, with the overarching goal to be achieved by the end of the year.
