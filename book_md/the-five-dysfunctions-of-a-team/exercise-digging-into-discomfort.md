## Exercise: Digging Into Discomfort

These questions will help you identify sources of discomfort and examine why you might be holding back from your colleagues.

* * *

Do you feel comfortable admitting your own weaknesses among your team? Why or why not? Describe a recent example.

Do you have a hard time quickly and genuinely apologizing to your teammates when you’ve said something hurtful or destructive? Describe a recent situation.

Do you generally find your team meetings to be boring because no one’s willing to disagree with each other? Describe a recent example.

If you have these dysfunctions, let’s think about the root issue. Do you think that an absence of trust might be at the core of these problems? Are people unwilling to show their weaknesses because they’re afraid others will use that against them? Reflect on this and how it applies to your examples above.
