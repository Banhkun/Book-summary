## Exercise: Getting Comfortable with Conflict

Think about these questions to see how you can get more comfortable with your teammates.

* * *

How much do you know about your teammates on a personal level? Do you find yourself working better with people when you know more about their lives?

What’s one conflict from the past that you hold a grudge about? How can you bring this up and resolve it, in a safe environment, with the other people involved?

How can your team build a safe, structured space for exchanging feedback and disagreeing? What’s an idea that you want to try in the next week?
