## Dysfunction One: Absence of Trust

**DecisionTech suffers from an absence of trust.**

“Trust” is an often-misused word, and tends to be used to signify predictability in someone’s behavior (as in, “I trust that you will get this done”).

When discussing interactions between members of a team however, it means something deeper. Trust is the quality of being able to feel safe and unjudged by one’s teammates. **It is the ability to be vulnerable with one another**(by being willing to admit mistakes and reveal weaknesses). The root of this is fear that exposing your weaknesses will be used against you. You don’t believe that other people have your best interests at heart.

Without trust, teams miss important opportunities and channel their energy into unproductive behavior, suppressing their true feelings. **Instead of honesty and openness, you get politics** —people acting and speaking based on how they believe they will be _perceived_ by others, not on what they _truly_ feel. Without that foundation of openness and honesty, team members become quick to attribute disagreements to malice and are more likely to hold grudges.

In such an environment, **colleagues are reluctant to ask for or _offer_ help**, because they either don’t feel comfortable being wrong, or are afraid of looking inexperienced in the eyes of their colleagues if they step outside their field of expertise.

The consequences to the organization are severe: **issues don’t get resolved,** mistakes are repeated, and **team meetings become meaningless theatrical displays**. Since such meetings achieve nothing and waste everyone’s time, colleagues dread them and look for ways to avoid spending time with one another.

Taken together, **Dysfunction One** **prevents colleagues from taking full advantage of each other’s skills.**

### Example 1

Carlos is criticized by his colleagues for being too reserved and for holding back too much during meetings.**** This stems from his unwillingness to be vulnerable in front of his colleagues, which is itself a product of the mistrustful and overly political environment at DecisionTech. Carlos is masking his true thoughts because he fears that speaking his mind will lead to sarcasm, hostility, or even outright retaliation from his teammates—so he keeps silent. Unfortunately, this keeps the vicious cycle going and only serves to further drag the team down, as everyone would actually _benefit_ more from hearing his perspective.

### Example 2

When asked her greatest strengths and weaknesses, Mikey gives highly guarded, tight-lipped responses, while other members of the team reveal some of their innermost fears and insecurities. This is a product of her inability to be vulnerable in front of her peers, as is her caustic and defensive attitude toward her colleagues, which prevents them from seeing her insecurities.
