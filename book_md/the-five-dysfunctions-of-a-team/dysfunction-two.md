## Dysfunction Two: Fear of Conflict

**Passionate, ideological conflict is necessary for teams to learn from past mistakes** , take decisive action, and tap into the full team’s talent and experience. This requires healthy conflict, but dysfunctional teams have a _fear_ of conflict.

Fear of conflict**** is a direct outgrowth of the first dysfunction, absence of trust. Without the guardrails that trust provides, **teammates will be fearful that any conflict will devolve into personal sniping and unproductive arguing—so they _avoid_ conflict altogether**. Trustful teams don’t have this problem, because _their_ conflicts are about substantive issues, not personal feelings.

Productive, ideological conflict is different from interpersonal conflict.**Ideological conflict is driven by concepts, ideas, and goals**.Teams avoid these discussions because they fear (often correctly) that they will get heated and become uncomfortable. But that’s ok! Passion, emotion, and even frustration are all natural and important parts of the process.

**What’s _not_ ok is when conflict is rooted in interpersonal politics.** This kind of ideas-free conflict achieves nothing and only leads to bitterness and resentment that lingers after the argument is over.

In an environment absent of trust and healthy conflict, **teams substitute _artificial harmony_ for productive conflict,** _pretending_ to agree with one another in order to avoid the discomfort that comes with toxic conflict. Without regular, healthy conflict, **hostilities and tensions simmer just beneath the surface** , coming out as personal attacks, sarcastic and biting remarks, and passive-aggressive undermining.

The consequences of fear of conflict are also deeply harmful for a team. **Mistakes that might have been exposed or resolved through open debate go undiscovered and unfixed** , leading to wasted time and effort as the team continues pursuing the same wrongheaded course. Since these teams also shy away from discussing controversial topics, major opportunities are squandered through inaction.

### Example 1

When Mikey refuses to accept responsibility for marketing’s role in the company’s lack of success, Carlos knows that she’s in the wrong. “If the company as a whole is struggling, then clearly we’re not succeeding on an individual level either,” he thinks to himself. However, **he does not press her on this point because he thinks she’ll snap under pressure of being called out by a colleague.** This is a wasted opportunity, and as a result, the discussion goes nowhere.
