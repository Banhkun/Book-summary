## Chapter 10: Phaedrus at the Brink

Pirsig has his recurring dream, except this time he’s more interested in the shadowy figure than Chris. He interrogates the figure; the figure seems to cower in fear as Pirsig approaches it. Suddenly Pirsig lunges for the shadow’s neck—it writhes like a snake—but just as Pirsig is about to see its face he’s awakened by Chris’s cries.

As he calms Chris down, he tells Chris he saw the figure’s face: it was his own. Pirsig realizes that the shrouded figure in the dream is him—and the dreamer, the person trying to get through the glass door to Chris, is Phaedrus. This epiphany leaves Pirsig despondent. He believes Phaedrus is trying to reassert himself in Pirsig’s mind.

Pirsig has a flashback to a winter’s day when Chris was six. Phaedrus and Chris were in the car, but Phaedrus didn’t know where they were going or where in town they were. Chris had to remind him they were going to buy a bunk bed. Eventually Chris had to get out of the car to ask people for directions. They managed to find their way home, where Chris’s mother was irate that they weren’t able to find the bunk-bed store.

Haunted by this incident, Pirsig contemplates heading to San Francisco, putting Chris on a bus home, and checking into a hospital.

When Pirsig awakes again, it’s freezing out. He puts on long underwear, then jogs to warm up. Chris is still asleep, and Pirsig lets him alone—they won’t be able to ride in the cold anyway. To kill time, Pirsig decides to tune the cycle. The tools are cold in his hands.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s End**
> 
> Given Phaedrus’s reappearance in Pirsig’s psyche, Pirsig feels obliged to complete Phaedrus’s story. (Shortform note: Pirsig doesn’t specify whether the following takes place before or after Phaedrus’s discovery of the _Tao Te Ching_.)
> 
> As Phaedrus continued to investigate Quality, a sequence of coincidences suggested to him that ancient Greek philosophy might help answer some of his questions. He also needed a Ph.D. if he wanted to continue teaching at the university level, and he was intrigued by an interdisciplinary program (a “committee”) at the University of Chicago whose faculty included a specialist in ancient Greek as well as professors of English, philosophy, and Chinese.

Pirsig wakes Chris and they hit the road. At a restaurant in La Pine, while Chris orders their breakfast, Pirsig changes the oil on the cycle. As the two settle down to eat, Chris asks why they’re riding. Pirsig says that they’re on vacation, seeing the country, but Chris doesn’t seem convinced by this response. He says they just keep riding and riding. And Pirsig doesn’t really have a good reason why.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s End (cont’d)**
> 
> Phaedrus was admitted to the University of Chicago by an assistant chairman of the committee acting on the real Chairman’s behalf. The real Chairman, however, was less impressed with Phaedrus’s accomplishments. When he asked Phaedrus what his “substantive” field was, Phaedrus had no choice but to answer “English composition.” According to the Chairman, this wasn’t a “substantive” field but a “methodological” one. The interview ended, and Phaedrus returned to Bozeman to think about Quality and substantive and methodological fields.
> 
> Substance and method, Phaedrus quickly realized, are products of classical thinking—which means that Quality, the thing he really wanted to study, couldn’t be encapsulated _either_ by a substantive _or_ a methodological field.
> 
> Frustrated by the disciplinary barriers imposed by the Chairman, Phaedrus reread the brochures about the committee to see if he’d misunderstood its mission. What he discovered, both in the descriptions of the committee and the Chairman’s own writing, was a kind of awkwardness—it seemed like the committee was guarding a secret. When Phaedrus returned to Chicago, he mentioned to the acting chairman that Aristotle had been omitted from the committee’s description. This comment elicited shock, then a guilty laugh from the assistant chairman.
> 
> What Phaedrus didn’t know at the time was that he’d raised the spectre of a conflict that had riven academia. In the Thirties, a group of four University of Chicago administrators and professors had attempted to remake their university in an Aristotelian image. Their position was that human wisdom had reached its pinnacle in ancient Greek philosophy and Thomas Aquinas’s interpretation of that philosophy. **They believed that, rather than emphasize the modern, empirical sciences, a university should place the teaching of good _values_ at its core. **These values, of course, were embodied in the writings of the ancient Greeks and Aquinas.
> 
> Although the emphasis on values pleased Phaedrus—Quality _was_ value, after all—the Aristotelian orientation of the committee didn’t. And so Phaedrus wrote a letter to the Chairman explaining that, though he’d realized his substantive subject was philosophy, his area of study—Quality—couldn’t be analyzed using the dualistic concepts of Aristotle. Phaedrus argued that Quality was both anterior and superior to any dualistic notion of the world, and he asserted (conceitedly) that his work on Quality would unite Eastern and Western philosophy and transcend Aristotle.
> 
> The Chairman, as Phaedrus expected, was unmoved, and he suggested that Phaedrus apply to the philosophy department, from which he was summarily rejected. But Phaedrus had already been admitted to the Chairman’s committee, and so he decided to matriculate despite the Chairman’s dislike of him.
> 
> Phaedrus and his family moved into an apartment near the University of Chicago, and Phaedrus, who had no scholarship, began teaching composition at the University of Illinois to finance his studies. As he immersed himself in ancient Greek thought, he became incensed—not because the Greeks were antiquated and irrelevant, but rather because he believed their writings’ influence had done untold damage to the world.
> 
> The problem originated with the pre-philosophical myths (_mythos_) that gave rise to Greek logic (_logos_). (The idea that the myths of prehistory determine the science of ancient history is called the “ _mythos_ over _logos_ ” idea.) These myths, because of the structure of Greek grammar, featured solid divisions between subject and object, and so any culture determined by these myths was defined by these same divisions. (Chinese myths, on the contrary, due to the structure of Chinese grammar, don’t feature the same rigid division.)
> 
> Thus the myths of ancient Greece, coupled with the sacred texts of the Judeo-Christian tradition—which also feature strict subject-object division—constitute Western culture’s intellectual heritage. Phaedrus was steeped in that heritage, but his discovery of Quality, which lay outside the subject-object binary, necessitated his _thinking_ outside __ the binary. The problem is, when one abandons an entire culture’s collective understanding of rationality, one becomes, by any external measure, insane.

The Pirsigs are riding through a verdant fir forest. They descend into a valley that Pirsig can’t help exclaiming over. How can he be insane, he thinks, if he can appreciate such natural beauty!

As they reach Grants Pass, Oregon, the motorcycle’s chain guard gets caught in the chain. Pirsig opts to stop for the evening and replace the part the following day, even though the trouble isn’t serious enough to keep the motorcycle from running. Pirsig checks them into a hotel, their first since Bozeman, and they’re grateful for beds, clean sheets, and a shower.

In the morning Pirsig unloads and assesses all of their gear. It’s a mess—greasy, oily, wrinkled—and Pirsig wakes Chris to help him get started on doing laundry. Pirsig tracks down the rest of the items he realizes they need—all except the chain guard, which the parts store in town doesn’t have.

Pirsig finds a welder’s shop in town and, after he and Chris have breakfast, they return to the shop with the chain guard. Although the welder is fussy—his shop is immaculate, and he complains that the guard has grease on it—he does a masterful job on the repair.

> **Chautauqua: Modern Loneliness**
> 
> At the restaurant in Grant’s Pass where Pirsig and Chris had breakfast, he noticed certain look in the waitress’s eye, and he saw the same look in the mechanic’s eye. It’s loneliness, and Pirsig has noticed more of it here, in more densely populated communities, than in the small towns of the Plains.
> 
> The easy culprit is modern technology: television, automobiles—all the isolating aspects of living in a bustling city. **But Pirsig lays the blame not on technology itself but on the objectification that comes with an ignorance of Quality**. The modern attitude all too frequently objectifies the world: everything outside of us becomes a means to an end, whether greater wealth or pleasure or convenience. **But when we start thinking about Quality—about making the people and things around us _better_ —we suddenly seem a lot less lonely**.
> 
> Let’s say you have a boring job. If you just go through the motions at work, you’ll never find your job fulfilling, and your colleagues—who may also be phoning it in—will treat you like you treat your work: as just another dull part of the job. **But if you try to find Quality in your work, whether through a new technique or just your rededication to your job’s foundational mission, that Quality will spread, building bonds and increasing the complement of Quality in world overall**.
> 
> **Pirsig believes everyday people can improve themselves and their communities simply by attending to Quality in their everyday lives: Quality emerges from individuals making Quality choices**. This, it bears noting, wasn’t Phaedrus’s position. Phaedrus believed that to cure loneliness—among many other modern ills—those schooled in Western modes of thought need an _entirely new notion of rationality_. Because of the Western intellectual heritage, Westerners all too often do what’s “reasonable” rather than what’s “good.” The solution for Phaedrus was what seems like an oxymoron in the Western tradition: a _spiritual rationality_.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s End (cont’d)**
> 
> Phaedrus’s first class in graduate school, fittingly, was rhetoric, and his first reading assignment was Aristotle’s _Rhetoric_.
> 
> Aristotle analyzed rhetoric systematically and hierarchically (much like Pirsig does motorcycle assemblies). Phaedrus was disgusted—the naming and classifying of every aspect of rhetoric omitted the necessary creative element in any piece of writing. Aristotle’s approach also, of course, suppressed any natural inclination toward Quality.
> 
> Phaedrus prepared a rebuttal to Aristotle and entered class one day ready to deliver it to his professor. But he didn’t get a chance: the professor tore apart one of his classmates when he raised an objection, and Phaedrus realized that critical thinking wasn’t welcome in the seminar.

Under rainy skies, the riders arrive in Crescent City, California. From the road they can see the ocean. This, the ocean, Pirsig tells us, was the riders’ goal. They eat at an expensive restaurant and then get back on the road, heading south.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s End (cont’d)**
> 
> After the professor’s rebuke of Phaedrus’s classmate, the classroom atmosphere in subsequent classes was tense. No one spoke but the professor; and the professor was on edge himself, because he knew he would get no courtesy from his students if he were to make a mistake.
> 
> What made the professor especially edgy was the topic of “dialectic.” Phaedrus had encountered the word in Aristotle’s _Rhetoric_ and been mystified by it, and when a student asked for it to be defined, the professor cast a fearful glance at Phaedrus. Phaedrus’s interest was piqued.
> 
> _Dialectic_ at its most basic level is a conversation—a dialogue—that works its way toward a truth. Plato’s dialogues, in which he records Socrates’s conversations, are a clear example of dialectic in action.
> 
> Plato, channeling Socrates, believed that dialectic was the _only_ way to reach truth. Aristotle, however, thought dialectic produced only one _kind_ of truth.
> 
> In his philosophical system, Aristotle differentiated between _forms_ , which are the metaphysical and eternal facts of reality, and _substances_ , which are the physical and changeable facts of reality. Whereas Aristotle acknowledged that dialectic was a suitable means to discovering the truth of _forms_ , he believed that science, or observation, was the only way to discover the truth of _substances_. Plato argued that dialectic could arrive at the truth about both.
> 
> As luck would have it, Plato was the next thinker on the Phaedrus’s syllabus. But as Phaedrus delved into Plato’s dialogue _Gorgias_ , which finds Socrates making mincemeat of the practice of rhetoric, Phaedrus became as disenchanted with Plato as he was with Aristotle. He couldn’t accept a thinker who thought so little of rhetoric, the field which had led him to Quality.
> 
> After a traumatic class on _Gorgias_ , during which Phaedrus engaged in an internal dialectic that led him to question his own deepest motives and philosophical positions, he immersed himself in the thinkers who practiced the rhetoric Plato so hated: the Sophists. His hunch was that Plato had treated the Sophists unfairly.
> 
> What he discovered was that Plato’s antagonism to the Sophists had its origins in the thought of the earliest Greek philosophers (the “presocratics”). These philosophers first proposed the divisions—form/substance, mind/matter, subject/object—that both Plato and Aristotle took for granted. The presocratics believed that there was an “Immortal Principle”—a singular truth—underlying the world around us, and it was philosophy’s duty to uncover that truth. (Shortform note: Given what follows, it’s clear that Pirsig dismisses the possibility that the Immortal Principle could be Quality.)
> 
> But thinking and speaking at the same time as these philosophers were the Sophists, a group of teachers and rhetoricians, who believed that there _was no Immortal Principle_. **They argued instead that _truths are made by people and are thus relative_ —that there is no truth independent of people’s opinions of what’s true. **Given that he believed that every question had only one true answer, Plato _had_ to oppose them.
> 
> Phaedrus saw in the Sophists kindred spirits: **Not only were they rhetoricians like he, but they also recognized the importance of the individual in creating the world we live in.** They didn’t search for a truth behind appearances; rather, they sought to improve the lives of men through recognition of the Good—that is, Quality.
> 
> There was one aspect of the Sophists’ thought that Phaedrus couldn’t reconcile, however: the notion of “virtue.” How can one teach virtue when values are constantly in flux?
> 
> He found his answer in an analysis of ancient Greeks’ conception of heroism, included in a book by H.D.F. Kitto called _The Greeks_. Kitto writes that Greek heroes performed heroic deeds not out of duty to others, but out of duty to themselves: they were in pursuit of _aretê_ , which translates as “excellence.” **For the Greeks, excellence meant broad physical and intellectual accomplishment—well-roundedness rather than specialization.**
> 
> The lightbulb went on in Phaedrus’s head. _Aretê_ was Quality! And it had been present in the Western world all along.
