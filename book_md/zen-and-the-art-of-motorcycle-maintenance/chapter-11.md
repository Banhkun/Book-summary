## Chapter 11: The Travelers Arrive

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s End (cont’d)**
> 
> Phaedrus returned to his study of Plato and Aristotle with renewed interest. He now wondered why Plato had spurned the Sophists and their teaching of _aretê_. But it turned out Plato _hadn’t_ done away with _aretê_ , or at least not completely. What he’d done was transmute it into an entity called the “Good,” which Plato considered the highest goal of human life except for Truth. The problem with Plato’s “Good” was that it was eternal and unchangeable—exactly the opposite of the Sophists’ _aretê_ , which adapted to people’s beliefs and historical contexts.
> 
> Phaedrus guessed that Plato reinterpreted _aretê_ to keep immutable Truth at the top of his hierarchical system. Because, if for every question there is but one true answer, then there must be only one true definition of _aretê_.
> 
> This demotion of _aretê_ in favor of Truth left the door open for a philosopher like Aristotle, who sidelined _aretê_ even more in favor of the kind of scientific inquiry, based on empirical observation, that we would find familiar today. In Aristotle’s system, which formed the basis of not only the University of Chicago’s educational approach but also most American universities’, science and logic become the gold standard of knowledge, and the Good is relegated to the subfield of philosophy known as ethics.
> 
> (Shortform note: Pirsig’s characterization here of Plato and Aristotle’s influence on university education differs significantly from the one he offers earlier, when he discusses the Aristotelian revolution that overtook the University of Chicago some years before he enrolled.)

After a miserable drive through the dark and rain, the riders arrive in Arcata. They stop for a bite to eat, then hit the road again. Pirsig wants to get within a day’s ride of San Francisco before they pack it in for the day.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s End (cont’d)**
> 
> Phaedrus had little opportunity to share his new findings in the near term—his rhetoric seminar was cancelled several weeks in a row due to the professor being ill. Despite the cancelled classes, the students had been assigned a new dialogue: Plato’s _Phaedrus_.
> 
> The title meant nothing to Phaedrus at the time, since he wasn’t known by that name then. And the dialogue itself didn’t do much for him: Plato had clearly depicted Phaedrus in such a way as to make Socrates look exceptional by comparison. Nevertheless, there were aspects of the text that Phaedrus enjoyed, including Phaedrus’s personality. _Phaedrus_ , in Greek, means “wolf,” and the Phaedrus of the dialogue is an excitable and aggressive loner.
> 
> On the fourth week after Phaedrus discovered the Sophists, his rhetoric class was finally held—but with the Chairman of the committee as the professor. It was clear to Phaedrus that the Chairman was there to berate him for his philosophical positions and embarrass him.
> 
> Because the Chairman already knew _Phaedrus_(the dialogue), he opened the discussion by asking the class questions to see if they’d understood Plato’s message. The class, including Phaedrus, failed to satisfy him, so he began to lecture on Plato’s true meaning himself.
> 
> But when the Chairman got to a certain part of the dialogue, Phaedrus recognized that he was skirting a vital issue. Phaedrus raised his hand to object, knowing that by challenging the Chairman he was asking to be expelled. Phaedrus made his point and was obviously correct. The Chairman was stunned into silence.
> 
> Eventually the Chairman recovered and pressed on, but later in the class Phaedrus ambushed him again and was correct again.
> 
> After the class, walking home, Phaedrus was buoyant. Fancying himself a kind of intellectual wolf, he embraced the name Phaedrus. He’d come to the realization that his notion of Quality would never be accepted at the University of Chicago, and he would have to pursue it without the help of committee’s faculty.
> 
> Phaedrus’s teaching at the time, unlike his coursework, was going exceptionally. His students at the University of Illinois were intrigued by him; he’d grown a beard and appeared to them as a mountain man from Montana, talking about a strange thing called Quality. But then something happened: One day he fell completely silent and sat at the front of his classes without saying a word. In the following days he roamed the streets, having barely slept, his mind a whirl. He feared that by engaging in all the intellectual sparring with the faculty of the committee, he’d inadvertently begun to _define_ Quality, when, for it to maintain its significance, it had to remain _undefined_.
> 
> Eventually Phaedrus confined himself to a bedroom in his apartment. He told his wife he wanted to separate and spent days on end sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at the wall. During this time, he allowed cigarettes to burn down to his fingers and he urinated on the floor. When his wife discovered these symptoms, she called for help. But it was too late: Phaedrus’s consciousness had completely disintegrated.

It’s pitch black out, and the rain is coming down hard; the cycle’s headlight barely reaches the road. Pirsig regrets having ridden on from Arcata. They pull off the freeway onto a dangerous gravel road, and Pirsig has to slow down to keep them upright. They come upon a gas station and use its phone to make a motel reservation.

The room is depressing, but it’s dry and warm. Pirsig and Chris sit in front of the heater, and Chris asks when they’re going home. He’s upset that all they do is ride around without a clear destination. He says that he liked being with Pirsig more when he was little. Soon, he’s crying and rocking back and forth in a way that concerns Pirsig—it reminds him of something he saw in the hospital when he was Phaedrus.

Later, when they’re in their beds, Pirsig asks Chris if things were better when they were in Chicago. Chris replies that they were, that Pirsig used to play games with him. It becomes clear to Pirsig that Chris has mistaken Phaedrus’s mental decline: Chris thinks Phaedrus was just _pretending_ to be confused. Chris keeps saying Pirsig doesn’t _do_ anything anymore.

In the morning Pirsig is up first. Chris is in a terrible mood—surly and silent. After breakfast, they ride into a heavy fog and the temperature drops, and when the fog lifts, they’re on a cliff and can see the ocean. They pull over to put on warm-weather gear. As Pirsig gets into his jacket, he sees Chris get much too close to the cliff’s edge. When he yells, Chris doesn’t answer. He rushes over and pulls Chris back by his shirt.

Then Chris refuses to put on his layers. Pirsig tries to wait him out. Eventually Chris says he wants to “go back.” Pirsig explains it’s too far, but Chris persists, causing Pirsig to lose his temper. Chris relents and they continue riding south. **Pirsig admits that, for all the suggestions he’s made to eliminate the division between subject and object, he hasn’t confronted the division between him and his son**.

The riders reach Mendocino County. The surroundings are lush and open. The road descends from a cliff to a beach, where Pirsig pulls over to rest. Chris wants to press on—he’s still upset from the morning—but Pirsig ignores him and explores the beach. **Back on the cycle, Pirsig realizes that Chris is like Phaedrus—full of questions, stubborn, itching for a fight**.

They arrive in a town that’s covered in haze, giving everything a nostalgic aura. They go to a restaurant, but Chris says he isn’t hungry—his stomach hurts. Pirsig proceeds to order lunch for himself and eat; presently he realizes Chris is crying. Chris says he’s sorry he came on the trip, that it isn’t fun and he hates everything. It’s then that Pirsig confesses to Chris that he’s been thinking of putting him on a bus home once they get to San Francisco.

To Pirsig’s surprise, Chris gets even more upset. He doesn’t want to stay with any of the people Pirsig names—Pirsig reveals that guests are currently staying at their house—and breaks down in tears again. Pirsig suggests they go for a walk. They end up back on the cycle, looking for a peaceful place to chat. The road takes them to an ocean overlook, but, at the moment, fog obscures the water.

They sit, and Pirsig confesses to Chris that he was once insane and is moving in that direction again. He says that he’s sending Chris home because he’s not sure he can take care of him anymore. He also tells Chris that the doctors fear Chris may also be troubled—that his stomach aches are psychosomatic, and that his misbehavior at home has worried all of the authority figures around him except Pirsig. In response to this, Chris lets out a terrible wail and falls to the ground in the fetal position. Pirsig screams at him to get up, but he won’t listen.

And then, suddenly, he does listen. A voice—Phaedrus’s—has spoken through Pirsig and told Chris that he hasn’t forgotten him and that they’ll be together now. Chris sits up and allows Pirsig to put his jacket around him. Through Chris’s questions, it’s revealed that Pirsig’s recurring dream with the glass door actually happened—the glass door was in the hospital, and it was, in fact, the last time Phaedrus saw his family before his personality was erased.

The fog lifts, and the riders put on their helmets to mount the cycle. Chris, who’s starting to come around, asks Pirsig if he really was insane. Pirsig/Phaedrus denies it, and Chris says he knew it all along.

They ride along the coast, the landscape full of flowers and the air perfumed. Pirsig begins to feel sleepy and stops at a turnoff with a picnic table. They take a nap, and when they wake, they stow their jackets and helmets and ride without them. As they bank into the road’s turns, Chris stands on the foot pegs behind Pirsig. He exclaims at the beauty of their surroundings; he says that before he wasn’t able to see over Pirsig’s shoulders.

Then he asks if he can get a motorcycle when he grows up. Pirsig consents, but only if Chris agrees to take care of it. When Chris asks if it’s hard to maintain a motorcycle, Pirsig replies that, whereas repairing the motorcycle isn’t so hard, having the right attitudes is. When Chris asks whether he’ll have the right attitudes when he grows up, Pirsig tells him he has no doubt he will.
