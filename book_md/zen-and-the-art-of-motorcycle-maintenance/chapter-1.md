## Chapter 1: The Journey Begins

The book opens in the height of summer with Pirsig on his motorcycle, his son, Chris, seated behind him. They’re riding from Minneapolis to Montana alongside Pirsig’s friends, John and Sylvia Sutherland; when we join the travelers, they’re on a two-lane road somewhere in western Minnesota. Pirsig catches sight of a red-winged blackbird taking flight and points it out enthusiastically to Chris, but Chris, who’s 11, isn’t very impressed. Pirsig theorizes that the reason he’s so taken with the surroundings is because they’re bound up with his memories, memories Chris doesn’t have.

> **Chautauqua: Motorcycle > Car**
> 
> Pirsig follows a description of his memories—of the sights, sounds, and smells of the cold Midwest mornings of his past—with a riff on the superiority of motorcycling to car driving.
> 
>   * In a car, we see the world through the frame of the windows. We’re sealed off from the scene around us, and we watch the passing signs much like we watch TV: passively, comfortably, disinterestedly.
> 
>   * On a motorcycle, however, we are _in_ the scene: the road in all its solidity rushes by just a foot beneath us; the wind whips us; the sound of the engine is loud in our ears. Whereas riding in a car separates us from the world, traveling on a motorcycle is **holistic** —it places us in immediate contact with the world.
> 
> 


> **Chautauqua: Making _Good_ Time vs. Making Good _Time_**
> 
> Although the final destination is Montana, Pirsig tells us that he and his compatriots are traveling more or less for travel’s sake. Thus, rather than ride on freeways, they try whenever possible to stay on local roads. Pirsig calls this **making _good_ time**—that is, relishing the experience of traveling no matter how long the journey takes (as opposed to making good _time_ —that is, reaching your destination as quickly as possible). The difference in emphasis—on the _quality_ of the time spent rather than its _quantity_ —is what Pirsig wants to highlight.

> **Chautauqua: Why Chautauqua?**
> 
> Pirsig chooses to call his ruminations in the book a **Chautauqua** , which refers to a traveling tent show popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that featured an array of speakers and exhibits. Not only does this reference call to mind a bygone era, when knowledge circulated more slowly and deliberately (_see_ “ _Chautauqua: Making_ Good _Time vs. Making Good_ Time”), it also highlights the fact that Pirsig’s narrative has moral as well as entertainment value.
> 
> Shortform note: Pirsig uses the term “Chautauqua” in two distinct senses throughout the book. Sometimes he uses it as a catchall term for his philosophical project—in other words, he considers all his discourses combined a “Chautauqua”—and other times he uses it to denote specific discourses on specific topics. To keep consistent, we’ve decided to use the term in the latter sense. When we refer to more than one discourse, we use the plural: Chautauquas.

The group pulls over at a rest stop to stretch their legs, and Sylvia, recalling the cars they’d passed going in the opposite direction, comments on how sad their drivers looked; she even compares the stream of cars to a funeral procession. Pirsig replies they were just normal people on their way to work on a Monday morning.

The conversation then turns to the natural wonders Pirsig was picking out as they rode, the blackbirds in particular. John returns from pumping water and begins rummaging through the saddlebags attached to his motorcycle. Removing a random assortment of objects—rope, matches, shoelaces—he’s exasperated at how much they’ve packed and wonders aloud if they’ll ever actually need shoelaces. Pirsig deadpans that shoelaces can break at any time. The group saddles up and rides off.

> **Chautauqua: The Sutherlands and Technology**
> 
> On the road again, Pirsig reveals that John and Sylvia are having some issues in their marriage, and that this “disharmony” is the impetus for Pirsig’s Chautauquas. Though Pirsig doesn’t know exactly what’s eating them, his theory is that their troubles have something to do with **their difficult relationship to technology**. Pirsig uses several examples to illustrate this troubled relationship:
> 
> *** Whereas Pirsig believes that a motorcyclist should be prepared to fix his or her motorcycle on the fly, John believes that repairs should be left to a professional mechanic**. This position has gotten John into some messes on past rides: Pirsig relates an anecdote wherein John’s motorcycle refuses to start twice (for reasons relatively obvious to Pirsig), leading John to fits of frustration.
> 
>   * When a faucet begins dripping at the Sutherlands’ house, John makes a cursory stab at fixing it, then just lets it drip. On a day when Pirsig is over, Sylvia, who speaks softly, is trying to make herself heard over the dripping when her kids enter noisily. She blows up at the kids for interrupting her but doesn’t acknowledge that her anger was primed by the dripping.
> 
>   * The Sutherlands often talk about how there’s no escape from “it,” “it all,” “the whole organized bit,” and “the system.” Pirsig realizes that the Sutherlands are referring to a kind of dark force that gives rise to, and is epitomized by, technology. To the Sutherlands, this force is monstrous and unintelligible—inhuman.
> 
> 

> 
> Of course, the Sutherlands aren’t alone in resisting technology—at the time _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_ was being written, an anti-technological movement, embodied by so-called “beatniks” and “hippies,” was well established. (Shortform note: Though Pirsig dubs the Sutherlands’ nemesis “technology,” it overlaps with counterculture enemies like “mass culture,” “materialism,” and “conformism.”)
> 
> Pirsig, however, though he feels sympathy with the Sutherlands’ position, is neither intimidated by nor fearful of technology. This is because the spiritual entities that hippies praise—the Buddha, for example—when understood correctly, are as present in a complex machine as they are in the natural world.

As the travelers continue on their journey, crossing from the tree-populated Central Plains to the grasslands of the Great Plains, Pirsig begins to feel a sense of apprehension about the road they’re on, though he’s unsure why. Remarking its flatness, Pirsig recalls a discussion he and the Sutherlands had before setting off on the trip. John was worried that Sylvia wouldn’t be able to handle the monotony of Great Plains travel and suggested Sylvia fly to Billings and meet them, but Sylvia and Pirsig convinced John she would be fine.

> **Chautauqua: Discomfort Is Relative**
> 
> Pirsig’s argument for Sylvia’s joining them is that discomfort matters “only when the mood is wrong.” That is, if you’re already out of sorts—perhaps because you don’t want to be traveling—then discomfort assumes outsize importance. **But if you’re happy to be traveling, whether because of the scenery or the company, then discomfort doesn’t bother so much**.

Presently Pirsig spots a storm on the horizon. If it’s a cold front, the storm will be intense but short; if it’s a warm front, the bad weather could last for days.

> **Chautauqua: Be Careful of Assumptions**
> 
> Pirsig recalls a past motorcycle trip—to Canada—with Chris when they endured a warm front. After a soggy night, during which water leaked into their tent and soaked their sleeping bags, they get caught in a particularly dangerous storm. With lightning striking around them, their motorcycle suddenly stops working. They sputter into a gas station, and Pirsig tries to diagnose the problem (at the time, he was like John—ignorant of motorcycle maintenance). He sees gas sloshing around, checks the engine parts—all looks good—but the motorcycle still won’t run. Eventually he’s forced to abandon the trip, much to Chris’s disappointment. Two weeks later, Pirsig has another look at the motorcycle to figure out what went wrong. He discovers the tank was out of gas—the sloshing he heard was the _reserve_ tank, which he’d never turned on. He still kicks himself for this oversight.

John signs for Pirsig to stop and informs him that they’ve missed their turn. Rather than double back, they decide to press on. Once they’re back on the road, Pirsig’s anxiety ratchets up—he doesn’t know how he missed the turn, and he’s also forgotten to tell John and Sylvia about the storm. In preparation for what’s on the horizon—literally—Pirsig checks his motorcycle’s engine temperature with his hand.

> **Chautauqua: Care for What You Do**
> 
> Pirsig’s motorcycle, which is air-cooled, has a history of “seizing”—this is when the pistons expand from too much heat and lock the engine, sending the cycle into a skid. He reveals that the cycle he’s riding has seized three times before.
> 
> The first time the cycle seized, he brought it to a mechanic, thinking (at the time) that it wasn’t worth the investment and effort to learn what was wrong and repair it himself. The shop, in which a radio was playing loudly, was staffed by young men who seemed more interested in socializing with each other than paying attention to Pirsig. Finally a mechanic noticed him and took a look at Pirsig’s cycle. After only the most cursory analysis, he diagnosed the problem as the cycle’s tappets (which Pirsig knew was wrong).
> 
> Two weeks later Pirsig pays their hefty bill and has his cycle back. On his first ride it seizes again. When he brings it back to the mechanic, they accuse him of not wearing it in properly. The mechanics take the cycle back, fix it, and wear it in themselves. It seizes on _them_ this time.
> 
> The mechanics decide to replace many of the core components of the engine, and when Pirsig returns to pick the cycle up, it’s covered in grease and doesn’t start. Pirsig discovers the plugs are disconnected; he connects them and now the tappets _are_ making noise. When Pirsig points this out, a mechanic comes over and proceeds to ruin the tappet covers. Then, as the mechanic tries to remove the ruined tappet covers with a hammer and chisel, he further damages the engine. Finally Pirsig has had enough: “Just stop,” he says, and takes the bike as is.
> 
> On the road, the cycle vibrates violently at speeds over 20 mph. Pirsig pulls over and discovers that the mechanics had forgotten to bolt the engine in completely. It was attached by only one bolt.
> 
> A few weeks later he discovers what was causing the engine to seize: a sheared pin in the cycle’s oil-delivery system. The shear, Pirsig notes, was _also_ caused by a mechanic, one that worked on the cycle before he bought it.
> 
> Why did the young mechanics butcher Pirsig’s motorcycle? Pirsig has three theses:
> 
>   * _The radio_. You can’t do thoughtful work while you’re listening to the radio. You can turn wrenches with the radio on, but you can’t think deeply about what you’re doing.
> 
>   * _The speed_. The mechanics were working too quickly. More customers means more money, so they were doing slapdash work on Pirsig’s cycle to make room for the next repair.
> 
>   * _The (spectator) attitude_. The mechanics were friendly, relaxed, cheerful—and entirely uninvested in what they were doing. **They didn’t _identify_ with their work, they just _did_ it**. Pirsig, who edits technical manuals for a living, sees the same thing in the texts he corrects—a kind of carelessness. Pirsig calls this approach to one’s work **the spectator attitude**. When we perceive our work like it’s alien to us, like it’s an entity isolated in time and space from ourselves and others, we can’t help but treat it superficially. Pirsig aims to explore the sources of the spectator attitude in his ruminations throughout his trip.

The travelers are in the Red River Valley, not far from the Dakotas, when the storm reaches them. They’ve already decided to ride until they can’t anymore, and Pirsig signals to John that they had better get a move on. He and John press the throttle on their cycles, accelerating up to almost 100 mph, as it gets dark from the storm clouds. Suddenly there’s a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder, then another, and Pirsig realizes “he” has been on this road before. Pirsig begins slowing down, even as Chris urges him to speed up and the Sutherlands disappear into the distance. Eventually Pirsig and Chris arrive at the town Pirsig says, somehow, he knew would be there.

Pirsig and Chris reconvene with the Sutherlands under a tree at the outskirts of town. John reports there’s a motel at the other end of town, but Pirsig directs them to a “better” one. When they arrive, John sees that it is indeed superior to the motel he’d suggested and asks Pirsig when he was last in the town. Pirsig says he doesn’t remember. Sylvia, who has been watching Pirsig closely, comments that Pirsig looks like he’s seen a ghost.

The group waits out the rain in their rooms. Once it stops, they venture into town for supper, then gather in the motel courtyard to drink whiskey and decompress. Chris, who’s bored, suggests they tell ghost stories. He starts the group off with some stories he’s learned at camp, and when he’s finished, he asks if Pirsig knows some. Pirsig says he doesn’t remember any. Chris then asks if Pirsig believes in ghosts.

> **Chautauqua: Mind vs. Reality**
> 
> Chris’s question prompts Pirsig to extemporize on the nature of reality. Because ghosts are immaterial—they contain neither energy nor matter—they only exist in people’s minds (at least according to the laws of science). But, Pirsig points out, the laws of science too are immaterial—they contain no energy or matter and only exist in human minds as well. Thus Pirsig concludes that one should believe in neither ghosts nor the laws of science.
> 
> Unsurprisingly, this conclusion causes some confusion among the group. Chris says a friend of his at camp believes in ghosts. When the adults ask about his friend, he indicates that his friend is American Indian. (Shortform note: The text’s representation of American Indians in this section is dated, and modern readers may find Pirsig’s characterizations distasteful, if not offensive.) The adults laugh, and Pirsig says that he was talking about European ghosts. This answer doesn’t satisfy Chris: he doesn’t understand the difference between Indian and European ghosts.
> 
> Suddenly Pirsig reverses himself and says he does believe in ghosts. His reasoning is:
> 
>   * American Indians and medieval Europeans weren’t any less intelligent or perceptive than modern humans. Rather it was **the context in which they lived** that caused them to believe in ghosts. To them, ghosts and spirits were as real as subatomic particles are to us.
> 

>   * Modern humans, scientific advances notwithstanding, have their own ghosts: scientific laws, the number system, algebra. These entities don’t appear in nature; they appear real to us because we believe they’re real. 
> 

> 
> When John objects, Pirsig offers a further example:
> 
> *** Did gravity exist before Newton discovered it?** We’re naturally inclined to say “Yes, of course,” but Pirsig muddies the water. He asks John if the law existed before our galaxy formed, planets came into being, our earth and human beings appeared. When John demurs, Pirsig asserts that this argument, taken to its logical extreme, illustrates that the law doesn’t— _can’t_ —exist without a human mind to create and understand it. And not only the law: gravity _itself_ doesn’t exist __ before Newton.
> 
> What Pirsig is driving at is the **primacy of mind** in humans’ relation to the world. Mathematics, the laws of logic and physics, historical progress—all are human inventions designed to order and explain the world to us. In a very real sense, the “world has no existence outside the human imagination.” When we look at the world, we’re seeing it through the eyes of ghosts: Moses, Christ, the Buddha, Plato, Descartes, Jefferson, Einstein—the philosophers, sages, and scientists whose ideas about the world we accept as true.

The Sutherlands are dumbfounded by Pirsig’s theorizing, and, after a pregnant pause, the conversation turns to safer topics.

Later that night, as Pirsig and Chris lie in their beds, Chris asks his father for a “ _real_ ” ghost story. Pirsig attempts to avoid the topic—to no avail. After some back and forth, Chris asks Pirsig if he’s ever known a ghost. Pirsig, against his better judgment, says he once knew someone who spent his whole life hunting for a ghost. This, of course, piques Chris’s interest. When Chris asks what the man did when he found the ghost, Pirsig replies, “He thrashed him good…then he became a ghost himself.” Chris begs for the ghost’s name—Phaedrus, Pirsig finally tells him—then asks if Pirsig saw Phaedrus in the lightning storm. Pirsig doesn’t answer and tells Chris to go to sleep.

Pirsig lies awake after Chris has fallen asleep. Thinking over the day’s events, he confirms to himself that Phaedrus has seen the town they’re in and traveled the route they’re taking. Not only: He asserts that Phaedrus is watching them now, that he’s _with_ them. He admits that his ideas—about technology and caring, ghosts and the mind—are all Phaedrus’s. He hopes that his confession will satisfy Phaedrus and let him sleep.
