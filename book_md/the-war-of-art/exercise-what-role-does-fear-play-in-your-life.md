Name one thing you wanted to do that you didn’t out of fear.

What did you fear the most and why?

What were two symptoms you experienced because of this fear? For example, did you procrastinate? Seek self-soothing behaviors?

What internal consequences of giving in to your fear did you notice? For example, did you feel anxiety or shame you couldn’t explain? Discontent?

What work do you feel the most resistance toward? Do you consider this work to be related to your true calling in life? Why or why not?
