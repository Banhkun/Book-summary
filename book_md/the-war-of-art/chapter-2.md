## Chapter 2: Resistance and Your Personal Life

You’ve learned about what resistance is and how to recognize it in your life. You’ve also learned the consequences of allowing resistance to guide your behaviors. But there are other ways in which resistance influences you. The following section provides a more comprehensive understanding of how resistance shows up in your life.

### Emotional Resistance

As opposed to the behavior symptoms presented in the above section, these symptoms all present as attitudes founded in emotion.

#### Criticism of Others

When you criticize others, it’s a good indication that resistance is strong in your life. You may feel envious of people who are living their dreams and attempt to tear them down. This behavior only masks how scared you are to begin your own journey. **Resistance is a personal sensation, but it can cause you to harm other people.** Be careful of moments when you feel the need to criticize others. Likely, the problem is with you, not them.

If you are working within the power of your true spirit, you have no reason to feel threatened or offended by another’s success. You understand how hard it is to push past resistance and follow your dreams, so you provide encouragement, not criticism.

#### Self-Doubt and Fear

Any artist following their calling is going to experience doubt about their talents. The little voice in your head saying you’re not good enough is resistance. But you can use that voice to empower yourself.

Doubt is a sign that something is important to you. **When you express doubt, you're signifying your passion about reaching your potential.** If you ever wonder whether you’re really an artist, know that the answer is yes. Imposters tend to be overconfident because their souls are not on the line. True artists have everything to lose. If you experience doubt, it’s a good sign that you’re on the right track to your heart’s desire.

Likewise, fear is a huge indication that you’re headed toward personal growth. Fear can be tricky because, as mentioned, it activates resistance and gives it strength. But you can counteract the relationship between fear and resistance by using fear as a guide. As a general rule—the more you fear the work, the more you should pursue it.

Many actors only take roles that scare them. They do this because these roles challenge their abilities and push them out of their comfort zones. They see an opportunity to grow and get closer to their full potential. The same is true for you. **You feel so much resistance when you’re scared to pursue something because the work means something to you.** If it didn’t, you’d feel no resistance. Use your fear to propel you forward because the deeper parts of yourself and talent lie on the other side.

##### Vulnerability

Like doubt and fear, you only feel vulnerable when your heart is on the line. When you feel a deep emotional connection—something akin to love— to the work, failure feels visceral. Therefore, you feel vulnerable, and feeling vulnerable is uncomfortable. Resistance uses that feeling to drive you away from your work.

**When you’re overwhelmed by resistance, you know you’re doing something you love.** The joy and satisfaction you feel when you accomplish your goal will be immense because of how much you love it.

The antithesis of love is indifference, not hate. If you don’t love the work you’re pursuing, it’s probably not the right work for you.

#### Misplaced Priorities

**Resistance will distract you with grandiose ideas about rewards and status.** You must ignore those ideas—they are false motivators.

A true artist understands that work is required for success. There is no way around it. So when grand ideas enter your process, accept them as resistance and push forward with the hard work. The joy you find in the work is what will help you reach the potential, not external commendations.

#### Leaning on Others

Resistance makes you believe you need motivation to start your work. It tells you that you must get support from others to achieve that motivation. Therefore, you spend time and energy attending conferences and workshops, reaching out to loved ones, and discussing your fears with colleagues. None of that time is you sitting down to do the work.

We all need support from family and friends. **But the work has to come from you, regardless of how much or little support you have from your personal network.** If you wait to start your work until you have a suitable amount of encouragement, resistance is winning.

#### The Power of Rationalizations

When you rationalize something, you are trying to justify your choices. Imagine what resistance could do with that! In fact, rationalization is the operational mode of choice for resistance.

Resistance is fear, as you’ve already learned. But if you only felt fear, you might recognize it as such and maybe start to feel ashamed for letting it get in your way. That shame could be enough motivation to jump start your work. Resistance can’t have that, so **it presents you with rationalizations to push you farther away from the work you’re afraid to start**.

You can justify not starting your work for a number of reasons. The day job takes up too much time. The kids need your attention. Whatever it is, you rationalize that it’s simply too hard for you to start your work now, so you put it off for a more convenient time. What makes the situation worse is that those rationalizations are valid. You may have a lot of “real” work, and you might have children. But those things are not what’s stopping you from following your calling. Fear is.

Don’t buy into the rationalizations. You always have the power to make art, even if it’s after the kids are in bed.

### The Artistic _You_ vs. the Public _You_

There is a difference between the _you_ who works within your spirit genius and the _you_ who you share with the world. Resistance wants you to believe the two are the same person. This belief distracts you with concerns about losing the public _you_ when you choose the artistic _you_ (i.e., your _true_ _authentic_ self). But who you are with the rest of the world is separate from who you are in the artistic world. The two worlds will never collide, so you don’t need to worry about it. You can live with both easily. The following concepts show you the difference between the two worlds so you won’t fall for resistance’s tricks.

#### Isolation

Most artistic pursuits require solitude. This understanding is important because resistance tries to convince you that isolation is a bad thing. You fear losing your community or place within it. You fear the sensation of loneliness.

The key is to remember that when you’re doing the work of your calling, you’re never alone. When you engulf yourself within your true work, your muse comes forth to keep you company. (We’ll talk more about the muse in Part 3.) **The act of committing to your work is an act of courage, and courage opens up deeper parts of your soul.** Those parts are creative, raw, and magical. They pull you out of reality and immerse you in a timeless space where your heart is full and the outside world ceases to exist. The artistic you lives in this space, and you’re the only one who can access it.

#### Timelessness

You only experience the sensation of timelessness when you are working within your passion. Your mind and soul are fully engaged when the outside world disappears. Hours go by without you realizing it, and the work doesn’t feel like effort. If you find yourself within that timeless space, you know you are doing work that fulfills your true calling. This knowledge can help you keep working when resistance tries to intervene.

#### Healing

One of the ways resistance tries to manipulate the barrier between the artist and the person is through healing. You may have personal demons or past traumas you struggle with emotionally and psychologically. Resistance makes you believe you need to heal those parts of you before you can start your important work. But this is not true. As stated, your artistic space cannot be touched by the outside world because it lives deep within your spirit landscape. This space is safe from external influences, even those that affect you internally. The part of you affected is the public sphere, which has nothing to do with your true artistic pursuits.

What’s interesting is that healing the psychological mind does not impact the artistic mind, but healing the artistic mind _does_ impact the psychological mind. When you tap into your spirit and pursue your calling, the positive effects seep into your total being. The emotions you tackle in the work are emotions you want to understand more. When you connect with the work, you are working toward an understanding of those emotions, which leads to personal growth.

When you make the first step toward your artistic calling, you cast a vote in favor of your life. By proxy, your whole being becomes empowered. On the other hand, when you focus your psychic energy on psychological healing, you're taking it away from the work, and resistance has won.

Of note, not all desires or attempts to heal your psychological self are bad. They are only negative when they stop you from getting to work.
