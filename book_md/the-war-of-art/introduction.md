## Introduction: The Unrealized Life

We all have a part of ourselves that is unrealized—a dream or calling that encompasses our true selves. But many of us struggle to live those authentic lives. What stops us is something called _resistance_. **Resistance is the enemy of achievement.** Artists who don’t create art, innovators who don’t innovate, and healthy people who live unhealthy lives are all losing their battles with resistance.

Resistance is a toxic force and the cause of many negative psychological issues. When you lose the battle with resistance, you likely experience some form of depression, discontent, and unhappiness as a result.

Like everyone else, you have genius inside you. Genius is Latin for “inner-guiding spirit.” Your _spirit_ is the force that encompasses your truest self. **It is the voice inside that tells you what your true calling is.** Your unique brand of talents and desires, whether you are a writer, fashion designer, or scientist, is your spirit. When you don’t act on that spirit, you are giving in to resistance.

Many have fallen before you under the weight of resistance, and many will fall after you. The sad part is that you likely won’t know that it’s resistance holding you back.

Think of someone who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With nothing left to lose, he finally does all the things his heart has always desired. He starts a travel blog, takes up painting, volunteers at a homeless shelter, or starts a non-profit for runaways. He is happier than he’s ever been because he is finally living his dream.

**You don’t want to wait for the prospect of death to move you to follow your heart’s desire.** You must learn to wage war against resistance if you want to accomplish your dreams.

Part 1 of this summary will show you what resistance is, how it appears in your life, and how to overcome it. Part 2 will show you how to commit to your art like a professional and win the battle against resistance. Part 3 tells you what a muse is, where it comes from, and how to summon it in your work.

(Shortform note: This book was written specifically for artists struggling to create art. Therefore, the summary focuses mostly on strategies to help artists overcome their fears. However, the term “artist” can be replaced with any category of person who feels a calling to be more than they are. Whether you’re a scientist, entrepreneur, inventor, or chef, the ideas surrounding goal achievement and fear apply to you, as well.)
