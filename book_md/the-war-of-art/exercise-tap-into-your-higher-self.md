The mysterious forces at play in your creative space are not always easy to identify. The information in this chapter can help you become more aware of the powers conspiring in your favor.

Name one time you’ve experienced the sensation of timelessness when working on a project. For instance, you sat down to work then suddenly looked up to realize that three hours had passed without you noticing.
