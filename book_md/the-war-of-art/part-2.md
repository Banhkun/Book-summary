## Part 2: Winning the War Against Resistance | Chapter 3: Commitment Is Key

The previous chapters make resistance sound like a scary monster lurking around every corner. You may be feeling overwhelmed and ill-equipped to manage it. But remember, everyone pursuing their calling experiences resistance. If it couldn’t be beaten, there’d be no art, no novels, no vaccines, and no Internet. When the journey to defeating resistance seems impossible, just remind yourself that people have been defeating it since the beginning of time. Here’s how to become one of them.

### Be a Professional, Not an Amateur

Artists who fold under the pressure of resistance have one thing in common: they’re amateurs. You might say, “Well, I don’t get paid to make art, so I’m an amateur by definition.” In the world of sports, that distinction is true. In the world of artists, the distinction between amateur and professional falls under different categories.

**When you’re an amateur, you dabble in your art.** You venture into the foray of art when the mood suits you or to have fun. Art is your hobby or a part-time commitment. You may love to create art, but the love doesn’t come from the depths of your soul. It’s a fair-weather love that fades at the first sign of fear. Resistance loves an amateur because you are easily distracted from the work.

**When you’re a professional, you create art because you _have_ to.** You turn to art because your soul demands it and because you feel incomplete without it. Your art is a full-time commitment, even if you aren’t getting paid. You sit down to face your art daily because it is part of who you are. The transition from amateur to professional is akin to having your first child. Your priorities change, and how you approach your life changes. **Resistance hates the professional because you are less likely to be thwarted from the work at hand.**

The great thing about being a professional is the access you have to your muse. Each time you sit down and face your art, you open the portal to your artistic space, where the muse resides. Within this universe, this mysterious force conspires to bring you inspiration because you are committed to your art.

### Why You Must Love Misery

When you’re a professional artist, you live in a world fraught with resistance. Fear, doubt, passion, vulnerability, and struggle are present every day of your life. These feelings make you miserable, which resistance is counting on. If you feel miserable, you won’t want to dwell in that world for very long. You’ll search for ways to self-soothe or get instant gratification. But **a professional understands that his world is a living hell and accepts it as part of life**.

A typical day of your professional life may follow the sequence below:

  * You wake up each day feeling unsatisfied. Fear follows shortly behind and lodges in your gut. 
  * You perform your daily rituals: breakfast, children, day job, laundry, emails, etc. You are physically there, but your mind is not. However, you aren’t focused on your artistic work. You’re focused on resistance, and you will be until you start your work. 
  * You can busy yourself all day with menial or urgent tasks, but your subconscious knows this is not the work you should be doing. It’s not what’s important to your ultimate survival. If you don’t do the work, you’re basically a tiger tied to a leash.
  * You muster the courage to face resistance. You settle into your artistic work, strapping on your muck boots and armor for the battle ahead. 
  * At first, the road is muddy, the conditions are harsh, and your feet and back hurt. But you have to keep putting one foot in front of the other. As you get farther down the road, the conditions improve. You make better time. You still feel pangs of discomfort, but you know how to keep moving despite them. 
  * You make it to your destination after a few hours. You feel satisfied and accomplished. Your heart and soul are full. Resistance is gone. There is nothing more you need to do. You finish out your day with ease and go to bed content. 
  * Before you fall asleep, you feel a pang of fear. In the morning, resistance will greet you again, and the battle will continue.



If this life sounds unpleasant, it’s because it is. **When you commit to following your true spirit, every ounce of resistance will place roadblocks in your path that you must overcome.** There is no getting around it. You have volunteered to be miserable, and you must learn to love it.

Learning how to be miserable is essential for any artist. You will have to give up things in your public life so you can be present in your artistic life. You have to come to the battle every day knowing you will be tired and possibly injured from doubt, humiliation, and rejection on a regular basis. But you can wear your scars like a badge of honor, because at least you were in the battle and fought. You are a soldier in the war to fulfill your artistic calling. You win the war every time you show up to the front line.

### Your “Real” Profession Informs Your Artistic Profession

You are already a professional in one aspect of your life—you get paid for your services in your day job. The attitude you bring to your day job can help strengthen your role as a professional artist in the following ways:

  1. **You work every day** —Even if you don’t feel like going to your job, you do it because you have to. You have responsibilities and obligations, and if you didn’t show up, you’d get fired. Even when you’re sick, you manage to drag yourself to the office, store, or factory. 
  2. **You work long hours** —You’re probably not mentally focused all day at your job. But when a customer needs help or your boss needs certain documents, you get the job done. You do the work because your workday isn’t over until you clock out. 
  3. **You will always work because you have to** —Your job title may change or you may move to a different job, but you will work year in and year out because you have to support yourself. There are no other options short of winning the lottery.
  4. **You deal with immense pressure** —Your job pays for rent, mortgage, children’s tuition, food, and clothes. The pressure of keeping these things afloat is intense. It motivates you to show up and work hard. 
  5. **Your job is not your identity** —You can enjoy your job and be proud of performing it to a high degree. You may put in overtime and stretch yourself thin to complete the work. But at the end of each day, you go home to your personal life. You are not your job, which means you are detached from it personally. When you’re detached, it’s easier to put your head down and finish your duties without fear. 
  6. **You trained to become efficient at your job** —You’ve put in the time and effort to learn how to do your job well. 
  7. **You don’t take it so seriously** —Your job is what you do for money, not the end-all and be-all of your existence. You can have a sense of humor about the work because it’s not personal. 
  8. **You receive feedback during evaluations** —You’ve experienced praise and ridicule for your job performance. You know the evaluation is about the work and not about you. 



Although your artistic work is done because of love, becoming a full-time artist means treating your creative work like a business. If you can carry these attitudes about your day job over to your artistic life, you will reduce resistance and increase your commitment.

#### The Creative Professional

The idea of treating your art like a business may make you cringe, but it is the main way to separate yourself from the amateurs. You must be committed to showing up for your art in the same way you’re committed to showing up to your job. You must put in the training to hone your craft. You must be willing to put your art into the world for judgement.

Whether you believe it or not, you need real-world validation as an artist. It’s what pushes you to grow and helps you understand how to grow. **Failure is part of life for an artist. You have to learn to take it in stride. If you’re afraid to fail, you won’t try.** Receiving a rejection or a poor review is just as valuable as an acceptance or rave review. You’ve completed a project and put it into the world. You have joined the battle. You are a professional.

Another useful aspect of your day job attitude is the idea of working simply to support yourself. As stated, your creative work is a product of love. If it isn’t, it’s not your true calling. But you can’t focus on love. Loving your art too much leads to fear. You become too precious with the work and take it too personally. These feelings can make you freeze when it comes time to create.

**If you can think of yourself as an artist-for-hire, meaning you do it for the money, you can be detached from the work.** You also view the work as a process needed to create a product, rather than an extension of your character. This level of detachment is resistance’s worst nightmare because it diminishes fear.
