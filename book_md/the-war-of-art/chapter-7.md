## Chapter 7: Life as an Artist

Only you know what your true calling is—what you were born to do. And only you can decide what to do with the genius you’ve been given. You can do the work or not do the work, it’s up to you. But if you choose not to write a novel, paint a mural, cure cancer, or develop the Internet, realize you are hurting yourself and everyone else that may benefit from your gift.

**Using your gift to create your art is typically an isolated enterprise, but it is not a selfish one.** You’re following through on the life bestowed to you. You are using your unique spirit to create the work you were meant to create. This gift wasn’t given to you by mistake. If you feel it, you’re meant to use it. A muse waits in your divine space to provide you with the many blessings they have to offer. All you have to do is call upon them and be grateful.

### What If You Don’t Succeed?

You can’t predict what will happen with your art once you create it. But if you don’t create it, you guarantee the answer is nothing. Your only certainty is that doing the work fulfills your destiny. The rest is out of your hands. If the idea of doing the work for the sake of the work is too hard to swallow, think of other ways to measure success.

For example, territorial work becomes a form of meditation and healing. You have been given the tools you need to live a harmonious psychological life. That in itself makes you fortunate. When you work as a professional, you open the doors to higher forces and can experience the magic of divine intervention. Not many people can say that. Therefore, **the work becomes a portal to reaching a spiritual place only you know how to find**.

### What Now?

Now you must decide what you believe and how you will use those beliefs to become your authentic self. You won’t be able to document or prove that forces from higher planes conspire in your favor. You won’t be able to name the moment the muse speaks to you. You won’t be able to differentiate between what is your work, the muse’s work, or the work of your higher mind. **All you can do is trust the process and receive your rewards. Those rewards will be happiness, fulfillment, and purpose.**

If you can let go of your Ego, you can succeed. If you can stand up to resistance, you can succeed. If you can be humble and accept your role as servant to the muse, you can succeed.

You must become a warrior in the fight for control over your life. You must be willing to share the spotlight with inspiration and view yourself as an instrument it works through. You must remember that you are an artist, not the art. You must commit to doing whatever the work entails. If you can do these things, the rest will take care of itself.
