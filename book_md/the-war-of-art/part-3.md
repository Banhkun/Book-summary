## Part 3: The Other Side of Resistance | Chapter 5: A Powerful Ally

(Shortform note: The author suggests that the muse is the Lord’s helper and bestows God’s work unto you. However, in the foreword, Robert McKee states that his interpretation is that the muse represents biological talent. The concepts of the muse are applicable to your work regardless of which form you choose to give it. Therefore, we’ll discuss the muse as a psychic force without distinction between science and religion.)

If resistance is the force working against you, then the muse is the force working in your favor. Access to your muse is another aspect of what makes working like a professional so important. Something mysterious happens when you come to your art every day. The forces of your artistic power accumulate around you. **The muse sees your work and commitment and rewards you with inspiration.**

Some refer to professionalism as the “artist’s code” because they know the artist works in service of the art without arrogance. Others call it the “warrior’s way” because, like warriors, you must slay dragons and fight the enemy daily to win the battle for your work. The muse is what enhances your power during the battle and helps you find your way to the gates of your destiny.

To form a strong relationship with your muse, you must first understand what a muse is, where it comes from, and how to harness its power.

### What Is a Muse?

A muse can be considered a mystical force that inspires artists. Some refer to the muse as an angel, and some think of it as talent. Whichever form suits you best is fine as long as you understand that some psychic force is supporting your work as an ally. This force, when experienced, is stronger than resistance at its best.

The concept of the muse is not new. Almost every ancient culture, from Greeks to Native Americans, has an identified embodiment of this force of nature. For the Greeks, their force was the gods. The father of all gods was Zeus, and in Greek mythology, his nine daughters were the muses.

Some believed that the gods took an interest in the affairs of mortals and interfered for either good or bad (perhaps better understood as rewards or punishments). William Blake, an 18th-century poet, believed the muses delighted in the creations of the living. Others suggested that artistic creations already existed in this higher plane, and the muse simply provided the path for the mortal to bring them forth.

You may not believe in this mythological mumbo jumbo. But once you understand how the muse works, you may begin to see the benefit of having this force in your corner.

### How the Muse Becomes Your Ally

When you acknowledge the muse in your artistic life, you counteract feelings of ego that can hinder the authenticity of your work. The muse is not just from a higher dimension, the muse wants to help you and knows things that you don’t. It sees your potential and wants to give you what you need to reach it. But for that to happen, you must be open to hearing the muse and listening. Basically, you need to get out of your head so you can hear the inspiration when it comes. The only way to summon the muse is simply starting to work.

#### Beginning Your Work

When you have an idea and commit to creating it despite fear, you clear the path for the authentic _you_ to come through. Starting is like the first contraction after the long gestation period of your idea. The muse works like a midwife to help bring the person you were meant to be into this world.

The small act of sitting down to write that first sentence or paint that first stroke or draw that first blueprint is an invitation to your muse. You invite the muse to sit at your table and give them the space to do their work. They’re happy and you’re happy. When you’re both happy, you will receive the guidance you need to bring your work to fruition.

When you sit down to work, recognize the muse and show gratitude for the gifts it will bring to you. Be humble in what you ask for. **The muse’s job is not to give you fame and fortune. The muse gives you inspiration, which helps you continue to work.** That is all you can hope for and all you should ask for—the ability to maintain your work. If your goal is anything else, you are not yet a professional, and the muse will know it.

#### Harnessing Your Potential

Opening yourself up to the force of the muse is helpful, but just as important is opening up to the concept of higher planes of consciousness. This belief is imperative if you want to keep moving forward in your work.

**There are different planes of consciousness at play inside you.** Too often, you’re distracted by the external world or the myriad of thoughts racing through your brain to notice. You can’t see past the flesh to the soul.

Pressfield gives an example of this higher consciousness at work. When he finishes writing for the day, he takes a hike. Hiking clears his mind and allows other planes of consciousness to come through. He receives notes about the work, information stored in these different arenas that he could not access on his own. For instance, a voice tells him he’s written the same sentence hundreds of pages apart in his novel. Through no effort of his own, this guidance appears to help show him the way forward.

This process happens to you all the time. It is mystical and profound when it occurs, but you must be willing to shut down your surface mind enough to receive it. This part of your consciousness knows more than you do. It’s always working alongside your surface mind, even when you're not physically working. **It processes and organizes your ideas and brings you solutions as insights when you forget to think** , like when brushing your teeth or hiking. It enjoys the work and waits patiently for an opportunity to share what it’s done.

Many artists are humble about their work because they understand that they are not wholly responsible for it. They receive help from this other conscious sphere. They become mere tools to dictate what this mystical mind tells them. They can’t explain what’s happening, but they know that it is beyond the power of their surface brain, or what is called Ego.

### The Self and Ego

This duality of consciousness is best understood as the _Self_ and the _Ego_. Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in the early 20th century, was one of the founders of this concept. He believed the Ego is the embodiment of the personal “I,” or the surface mind. The Ego operates in the real world. The Self is the larger landscape of consciousness. Your dreams, intuition, and visions live within the realm of the Self. Jung called it the mind of the soul.

Pressfield uses Jung’s theory to describe the mind of the artist. He posits that**the Ego is where resistance lives and the Self is where the spirits live** , including yours and that of your muse. Both the Self and Ego are powerful and battle for position in your mind.

#### The Doctrines of the Ego

Your Ego believes in what is tangible. It runs the day-to-day operations of life, which are essential for survival. According to your Ego, there is nothing beyond death, and the physical world is the only realm of being. Time and space are real entities that dictate your movements, and you cannot override them. You are separate from everyone else, and your only goal in life is to keep living. Because of this, you live in a constant state of fear of losing your life. Your Ego desires to leave a legacy behind, whether through children or your impact on the world.

#### The Doctrines of the Self

Your Self believes that the soul is eternal and remains after death. Time and space are illusions manifested to create order. You have the power to traverse various realms of consciousness at all times. You are connected to everyone, and love is what guides life. All things carry the spirit of the interconnected universe and are connected through it.

### Finding Your _Self_

Anytime you try to alter your consciousness, you are seeking to access the Self, or higher mind. Drugs, alcohol, meditation, fasting, and prayer are all ways in which people attempt to reach the divine ground where ideas and dreams live and your authentic being resides. **The Self does not lie and cannot disguise itself as something it’s not. The Self encompasses the deepest form of who you are.**

Any artist that sits down to create is attempting to access the Self. You gravitate toward art because you want to grow, evolve, learn, and tap into internal truths. You seek a spiritual awakening to become more enlightened.

The Ego hates the Self. **The Ego would rather you didn’t become your authentic self** because the more enlightened you become, the less you rely on the Ego, or the public personification of you. To block your path to this more powerful mind, the Ego shuffles in its artillery as resistance.

#### The Original _You_

You were not born a blank slate. You were born with a particular soul and brand of characteristics. You were told the world is your oyster, but that’s a lie. You have a specific purpose in life—your true calling—and your job is to discover what it is and follow it.

If you were born to be a leader, you must become a leader. If you were born to nurture children, you must seek out positions that require nurturing, such as a mother or teacher. If you were born to be an artist, you must create art.

If life is this easy, why are so many people miserable? What stops you from following your destiny. Once again, the answer is fear.

### Understanding Your Fear

You’ve learned that resistance feeds off fear and that the Ego exists in a constant state of fear. But what is this fear about and why do you let it control you? Fear, as detrimental as it is to your progress, is comforting. You’re used to living with it, and if you're honest, **you have to admit that it’s easier to do nothing out of fear than put your heart on the line for what you believe in**.

The most common fear encompasses your relationship with the external world. What will people think of you if you seek internal fulfillment? You’re afraid you will lose your tribe. You’re afraid of failing and the humiliation that comes with it. You fear a loss of financial or social stability. You’re afraid of wasting your time, which you believe is finite. You’re afraid of the “I-told-you-so’s” from people who don’t understand your dreams. You fear finding out you're a fraud or not capable of living up to your calling. You’re afraid to find out you’ve been wrong about your calling.

These are valid fears, but they’re not the main fear that halts you in your tracks like quicksand. You never talk about this fear, not even to yourself. This fear is the fear of succeeding.

What happens if you gain your full power and become the person you believed you were? If you discover you do have talent, drive, and passion and can achieve your goals, will you be able to live up to it? **The pressure is now on for you to be that person and stay enlightened in the higher plane.**

Also, you fear success will make you lose the life you’ve grown accustomed to. The truth is, you _will_ lose some or all of that life. And that’s not a bad thing. The parts of your life that are true will continue to support you in your new fulfilled soul. The ones that drop away are not the parts you need. You can’t change who you are meant to be. Once you become that person, the life you’re meant to lead will open up to you and will include people and environments with which you truly belong.
