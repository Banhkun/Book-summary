## Exercise: Understand What Your Emotions Mean

Your thoughts are excellent guides regarding your relationship with your true calling. What do your emotions say about your calling and the work you put into it?

* * *

In what ways are you critical of other people? Can you list one example of a time when you criticized a successful person?

What does your criticism of others tell you about your emotions regarding your own work?

Do you conflate your artistic self with your public self? If yes, how do the two overlap? If no, how do you keep them separate?

Name one thing you do that allows you to slip into the timeless space. Does this work speak to your true calling? Why or why not?
