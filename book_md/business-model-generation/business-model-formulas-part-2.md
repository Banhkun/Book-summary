## Business Model Formulas, Part 2

In this chapter, we’ll look at the remaining business model formulas: Free, Open, and specific formulas for nonprofit and beyond-profit organizations.

### Formula 4: Free

The Free business model pattern ensures that**at least one customer group always receives value for free**. While different patterns make the model financially viable, Free users are always financed by another part of the business model or by another customer segment. Osterwalder and Pigneur categorize Free models into three groups, based on where their revenue comes from: advertising, premium services, and continuing purchases.

#### Advertising

In this model, Multi-Sided Platforms encourage advertisers to subsidize free users. For example, the revenue that Google receives from advertisers enables Google users to make unlimited searches for free. The more free users, the more advertisers are willing to pay to access these users.

Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest the following priorities for Free business models subsidized by advertising revenues:

**Customer Groups** | Focus on large customer groups to entice advertisers.   
---|---  
**Value Offer** | Value comes from providing a free product or service to customers. The resulting customer base will create value for advertisers.   
**Touchpoints** | Depends on the type of product or service.   
**Interactions** | Depends on the type of product or service.   
**Profit Sources** | Profit comes from advertisers using the platform.   
**Resources** | The larger the platform becomes, the more of a resource it will become.   
**Critical Actions** | Develop and maintain the platform to entice both customers and advertisers.   
**Network** | Focus on developing partnerships that will make the platform more functional or attractive to all customer groups.   
**Expenses** | Platform management and development, as well as traffic generation, will incur the highest costs.   
  
> **Facebook’s Advertising Revenue**
> 
> Facebook’s family of apps (Instagram, Messenger, Whatsapp) **provides a free service to more than 3 billion users worldwide**. Facebook clearly has two primary groups of customers: Users, who they provide value for in the form of free communication, and advertisers, who they rely upon for revenue.
> 
> Facebook collects and analyzes data to categorize each of its users: who they are, what they care about, who they communicate with, and what content they spend time on both within and outside of Facebook apps. The more time that users spend on Facebook apps, the more data Facebook collects to categorize these users.
> 
> Facebook auctions off advertising space within users' feeds and stories based on the categorizations they’ve created. Further, Facebook provides advertisers with performance tracking data on how effective different campaigns are, for example, how often users click on certain advertisements. These categorizations and performance analyses are accurate enough that advertisers are willing to pay for the opportunity to create targeted marketing campaigns. In fact, **over 10 million advertisers use Facebook’s advertising platform**.
> 
> Facebook’s 2020 revenue: On average, Facebook earned an average of $32 from each of its users, totaling $84.2 billion in advertising revenue—advertising represented 98% of Facebook’s $86 billion revenue for that year alone.
> 
> Facebook has faced many accusations regarding the way it manages the security and privacy of its users. However, Facebook doesn’t sell personal data to advertisers—just advertising space based on user demographics. Still, the increasing scrutiny of the government and public demonstrates that applications of this Free model may need to change in the future.

#### Premium Services

Premium Service models—Osterwalder and Pigneur refer to these as “Freemium models”—give customers the option to use the basic service for free or to pay for premium or additional services. The revenue from paying customers supports the costs incurred by the free users. **The larger the customer base for paid services, the more revenue there is to support free users**. For example, Evernote offers three plans to users: free, personal, and professional, and users can choose to upgrade and pay if the free service doesn’t meet their needs.

Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest the following layout for this type of business model:

**Customer Groups** | Focus on creating a large group of free users. Eventually, convert a portion of this group into paying users.   
---|---  
**Value Offer** | Value comes from providing a free basic service to a large customer group, as well as offering a premium service to a smaller customer group.   
**Touchpoints** | Online methods are usually the most cost-effective.   
**Interactions** | Automate as much as possible to efficiently serve the large customer group.   
**Profit Sources** | Profit will come from customers paying for premium services. Calculate the conversion rate from free users to premium users to determine profit.   
**Resources** | The platform that offers the free service is the main resource.   
**Critical Actions** | Develop, maintain, and promote the platform to ensure it meets the needs of both free and paying users.   
**Network** | Focus on developing partnerships that will make the platform more functional or attractive to both free and paying users.   
**Expenses** | Platform management and development will incur the highest costs. There will be fixed costs for providing services to the two different groups of users, free and paying.   
  
> **The Difference Between Freemium and Free Trial**
> 
> Both customer acquisition methods offer free services to customers. However, the difference between the two is that Freemium models _limit user functions_ whereas Free Trials _limit user time_. Freemium services offer a free basic service to users with an option to pay for premium functionality. Free Trials typically offer users premium functionality for a limited time, after which the user must make the decision to either start paying to use the service or to stop using the service.
> 
> Freemium models provide “free value forever” and this is more attractive to users than “free value for a limited time.” Consequently, **businesses using Freemium models are more likely to grow their customer base at a much faster rate than businesses using Free Trials**. However, the problem with Freemium models is that they create no sense of urgency for users to upgrade—converting free users to paying users can take months or years, if ever. Meanwhile, businesses have to pay to maintain and develop the services it offers to these users.
> 
> **The more value a Freemium service offers to free users, the more likely it is to create procrastination** —users will happily benefit from the free service as long as possible. But if businesses add restrictions to the free offer to create a sense of urgency, users are likely to feel betrayed. This was demonstrated when Evernote placed limitations on its free service and raised subscription fees.
> 
> Ultimately, businesses offering Free Trials are more likely to create profits in the short term as they don’t have the additional expense of serving a large base of free users for an unlimited time. However, if businesses using Freemium models can strike the right balance between offering enough free value to grow their customer base, and offering enough premium value to convert users into paying customers, they can create substantial profit in the long term.

#### Continuing Purchases

Continuing Purchases models—Osterwalder and Pigneur refer to these as “Bait and Hook” models—are characterized by cheap or free products that provide customers with instant gratification but create demand for future products and services. Although businesses initially lose money, they can easily cover the costs and make a profit from the recurring income they receive from these transactions. For example, coffee machines that require specific capsules to function can sell at a loss since customers will inevitably pay for the capsules so that they can use the machine.

Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest the following layout for this type of business model:

**Customer Groups** | Focus on large customer groups.   
---|---  
**Value Offer** | Value comes from attracting customers with an inexpensive or free offer, which will lead to a necessary follow-up product or service.   
**Touchpoints** | Depends on the product or service.   
**Interactions** | Interactions need to encourage customers to have no choice but to purchase follow-up products or services.   
**Profit Sources** | Profit will come from multiple purchases of the follow-up product or service.   
**Resources** | Product patents, as well as brand equity—brand reputation and familiarity—will be the biggest resources.   
**Critical Actions** | Focus on the production and delivery of follow-up products & services.   
**Network** | Focus on developing partnerships that will make the production and delivery of follow-up products and services more efficient.   
**Expenses** | The main expenses will be the subsidization of the initial value offer, as well as the production of the follow-up products and services.   
  
> **Reversing the Model**
> 
> Business models focused on continuing purchases generally offer the premium product (for example, coffee machine or printer) at a low cost and its complementary product (coffee capsules, printer ink) at a high price. In effect, businesses choose to initially make a loss in the hope of making a future profit from ongoing purchases. However, this gamble doesn’t always pay off—savvy buyers may calculate the ongoing expenses of owning such products and choose not to take the bait. The result is that businesses may end up making an overall loss from this model.
> 
> Many businesses have found the reverse of this model to be even more successful—they offer the premium product at a high price but keep the complementary product at a very low price. In other words, customers pay a high price upfront so that they can receive long-term benefits from low price add ons.
> 
> For example, Apple products require a high degree of investment from consumers. However, consumers are happy to pay the price to enjoy low-priced music and apps at affordable prices. Similarly, Amazon’s Kindle devices are also sold for high prices, but consumers benefit from accessing millions of free or low-priced ebooks. If both Apple and Amazon Kindle continue to provide access to low-price complementary products, consumers will be willing to pay high prices for their premium products.
> 
> Unlike the original model, businesses do not suffer a loss when customers fail to purchase complementary products. Further, even though the complementary products offer a low profit margin, they still provide businesses with ongoing and predictable revenue streams.

### Formula 5: Open

Businesses with Open business models create opportunities for innovation and efficiency by collaborating or co-creating with external partners. For example, NASA collaborated with TopCoder, Harvard Business School, and London Business School to build an algorithm to assist manned missions.

Osterwalder and Pigneur claim that there are two ways to create value through collaboration—businesses can either receive and integrate external resources to strengthen their own business models, or they can leverage their internal resources by supplying them for a fee.

| **Receive Resources** | **Supply Resources**  
---|---|---  
**Customer Groups** |  | Focus on creating partnerships with organizations that require existing internal resources.   
**Value Offer** |  | Value comes from anything that won’t be used internally such as research results or intellectual property.   
**Profit Sources** |  | Profit comes from selling off any resources that aren’t required internally.   
**Resources** | Focus on evaluating external resources and develop methods to work with external networks—these capabilities will become the main resource.  |   
**Critical Actions** | Evaluate external resources, develop and manage the infrastructure to connect these external resources with existing internal processes.  |   
**Network** | Focus on developing partnerships with organizations that can provide value in the form of innovative products and services or research.  |   
**Expenses** | Acquiring external resources, as well as developing the infrastructure to work with these resources, will incur the highest expenses.  |   
  
(Shortform note: In addition to identifying physical and intellectual resources, businesses can also create value by leveraging their brand equity. For example, Xiaomi grew to become the world’s leading consumer internet-of-things company by forming alliances with partner firms. Xiaomi offered these partner firms significant value in the form of physical and intellectual resources such as research, development, and manufacturing resources, as well as **brand capital** —the firms benefited from access to Xiaomi’s millions of existing loyal customers without having to go through the long process of building a customer base and developing trust.)

### Formula 6: Nonprofits and Beyond-Profits

Although nonprofit and social causes organizations do not seek to make profits in the conventional sense, they still need to have a business model to plan how they will meet their objectives and cover their expenses. Osterwalder and Pigneur distinguish between two different business model patterns defined by how these organizations receive revenue: Donor-supported organizations and organizations that balance profit with social and environmental impact.

#### Donor-Supported Organizations

When third-party donors fund the organization’s mission, the business model has to place emphasis not only on how to fulfill the mission but how to appeal to third-party donors so that they support the mission. Therefore, the organization has to manage third-party donors in the same way that conventional profitable businesses manage their customers. Consequently, the development and management of these relationships form a large part of the organization’s activities.

(Shortform note: Aligning both donors and beneficiaries into one business model is difficult to balance. Donor-Supported Organizations need to focus on fulfilling their mission, but they also need to fully consider how they create value for their donors. In other words, donors are more likely to contribute if organizations can provide proof of specific and measurable improvements made possible by their donations.)

#### Organizations That Balance Profit With Social and Environmental Impact

When the organization has to generate its own revenue to fulfill its mission, Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest that it should balance its need to make profits with its need to make a positive social and environmental impact. To evaluate this impact, the authors recommend extending the business model to include two additional elements:

  * Social and environmental costs of this business model
  * Social and environmental benefits of this business model



(Shortform note: Many experts believe that all businesses should be held accountable for their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact, not just businesses that focus on social causes. However, companies haven’t quite figured out how to measure their ESG impact.)
