## Innovation and Strategy Techniques

Now that you understand the most common business model formulas, we’ll look at techniques you can use to generate innovative ideas to adapt or create your own business models. We’ll also explore strategies you can incorporate to help you regularly analyze and optimize the effectiveness of your business models. The following nine techniques will help you develop, test, and evaluate your business model:

Part 1: Innovation Techniques

  * Technique 1: Generate Innovative Ideas
  * Technique 2: Empathize With Your Customers
  * Technique 3: Create Visual Representations
  * Technique 4: Build Detailed Scenarios
  * Technique 5: Create a Story to Communicate Your Business Model



Part 2: Optimization Techniques

  * Technique 6: Prototype Multiple Versions of Your Business Model
  * Technique 7: Use a SWOT Analysis to Evaluate Your Business Model
  * Technique 8: Use Blue Ocean Framework to Evaluate Your Business Model
  * Technique 9: Align Your Organization and Resources



### Part 1: Innovation Techniques

#### Technique 1: Generate Innovative Ideas

Osterwalder and Pigneur argue that you first need to generate and evaluate a large number of ideas before you can come up with viable options to create an innovative business model. They suggest that you assemble a diverse team of colleagues from across different departments and from different levels of your business to brainstorm and discuss possibilities. Further, consider including people from outside your business to help stimulate new ideas.

The authors suggest you use one of the following objectives to trigger innovative ideas:

  * Serve unmet market needs
  * Create new products or services
  * Disrupt an existing market
  * Create a new market



(Shortform note: The authors don’t mention that there are other significant opportunities to spark innovation. For example, shifts in the economic environment (growth or turmoil) can create new customer preferences and spending habits that trigger business innovation.)

Each of the nine elements can serve as a starting point for generating ideas and can have a powerful impact on how you arrange the rest of the elements within your business model. In addition, asking “what if” questions will help you to explore potential possibilities and provoke new ideas. To begin your brainstorming session, Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest that you consider how you can:

  * Use your existing resources and infrastructure to expand or transform your business model.
  * Add more value to your existing product and service offerings. 
  * Focus more specifically on your customers’ wants and needs.
  * Create new revenue streams and pricing structures, or examine how you can cut costs.



> Established companies can find it difficult to define, challenge, and redesign their existing business models. The more successful these businesses become, the more difficult they find it to anticipate risks and proactively implement innovative strategies. In fact, **pushing for innovation can seem risky during times of success**.
> 
> However, management experts argue that businesses need to establish a framework that allows them to analyze opportunities, align their operations with what they intend to offer, and ensure that they remain adaptable to ongoing changes in the market.
> 
> The first step is for businesses to explicitly understand the strengths and limitations of their existing business models. Once they understand how the elements within their current business models interact, they’ll have a better understanding of **the resources they can leverage to generate more ideas and create more opportunities**.

#### Technique 2: Empathize With Your Customers

Osterwalder and Pigneur argue that if you find out what your customers want and figure out ways to help them _before_ you design your products and services, you’re more likely to discover new opportunities and create a strong foundation for your business model. To find unsatisfied, or hidden needs that your customers may not even be conscious of, the authors suggest that you pair basic customer profiling (demographics) with a deeper analysis and exploration of your customers’ experiences and underlying motivations.

> Another way to approach this is to specifically look for problems and inconveniences that your customers face both throughout their experience with your business and their experience with your products and services. This is an effective way to create more value for your customers either in what you offer or how you interact with them. For example, one business noticed that consumers are reluctant to buy electric fryers because deep-fried food is unhealthy and the machines are difficult to clean—they transformed the problem into a solution by creating Actifry, a machine that creates tasty fries with only one tablespoon of oil. Actifry **converted a problem into revenue totaling €1 billion** by addressing customer concerns.

#### Technique 3: Create Visual Representations

Osterwalder and Pigneur argue that visual representations of your business model allow you to better understand how each of your elements connects and interrelates. They designed the business model template to encourage collaboration across teams and departments—it’s intended to be reproduced in a large format to allow groups of people, armed with Post-it™ notes and markers, to strategically discuss each element. The authors claim that Post-it™ notes and drawings can express ideas more succinctly than abstract concepts expressed in text. In other words, the visual representations give you something tangible to focus your discussions on and allow you to better communicate your ideas. (Osterwalder and Pigneur also developed a Toolbox to support the creation of online collaborative methods).

(Shortform note: _The Back of the Napkin_ by Dan Roam argues that drawings can solve any problems. According to Roam, solving problems with images has nothing to do with being artistic and requires no creative talent—we’re all born with the innate ability to visualize and draw what we’re thinking even if we’re convinced that we have no aptitude for it.)

#### Technique 4: Build Detailed Scenarios

Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest that you regularly create scenarios around possible future environments and the impact they will have on the way you operate. This will not only help you to prepare adaptation strategies but will enable you to generate innovative ideas for groundbreaking products and services. To create informed future scenarios, you need to understand the business environment within which you intend to operate and the various forces that influence it. The authors recommend that you base your scenarios on the following four areas of your business environment:

**_Market_ ** | **_Industry_ ** | **_Key Trends_** | **_Macroeconomic_ **  
---|---|---|---  
**Market Segments** : Which segments are growing or require attention?  | **Suppliers & Value Chain Contributors**: Who do you rely on & how do they impact you?  | **Regulatory** : Which new rules & regulations will affect how you operate?  | **Global Market** **Conditions** : What overall conditions could affect your market?   
**Needs & Demands**: Where are customer needs not being met?  | **Stakeholders** : Which stakeholders influence how you operate?  | **Technology** : Which technological trends could threaten or enable your business model?  | **Capital Markets** : How easy is it to obtain funding?   
**Market Issues** : What issues are driving change?  | **Competitors** : Who are your competitors and what are their strengths & weaknesses?  | **Societal & Cultural**: Which shifts or trends will influence buyer behavior?  | **Economic Infrastructure** : How does the public infrastructure affect your market?   
**Switching Costs** : Why are customers switching to competitors?  | **New Entrants** : Who are the new players in the market and what are their strengths & weaknesses?  | **Socioeconomic** : What are the demographic trends for your market?  | **Commodities & Resources**: What’s the price trend for the resources you need to operate?   
**Revenue Attractiveness** : What are customers willing to pay for?  | **Substitute Products & Services**: Which products & services could replace yours?  |  |   
  
> **Risk Management Strategies**
> 
> Businesses face two types of risks: **preventable risks** (controllable risks that you can take measures to avoid), and **external risks** (natural and political disasters that you can’t control). While businesses can set rules and regulations in place to manage preventable risks, external risks are more difficult to predict and plan for since they’re largely based on speculation. Further, established businesses often assume that external trends will continue in a predictable way, and they find it difficult to look beyond their assumptions when planning for the future.
> 
> However, the impact of Covid-19 on the workforce and consumer behavior emphasized that businesses are often impacted by forces beyond their control. Consequently, many experts argue that businesses need to consider how they can evaluate and manage unanticipated external risks in advance, and develop appropriate risk management strategies to lessen their impact.
> 
> **Businesses can’t prevent external risks from occurring** so they must focus on identifying them, assessing their potential impact, and mitigating their effects. In other words, create a recovery plan that helps you to respond effectively to external events—your objective is to shorten your recovery time and minimize potential losses.
> 
> But how can you predict the unpredictable? For the purposes of this technique, it’s beneficial to focus on early indicators of change in your environment, particularly in regards to politics, economics, technological advancements, regulation changes, and environmental forces.
> 
> For example, many businesses, both within the UK and without, are feeling the impact of BREXIT regulations, which came into force at the end of 2020. However, businesses could have taken notice of the early indicators of BREXIT (there was a call for a referendum on the UK's EU membership in 2012) and planned for the worst-case scenario. Businesses that created strategies for BREXIT’s impact on global trade ahead of the trade agreement are better prepared to respond to the additional administrative burdens than the businesses that passively waited for the deal to be finalized.

#### Technique 5: Create a Story to Communicate Your Business Model

Osterwalder and Pigneur claim that creating a story centered around the value that your business model offers, from the perspective of either an employee or customer, will enable you to engage your listeners and effectively communicate your business model. You can create multiple stories throughout the process to instigate feedback and refine your business model. Further, once you’ve defined your business model, you can use the story to communicate it across your business and to external organizations.

(Shortform note: Marketing expert and author of _Purple Cow_ , Seth Godin, argues that businesses can’t overcome resistance unless they **create and frame their stories from the perspective of each audience they target**. In other words, to effectively engage and resonate with your listeners, you need to recognize that each audience you address has different priorities. For example, your team cares about how your business model will affect their jobs, whereas your investors care about how they’ll profit from your business model.)

### Part 2: Optimization Techniques

#### Technique 6: Prototype Multiple Versions of Your Business Model

Osterwalder and Pigneur argue that prototypes of your business model will allow you to better understand the structure and combined effects of your elements. With this understanding, you can create multiple prototypes to explore and test various possibilities and strategic directions. The authors suggest that you follow this sequence to create prototypes:

  1. **Draft an idea** : Briefly outline your idea describing the product or service you intend to offer and how you intend to make a profit.
  2. **Create an outline of your business model** : Expand upon your idea by including details for each of the nine elements in your business model.
  3. **Test your business model** : Gather financial data to estimate the potential for profit and talk to customers to evaluate the viability of your business model.



(Shortform note: The sooner you test your business model, the sooner you’ll know if your business model is worth investing in. There are a number of tools that you can use to test the viability of your business model. For example, you can use targeted advertising to measure consumer interest, or use your email database to test your value offer on existing customers.)

#### Technique 7: Use a SWOT Analysis to Evaluate Your Business Model

Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest that you regularly use the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of each of your individual elements, as well as your overall business model. The SWOT analysis provides a clear indication of the strengths and weaknesses of your current business model and reveals the opportunities and threats that you need to plan for.

(Shortform note: There are various alternatives to the SWOT analysis that the authors don’t mention. For example, NOISE would be useful when you’re actively looking for solutions to solve problems within your organization, whereas Porter’s Five Forces Model offers an effective way to analyze your competition.)

#### Technique 8: Use Blue Ocean Framework to Evaluate Your Business Model

Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, the authors of _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , argue that businesses need to challenge established market boundaries and business strategies to create value in new markets. The “Four Actions Framework” encourages you to shift current industry standards by examining how you can pursue both differentiation (raise standards and create new features) and low costs (eliminate unnecessary features and cut costs).

The authors argue that using this framework to analyze the impact of each of your elements will put you in a position to create demand for innovative products and services in unclaimed markets.

(Shortform note: _Blue Ocean Strategy_ by Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne argues that businesses can effectively bypass competition by creating entirely new markets, whereas Porter’s Five Forces argues that businesses need to continually assess their competition to remain relevant in the marketplace. Management experts suggest that a blend of both strategies can be effective—use Four Actions Framework to create your new market and then use Porter’s Five Forces to defend against your eventual competitors.)

#### Technique 9: Align Your Organization and Resources

Once you’ve defined your business model, you’ll need to evaluate if your organization is prepared to move forward with it. In addition to assessing your technology and resource requirements, the authors suggest that you consider the following questions inspired by Jay Galbraith’s Star Model to assess whether you need to restructure or adapt your business operations to successfully implement your business model:

  * Do your current strategic goals align with the business model?
  * Does your organizational structure support the business model?
  * What processes will you need to implement to support the business model?
  * How can you reward your team and encourage them to align with your business model objective?
  * What people skills do you require to implement the business model?



(Shortform note: The authors suggest that you should organize all of your business operations around your business model. One criticism of this approach is that it doesn’t offer any flexibility for you to adapt your business model—every time you decide to update your business model, you’ll need to reevaluate and realign your entire organization to support your new business model. An alternative approach is to use your company values as a starting point—aligning your business model with your company’s values (instead of vice versa) will allow you the flexibility to innovate without having to evaluate your organizational structure.)
