## Chapter 1: The Social Media Arena

Boxing is a natural metaphor for marketing—boxing and marketing are both aggressive and strategic, and both require dedication and hard work. In _Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook_ , marketing expert Gary Vaynerchuk explains how to land perfect punches in the social media arena.

First, we’ll look at how the rise of social media has changed marketing. Next, we’ll look at how to create great social media content. Finally, we’ll look at individual platforms and how to take advantage of their specific features.

(Shortform note: _Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook_ was published in 2013, so some of the content may be outdated.)

### The Rise of Social Media

These days, **almost everyone has a mobile device and most people are on social media.** There are 325 million mobile subscriptions in the US and the author suspects that almost half of the time people spend on their phones is used for social media.

While it’s normal for new platforms to replace old ones, social media is taking over quickly. To get an audience of 50 million, it took radio (which replaced print) eight years. It took TV (which replaced radio) 13 years. It took Instagram (which replaces everything that’s come before it) 18 months.

**People are so addicted to social media that they expect all media, marketing, and technology to have a social element.** Digital media that _doesn’t_ have a social element, such as banner ads and emails, isn’t as effective anymore. For example, in 2002, the email open rate was 37.3%. By 2011, it was only 17%. Social media is even taking people away from real life—people are on their phones in grocery stores and ignore displays and marketing in their physical surroundings.

**Because social media is so widespread, quick-growing, and popular, businesses and marketers need to create a strong presence on all of the major platforms.** Ideally, businesses will also be early adopters of new platforms.

#### Skepticism and the Early Adoption Advantage

**In spite of the fact that social media is where the population’s attention is focused, most businesses and marketers don’t take advantage of it, especially new platforms.** There are several reasons for this:

  * They think social media doesn’t matter.
  * They don’t understand it.
  * They think it’s a fad that will soon die out.
  * They don’t think it works. (It can take a while for the analytics to show results.) 
  * They’re scared of making a mistake or starting a lawsuit.
    * For example, Pinterest encourages users to share images they don’t own.
  * They don’t have time.



Even once marketers create a presence on one platform (often Facebook because it has such a large audience), they don’t necessarily respect other platforms. Most marketers respond to a new platform like this: Once they hear about it, they spend only a few minutes exploring. The moment they find something low-brow that makes them think the platform’s a waste of time—for example, a nonsensical post about how someone likes ketchup—they abandon it.

**Because of this reluctance to embrace social media, you and your brand don’t face a lot of competition on new platforms.** No one knows which platform will take off, but once one seems to be doing well, invest in it. Explore the platform and if you find silly posts, instead of writing off the platform as silly, consider how you could make better content than what’s currently posted.

Then, spend a year learning the platform more deeply than the average user. This forward-thinking will not only earn you a strong presence on that platform, but it will also earn you media attention (because you’re doing something trailblazing) and make your company attractive to new talent (because you’re progressive).

  * For example, in 2006, YouTube was still maturing. There were lots of silly videos of people mixing Mentos and Coke. The author saw that YouTube had potential though, so he invested in learning how to use it by watching videos and creating his own. He ended up creating successful wine review videos that promoted his wine company.



#### Small vs. Large Businesses: A Matter of Effort

**Embracing a new platform is usually easier for small companies than large ones.** This is because smaller companies are more nimble and don’t necessarily have legal or PR departments that stifle their creativity or bind them in red tape.

However, as platforms become more mainstream and larger companies begin to invest in them, the small business advantage disappears. **Larger companies have higher budgets and more staff that can interact with the community.** For example, a company with ten people answering customer questions on Twitter has an advantage over companies with just one person.

However, a higher budget and large staff aren’t necessarily synonymous with effort. If you’re a smaller company and you work hard to create great content and interact with the community, it doesn’t matter if other companies have more staff. **Effort is how small companies successfully compete with big ones in the social media arena.**

##### How to Interact With Effort

The most important kind of interaction is making customers believe that you care about them. People like to be informed and entertained, but being cared for is so rare that it surprises people and leaves an impression. Make the effort to reply to your customers’ social media queries and concerns.

  * For example, if you were unclear about the timing of a sale in the initial post, go back and clarify, which will strengthen your right hook and your customer relationships.



**When you’re engaging with someone, always tag them.** This both ensures that they see your reply and forces them to return to your brand page to continue the conversation.

  * (Shortform example: If someone comments with a question on your Facebook post, when you respond, don’t only respond to their question; include the @ symbol and her name so that the response is linked to her and she’s notified.)



#### What’s Changed in the Era of Social Media

The rise of social media has ushered in four changes to how marketing works:

**Change #1: Shorter campaign length.** Before social media, big businesses would create 6-month-long campaigns using the same images for outdoor signage, print, and TV. Regardless of whether the campaign was effective, the old one ended and the new one began. Today, every day is a new campaign and requires new content tailored to specific platforms.

**Change #2: Increased customer interaction.** Before social media, traditional marketing was a one-sided conversation. Businesses put ads in the media and customers viewed the ads. Today, however, customers have the opportunity to interact with businesses on social media. They can like posts, ask questions, and demand attention before agreeing to buy something.

**Change #3: Increased affordability of advertising.** Before social media, marketers relied on traditional media such as television ads to distribute their advertising. Today, it’s free to set up a presence on social media and some platforms offer affordable advertising.

  * For example, if you wanted to test out two ads aimed at different demographics on TV, you’d have to spend weeks creating two different ads, and then show them on different channels at different times, depending on when you think the target demographics are watching. You’d have to run them for two weeks so that your demographic would have seen them three times, and this would cost you between $7,000-$13,000. You’d have no way of knowing if people actually saw the ads. In contrast, if you wanted to test out two different ads on Facebook, all you’d have to do is create two targeted posts aimed at different demographics. Targeted posts are free and quick to set up, and you can watch people interact with your posts in real-time as they like or comment.



**Change #4: Decreased reliance on traditional media companies.** Before social media, companies rented their time with customers from traditional media companies. With the advance of social media, however, companies can access their customers on their own, and often for free—real people on social media will distribute your content for you if it’s good enough. Any brand can become its own media company, though it needs to be clear that its media arms aren’t objective—customers won’t put up with a lack of transparency, especially younger ones who have well-honed BS detectors.

  * For example, a sports equipment brand such as Nike could create its own sports programming and no longer rely on ESPN. 



#### What Hasn’t Changed in the Era of Social Media

Social media has changed a lot of things for marketers, but there are six constants:

**Constant #1: Good timing is critical.** A goal of marketing has always been, and always will be, to connect with customers at the moment and place when they’re most likely to purchase. Today that place is social media, but no matter where it ends up being in the future, that’s where you need to be.

**Constant #2: Storytelling is key.** No matter where you’re telling your story, you need to write it in a way that creates enough emotion to make customers want to answer your calls to action. You can change your story often, but it should always include some of the following:

  * Your company’s history
  * Your competitor’s history
  * What your customers are interested in (Shortform example: One day your story might be “Our bathroom cleaner will halve the time you spend doing chores” to appeal to the customers who want more free time. Another day it might be, “Our cleaner is made of biodegradable materials” to appeal to the customers who are concerned about the environment.)
  * What’s going on in the world and how you could relate that to your brand



**Constant #3: Long-form content continues to be relevant.** Social media content is becoming shorter and shorter, but long-form content still has its place. Books, movies, and YouTube videos probably won’t disappear.

**Constant #4: Marketing requires lifelong learning.** No matter what platforms and technologies come into being in the future—or how their algorithms and features evolve—where, when, how you tell the story, and who does the telling will be continually changing. You’ll need to learn new skills on an ongoing basis.

  * For example, just before the author submitted this book to his editor, Instagram put out a 15-second video product and everyone scrambled to figure out how to best use it.



**Constant #5: You need heart, sincerity, engagement, commitment, and hustle.** Marketing is hard and it takes work.

**Constant #6: There are two types of content, “jabs” and “right hooks.”** We’ll look at both in more detail in the next section.

### Jabs and Right Hooks

In marketing, **a metaphorical jab is content that builds the relationship between you and your customer.** Jabs should be intriguing, engaging, entertaining, and/or create some sort of emotional response, such as making people laugh. People might not be ready to buy from you when they first encounter your content, but if you can give them value and make them think you understand them, they’ll be more likely to choose you over a competitor in the future.

For example, on Facebook, Twix posted a photo of snapping a Twix bar in a forest to play off the old question about if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears, does it still make a sound? There was no call to action in the post; it was just meant to make people laugh and remind them of the saying.

**A metaphorical right hook is marketing content that includes a call to action and aims to convert a sale.** There are three characteristics of a good right hook:

  * The call to action is easily comprehensible.
    * For example, on Tumblr, Target posted about a dress and included links that took customers directly to the dress product page.
  * The post works on all digital devices, including mobile.
    * The dress post looked good on both the desktop and mobile versions of Tumblr.
  * The post meets the conventions of the platform.
    * The post included a GIF (a short, looping series of images) that showed a dress from several angles. GIFs are a standard on Tumblr.



This Tumblr post from Amazon is an example of a right hook. Notice the price in the copy:

![jabjab-amazon.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-amazon.png)

**While the right hook is the content that creates a sale, jabs are just as important**. If you were in a boxing ring with an opponent, you couldn’t just throw a right hook out of nowhere; your opponent would slip out of the way. You need to set up an opportunity to throw the hook by throwing jabs first. It’s the same in marketing—**before you ask a customer for a sale, you need to build a relationship with them.** Jabs create reciprocity: When you’re given so much, people feel almost obligated to give back when you finally do throw your hook.

#### “Boxing” Combinations

There’s no universal formula for creating a perfect combination of marketing jabs and hooks, except that you’ll always have to throw more jabs than hooks. Additionally, **well-established brands don’t have to jab as often as start-ups or brands that are trying to rebuild their reputations.** For example, after BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the company had to jab a lot more often then it did previously.

**To find the perfect combination for your brand, you have to pay attention to what’s going on on social media, look at your analytics, constantly experiment, and then analyze the results.** Consider what happens when you post at different times, use different hashtags, use slang, and so on.

These kinds of analyses take time and money, but the investment is worth it because you’ll end up with a step-by-step method for telling your brand's story. However, **keep in mind that your formula, once you figure it out, only applies broadly—you can’t repeat the same move too many times or it won’t be effective.** Just like in boxing, one attack might work on one opponent but not another.

#### Study Your “Opponent”

It’s important, as a boxer or a marketer, to study your opponent’s (customers’) techniques. A boxer watches videos of her opponent to try to figure out her weaknesses and strengths to create a strategy so that when they meet in the ring, she’s prepared. Marketers need to pay attention to their audiences too—what are they interested in? It’s even easier to study your audience than it is for a boxer to study an opponent because as a marketer, you have access to data mining and real-time feedback.

(Shortform note: We've reorganized the order of some of the book’s material to add clarity. Chiefly, we’ve placed the general material that applies to all platforms in the first two chapters of the summary, and the discussion of specific platforms in the subsequent chapters.)
