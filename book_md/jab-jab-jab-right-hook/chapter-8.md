## Chapter 8: Up-and-Coming Platforms

In this chapter, the author covers four platforms that weren’t very social at his time of writing, but that he believed had the potential to become social as users demanded this functionality from everything in their lives.

(Shortform note: Two of the platforms the author mentions in this chapter—Google+ and Vine—are no longer operational. However, we’ve included information on them to give an insight into the types of content that the author thought would become popular.)

### LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a business-oriented site that allows professionals to network with each other. It also allows people to share samples of their work, articles, and reviews.

**The audience:** In 2013, LinkedIn had 200 million members. Over 2.8 million companies have a company page.

**Who uses it:** LinkedIn is used by students, college graduates, Fortune 500 company executives, and many other professionals.

**Why they use it:** People use LinkedIn to make professional connections, find jobs, find employees, and learn about the workplace.

#### Notable Features

LinkedIn has several features:

  * **Access to a professional audience.** B2B marketers, who sell directly to businesses, can more easily access their customers on LinkedIn compared to other social media platforms.
  * **Less content.** Because LinkedIn is a business site, there’s less distracting, non-professional content to compete with.
  * **Support for long-form copy.** LinkedIn allows for long copy because people who go to LinkedIn are seeking information.



### Google+

Google+ is a social network that’s similar to Facebook. **The audience:** 500 million users have Google+ accounts, however, many of these users aren’t active. Anyone who uses any of Google’s other products, such as YouTube, is automatically assigned a Google+ account.

**Who uses it:** Early tech influencers use Google+. Few other people use it because it’s so similar to Facebook.

**Why they use it:** Early tech influencers are on Google+ because they hope it might take off.

#### Notable Features

Google+ has several features:

  * **Higher-ranked search results.** Google’s search prioritizes its own products, so your Google+ marketing will come up higher in a search than posts on other platforms.
  * **Google Glass features.** If Google Glass replaces mobile phones, Google could make Google+ the only platform on which Glass content could be viewed and shared. 



### Vine

Vine is a platform for sharing six-second looping videos. At the time the book was published, Vine had just come out and was too new for the author to have a lot of advice about it.

**The audience:** Vine had 13 million users as of June 2013, six months after it was launched.

**Who uses it:** Vine is popular with 8-to-21-year-olds. The author predicts the demographic will expand.

**Why they use it:** Vine provides a variety of content, and the content is short so people don’t feel like they’re going to get sucked in.

#### Notable Features

Vine has several features:

  * **Time limit.** Many people don’t want to watch videos because they don’t know how long they’ll take, but because Vine limits all videos to six seconds, there’s little commitment.
  * **Forced creativity.** The six-second limitation forces marketers to be creative. The best videos are edited instead of the whole video being one six-second take.



### Snapchat

Snapchat is a platform that sends photos and videos that self-destruct after being viewed or watched. A message is called a “snap.”

**The audience:** As of February 2013, people sent 60 million snaps per day. (Shortform note: Unlike for other platforms, the author didn’t give the number of Snapchat users.)

**Who uses it:** Snapchat is popular with young people.

**Why they use it:** Snapchat has a reputation for being used for sexting, but in fact, it’s more commonly used for sharing jokes. People want quick laughs.

#### Notable Features

Snapchat has one notable feature:

  * **Attention-grabbing.** Since each snap is only visible once, customers pay more attention to it.
