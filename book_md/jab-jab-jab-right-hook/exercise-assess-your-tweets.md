## Exercise: Assess Your Tweets

Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms, so it’s important to tweet effectively.

* * *

Navigate to or recall one of your brand’s recent tweets. What hashtags did you use, if any? What memorable and idiosyncratic hashtags could you add to strengthen the tweet?

What’s the voice of the tweet? How could you align it more with your brand identity? How might you amend it to match the voice of native Twitter content (for example, by using irony, if appropriate)?

Look at the hashtags that are currently trending. How could you relate one of these to your brand to trendjack? What would your trendjacking tweet say?
