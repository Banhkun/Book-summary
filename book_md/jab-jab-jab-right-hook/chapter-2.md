## Chapter 2: Creating Great Content

Now that you better understand the social media arena, it’s time to learn about how to create great jabs and hooks. Social media campaigns should be simple and focus on these two elements:

  1. Jab constantly. Social media requires attention 24/7.
  2. Talk about what people are talking about. This creates engagement.



This chapter will discuss six rules and 11 tips that will help you craft great content for your campaigns.

### Six Rules for Using Social Media

There are six rules to creating engaging, relevant content that people on social media will want to read or view. These six rules apply to any platform.

#### Rule #1: Use Native Content

Every platform has its own unique design, tone, culture, and aesthetic, and **native content is content that mirrors the form and content of the platform it appears on.** For example, user-generated content on Instagram is typically beautiful photos, so native content on Instagram would also be beautiful photos.

Customers go on social media because they want something of value, whether that’s a break from stress or news, or to connect with friends.**If you employ native content, your content gives people the same value that they’re seeking.** Your company’s posts feel like they’re coming from a real person and your customers are just as interested in reading your posts as they would be in reading their friends’.

For example, the earliest TV ads were people talking about products, which wasn’t anything like the kind of content that appeared on TV. Eventually, marketers started coming up with ads that were like TV shows—the ads became story-driven scenes with characters. The native content was far more effective and commercials became part of the TV-watching experience.

#### Rule #2: Don’t Interrupt

Before social media, it was fine for ads to interrupt customers from their media. Commercials interrupted TV shows, and no matter how native they were, there was still a hard break between what people were watching and the commercial.

Today, however, if you interrupt people, you’re doomed, because people’s expectations have changed. **People have more control over what advertising they see now—pop-up blockers and commercial-skipping devices abound—and being forced to look at your ad at best annoys someone and at worst makes them hate your brand.** In particular, don’t use mobile banner ads, which are a huge interruption because they block almost the whole mobile screen (and they’re overpriced).

To avoid interrupting people, your content needs to:

  * Include more jabs than hooks.
  * Be native. Ads need to be just as entertaining or informative as a regular post so that they don’t annoy people or break the spell of the social media experience.
  * Offer something of value, such as a joke that brightens a user’s day.



#### Rule #3: Tailor Your Jabs to the Customer’s Desires

Leo Burnett, an expert advertiser, said that good content should be simple, memorable, inviting, and fun. The author adds that good content should also be aimed at meeting your audience’s goals, not yours. Right hooks are about your company, but jabs are all about the customer.

How do you find out what the customer wants? Consider what kinds of apps they use. The three most popular categories are:

  * **Utility**(notepads, maps, and so on). The popularity of utility apps tells you that people want things that are useful.
    * For example, if you’re a cosmetics company, you might appeal to people’s desire for information by posting a video tutorial about how to choose lipstick colors.
  * **Recreation** (music and games). The popularity of entertainment apps tells you that people want escape.
    * The cosmetics company might appeal to people’s desire for entertainment by posting music videos and then starting a conversation about stage makeup.
  * **Social**(social media). The popularity of social apps tells you that people value their relationships with others.
    * The cosmetics company might appeal to people’s desire for human interaction simply by chatting with potential customers about what they’re interested in, no matter how tangential it is to cosmetics.



#### Rule #4: Take Advantage of Pop Culture

Pop culture is a large part of what defines a generation.**If you show your followers that you’re in their loop and share their interests, whether that’s by talking about a popular song or sharing celebrity gossip, your brand will come across as human.**

For example, on Tumblr, comedian Paul Scheer posted a GIF about _Breaking Bad_ to insert himself into a topic that people were already discussing.

#### Rule #5: Keep Your Jabs Brief and Nimble

**Your jabs should be what the author calls micro-content—short content that responds to current events and culture.**

For example, in 2013, when the power went out during the Superdome, **Oreo put out a 4-word tweet with a photo of an Oreo in the dark with overlaid text. This was the first time a brand had reacted to an event as a real person would.** The tweet didn’t have any calls to action—it was just supposed to be entertaining and remind people that Oreos existed. Oreo was able to do this because they planned ahead—they put together a team that was on call to respond to whatever happened.

![jabjab-oreo-original.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-oreo-original.png)

This is also an example of why it’s good to be the first to a platform. Oreo’s post was revolutionary because it was the first of its type; other brands who later reacted to pop culture in real time were less notable.

#### Rule #6: Maintain Your Identity

**Know who your brand is and know its message, and always keep both of these things in mind while creating your content.** Your content should always be in line with your brand’s identity.

However, it’s fine (and even encouraged) to use different platforms and jabs to share different stories. Likewise, you don’t have to always keep the same tone—for example, some of your content can be light-hearted, while some can be more “serious” and factual.

### 11 Tips for Creating Great Posts

Many of the qualities that make content excel or flop aren’t platform-specific. Below are 11 tips for creating great posts on any platform.

**Tip #1: Keep the text short and simple.** Make it as easy as possible for your followers to consume and engage with your content.

  * Example of bad content on Facebook: Mercedes-Benz posted far too much text about an upcoming car. All they needed was a sentence about the car’s luxurious interior and a link to the review. 



![jabjab-Mercedes.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-Mercedes.png)

  * Example of good content on Twitter: On National Sibling Day, Netflix posted a short, relevant line from _Arrested Development_ , which they had just recently aired. The only other text was a hashtag and link. 



![jabjab-netflix-original.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-netflix-original.png)

**Tip #2: Make the content interesting and intriguing.** People go on social media to be entertained, so make sure your content fulfills this wish.

  * Example of bad content on Facebook: Subaru posted dull, boring text—a link to a review, with no indication that the review was positive and interesting. This dull, boring text was accompanied by a dull, boring photo—half the photo is taken up by pavement and the vehicle’s too small to make out detail. 



![jabjab-subaru2.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-subaru2.png)

  * Example of good content on Facebook: Mini Cooper posted a photo of someone driving a car through the snow in Switzerland with the top down, which made viewers curious about how that could possibly be done. 



![jabjab-mini.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-mini.png)

**Tip #3: Make sure the call to action is appropriately placed and links to the right place.** People don’t want to be linked to the home page of a website when they’re trying to access the product page of whatever’s featured in the post.

  * Example of bad content on Facebook: One of Land Rover’s posts linked to another Land Rover Facebook post, not the relevant page on the Land Rover website.
  * Example of good content on Pinterest: Lauren Conrad posted a photo of a woman with toned legs to advertise her workout program and the photo links to her blog, which contains the workout. 



![jabjab-laurenconrad.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-laurenconrad.png)

**Tip #4: Include a price on your right hooks.** Including a price increases the amount of engagement with your post.

  * Example of good content on Tumblr: Burger King posted an image of cheeseburgers, and gave the price of a combo in the accompanying text.



![jabjab-burgerking.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-burgerking.png)

**Tip #5: Use a good quality photo.** It’s often appropriate to overlay your logo, slogan, or short, relevant text over the photo.

  * Example of bad content on Facebook: Zeitgeist posted a photo that’s so small, dark, and blurry you can’t even tell what it is. 



![jabjab-zeitgeist.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-zeitgeist.png)

  * Example of good content on Facebook: Cone Palace hires professional photographers to shoot the photos they post on Facebook. 



![jabjab-conepalace.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-conepalace.png)

**Tip #6: Include your logo or slogan.** If you don’t, people may not realize that the post is from your brand.

  * Example of bad content on Facebook: Luke’s Lobster not only didn’t include their own logo on a photo of their food, the photo included Cape Cod chips, so anyone looking at it might think the post was authored by Cape Cod. 



![jabjab-capecod.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-capecod.png)

  * (Shortform example of good content on Facebook: Pizza Hut put their logo and website at the bottom of this post so no one could miss it.) 



![jabjab-pizzahut.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-pizzahut.png)

**Tip #7: Invite fans to engage.** In your post, ask your fans questions and give them the opportunity to respond in the comments.

  * Example of bad content on Twitter: Lacoste asked its fans what they would do today if they could only do one thing, which would have been a conversation-starter, had they not immediately answered their own question with “shop.” 



![jabjab-lacoste.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-lacoste.png)

  * Example of good content on Facebook: Football player Reggie Bush asked his fans for their expertise about rowing.



![jabjab-Reggie.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-Reggie.png)

**Tip #8: Employ gamification.** Post games or contests to engage with people.

  * Example of bad content on Pinterest: Lululemon posted a yes/no flowchart that people could play through in order to find their perfect yoga mat. Unfortunately, the post failed to include a link to where the customers could buy the mats, so people couldn’t actually finish or “win” the game—all they ended up with was the name of a mat, not a way to actually get the mat.
  * Example of good content on Instagram: The Meatball Shop encouraged fans to tag photos of their best meatball moments with a hashtag. The best three photos would be featured on the shop’s social media and the photographers given hats. This prize encouraged people to play. 



![jabjab-meatballshop.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-meatballshop.png)

**Tip #9: Showcase your fans.** Share, retweet, repin, or regram in other people’s posts and images to show that you’re reading other people’s content, you share interests, and you pay attention.

  * Example of good content on Instagram: Ben & Jerry’s asked a fan if they could post a photo she took of a bowl, spoon, and ice cream. They credited her for the photo. 



![jabjab-benandjerrys.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-benandjerrys.png)

**Tip #10: Time the post properly.** If you post at an inappropriate time, people may not see your content.

  * Example of bad content on Facebook: Kit Kat posted about the 2013 Super Bowl at 6 a.m. EST. The two teams in the competition that year were the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers, and while Baltimore fans _might_ have seen the post if they were up early, 6 a.m. EST is 3 a.m. in San Francisco. 



![jabjab-kitkat.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-kitkat.png)

  * Example of good content on Twitter: Shakespeare Pizza related pizza to the planet on Earth Day. 



![jabjab-Shakespeare.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-Shakespeare.png)

**Tip #11: Cross-pollinate.** If you have a good following on one platform, use it to advertise your presence on a platform where your following is smaller.

  * Example of good content on Twitter: Surf Taco has a Twitter following that’s almost 13 times larger than its Instagram following. On Twitter, they linked to an Instagram photo. (Note—Twitter has cut off Instagram integration due to competition, so Instagram photos don’t load natively anymore.)
