## Exercise: Fit Meditation Into Your Life

Now that you’ve had a brief overview of some different beliefs and practices, think about how you could apply what you’ve learned to your own life.

* * *

Of the types of meditation we discussed in this Master Guide, note down the one that appeals to you most and explain why it resonates with you. (For instance, maybe _metta_ appeals to you because you value compassion.)

What’s one way practicing that style of meditation could help you in your daily life? (For example, practicing _metta_ could help you develop greater compassion for a difficult colleague, improving your work life.)

How do you plan to incorporate that style of meditation into your schedule? (For instance, you might practice _metta_ each day just before bed, to end the day on a compassionate note.)
