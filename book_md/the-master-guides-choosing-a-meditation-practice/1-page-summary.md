## 1-Page Summary

Do you struggle with anxiety, stress, or other strong emotions? Are you struggling to find time to relax in the busy modern world? If so, you could benefit from meditation: a practice that many people find helpful for reducing stress, sharpening focus, and getting their thoughts in order. In fact, a Zen proverb says you should meditate for 20 minutes every day—and if you think you’re too busy for that, then you should probably meditate for an _hour_ every day. People from all walks of life, both religious and secular, have practiced and written about meditation for thousands of years, and it continues to be a popular relaxation method today.

In this Master Guide, we’ll compile advice on meditation from some of its most respected experts and teachers, ranging from yogis and Buddhist monks to present-day self-help experts like Jen Sincero and Julia Cameron. To help you find the meditation practice that’s right for you, we’ll explore the meditation practices of four major traditions: Buddhism, Hinduism (yoga), Christianity (prayer), and modern Western thought. For each, we’ll explain that tradition’s key beliefs and practices; then, we’ll discuss the main benefits of that style of meditation. We’ll close by offering some tips for incorporating meditation into a busy modern lifestyle.

### Buddhist Meditation

First, let’s explore the meditation practices of Buddhism: a religion often associated with meditation and mindfulness. Buddhism focuses on finding happiness through self-improvement,**** rather than through understanding God or seeking divine guidance.

**Buddhism is helpful for learning acceptance** —the ability to recognize and acknowledge problems without becoming overwhelmed by them. Buddhist meditations are particularly helpful for **managing strong emotions such as anxiety, anger, and grief.**

#### Background: Buddhist Beliefs

The core tenet of Buddhism is following a balanced lifestyle of neither rejecting pleasures nor chasing them:**“** the middle way,” as Siddhartha Gautama, better known as the Buddha, phrased it. In this way, he and his followers were able to fully enjoy the good things in their lives, yet remain calm and patient when those pleasures were absent.

The Buddha taught that **people are unhappy because they chase after pleasure, but those pleasures are temporary.** That leaves people dissatisfied and always wanting more. However, the Buddha also offered hope in the form of the Noble Eightfold Path, which he promised would eliminate those frustrating desires and bring inner peace.

The Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism consists of the following eight practices—**note that meditation is a crucial part of the path** :

  1. Correct understanding—seeing the world as it truly is, instead of as you want it to be
  2. Correct thought—rejecting thoughts of desire and animosity
  3. Correct speech—avoiding lies and hurtful words
  4. Correct action—ethical behavior
  5. Correct livelihood—avoiding occupations that cause harm directly (like fighting in wars) or indirectly (like selling alcohol or other drugs)
  6. Correct effort—working tirelessly toward enlightenment
  7. Correct mindfulness—awareness of yourself, your mental and physical state, and your surroundings
  8. Correct concentration—single-minded focus; meditation



Taken together, these eight practices establish a lifestyle that Buddhists believe will release them from desire and suffering, allowing them to live happy, fulfilling lives.

#### Styles of Buddhist Meditation

Two popular types of Buddhist meditation are vipassana and metta.

##### Vipassana: Mindfulness

The Buddhist monk Bhante Henepola Gunaratana describes vipassana meditation in his book _Mindfulness in Plain English. **Vipassana will help you to recognize that your impulses—your desires and aversions—have no power over you.**_ With that understanding, you’ll be able to take thoughtful, _mindful_ actions, instead of simply reacting to your moment-to-moment impulses.

In vipassana meditation, you examine the processes of perception and thought, and learn to separate them. In other words, you acknowledge what you see, hear, smell, feel, or experience in any way—**but you do so without judgments or reactions.**

For example, if you smell a skunk, you would simply acknowledge that it’s the smell of a skunk; you wouldn’t judge it as unpleasant, try to ignore it, or close a window to shut it out. The same goes for any emotions that arise during your meditation: Recognize and acknowledge them, but don’t judge them as positive or negative, and don’t try to embrace them or push them away. Simply allow your experiences to arise and pass naturally, in their own time.

Gunaratana recommends using your own breath as a focus for your meditation. Note each step of each breath: inhaling, holding the breath in your lungs, and exhaling. Notice how quickly and how deeply you’re breathing, but don’t try to change how you breathe during your meditation—just observe.

From this central focus of breathing, note all other physical and mental phenomena that arise—in other words, any distractions—again without judging them or trying to control them.

At times, you’ll find yourself incapable of wrangling your mind from thinking random thoughts. You’ll not be aware of where the thoughts come from, and you’ll feel crazy. **Realize that your mind has always been this way—you’ve just never noticed before.** Gently but firmly return to your focus. Don’t get upset or judge yourself for straying. Don’t try to force things out of your mind; doing so only adds energy to the thoughts, and it’ll make them return stronger.

When you’re first starting out with vipassana, set small goals. For instance, try to focus for just one inhalation and exhalation. You’ll still fail at times, but keep at it.

Through vipassana, you’ll learn a great deal about yourself. For example, you’ll discover why you experience emotions like greed, hatred, and anger, and you’ll learn not to let those feelings control you. You’ll learn how to accept things that you dislike, such as the idea of growing old or having your mistakes pointed out.****

##### Metta: Lovingkindness

Another type of Buddhist meditation is _metta_ , translated as “lovingkindness.” Psychologist Tara Brach discusses this practice in _Radical Acceptance_ , where she describes metta as a wish for others’ health and happiness.

Practicing metta involves mentally sending love to people you like, people you don’t like, and people who’ve helped you. This kind of meditation allows you to practice compassion toward _everyone_ —even those who’ve hurt you. By doing so, you’ll discover that you’re capable of deep feelings of compassion; eventually, after practicing metta for long enough, you’ll have intense feelings of vicarious joy and sympathy even for people you’ve never met. Wishing for universal peace and happiness helps you to reconnect with the essential goodness that exists in all people.

Traditionally, when practicing metta, you begin with yourself: **Reflect on your own innate goodness, and offer yourself wishes for peace, joy, and feelings of metta.**

After that, expand your circle of lovingkindness to include the people closest to you. It’s often easiest to begin with a single person: the one whose goodness is easiest for you to see. This could be a child, a parent, a grandparent, or a friend—there’s no “correct” person to choose. Once you have someone in mind, meditate on what you love about that person and offer them the same wish for happiness that you offered yourself.

Once that’s done, widen your circle of metta to include other people whom you’re close to, then people you don’t know as well, and, eventually, people whom you don’t know at all.

**The most challenging part of this exercise is to experience lovingkindness for those who stir feelings of dislike or anger in you.** Offering those people wishes of peace and happiness is likely to feel forced and hollow at first. However, if you acknowledge those negative feelings and let them pass (as in vipassana meditation), you can continue offering your well-wishes. In doing so, you’ll find that those wishes start feeling more sincere—in other words, by offering love to others even when you don’t mean it, you’ll start to awaken genuine caring feelings within yourself.

### Hindu Meditation and Yoga

The next practice we’ll explore is Hindu meditation, which is sometimes referred to as _yoga_. Yoga translates as “union”: Its purpose is to unite your consciousness with God. This sense of connection can help alleviate feelings of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. But, even if you’re not Hindu (or not religious at all), practicing yoga can build physical strength, reduce stress, and improve your ability to focus.

#### Background: Hindu Beliefs

In _Autobiography of a Yogi_ , Paramahansa Yogananda—a famous yoga practitioner and teacher—briefly explains yoga’s core practices. These include physical, mental, and behavioral disciplines collectively called the Eightfold Path of Yoga (sometimes called the Eight Limbs of Yoga). Note that while one of the steps of the Eightfold Path is itself meditation, the other practices can help you meditate more effectively.

  1. **Yama: behaviors to avoid.** The five Yamas are violence (in action, speech, and thought), lying, stealing, sex, and greed. These are selfish behaviors that cause you to focus on yourself instead of God, and therefore block you from reaching enlightenment.
  2. **Niyama: good deeds, or duties to observe.** The five Niyamas are cleanliness, contentment, discipline, learning, and devotion to God. These practices create a healthy physical and mental environment, allowing you to more effectively seek God.
  3. **Asana: posture.** Holding yourself in a stable and comfortable position allows for extended meditation. This helps you to build physical strength and discipline, thereby gaining better control over your own body.
  4. **Pranayama: breathing exercises.** Controlling your breathing helps you to strengthen your discipline and deepen your meditation.
  5. **Pratyahara: inward focus.** This means detaching your senses from the outside world. Directing all your attention to your own thoughts and moment-to-moment experiences helps you to build mindfulness and gain a greater understanding of yourself.
  6. **Dharana: concentration.** This involves focusing on a single thought for extended periods of time, which helps you build mental strength and discipline.
  7. **Dhyana: meditation.** This is**** a state of calm and focus that you can achieve by practicing Dharana.
  8. **Samadhi: expanded consciousness.** This is**** an all-seeing, all-knowing state of bliss achieved by temporarily joining your consciousness to God. Yogis like Yogananda say that samadhi requires years of intense, dedicated training to achieve.



#### Styles of Yoga

In this section, we’ll discuss two styles of yoga: _hatha yoga_ , which emphasizes physical exercises (asana), and _kriya yoga_ , which focuses on breathing exercises and controlling your life energy (pranayama).

##### Hatha Yoga

_Hatha yoga_ is what most Westerners imagine when they think of yoga: a form of exercise that trains flexibility and balance. While most forms of meditation are about mastering your mind, hatha yoga focuses on **helping you master your body by building up physical strength and control.**

This is probably the easiest type of meditation to find a teacher for—odds are there’s a gym or yoga studio near you where you can take classes in hatha yoga. Taking a class will also give you a fixed schedule for practicing your yoga, which can help you work it into an already-busy lifestyle.

Hatha yoga can benefit anyone who’s physically able to do it, but psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk (_The Body Keeps the Score_) says it’s especially helpful for trauma survivors for several reasons. First, yoga’s inherent focus on the breath—moving with each inhale and exhale, noticing whether your breath is fast or slow, and counting breaths in certain poses—**helps control your heart rate,** which in turn helps you to stay calm and stave off anxiety attacks.

Second,**yoga teaches you to listen and respond to your body,** ultimately helping you to be more connected to and comfortable in it. You need to feel connected to your body to have a sense of self; if you can’t understand what your body is telling you (for example, are you hungry, or are you anxious?), then you can’t identify how you feel or what you need, and you won’t be able to properly take care of yourself. Feeling safe in your body also helps you articulate your emotions and even traumatic memories that were previously overwhelming.

Third, **yoga teaches you to notice the emotions connected to certain physical sensations;** this is especially critical for trauma sufferers, because certain physical sensations and poses can trigger flashbacks. (For example, many sexual assault survivors panic in poses that have them lying on their backs with their feet up in the air.) As long as you approach yoga at a slow pace and avoid becoming overwhelmed, the practice can help you work through those intense emotions.

Finally, yoga and body awareness improve your sense of time. Trauma causes people to feel stuck in their traumatic memory, and you may struggle to be present. Yoga **encourages you to be present by focusing on your breath and body sensations, and it reinforces the fact that experiences are temporary.**(For example, as hard as this pose may be, you only need to endure it for 10 breaths.)

##### Kriya Yoga

Kriya yoga is a particular style of yoga that**heavily emphasizes _pranayama_ : breathing exercises and controlling your inner life energy (called _prana_). **This is the form of yoga that Paramahansa Yogananda (_Autobiography of a Yogi_) practiced.

While we’re all born knowing how to breathe correctly, that skill fades as we age. By adulthood, most people are only using one-third of their total lung capacity, and therefore taking three times as many breaths as they need to. **Re-learning to breathe correctly strengthens your lungs and your immune system.**

Yogananda explains that these breathing exercises remove toxins from the blood, which allows life energy to flow more freely. You might picture pranayama as removing trash (toxins) that’s blocking the flow of a river (blood and life energy).

Once your life energy is flowing freely, you focus it around your central nervous system (that is, your spine and brain), which strengthens your natural ability to perceive and understand God. This is called the Kriya Technique, from which kriya yoga takes its name.

A few of kriya yoga’s other techniques include:

**Energization Exercises:** A series of breathing exercises that takes about 15 minutes to perform. These exercises help you to consciously draw in spiritual energy from the world around you, using it to strengthen your body and release tension.

**Hong-Sau Technique of Concentration:** Withdrawing your attention from the world around you, focusing it entirely inward to help you solve a problem or meditate on God.

**Aum Technique of Meditation:** Developing your own divine qualities by meditating on God, and experiencing God as an omnipresent and universal force. In other words, understanding that God is present in all things, and that you are part of God.

### Christian Meditation

In the previous section, we saw how meditation can be a form of prayer—a means of getting closer to God. Now, we’ll discuss how Christian prayer specifically can be a form of meditation, with all of the associated benefits.

#### Background: Christian Beliefs

Christianity is the belief that Jesus Christ is the son of God and God’s will given human form. In the Christian religion, the only way to be saved (to reach heaven) is to pray and follow God and Jesus’s teachings. **Prayer is the act of communicating with God,** either directly or through an intermediary such as Jesus or a saint.

Christian minister Norman Vincent Peale (_The Power of Positive Thinking)_ says that faith in God and prayer result in a greater sense of well-being, robust health and energy, and a stronger sense of purpose in the world. He also notes that the power of prayer can slow the aging process, helping you keep youthful energy as you age. Finally, prayer can help keep your spirits up, send you out each morning feeling refreshed and renewed, guide you in solving problems, and help you react properly to what’s happening around you.

#### Prayer

Christianity has many formalized prayers, but you can also speak to God in your own words—what matters most is that you keep your attention on God and have absolute faith that He will protect and guide you.

In _Seeking Wisdom_ , teacher and self-help author Julia Cameron describes two different types of prayer that you could start with:

##### Prayers of Request

A request prayer is when you ask God for something, such as inspiration or a new friend. **Request prayers are crucial because they’re how you receive God’s guidance** —you make your request, then you listen for the response.

God’s responses can come in many forms, like a gut feeling, a new opportunity, or an abrupt change in your circumstances—you must listen to the signs and trust your intuition about what they mean. Sometimes God’s response won’t be what you wanted or expected, but above all else, you must trust Him.

##### Prayers of Appreciation

Prayers of appreciation involve expressing gratitude for the things you have, the guidance you’ve been given, and God’s gifts. These prayers are important because **they bring you feelings of prosperity and abundance that will attract even more positivity and abundance back to you.** Praying about the things you appreciate helps reinforce your belief in the innate goodness of God and the world.

To begin expressing your appreciation through prayer, you could observe the beauty of nature. When you observe things like green grass, intense snowstorms, and rumbling rivers, you often enter a state of awe, which is a great starting point for prayer. Use the energy of awe to express your gratitude for God’s beautiful gift of nature.

Once you’re in the practice of expressing your appreciation, try adding a few specific topics into your prayers: For example, you might thank God for other people, miraculous events, or experiences of serendipity.

### Western Meditation

While often drawing from traditional meditation philosophies and techniques, some meditation practices don’t fit neatly under any specific religion or spiritual tradition. Since these practices largely come from the United States, we’ll call this category Western meditation.

#### Meditation for Creating the Life You Want

Many forms of Western meditation are based on the idea that there’s a universal source of infinite power and knowledge, and you can tap into it by harnessing your thoughts and willpower. This isn’t necessarily a religious belief; some people believe that this universal source is God, but others might call it “the universe,” “Source Power,” or simply “a higher power.”

Rhonda Byrne’s book _The Secret_ popularized this belief. In it, Byrne teaches you to take advantage of the Law of Attraction: the idea that your thoughts will “attract” whatever you think about. In other words, **you can create the life you want by simply believing that it will happen.**

Think of yourself as a transmission tower, like the ones used to broadcast signals to your television. Those signals become pictures on the screen. If you don’t like the show you’re watching, you change the channel to a new frequency. A new picture is broadcast. Through a similar process, your thoughts create a frequency that signals the universe, and the Law of Attraction broadcasts that signal back to you as the pictures of your life.

In _You Are a Badass_ , Jen Sincero argues that meditation is a way to connect to the universe (what she calls Source Energy), get into top mental and spiritual shape, and create the life you want. She argues that even beyond helping you to manifest your dream life, the practice has many benefits: Meditation will bring you into the present moment, open you up to receive unlimited information and ideas, relax you, relieve stress, strengthen your intuition and focus, let you hear your inner voice more clearly, fill you with light and love, put you in a good mood, and help you love yourself.

She notes that basic meditation is quite simple:

  * Sit in a comfortable cross-legged position, with your hands on your knees or in your lap.
  * Sit up straight; relax your face, jawline, and forehead. 
  * Close your eyes (or keep them open, gazing at a spot on the ground). 
  * Focus on your breathing. 
  * Release any thoughts that come into your brain, and focus back on breathing. 
  * Keep your mind as clear and empty as possible; listen for flashes of intuition.



##### Goal-Oriented Meditation

To harness the universal source, you must have a specific goal in mind—in other words, to get what you want, you first have to _know_ what you want. Once you know your goal, achieving it is a matter of **focusing your thoughts on what you want and truly believing that it will happen.**

Sincero __ offers the following tips for keeping your thoughts focused:

  * Set a timer to avoid distracting yourself by checking a clock.
  * Light a candle and focus on it. A focal point can help you get centered.
  * Imagine a beam of light coming from the sky and going through you from your head through your entire body, then back up to the sky again (in other words, traveling full circle). This can help you feel more energy and light and more deeply connect you to Source Energy.
  * Use a mantra. This can help you chase out unwelcome thoughts.
  * Meditate first thing in the morning before starting your day. The day’s activities can distract you.
  * Set an intention. Meditating is about receiving information from The Universe, as opposed to prayer, which is sending information out to The Universe. You can start with your intention and see if any answers come to you while you meditate. Or, you can meditate first, opening up the channels and clearing out the chatter; then, ask your question and see if anything comes to you.
  * Consider guided meditation. Many books and videos walk you through meditation. These can be helpful when you’re just starting out and having trouble chasing out unwelcome thoughts.
  * Chanting is also a way to get into a meditative state. Chanting means repeating a mantra over and over out loud, by yourself or in a group class.
  * Transcendental meditation instruction may also be helpful; this involves repeating mantras and sitting twice a day for a set period of time.



#### Meditation for Focus

In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey discusses how to practice meditation and mindfulness to help you “hyperfocus.” Meditation and mindfulness improve your ability to hyperfocus because they increase your working memory capacity. Your working memory capacity dictates how much information you can pay attention to—the bigger it is, the more information you can process simultaneously. Furthermore, these practices improve the quality of your attention in general.

While many people use the terms meditation and mindfulness interchangeably, Bailey does not. He explains that when you meditate, you focus on a single thing and bring your attention back to it when your mind wanders. When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to _everything_ you experience in a given moment. For example, if you wash dishes mindfully, you pay attention to everything that happens moment-by-moment, like how the water feels on your skin or how it sounds as it hits the sink.

To meditate, sit down and focus on nothing but your breathing for a given amount of time each day. For best results, Bailey encourages you to start small: Meditate only for an amount of time that feels easy. He also encourages trying guided meditations with apps like Headspace.

To practice mindfulness, Bailey encourages you to **pick a single daily task and be mindful during it.** In other words, notice everything that happens as you do that task. For best results, choose a task that occupies very little working memory, like eating a meal.

### Tips for Starting to Meditate

Here are some general tips to help you start meditating, regardless of which style (or styles) of meditation you practice.

#### Tip #1: Start Small

If you’re struggling to figure out how meditation can fit into your schedule, or if getting started seems daunting, begin with very short meditation sessions. For example, in _You Are a Badass_ , self-help author Jen Sincero says that just five minutes a day is enough to get you started. You can then start making your meditations longer at whatever rate feels natural to you.

#### Tip #2: Build a Support Network

In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , the authors suggest seeking outside support when tackling difficult or daunting goals (like building a new meditation practice). They offer these two strategies:

**1) Talk with a third party.** When you’re in the midst of a challenging situation, it’s hard to see the bigger picture. Get an unbiased outside perspective to help you keep things objective and rational as you decipher your emotions and determine the best route forward. When possible, get advice from an expert—ask them about their methods, then try to implement some of their suggestions into your day-to-day life.

**2) Publicize your goals.** Working toward goals can be stressful. This stress often makes people abandon their objectives before they achieve them, especially when no one knows about them. When creating goals for yourself, share them and ask other people to hold you accountable. This gives you a support system to motivate you when faced with emotional obstacles that make you want to quit.

#### Tip #3: Try Active Meditation

Meditation doesn’t have to mean sitting quietly. **If you’re feeling restless, you could try awalking meditation,** as journalist Dan Harris describes in _10% Happier. _Find a space where you can walk comfortably. Begin walking slowly back and forth along this path. While you walk, focus only on the process of walking. Think about each step you take: picking up your foot, moving your leg, and placing your foot back down. Harris notes that walking meditation isn’t the same as mindlessly pacing—you’re still focusing and constantly refocusing your attention when it wanders.

A variation on walking meditation is what self-help author Cal Newport (_Deep Work_) calls **productive meditation—thinking about a problem while doing a low-intensity physical activity**, such as walking or showering. This helps with problem-solving in two ways: First, the activity typically takes you away from distractions like your smartphone. Second, you train your ability to focus on the problem at hand, rather than daydreaming while doing a routine task.

Hatha yoga, which we discussed earlier in this Master Guide, is a more strenuous form of active meditation.
