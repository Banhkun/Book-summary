## Exercise: Reflect on How You Collaborate

The way our brains collaborate makes us a social species, which improves our day-to-day lives but also comes with responsibilities.

* * *

Barrett stresses the importance of empathizing with people who are different from us. Describe an experience when you spent time with someone with a different background, belief system, or culture. What was that like? For example, were you uncomfortable, or was it enjoyable?

Continuing with that experience, identify a few ways that you and that person are alike.

If you were to have more of these experiences (spending time with someone different from you), how might that shape you as a result of your brainâ€™s plasticity (the capacity to learn and improve skills) and complexity (the ability to adapt to new conditions)?
