## Chapter 2: Building Trusting Relationships

One of the first steps toward creating a radically candid workplace is showing your team members that you personally care about them, which naturally builds trusting relationships. This practice might feel a little “soft” for the workplace, but it’s not a waste—when you build trusting relationships with your team and let them bring their _whole_ selves to work, you give shape and meaning to the work you do together. This motivates and engages your employees, driving them to accomplish much more than you could as a closed-off, disconnected team.

This step will take a good deal of time and effort on your part—solid relationships can’t be forced. Rather, they’re developed slowly through repeated, meaningful demonstrations of **practicing self-care, giving your team autonomy, and respecting boundaries.** First, we’ll explore how practicing self-care can help you show up to work in a way that opens up opportunities for relationship-building. Then, we’ll discuss building trust by giving your team autonomy, and by respecting their boundaries when asking them to share about themselves.

### Practicing Self-Care

Self-care is vitally important to creating opportunities for building trusting relationships, because it allows you to bring your best self to work. This is important for several reasons. First, it’s very difficult to correctly deal with tough situations when you’re not at your best. As a leader, your job is to avoid becoming overwhelmed by the situations you’re faced with—however, if you’re stressed at work and stressed at home, your problems will exacerbate one another. Tough work situations become insurmountable, or you may snap at someone who doesn’t deserve it. Second, it’s hard to care personally about other people when you’re caught up in your own issues—and personal care is crucial to radically candid relationships.

**There are three ways that you can maintain your self-care: integrating your work and life, finding and practicing your self-care method, and scheduling self-care time.**

#### Integrate Your Work and Life

Don’t think of your two lives separately, as a work-life _balance_. This implies that energy that’s put into your work is sapped from your life, and vice versa. Instead, think more in terms of integrating the two—you bring your whole self to work, and your whole self goes home at the end of the day. For example, if staying centered requires that you spend 30 minutes meditating every morning, this isn’t time that’s “taken away” from your focus on work. It allows you to bring a more grounded self to work. Likewise, if you feel excited and energized about a work project, feel free to talk about it at home and share your vision with your spouse.

**Integrating your work life and personal life ensures that they enrich one another, instead of working against each other for your attention and time.**

#### Find and Practice Your Self-Care Method

It’s important to find _your own_ self-care method—what is helpful and meaningful for one of your colleagues may do nothing at all for you. Self-care can look like mediation or exercise, or can be grounded in spending time with your spouse, getting drinks with friends, or going on vacation with your family.

Whatever your self-care method is, it should be prioritized when you’re faced with tough situations—but you need to check in and make sure it’s not your highest priority. For example, if you’re tasked with laying off several members of your team, it’s okay to have a weekend getaway for some space to think. It’s _not_ okay to abandon work commitments for a last-minute 4-day weekend, or to distract yourself from the task by shopping around for flights and hotels while you’re on the clock.

**If you don’t have a way to step back and center yourself, it’s all too easy to get caught up in stress and chaos. On the other hand, if you have a solid self-care practice in place, you should be able to deal adequately with tough situations.**

#### Schedule Self-Care Time

Self-care doesn’t feel as urgent or important as your bigger work tasks, so it’s likely to get bumped to the bottom of your priority list. To avoid this, schedule self-care time into your day like you would schedule anything else for work, and _show up for it_. For example, if you always blow off exercising in the morning, put it into your calendar and commit to it as you would with any other scheduled meeting.

**Once you’re taking care of yourself, you’re ready to effectively care about your team and work on the next two steps of relationship-building: granting your team autonomy, and respecting their boundaries when learning about them.**

### Grant Your Team Autonomy

Giving your team autonomy at work leads to better results and more accomplishments, because a sense of agency—not power and control—builds _trusting relationships_. When employees feel that they have a trusting relationship with you, they’ll bring their best selves to their work, naturally collaborate better, and are more engaged with their work. This is because a relationship _encourages_ them to bring out their best selves, and ensures that they can trust your decisions, and you theirs. On the contrary, if they feel that their best selves are being _forced_ out, or feel like replaceable parts of a machine, they’ll do the bare minimum.

When loosening the reins of authority, it’s important that your balance between control and freedom still offers your team a sense of structure—too little structure can cause systems to break down, and can allow people to use selfish interests to rise to positions of self-made power. These balances—between freedom and control, and between structure and disorganization—won’t come easily. It’s helpful to keep in mind that you’re not giving up _all_ control—you’re giving up control selectively, in a way that makes sense for everyone.

Put some research and thought into what duties or responsibilities make sense to give up. For example, promotions at Google aren’t based on managerial decisions or recommendations. Any employee who wants a promotion can put together their own “promotion packet” that highlights the reasons they deserve promotion, such as accomplishments, recommendations, and so on. The promotion is then considered and approved or denied by a team. This eliminates the possibility of one person having full control over another’s path, and also eliminates the ability of someone to act without the interests of the whole team in mind.

### Encourage Sharing, But Respect Boundaries

The second part of building effective relationships with your team members is respecting their boundaries. Respecting boundaries is not a one-size-fits-all practice. As a leader, you’ll have to navigate what “boundaries” look like for each person on your team—everyone will react differently to the idea of bringing their whole selves to work and sharing aspects of their personal lives with you. The good news is, this gets easier over time, as your relationships strengthen and you understand your employee’s needs more deeply.

It’s challenging to simultaneously get to know your employees and understand their integrated work-life selves, while respecting the boundaries they may set around their personal information—there are 6 guidelines that can help you navigate the process:

  * You have to build trust
  * It might not be best to share values
  * Stay open to new perspectives
  * Use physical touch where appropriate
  * Tune into your own emotions
  * Figure out how to deal with others’ emotions



#### Guideline 1: You Have to Build Trust

Trust-building is a long, slow process of repeatedly asking questions about your employee and showing that you are trustworthy by engaging with their responses. You can’t rush it by immediately asking deeply personal questions, which will likely scare them off. On the other hand, you can’t sit back and wait for trust to just _happen_ —as the leader, you have to take the first step of asking questions.

The best way to get into the trust-building process is to regularly spend one-on-one time with your employees. Let them decide the topic of discussion so they can talk about whatever they need to talk about, and take responsibility for asking the questions.

#### Guideline 2: It Might Not Be Best to Share Values

Many organizations tout the benefits of sharing values among team members, thinking that doing so will help colleagues better understand and communicate with one another, and act with integrity. However, this might not be the best way to build relationships, for several reasons:

  * Refining and practicing your personal values is a lifelong process, which gets minimized by a short value-sharing exercise. 
  * While some people might find it helpful to name their values aloud, others might find it impossible to pack the meaning of their values into a simple expression.
  * Some people might feel that their values are too private to be discussed with colleagues. Their colleagues might disagree with their values, which only goes toward breaking down relationships, not building them. 



You don’t need to ask about or share values with your employees—but you _do_ need to know what _your_ personal values are, and depend on them to help you show up to conversations and tough work in a way that aligns with who you are.

(Shortform note: Read our summary of Dare to Lead to learn more about how your values can help you show up to tough conversations with integrity.)

#### Guideline 3: Stay Open to New Perspectives

If your team members share their values or experiences with you, your job as a leader is to stay open to their perspective. This practice of basic respect is at the center of strong work relationships. Your “personal care” has to extend to everyone, even those who come from a different background, have a different perspective of the world, or have beliefs you don’t understand. If you mandate that people have beliefs or values similar to yours, or that they hide their conflicting beliefs and values before you’re interested in building a relationship with them, your work relationships will be weak, artificial, and void of trust.

Beyond accepting the diverse perspectives of your employees, you can further strengthen your relationships by making a perceptible effort to create a workplace that honors their diverse perspectives. This might look like organizing a workshop on discussing race in the workplace, or a review of exclusive language in your organization's written materials.

#### Guideline 4: Use Physical Touch Where Appropriate

Physical touch is often considered inappropriate in the workplace, but sometimes it can go a long way toward strengthening your relationships by showing that you care personally. If one of your employees experiences a death in the family, or announces that they’re having a baby, a professionally distant handshake won’t demonstrate that you care about them. A hug, on the other hand, certainly would.

However, when it comes to physical touch, you have to be attuned to your employees’ needs— _ask them_ what they prefer. Don’t make an assumption they might be uncomfortable with. Some of your employees will be comfortable with hugging and gladly accept it, but others will prefer not to be hugged. It’s important to find another way to include these employees in expressions of care, such as a reassuring shoulder squeeze, or a note left on their desk. It’s okay to ask what will work for them.

#### Guideline 5: Tune Into Your Own Emotions

If you create a work culture where everyone is expected to bring their whole selves to work, it’s important to be attuned to the emotions _your_ whole self brings to work. This is important when you’re carrying negative emotions, because emotions spread easily, especially when you’re the boss and everyone is tuned in to how you’re feeling.

You have to find a way to keep your emotions from getting in everyone’s way, without suppressing or trying to ignore them, which could cause them to manifest in a way that's not in your control and chips away at trust—such as snapping at someone for asking for your help. Be candid about what’s going on, and assure your team that they’re not to blame for your bad mood. You could say something like, “I’m exhausted because I stayed up all night with a sick kid, so I’m really irritable today. I’m trying my best not to snap at anyone, but if I do, please know it’s nothing against you or your work.”

#### Guideline 6: Figure Out How to Deal With Others’ Emotions

When you’re building relationships with your team—especially when asking your team to bring their whole selves to work, and when challenging directly alongside caring personally—you’ll inevitably be exposed to others’ emotions. The most important rule in these situations is: _don’t try to control, manipulate, or prevent others’ emotions._ Instead, your focus should be on engaging with their emotions and reacting with empathy. There are seven methods that can help you react to others’ emotions with empathy, rather than with defensive or controlling behavior:

  * **Recognize emotions:** Don’t pretend that your employees’ emotional reactions aren’t happening, or try to assuage them by saying something like, “Don’t take it personally.” Instead, try opening up a fuller conversation about it by saying something like, “I’m sensing that you’re frustrated. Do you want to talk about it?”
  * **Don’t tell people how to feel:** Telling people how to feel (or not feel) will usually have the opposite effect on them—if you say to your employee, “Don’t be angry,” they’ll likely get even angrier. 
  * **Don’t approach with guilt:** When failures or setbacks happen, it’s natural that people will be upset. If you feel personal guilt for others’ negative emotions, you’ll likely react defensively. You have to remember that their feelings aren’t your fault, and they’re not necessarily directed at you. Otherwise, you’ll focus on your own guilty feelings instead of on _their_ negative emotions that need attention.
  * **Ask questions:** Don’t tell someone what they’re feeling. Instead, keep asking questions about their emotional reaction until you arrive at the root of the problem together. 
  * **Build in little breaks:** Having bottles of water or tissues on hand to offer to an upset employee gives them a moment to regain their composure if needed.
  * **Go for a walk:** Tough conversations are best on their feet—emotions feel less intense in an open space, and when you are walking and looking in the same direction, the conversation tends to feel more collaborative than combative.
  * **Take a break if you need to:** If you’re truly uncomfortable with someone’s emotional reaction, instead of telling them how to feel or ignoring them, you can take some space for yourself. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry you’re so angry about the way that presentation went. I’m going to grab you a cup of coffee and I’ll be back in a few minutes.” If you’re still feeling uncomfortable after your break, give yourself some space. You can say, “I’d like to press pause on this conversation. I know it’s important to you, so we _will_ come back to it, but I can’t have this conversation right now.” Be forgiving to yourself for needing space, but recognize the importance of coming back to the conversation when you’re ready—your employee needs to see that you’re good on your word when it comes to addressing issues that are important to them.

> **Successful Relationship-Building at Social Events**
> 
> While outside-work social events are good ways to open up to your colleagues, learn about one another, and show them that you care about them, they’re not always the best choice. When thinking of planning a social event, keep two things in mind: optional events can feel like a mandatory burden, and you should be very careful around booze.
> 
> **Optional Events Can Feel Like a Mandatory Burden**
> 
> When social events are organized by management, people can feel forced into taking part in them—this chips away at the “autonomy” that you’re trying to demonstrate in the organization. When organizing an event, remember to _read the room._ Ask yourself if you might be pressuring your employees into a situation that they’re not comfortable with, either implicitly or explicitly. You might feel that a non-mandatory event doesn’t feel like a burden, but keep in mind that employees feel a great deal of social pressure when it comes to events their boss is putting on—they’ll attend out of fear of missing out on an opportunity to show you their commitment.
> 
> Sometimes, the best thing you can do for your team—and what shows them that you’re _really_ paying attention to their needs—is not scheduling an event at all, instead letting them go home. For example, setting up a fun outing to help everyone relax at the end of a 70-hour week is well-intended, but most of your employees would prefer to go home and rest.
> 
> **Be Careful Around Booze**
> 
> While adding drinks to your social event is a surefire way to loosen people up and get to know one another, you need to be _very_ careful when it comes to booze. There are so many problems that can come from overindulgence, especially in a work context—such as saying things that can’t be taken back, embarrassing loss of control, or aggression.
> 
> In this way, booze can actually serve to _destroy_ relationships, rather than build and strengthen them. If you do choose to have alcohol at an event, make sure that everyone’s consumption is kept under control, either by bartenders or limited supply.
> 
> **Overall, consider that the workday might be a much more valuable time to get to know one another.** After all, you and your employees spend most of your time together at work, so it makes sense to get to know each other within that context. Additionally, people should be spending their time after work with their other priorities and their self-care, not holding themselves in the work mindset that naturally comes along with socializing with colleagues.
