## Chapter 6: Creating Growth Plans With Your Employees

Understanding growth trajectories is a good first step to honoring the needs of your employees—the next step is learning about their dreams and goals, and helping them recognize how their work can contribute to those dreams.

### The Three Conversations You Should Be Having

To accomplish this, have honest conversations with all of your direct reports—regardless of performance—about who they are, what their goals are, and how you can help them reach those goals. There are three conversations vital to effective growth management: **the life story conversation, the dreams conversation, and the planning conversation**

#### The Life Story Conversation

**The life story conversation is essential to getting to know your employees—if you want to care personally about them, you need to know them personally**. Ask your employees about their life story, focusing on changes they made and _why_ these choices were made—it’s often here that you’ll discover their values. For example, if your employee says, “I dropped out of grad school because I was tired of talking about theory and not using any of the skills I was learning in a tangible way,” you learn that one of her values is seeing tangible results of her work. These conversations also lend context to abstract values that can easily be misunderstood. While a focus on “financial independence” might make you think an employee is materialistic, knowing his life story might reveal that his mother was often absent because she was working two jobs to make ends meet, and he doesn’t want the same experience for his children.

Approach this conversation with respect and care—while most people will be comfortable with it, you might have someone who is significantly uncomfortable with the questions. In this case, drop the matter and move on quickly.

Ultimately, this first conversation should reveal what’s _truly_ important to your employee, which helps contextualize your next conversation, in which you’ll talk about their dreams and figure out what skills and opportunities will be most useful to them.

#### The Dreams Conversation

**The dreams conversation helps you understand what your employees ultimately want out of their careers and their lives, and as their boss, how you can help them get there.** This makes their work more meaningful and rewarding and they’re assured that you truly _care_ about them as people.

It’s important to frame this conversation around _dreams_. Calling them “long-term goals” or “plans” usually invites professional, not personal answers that are often catered to what the employee thinks their boss wants to hear. It’s possible that their dreams _will_ be work-related, such as, “I want to retire at 50,” but this reframe often pushes people to name their non-work goals such as, “I want to own a dude ranch in Colorado.”

In preparation for your next conversation, task them with figuring out the necessary skills to reach their dream. Then, they should consider the importance of each skill, and their competence. This step reveals where they need more experience and skills development, and gets you thinking about how you’ll help them achieve that. Think about networking you could help them with, or new projects that you could put them on.

#### The Planning Conversation

**The last conversation, the planning conversation, is where you help your employee come up with a solid plan for achieving their dreams.** This conversation shouldn’t be focused on telling your employees how to move up in your organization. Rather, it should be focused on finding ways to make their current work clearly translate to preparation for their dreams.

List the ways their work can change to better support the direction they’d like to move in—such as working with mentors, taking on new projects to develop skills, or taking classes. Then, come up with action items for each idea listed, and a deadline. This provides tangible steps toward building their dream, and demonstrates how their current work is important to getting there.

### Regularly Check In and Provide Growth Opportunities

**Alongside talking to your team members about their dreams and coming up with action plans, you should check in once a year on their professional performance and growth trajectory.** This tells you if their needs are being met, how their work affects the team, and what their plan should look like moving forward.

**There are three parts to this exercise:**

  1. Draw five boxes and label them—superstars, rock stars, mediocre, low performance with no growth, and low performance with expected rapid growth. Put your team members’ names into their corresponding boxes. Don’t hem and haw over this—it shouldn’t take more than 20 minutes. While doing so, keep an eye out for bias. Are your more senior members really superstars, or are they coasting on the work of the superstars under them? Ideally, your boxes will reflect excellent performance at all levels, with senior people showing more gradual growth and newer people showing rapid growth.
  2. Come up with a short plan of opportunities and growth for each person—if you’ve been doing the work of regularly checking in with them and thinking about their growth, this should only take about 20 minutes.


  * **Superstars:** Make sure you’re offering them challenges and projects that will help them continue to learn.
  * **Rock stars:** Make sure you’re offering them what they need to feel appreciated and continue doing consistent strong work. 
  * **Mediocre:** Think of what you can offer them to give them a boost, such as classes or projects, or consider if they’d do better elsewhere. 
  * **Low performance with expected rapid growth:** Think of what you can offer them in terms of clearer guidelines, better training, or a transfer to a role they’re better suited for.
  * **Low performance with no growth** : If you’ve taken the time to ask a third party to check your decision and they agree, it’s time to start the process of firing this person. 


  1. Compare your growth plans with those of your colleagues—this gives you a _common sense_ of what it means to do bad, good, or excellent work. Having these conversations is especially important when you’re managing other managers, so you have consistent expectations across all levels of management. If employees are treated differently under different managers—for example, if one manager values superstars more, but another manager values rock stars more—your workplace will feel unfair and confusing. 



**Hiring, Firing, and Promoting**

As a boss, you’ll be heavily involved in making major decisions about the growth of your team and its members such as hiring onto your team, firing low performers, and promoting your reports into new roles. It’s essential to approach these decisions with radical candor to achieve positive outcomes.

#### Hiring

Above all, hire with the needs of the _entire team_ in mind. Do you have too many superstars, and not enough rock stars? Do you need a dose of innovation from a superstar? When you’re hiring, keep in mind that hiring is a subjective process—subjectivity can’t be fully eliminated, but there are a few ways that it can be managed.

**Define your team’s culture.** Come up with 3-4 words that describe your team’s culture, such as ambitious, straightforward, polite, blunt, big-picture, and so on. Interview specifically for _that_ fit—this reduces personal bias in cases where you don’t love the person, but they’d be a great fit for your team. You could also include the growth trajectory you’d ideally like the person to have, so you interview toward that, rather than interviewing with your _own_ goals and trajectory in mind.

**Prescreen candidates blindly.** To make sure you’re not unconsciously biased against certain applicants, set up a prescreening system where candidates can show you the work they’re capable of before you see who they are. For example, you could ask candidates to perform a task relevant to the work they’d be doing for you. This eliminates people who have a nice résumé but can’t back it up, and it gives opportunity to people with a mediocre résumé but great skill set.

(Shortform note: Read our summary of Blink to find out more about how unconscious bias affects hiring decisions, and how to get around it.)

**Create a hiring committee.** Having**** multiple perspectives on a candidate ensures that you’re not letting your bias get in the way of a good hiring decision. A good hiring committee has about four people, and it should be diverse. It might be off-putting for a woman to be interviewed by all men, or a person of color to be interviewed by an all-white committee. Additionally, at least one person should be from a different team than the one being hired onto. This prevents the committee from being tempted to make a decision just to fill an empty role on the team as quickly as possible.

You should have just one committee, which speaks to _all candidates._ It’s not helpful if one committee liked Candidate A, and a different committee liked Candidate B—they have no common point to make comparisons from.

**Take casual moments into account.** People are likely to reveal who they really are outside of the interview room. Take them out for lunch and observe how they talk to the waiter, or ask your receptionist for their opinion on the candidate.

**Write down your thoughts.** Write down your impressions immediately after the interview—this allows you to later recall the specifics of your discussion, or small signals that they would or wouldn’t be a good fit for your team. Your hiring committee can make better decisions when they rely on true impressions, not recalled impressions.

**Make the decision together.** Bring your hiring committee together to discuss candidates. Share everyone’s feedback about each candidate at the beginning of the meeting, and debate until you come to a mutual decision. If you, as the boss, put forth a preferred choice and no one objects, that should be your choice.

#### Firing

As with hiring, there will likely be a time in your career that you’re tasked with letting an employee go. **This shouldn’t be an easy process, but neither should it be impossible**. If your organization fires people easily, it’s likely that bad firing decisions are being made—which carries the risk of causing anxiety among your team members, who worry that they’re next. This will create a culture of fear, where people don’t try new ideas or take risks because a failure might get them booted. If your organization _never_ fires anyone, it’s likely that there are underperformers dragging their whole team down—which carries the risk of high performers quitting out of frustration.

**There are three ways that you can ensure that your firing process is as radically candid as possible: don’t delay, ask for peer opinions, and demonstrate that you care personally.**

**Don’t delay.** Too many bosses put off firing conversations to avoid the risk of discomfort and negative emotions. Sometimes, they put it off long enough to talk themselves out of the decision. Common excuses to put off firing include:

  * **Things will improve.** If you find yourself using this excuse, ask yourself: how _exactly_ will things improve, either in your behavior or your employee’s? Even if things do improve, is it possible for them to improve _enough_? If you can’t come up with answers to these questions, you can guarantee that things won’t improve.
  * **I’d rather have _someone_ than _no one_. **If you find yourself using this excuse, look at the rest of your team. You’re creating extra work and stress by letting this employee’s poor work slide. The work of finding an adequate replacement is always less than the work of managing a team that’s breaking down.
  * **A transfer is better.** If you find yourself using this excuse, understand that making a transfer isn’t kind—it’s comfortable for _you_. If an employee doesn’t have the right skills for your organization, a transfer will create problems and stress for the colleague you transfer them to, and the employee stays in an environment where they can’t thrive. 
  * **It will worry my team.** If you find yourself using this excuse, remember that your team’s morale doesn’t decrease when you fire a low performer. Morale decreases when you let a low performer stay on and drag everyone down. 



**Ask for peer opinions.** It’s easy to get lost in the emotions of firing someone—perhaps you’re acting unfairly out of anger, or acting too lenient out of fear. As noted in Chapter 5, before deciding to fire someone, you should ask a neutral third party if they think your decision is fair. If they agree with your decision, ask for help from peers, your boss, or HR to help you with your documentation so that your reasons for firing your employee are as clear as possible.

**Demonstrate that you care personally.** The trusting relationship you’ve built with this person shouldn’t disappear during the firing process. There are several ways to make it a more dignified process for them.

  * Think about what you can do to make it easier—ask them if they want to announce their departure, or prefer that you do it. Or, ask if they’d prefer to come collect their things on the weekend, when the office is empty. 
  * Help them find the way forward, and make sure they understand that they’re being fired so they can find what they’re good at, elsewhere. You can accomplish this by entering the conversation with ideas of what jobs might suit them better, and connections you might be able to introduce them to. Follow up with them a month or so after their departure to check in and see how you can help them. 



#### Promoting

The most important guideline when it comes to promotion is that _you must be sure that your promotions are fair_ —the best way to avoid unfairness or favoritism in promotions is to give up the power of being the only person making the decision. However, when you get your peers together to discuss promotions and align them with one another, things can take a negative or competitive turn—there are several ways you can keep promotion discussions productive.

**Prepare for your meeting.** Everyone on your team should send in a list of the employees they’re planning to promote and a justification for each. Read through their justifications, and come prepared with an opinion on each person listed.

**Keep an eye on time management.** Go through your junior positions first, as they should be the least time-consuming decisions, and then work up to your senior positions. Don’t let the debates go on too long, or you risk decisions being made out of boredom or frustration. If the choice seems obvious to you, call the decision yourself. Otherwise, ask that the discussion on that person be continued outside the meeting and revisited, then move on.

**Plan to clear the air.** You can only promote so many people, and everyone believes their candidate is the most deserving. Subsequently**,** these discussions can be difficult, emotionally-charged, and competitive. Plan an activity for the group after the meeting to calm down, such as taking a walk together to grab coffees, or a fun class like axe-throwing.
