## Exercise: Find Ways to Grant Your Team Autonomy

Giving your employees a sense of autonomy is a good step toward building a trusting relationship with them.

* * *

Describe one of your practices that might unnecessarily hold control over your team members. (For example, you hold constant “update meetings” during projects, or build project teams without input from those affected.)

How can you transfer ownership of this responsibility to your team members? (For example, team members schedule their own update meetings and set the agenda, or team members create their own project teams.)
