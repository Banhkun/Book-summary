## Exercise: Understand the Importance of Collaboration

The seven steps of collaboration can be time-consuming, and it’s tempting to skip some of the steps. Reflecting on past negative experiences that stemmed from a lack of collaboration will remind you of the importance of working together.

* * *

Think of an experience where you, as the boss, made a decision on behalf of your entire team that turned out negatively. (For example, you decided to change working hours to better work with clients in New York, or split a team of multitaskers up into dedicated task forces.) Describe your decision.

Describe the outcome of making the decision without discussion. (For example, team members regularly came in late because their schedules didn’t work with the new hours, or team members left for other departments that would let them continue multitasking.)

What problems do you think you would have been made aware of, if you’d made this decision collaboratively with your team?

What creative solutions to these problems could you have come up with if you’d worked through them collaboratively with your team?
