## Chapter 7: Getting Results With Effective Collaboration

**The fourth goal of a radically candid workplace is building a highly collaborative atmosphere and a team that works together to accomplish much more than you could individually.** The principle of caring personally is especially important to a collaborative atmosphere, for several reasons. First, it allows you to invite an exchange of perspectives—that is, incorporating another’s way of thinking or doing things into your own way of thinking or doing things. Second, caring interrupts the self-interested mindset of focusing _only_ on results.

Charging ahead toward decisions and results—without caring about the people you work with—can cause a breakdown in your team. For example, at Google, Scott tried to change team structures and responsibilities drastically, without letting her team in on her decision-making process. While her ideas were good, the team fell apart. Because she’d acted alone, her team felt confused or personally targeted by her changes, and some people chose to ignore the proposed workflow. Some people, angry that she’d acted alone in such a drastic decision, even quit her team.

**Accomplishments don’t come from diving into a problem alone, telling people what to do, and focusing only on results. They come from approaching problems and solutions collaboratively, setting your power aside, and focusing on your team members.**

### The Seven Steps to Getting Collaborative Results

Collaboration is a long process that should, at some point, involve every member of your team who will be affected by the outcome. **There are seven steps to effective collaboration: listening, clarifying, debating, deciding, persuading, executing, and learning.** While you want to move your team through the steps quickly, so that collaboration feels like a worthwhile task instead of a burdensome chore, don’t skimp on or skip over any of the steps. The success of each step builds on the success of the one before.

### Step 1: Listening

**Your job as a leader is to _listen_ to every person on your team, with the goal of amplifying their voice.** You’ll usually resort to one of two types of listening: _quiet listening_ and _loud listening_. It’s likely that you’ve already adopted one of these listening styles over your lifetime. You don’t need to change your listening style when you become a boss, but you do need to learn how to use your particular listening style _effectively_ , and be in tune with how others receive it.

#### Quiet Listening

Quiet listening means inserting silence in your conversations in order to create space for the other person to speak. The advantage of this type of listening is that people are more likely to say what they’re really thinking—rather than what they think you want to hear—when they’re expected to fill silence and don’t have to deal with a highly reactive conversation partner.

Executed improperly, however, quiet listening comes with a number of disadvantages. People may waste their time trying to guess what you want, or present their own ideas as yours in meetings or conversations. They can get away with this easily if you’re not very vocal about your own ideas, in favor of keeping the floor open for others. Creating silence in conversations can also make people very uncomfortable and stress them out, or can make them feel that you’re trying to use discomfort to trick them into speaking, which undermines the productivity of the conversation.

**To be an effective quiet listener, focus on building conversations that make everyone feel comfortable.** The first way to do this is to model the behavior you want to see—if you want people to put forth their unpopular opinions, you need to put your unpopular opinion on the table first. You could say something like, “I think that our system to respond to customer support inquiries is outdated and slowing us down. What do you think?” If you want people to challenge you, you have to open the floor to them and make the invitation to challenge clear. For example, you might say, “Please come to our meeting with some ideas on how my system for handling customer support inquiries could be improved.”

Create space for meaningful discussion, but don’t spend too much time on silence—it shouldn’t take up your whole conversation. Too much silence seems like you’re not engaging with what’s being said.

#### Loud Listening

Loud listening depends on saying things that will make the people you are speaking to react or push back—this usually happens when you put forth a firm opinion and ask for a response to it. The advantage of this method is that no one wastes time trying to figure out what you're thinking—it’s quite clear. It also quickly gets to the root of opposing points of view and holes in logic.

However, it’s important to understand that many people you talk to won’t have the type of confidence they need to challenge you, especially if you are their boss. Improperly executed loud listening scares people into agreeing with you and backing down, which isn’t a productive outcome for anyone. You can encourage the confidence to challenge by stating your idea clearly, and then—as with effective quiet listening— _explicitly asking_ that the other person challenges your idea. This might look like, “I want to revamp our customer support templates, but the way I want to go about it might be unnecessarily time-consuming and overall, not a great idea. I want you to tell me where my logic isn’t making sense, so we can discuss.”

#### Which Listening Style Is Best?

Neither listening style is better or more managerial. Keep the listening style you’ve developed over the years, but refine it so that it best serves your purposes and your team. Caring personally and truly knowing your team members is helpful here—you can see how your listening style is perceived by the people around you, and can make necessary adjustments to make sure everyone is comfortable enough to challenge one another.

#### Creation and Maintenance of Your Organization’s Listening Culture

Your team members should also be taught how to effectively listen to _each other_. This has several advantages. First, it takes the burden off you to be the “designated listener.” When there are more effective listeners on your team, more ideas and suggestions can be heard. Second, team members see the small points for improvement that high-level managers often overlook, and are more receptive to suggestions for improvement when they’re not prioritizing around high-level matters. When small ideas—the type of ideas that spur innovation and creation—are given the space and time they deserve, other team members are inspired to come forward with their own ideas/suggestions, furthering the innovative cycle.

Start by demonstrating good listening in a highly visible, basic way—in meetings, work on modeling behaviors that give everyone a voice. These behaviors might include:

  * Going around the room to make sure everyone gets to say something if they’d like
  * Cutting off people who are speaking too much
  * Ahead of time, meeting with those you want to talk more or less to outline expectations 



### Step 2: Clarifying

**Ideas that aren’t totally clear or well thought-out are likely to be dismissed or rejected when presented to others—your job as a boss is to help your team members _clarify_ their ideas for an audience. **Your commitment to caring personally is helpful here, because your clarification suggestions will be most effective when you know who your team member is as a person and understand who she’ll be presenting her ideas to. Clarification has two main parts: letting your team member bounce ideas off you, and helping your team member know her audience.

**Let Team Members Bounce Ideas Off You**

As a boss, your job in the clarification step is helping your team member work out her ideas’ kinks in a nonjudgmental space before she presents them in much harsher arenas. The best way to work through ideas is a brainstorming session—this meeting should help you cut out bad, time-wasting ideas and choose and refine good ideas.

Commit to challenging directly at this stage. Much of the time, good ideas are in serious need of work. Pointing out an idea’s flaws isn’t mean—it points you toward solutions for the problems, and a bit of refinement now will keep the idea from being killed off at a later stage. Before going into these meetings, don’t be tempted to try to save time by asking your team member to think through the problems and solutions on her own ahead of time. Creative problem-solving happens in the back and forth of discussions.

#### Help Team Members Know Their Audience

It’s crucial to teach your team members that when they’re presenting an idea, it’s _their responsibility_ to make sure everyone understands—not the other way around. The first way to approach this responsibility is pushing your team member to continue clarifying until they’re left with the core essence of their idea—something that would be impossible for someone to misunderstand.

Then, help them think of _who_ their audience is and how the audience might receive their ideas. For example, your graphic designers and your backend engineers aren’t going to care about the same things—you want to help them cater their ideas specifically to the people they’re presenting to. They should ask themselves:

  * What does my audience know or not know? 
  * What details would be particularly important to them? What details can be omitted?



### Step 3: Debating

**Debate is an essential step in getting good results. When ideas can be discussed and improved, it leads to better decision-making and easier persuasion of the people who are going to execute or be affected by the decision.** Some bosses think it’s better to make decisions on behalf of their team—it’s quicker and avoids the friction that often comes with debate—but not allowing team members to debate and talk through decisions creates distrust and feelings of being “left out,” which will make it harder to persuade people to future decisions.

As the boss, you don’t need to be in every debate. However, you do need to foster a healthy debate culture among your team. _Healthy debate culture_ doesn’t imply debates where there’s no real friction or big ideas to wrestle with. It means that debate is structured in such a way that it makes sense, is respectful, and doesn’t take too much emotional energy out of your team. There are six ways that you can help create a healthy debate culture.

#### Six Methods to Build a Healthy Debate Culture

**Method #1: Make sure ego isn’t getting in the way of good ideas.** Often, conversation around finding the best __ answer gets derailed by people’s egos and the need to be right or “win.” If you sense that people are starting to focus on winning instead of finding an answer, your job is to remind everyone of the goal, and redirect the conversation in a productive direction. There are several ways to save an ego-driven conversation.

First, set up clear rules before debates, such as no interruptions, or no giving criticism without adding an idea. Then, be quick to stop anyone who claims an idea as “theirs” instead of involving the whole team, or uses the opinions of absent people to bolster their opinion—such as in saying, “ _We_ don’t think that’s the right direction for this project.” Finally, have team members switch their position on an issue halfway through the debate—knowing that they’ll have to argue against themselves makes people put aside their egos and listen more.

**Method #2: Establish the expectation of disagreement.** Good debate doesn’t happen when everyone around the table is in agreement—make it clear that you expect _someone_ to consider the issue from a different perspective. If simply asking your team to disagree won’t work, you can use a prop to represent the expectation of disagreement. When there isn’t enough debate happening, hand over the prop (and the duty to disagree) to a team member.

**Method #3: Know when to take a break.** Your debate may reach a point where everyone is too tired—physically, mentally, or emotionally—to productively contribute. It’s unlikely that pushing your team past this point will result in a good outcome. Team members might start bickering instead of debating, or a decision will be made just to end the meeting.

It’s your job to know your team members well enough to see when they are approaching this point, make the call to stop the debate, and decide when to pick it back up.

**Method #4: Know your audience.** Recognize that you might have team members who don’t like debate—they might be anxious about speaking up, or find the practice too aggressive or direct. If you know your team members well enough, you’ll be able to see when they’re not comfortable with the debate atmosphere, and you can jump in to help them.

Ease debate discomfort by making the goals and expectations of the debate clear from the beginning, which diminishes anxiety about how things will go or how it will end, and use your ground rules, such as no criticism without contribution, to show that it’s a safe space for speaking up.

**Method #5: Set a deadline for your decision.** Everyone needs to have the same expectations for when a decision will be reached—otherwise, there will be tension between those who want to think for a bit before making a decision and those who want to make a decision at the end of the meeting. Mark a decision deadline for each of your debate topics, so everyone is aware from the beginning when decisions are expected to happen.

**Method #6: Don’t make a decision just to end the debate.** When a debate’s been dragging on for a long time, it’s tempting to make a decision just so that it will end—as the leader, you’re the one who will be expected or pressured to pull the trigger on this decision. Remember that your job is to support your team members by taking breaks, setting new rules, or redirecting conversation so _they_ can see _their_ debates through to the end. Don’t take agency away from them by making a quick decision.

### Step 4: Deciding

When it comes time to make a decision, make sure the right people are the decision-makers. Keep in mind that the most senior people—and you, as the boss—are often considered decision-makers, but they’re not necessarily the people with the best information. Furthermore, know that the people who demand to make decisions _shouldn’t_ be decision-makers. They tend to think they’re always right, and the refusal to consider any other perspectives or information leads to poor decision-making.

**Your decision-makers should be those who are close to the facts surrounding a situation, and thus have the best possible information to make a decision.** Good bosses make sure that these people are given the clearance to make as many decisions as possible, instead of creating decision-making processes that favor senior people or higher management.

As the boss, you’re mostly overseeing decisions on a higher level and don’t need to be actively involved in decision-making meetings. However, it’s important to occasionally jump into the details of a small decision-making process that piques your interest. This accomplishes several goals:

  * It demonstrates to your employees that no decision is below you, or above them, and it gives you a _true_ look into what’s going on at their level. When you’re at the top, the “facts” you receive are filtered up through many people and their opinions, egos, and experience. It’s important to stay involved in learning facts _at their source._
  * It empowers your employees when they’re considered a reliable source of information when you want answers or unfiltered facts. This was common practice at Apple—when Steve Jobs wanted to know more about backend developments, he’d go directly to the junior engineers working on them to ask questions and discuss ideas. He demonstrated that their small decisions weren’t below his interest, and in turn the engineer felt validated as an important contributor to the process. 



### Step 5: Persuading

It might feel pointless to put effort into persuading people to go along with a decision once you’ve already made it, but it’s critical that everyone who will be helping you execute the decision is persuaded of its value—skipping this step leaves key people feeling unimportant and disconnected. There are three steps to effective persuasion: _listen to your audience’s_ _feelings_ about the decision, _prove the credibility_ of the person making the decision, and _explain the logic_ behind the decision.

**Listen to your audience’s feelings.** You might have an emotional connection to your decision, but that’s not what’s important—persuasion requires thinking of how you can connect your audience’s emotions to the same problem.

**Prove the decider’s credibility.** There are several components to credibility. First, you need to know exactly what you’re talking about, and back up your knowledge with demonstrated good results and decisions. The second component is _practicing humility_. Humility involves talking about the accomplishments and vision of “us” or “we” rather than “me” or “I.” Instead of trying to persuade people with, “ _I’ve_ built a team that gets stellar results, and _my_ projects have always been successful,” you might try, “ _We_ get stellar results—look at _our_ track record of successful ad campaigns.”

**Explain your logic.** Logic can be tricky to explain to others—because you’ve been part of the decision-making process from the beginning, the logic seems clear to you. However, it’s important to do so, because someone who’s looking at your idea for the first time may spot holes in your logic that you’re not aware of. Walk your audience through your idea, from beginning to end—explain how you came up with it and detail the entire process leading up to the moment you stood up in front of them. Either your audience will point out the holes in the logic—at which point you need to take the idea through clarifying, debating, and deciding again before coming back—or they will see there are no holes in the logic and be persuaded.

### Step 6: Executing

Your job as a boss is to get your team through the steps of collaboration as efficiently as possible, so they have time to execute on their ideas. You can accomplish this by _keeping things efficient_ and _scheduling execution time._

  * **Keep things efficient.** Don’t waste your team’s time—make meetings as efficient as possible by starting on time or having your employees bring you a list of problems they need to sort out. Wrap up debates that are dragging on by appointing a decision-maker and setting a decision deadline. Do your best to protect your team from time-wasting policies from higher management. These efforts on your part give your team extra time to work on the things they need to execute, as well as the answers, clearance, or help they need to push toward results. 
  * **Schedule execution time.** Have your team members block off time in their calendars every week that’s dedicated to executing on ideas. Remind them that this should be considered as important a commitment as any other meeting.



**While much of your contribution to collaborative work should be in the form of meetings and clearing the path for your employees, you shouldn’t stop _all_ execution duties when you become a boss.** It’s important to flex your _own_ execution muscles from time to time. When you’re too separated from your team’s work or what it looks like to execute decisions in your organization, you won’t know how to adequately clarify their ideas or prepare them for debate or persuasion meetings. Stay connected by doing some of the work yourself.

### Step 7: Learning

**It’s crucial to examine results and note the ways that the collaborative process could have gone more smoothly or been improved, because this is where growth happens.** It’s fairly common sense that you learn equally valuable lessons from your successes and your failures—but denial is a much more frequent reaction to failure than learning is. There are two reasons for this: expectations of consistency and burnout.

After you realize you’ve made a bad decision and have learned from it, you may find that people’s **expectations of consistency** drive them to blame your changing opinion on a lack of integrity. You can work against this by clearly communicating what new information caused you to change your mind

**Burnout** and being worn down by issues in your work or personal life also makes failure difficult to learn from. It takes much less effort to move on quickly from the failure without looking at it too closely. You can work against this by remembering to practice your self-care method, which should help keep you centered in stressful situations. For example, Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, practiced self-care by focusing on family time. He often turned down incredible opportunities and invitations to have dinner with his family almost every night. This commitment to his self-care helped him make tough decisions and stay calm even in the face of incredible backlash.
