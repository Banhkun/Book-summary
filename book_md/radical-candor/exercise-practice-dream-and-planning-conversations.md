## Exercise: Practice Dream and Planning Conversations

Having conversations that demonstrate how your team members’ work translates into building their dreams is key to keeping motivation high—practice within the context of your own dreams.

* * *

Think about your _dreams._ Keep in mind these don’t need to be related to your work. (For example, you might dream of owning a dude ranch in Colorado, or of early retirement.) Describe **one** of your dreams.

Make a list of the skills you think you’ll need to achieve this dream, and your competence in each skill.

Come up with 3-4 action items that build toward your dream, and set a deadline for each. (For example, shortlist farm management courses by the end of the month, or have x amount in savings by June.)
