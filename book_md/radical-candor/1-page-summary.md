## 1-Page Summary

**Radical candor** is a straightforward, deeply human way of managing the people who work for you and supporting them through personal and professional problems. There are two vital components to radical candor: “**caring personally”** and “**challenging directly.”**

#### Caring Personally

_Caring personally_ means caring about who employees are on a human level, beyond their work output. This requires getting to know each team member’s motivations and ambitions, as well as learning about their “whole selves”—their lives and interests _outside_ of work that may affect their needs _at_ work. Showing that you personally care about your employees naturally builds trusting relationships. When an employee feels that you have her best interests in mind, she’s more likely to engage with your feedback, trust your decisions, and be honest with you—and in turn, you’ll feel that you can trust and be honest with her.

#### Challenging Directly

_Challenging directly_ pushes you to have tough conversations with your employees, such as in giving criticism or discussing subpar performance. These important conversations give your employee the opportunity to improve, help you avoid more problems and tough conversations down the line, and contribute to trust-building—being direct and pushing your employee to their full potential demonstrates that you care about them.

**Bringing radically candid leadership to your workplace directly enhances four vital components to building an effective team:**

  * Building trusting relationships with your team members
  * Improving the guidance you give and receive 
  * Managing your team members’ ambitions and growth more effectively
  * Creating an efficient and effective collaboration system 



### Building Trusting Relationships With Radical Candor

When you build trusting relationships with your team and let them bring their _whole selves_ to work, you can better understand their needs and make sure their work is meaningful to them, which naturally motivates great results. These trusting relationships can’t be forced—rather, they’re developed through repeated demonstrations of **practicing self-care, giving your team autonomy, and respecting boundaries.**

**Self-care** helps you lay the foundations of trusting relationships, in two ways. First, if you’re overwhelmed and stressed, problems feel insurmountable or may cause you to snap at someone who doesn’t deserve it. Second, it’s difficult to care about other people if you’re wrapped up in your own problems. Without personal care, you can’t build radically candid relationships.

Find a self-care method that makes you feel like your best self, such as meditation or spending time with your family. Try putting it into your calendar, as you would with a meeting.

**Giving your team autonomy** naturally bolsters your relationships. When employees feel that you’re using power and control to _force_ them to do their best, they become resentful and disengaged. On the other hand, when they feel a sense of agency and autonomy, they _choose_ to bring their best selves to their work, which leads to better collaboration and results.

Think of areas where you could let go of control. For example, stop asking for constant updates on team members’ projects. Instead, ask them to plan update meetings and to try problem solving themselves before asking for help.

**Respecting boundaries** is important to meaningful relationship-building—when you _care personally_ about your relationships, you make an effort to learn about your employees’ whole selves, while being conscious of their limits. You’ll have to navigate what “boundaries” look like for each person—everyone reacts differently to the idea of sharing their personal lives with their boss.

You can encourage sharing by staying open to different perspectives and values, engaging with emotions instead of ignoring them, and responding to limits—for example, if an employee seems uncomfortable discussing her family, drop the issue quickly and move on.

### Improving Guidance With Radical Candor

The second component of radically candid leadership is improving your guidance. Giving radically candid guidance means calling on both personal care and direct challenge when delivering criticism and praise. Without a healthy balance of these two principles, you risk giving guidance that doesn’t solve problems, creates distrust, or allows poor work. An imbalance can manifest in three guidance types: “**obnoxious aggression,” “manipulative insincerity,”** or**“ruinous empathy.”**

**Obnoxious aggression** happens when you challenge directly without caring personally. Praise is usually characterized by empty, unspecific compliments, such as a generic “nice work.” Criticism is arrogant and personal—for example, “You’re lazy, so I can’t trust you on this project.”

**Manipulative insincerity** happens when you _don’t_ care about your employees, but _do_ care how they perceive you—you avoid guidance that could cause them to feel negatively about you. Praise is usually in the form of a false apology that dodges disagreement. For example, you might say, “Sorry for disagreeing with your decision. You’re probably right anyway,” instead of explaining your side of an argument. Criticism, stemming from a fear of negative perceptions, is usually too nice and dishonest. Imagine an employee gives a presentation with typos throughout—you don’t want to seem like a stickler, so you say the presentation was fine.

**Ruinous empathy** happens when you care very much about your employees, to the point of being afraid to hurt them with challenges or criticism. Praise is unspecific and superficial—your employee gives a confusing presentation, and you tell them their presentation went perfectly. Criticism, _if there is any_ , is insincere or far too nice— _everyone_ needed clarification at the end of the confusing presentation, but instead of addressing the issue, you say, “That presentation went perfectly! There were so many questions at the end, and you fielded them well.”

**Guidance from a place of radical candor involves both praise and criticism that are given _sincerely_. **Radically candid praise is specific, and you’re attuned to how your praise is landing with your recipient. For example, you might say, “That presentation went well—I could tell you spent quite some time clarifying your ideas. Great job fielding Greg’s question about the timeline. I think you persuaded everyone to your vision.”

Radically candid criticism is also specific, and is given when things go poorly _and_ when they go well. In praising your employee’s presentation, you might say, “Great presentation. You got a lot of people on board. However, the marketing team seemed less convinced. You should follow up with them, with _their_ interests at the forefront of discussion.”

#### Introduce Radically Candid Guidance to Your Team

Radically candid guidance can be off-putting if your team isn’t used to sincere criticism and praise. **Building a culture where radical candor is the norm has two parts:_asking_ for radically candid guidance and modeling an appropriate response, and _giving_ radically candid guidance. **

##### Asking for Radically Candid Guidance

In asking for guidance from your team, focus on engaging properly with criticism—**seeing you take criticism well builds your team’s trust and __ respect, and demonstrates the productive outcome that radically candid guidance can have.** There are five steps to effectively engaging with criticism and having productive conversations.

  1. **Ask for public criticism:** This shows your team that you’re open to challenges, and won’t react poorly if they try to give you feedback. 
  2. **Ask questions:** This can help cut through the discomfort of offering criticism—helpful questions include, “How can I better support you?” and “What is something I’m doing that you find frustrating?”
  3. **Push for answers:** Uncomfortable**** hesitation and silence don’t mean that there are _no_ areas for improvement. Push for sincere answers by repeating your question, staying quiet so the other person has space to speak up, or calling out conflicting words and body language—for example, “You’re agreeing with me, but your face is tense. What’s on your mind?” Don’t push too far—if they _really_ can’t think of anything, ask them to think about it and schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss. 
  4. **Manage your response:** It’s crucial that you respond in a way that shows that criticism is welcome and well-received. There are two behaviors to avoid. First, _don’t_ explain how your employee’s criticism wasn’t radically candid enough, as this will make them hesitant to give guidance again. Instead, listen for valuable parts of the criticism that you can act on or respond to. Second, _don’t_ respond with anger or defensiveness. Instead, listen with the intent to fully understand the criticism by repeating what’s been said and checking that your interpretation is correct. 
  5. **Express gratitude for criticism:** This encourages people to keep giving it. The best way to show gratitude is to make a _perceptible effort_ toward making changes. If you don’t agree with the criticism, you can still show gratitude by taking the time to explain why you disagree or why the change won’t be possible. 



##### Giving Radically Candid Guidance

Once your employees gain confidence in using radical candor, you can start giving them guidance as well. Radically candid guidance is based on six concepts:

  1. **Humility:** Humble guidance depends on focusing on the reality of the situation, not your perception. You can accomplish this by framing guidance around _the situation_ , _the person’s behavior_ , and _the outcome_. For example, instead of saying, “You’re bad at time management,” try, “I asked you to draft the client’s proposal (situation). You worked on less urgent projects until just before the deadline, then threw together a proposal full of typos (behavior). We’ve likely lost that client’s trust (outcome).”
  2. **Helpfulness:** First, make your intentions clear—you’re giving criticism to help, not to be hurtful. Second, be as precise as possible—precision about what’s good or bad about someone’s behavior clearly tells them what to do more or less of. Third, look for ways to outsource help when appropriate and available—such as speech coaches or therapists.
  3. **Immediacy:** Immediate feedback allows you to speak to the specifics of a situation that merit attention, and find ways to fix problems or build on success right away. Consistent, immediate guidance also helps your reports understand how their work is being received, which keeps them engaged. 
  4. **In-person:** Always give guidance in person if possible—you avoid misunderstandings if you see how your feedback is being received. Additionally, being present for negative emotions after criticism helps you demonstrate radical candor—if they’re upset, focus on caring personally to help them. If they’re not taking you seriously, focus on challenging directly to insist that your feedback is important. 
  5. **Public praise, private criticism:** Always default to giving praise in public and criticism in private. Public praise is meaningful for the recipient and demonstrates what your team should do more of. On the other hand, public criticism triggers defensiveness in the recipient and anxiety in your other team members who wonder if they’re next. 
  6. **Don’t personalize:** Make sure that your criticism targets the issue, rather than the person. Attributing a character trait to someone to explain their behavior, such as saying, “You’re careless,” doesn’t get to the root of the problem. However, saying, “There are too many typos in your reports” gives you a defined problem to find solutions to. 



#### Maintaining a Radically Candid Culture

**A radically candid culture is built on the continued use of caring personally and challenging directly.** As the boss, you can maintain caring relationships with your team members by giving them consistent guidance and having regular check-in meetings with them.

Furthermore, you can ensure that your employees act with radical candor toward _one another_ by insisting that they resolve conflicts together, instead of coming to you. You can also set up environments that encourage them to discuss their successes and failures openly. For example, in your weekly staff meeting, have employees nominate one another for an MVP award to recognize good work and highlight positive behaviors. Have them nominate _themselves_ for a “whoops” award to take accountability for mistakes and provide everyone with a learning opportunity.

### Managing Ambitions and Growth With Radical Candor

The third component of radically candid leadership is effectively managing the growth of your employees. In learning about your team members, you learn more about their goals, their motivations, and the growth trajectory they’re on—this helps you support them in ways that keep them engaged with their work and satisfied with their team.**There are five performance and growth trajectory combinations you’ll come across:**

**High performance with gradual growth:** These team members are your “rock stars,” the solid forces who keep things running smoothly. They aren’t looking for significant growth—perhaps because they’re happy with their current position, or other things in their lives are taking their time and energy. Support these team members by recognizing their efforts and thanking them, and by remembering that they deserve stellar performance reviews as much as those who are on rapid growth trajectories and gunning for a promotion.

**High performance with rapid growth:** These team members are your “superstars,” who want to move up in the ranks and are prepared to dedicate the necessary time and energy to doing so. They’re the results-driven people carrying your team to the next level. Support these team members by keeping them challenged with projects and new responsibilities, and by preparing them to continue moving up in their careers.

**Low performance with expected rapid growth:** These team members, based on their past track record of high performance, _should_ be excelling and taking on new projects, but are instead falling behind. Support these team members by first considering your management. Perhaps you’ve put this person in a role that doesn’t align with their skills, such as a people person on a numbers-crunching project. Be sure that they’ve received adequate training and clear guidelines. Then, consider _them._ If they seem to be having problems outside work, give them space to recover. If they’re a poor cultural fit with your organization, it’s best to let them go, rather than keep them in an environment that they’ll always be at odds with.

**Mediocre:** These team members consistently do okay, but not great, work.**** It’s crucial to your entire team that you figure out what the path forward should be for a mediocre employee—otherwise, your high-performers will become resentful as they continually pick up her slack. Radically candid conversations will reveal the best way to support her—either let her go so that she can thrive elsewhere, or give her space to get back on track towards high performance on her terms.

**Low performance with no growth:** When someone is not performing well, and isn’t showing any signs of future improvement, it’s probably best to fire them—doing so allows them to find a different job they’ll thrive in, and your team won’t have the burden of picking up their slack.

#### Creating Meaningful Growth Plans

To build meaning into the work of your team members and figure out what growth trajectory they should be on, you need to discuss their goals—this should take place in three parts:

  1. **The life story conversation:** This conversation is essential to getting to know your employee personally. Ask about her life story, focusing on changes she made and _why_ these changes were made—it’s often here that you’ll discover her values. 
  2. **The dreams conversation:** This conversation should help you understand what your employee ultimately wants out of her career and life, and how you can help her get there.**** It’s important to frame this conversation around _dreams_ because it usually pushes people to name non-work goals, such as, “I want to own a dude ranch in Colorado.” It’s possible that their dreams _will_ be work-related, such as, “I want to retire at 50.” Task her with figuring out the skills she’ll need and rating her own competence in each skill. 
  3. **The planning conversation:** In this conversation, you should help your employee come up with a solid plan for achieving her dreams. Instead of focusing on telling her how to move up in your organization, focus on finding ways to make her current work clearly translate to preparation for her dreams. This makes her work more meaningful and rewarding. Think of projects that could develop necessary skills, or consider mentors or classes that would be helpful. 



**When you take time to fully understand who each of your team members are and what their growth looks like, you build a team where everyone feels valued, promotions feel fair, and work feels meaningful—naturally leading to higher motivation and better results.**

### Promoting Effective Collaboration With Radical Candor

The fourth goal of a radically candid workplace is building a highly collaborative atmosphere and a team that works together to accomplish much more than you could individually. **There are seven steps to effective collaboration: listening, clarifying, debating, deciding, persuading, executing, and learning.**

#### Listening

When listening to team members’ ideas, you’ll usually resort to one of two types of listening: _quiet listening_ , which allows space in the conversation for the other person to speak their mind, and _loud listening_ , which involves putting a strong challenge on the table for discussion. Neither listening style is better than the other, and you don’t need to change your style when you become a boss. However, you _do_ need to stay attuned to how your employees receive your listening style—if they’re uncomfortable with a strong challenge, try giving them space to speak. If they find long silences unbearable, try putting forward a strong opinion for debate.

Teach your team members how to listen to each other—make sure everyone has a chance to speak in meetings, or have direct conversations with those you want to speak more or less. Idea-sharing among team members is important because they see small points for improvement that high-level managers often overlook, and can dedicate time to them. When small, innovative ideas are given the attention they deserve, they become big ideas. This inspires other team members to come forward with ideas, furthering the innovative cycle.

#### Clarifying

Schedule one-on-one meetings with team members to help refine their ideas for the next steps of collaboration. This is vital—unclear, half-baked ideas are likely to be dismissed or rejected when presented to others. Clarification has two main parts: letting your team member bounce ideas off you, and helping them know their audience. When your employee is bouncing an idea off you, don’t be afraid to point out logical flaws—this sparks brainstorming that reveals creative solutions that neither of you would have discovered on your own. Then, refine the idea until it’s impossible for any audience to misunderstand. Offer guidance about _who_ they’ll be presenting to, and which details should be omitted or emphasized to best capture the audience.

#### Debating

Keep your debates focused on _debate only_ , not a decision—this reduces the friction between those who want to make a decision ASAP and those who want to continue discussing an issue, and ensures that ideas are explored deeply enough.

Some ideas for building a respectful and healthy debate culture include: redirecting the conversation when it becomes clear that someone’s arguing to “win” instead of to make a good decision, stopping the meeting if it’s going on too long and wearing people out, or asking team members to argue the opposing side of the argument in the second half of the debate.

#### Deciding

Meetings dedicated solely to decisions are important because they signal that it’s time to stop discussing and start deciding. The decision-makers should be those who are close to the facts surrounding a situation, and thus have the best possible information to make a decision. Good bosses make sure that these people are given the clearance to make as many decisions as possible, instead of creating decision-making processes that favor senior positions or higher management.

The outcome of this meeting should be a meeting summary that’s sent out to relevant team members to explain the decision, and a decision that can’t be appealed or debated further.

#### Persuading

Once a decision has been reached, call an all-hands meeting to persuade everyone to the idea—this is important, because it makes sure that no one feels left in the dark. These meetings should have two parts: a presentation and a Q&A session.

  * **The presentation** is usually done by those executing on the idea and should include one or two reasons the decision is important or exciting. The goal is to get everyone informed _and_ on board.
  * **The Q &A** is usually led by higher-ups (such as the CEO or team leaders) to learn about the audience’s thoughts and concerns, and to persuasively answer challenging questions.



Throughout these two parts, there should be a focus on listening and responding to the audience’s feelings about the decision; proving the credibility of those who will execute on the decision by talking about their past achievements and commitment to the team; and explaining the logic of the decision, from the very first idea all the way to the all-hands meeting.

#### Executing

As the boss, you probably won’t be doing much idea-executing yourself—your job is to clear the path for your team members to execute as efficiently as possible. There are a few ways to accomplish this:

  * **Keep it efficient:** Always start meetings on time, and ask your employees to come to meetings with a prepared agenda and problems to address. Wrap up dragging debates by appointing a decision-maker and setting a decision deadline. Do your best to protect your team from time-wasting policies from higher management.
  * **Schedule execution time:** Block off time in your and your team members’ calendars that’s dedicated to executing on ideas. 
  * **Make workflows visible:** Creating a place where everyone can visualize their own workflows within the context of the team’s workflow helps teams identify issues, delays, and other problems early. They can then fix them on their own, before the issues get so large that management needs to step in. 



#### Learning

It’s crucial to examine your results and note the ways that the collaborative process could have gone more smoothly or been improved. Learning from errors or failure is how growth and improvement happens. In this process, people may accuse you of lacking integrity if you change your mind about a decision that was made. You can work against this by clearly communicating what new information caused you to change your mind.

### What Radical Candor Creates

When you commit yourself to caring personally about your team members and challenging them directly, you become a great boss. You build strong relationships with your team members, create a culture of sincere and helpful guidance, and put together growth plans that make sense and have personal motivations built in. With this kind of support, your team members will consistently bring their best selves to their work and their collaboration, delivering results that you’d never be able to accomplish alone.
