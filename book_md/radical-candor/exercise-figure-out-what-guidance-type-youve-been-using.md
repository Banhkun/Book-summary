## Exercise: Figure Out What Guidance Type You’ve Been Using

Think about how you usually give guidance to your employees to figure out where you should ramp up your efforts in caring personally or challenging directly.

* * *

Think of a recent situation where you had to give one of your team members praise or criticism (or both). Describe what you said to them.

What aspects of your praise or feedback do you think were radically candid? Keep in mind that radically candid praise and criticism is sincere and specific.

What aspects of your praise or criticism do you think _weren’t_ radically candid? Explain how the praise or criticism might have been obnoxiously aggressive, manipulatively insincere, or ruinously empathetic.

Try reframing your non-radically candid praise or criticism so that it’s more sincere and specific. Describe what you should have said instead.
