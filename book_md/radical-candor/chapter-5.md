## Chapter 5: Honoring Your Employees’ Ambitions

If you’re working on caring personally about your team members, you’ll naturally learn more about their goals and the growth trajectory they’re on. **This information supports you in the third component of a radically candid culture—effectively managing your team members’ ambitions and growth in order to build a more productive and satisfied team.**

### The Five Types of Team Members and How to Support Them

Your employees will likely fall into one of five performance and growth trajectory combinations:

  1. High performance with rapid growth (“superstar”)
  2. High performance with gradual growth (“rock star”)
  3. Low performance with no growth
  4. Low performance with expected rapid growth
  5. Mediocre



#### 1\. Supporting High Performance With Rapid Growth (Superstars)

**“Superstars”** are team members who like their work and are very good at it, and who are on a very rapid growth trajectory. They’re looking to move up in the ranks and are prepared to dedicate the necessary time and energy to doing so. These results-driven people are often coming up with innovative ideas, carrying your team to the next level.

**The most important step in supporting your superstars is _making sure they’re consistently challenged so they don’t feel bored or get stuck._** There are three ways you can meaningfully push your superstars to continue growing: keep them challenged, don’t get in their way, and don’t assume they want to manage.

**Keep them challenged:** To prevent boredom, superstars need to be learning constantly. Be on the lookout for new projects they can take on, or find a mentor from outside your team that can help them more than you can. Bear in mind that they’ll most likely outgrow your team, so don’t become too dependent on them—be ready to replace them. You can create a challenge for them by asking them to help you with this—they can teach or train those who are meant to take over once they’ve moved on.

**Don’t get in their way:** Recognize that your job is to encourage your superstars to grow beyond your team, or help them get hired to a place where they can thrive. All too many managers squash their superstars’ ambitions and growth because they want to keep the great work and willing attitude for themselves and their team. Stifling your employee in this way will cause resentment, lack of motivation, and subsequently, poor work. Likewise, many managers fail to recognize when they have a potential superstar on their hands who just doesn’t do great work on _their_ team. There are other places this person can thrive—make sure you’re not holding them back from pursuing better opportunities by insisting that they just try harder in their current position. Help them look for opportunities where they can do great work.

**Don’t assume they want to manage:** Thinking that growth naturally leads to management is a common mistake, because in many organizations there’s a real emphasis put on “leadership potential.” This emphasis on leadership is unfair on several levels. **It’s unfair for the superstar because it naturally caps their growth.** If they’re full of potential, but not _leadership_ potential, there’s only so far they can advance in the organization. They may have untapped growth that can continue to massively benefit the organization or their field, but they’re held back because they don’t want to be anyone’s boss. **It’s also unfair to the teams of unwilling managers.** When someone’s a boss just because that was the only advancement available, they’ll either do a mediocre job out of disinterest, or a downright bad job out of resentment. Bad management limits both the growth of the employee who could thrive outside a management position, and the growth of team members who could thrive under good management.

Google gets around this particular problem with their “individual contributor” career path, which is even more prestigious than many management positions and is designed to honor the ambitions of superstars who don’t want to be anyone’s boss. In this position, superstars can continue growing and learning on their own terms—they have no overhead supervision and have the freedom to work on projects as they see fit.

#### 2\. Supporting High Performance With Gradual Growth (Rock Stars)

**Rock stars** are team members who like their work and are very good at it, but have chosen not to follow a rapid growth trajectory. They might be happy where they are, or have other things going on in their lives outside work that they want to dedicate time and energy to. These reliable team members are the people who keep things running smoothly from day to day.

**The most important step in supporting your rock stars is _making sure you’re not ignoring them or their work._ **There are two ways you can meaningfully support your rock stars: make sure you’re giving them fair reviews, and give them regular recognition for their efforts.

**Give them fair reviews:** Many organizations’ review processes focus too heavily on leadership or promotion potential.**** If you focus too heavily on these factors, your rock stars will often be overlooked when it comes to performance reviews—especially if your organization sets a quota on how many stellar reviews you can give out. Your rock stars deserve a few places among these stellar reviews, even if they’re not gunning for a promotion. You should make sure there’s an even mix of rock stars and superstars at the top of your reviews, to ensure that not all your praise is being reserved for those on a rapid growth trajectory.

**Give them regular recognition:** Your rock stars deserve recognition and respect for the role they have in keeping things running smoothly in your organization. There are a few ways you can meaningfully recognize your rock stars:

  * Simply say thank you to them—this demonstrates that you not only see their work, but you see _them_
  * Establish them as an “expert” in their work, someone who can be trusted with decisions and giving out information
  * Give praise in a way that’s personal and attuned to their interests. For example, an employee who hates the spotlight should receive their recognition privately, but an employee who enjoys the validation of a group should be recognized via public announcement. 



**It’s crucial to realize that promotions are almost never the type of recognition a rock star wants._Don’t_** put rock stars up for promotion without having an honest discussion with them about what they want. Otherwise, you risk promoting someone beyond their competence—which a superstar might take as an interesting challenge, but will overwhelm a rock star—or promoting someone who’s competent but has no desire for the new position. While this risk might feel like the right decision for _you_ , it can cost you a valuable employee. Scott witnessed a fellow manager make this mistake: one of his employees had carefully planned out his career so that by the time he had a child, he’d have a solid, well-paying job that he’d mastered. He would have plenty of time and mental energy to focus on his child, because he was so comfortable with his work. However, his manager had other plans and promoted him. The employee, who wanted to stay in his rock star position, declined the promotion and was told that declining wasn’t an option—so, he quit.

#### 3\. Supporting Low Performance With No Growth

When someone has a track record of low performance, and isn’t showing _any_ signs of improvement, you most likely need to fire them. Before doing so, there are three questions to ask yourself:

  * **Have I demonstrated radical candor toward this person?** Reflect on your relationship with this person, considering if you’ve adequately shown your investment in her as a person, and been clear in your expectations when challenging her. Reflect on your feedback sessions: has your praise been sincere, and your criticism followed up with solutions? 
  * **How is this person’s performance affecting my team?** If this person isn’t performing well, it’s likely that their poor work has been getting in the way of other team members’ work or has been taking your attention away from higher-performing team members. Are they contributing anything worthwhile to the team, or just bringing everyone down? 
  * **Have I asked for advice from someone else?** Ask for a neutral third party’s opinion—it’s possible that you weren’t as clear with your expectations as you thought, or you’re not looking at everything this team member contributes to the team, only what they’re taking away. A third party can tell you whether you’re justified in firing your employee, or need to give them a second chance.



#### 4\. Supporting Low Performance With Expected Rapid Growth

You might be faced with an employee who, based on their past track record of high performance, _should_ be excelling and taking on new projects, but is instead falling behind or slacking. There are four likely reasons for this: **1) they’re in the wrong role, 2) they’re having a bumpy entry into their new role, 3) they’re having problems at home, or 4) it’s a poor cultural fit.**

**They’re in the wrong role:** Their low performance may be a reflection of your decision to put them in the wrong role. Keep in mind that your employee likely won’t tell you if this is the problem—blaming your boss for your own performance is uncomfortable and feels like an attempt to refuse accountability. You should ask yourself: Are their attributes aligned with this role’s required skill set? Would they do better elsewhere?

For example, you have an employee who’s a wonderful leader and gets great results, so you put her on a tough project. To your surprise, her results are very poor, and she seems completely unmotivated. After considering her attributes, you realize that she’s a great leader because she’s wonderful at working with people, but this particular project requires hours behind closed doors, crunching numbers. You transfer her to a new project where she manages people, and she excels in the new role.

**They’re having a bumpy entry into their new role:** There are a few reasons your employee might be having a hard time finding their place in a new role. First, they may not have had adequate training. Ask yourself if your expectations are clear, and if their training covered everything they need to know. You might find you need to invest a bit more time into giving more effective training. Second, they may be overloaded with work. Make sure you’re not giving them too much to handle right out of the gate—it’s easy for bosses to lose sight of an employee’s “newness” and give them a workload that only someone with years of experience could accomplish quickly.

**They’re having problems at home:** Naturally, your employees will occasionally have to deal with personal problems that will affect their work performance. If you’re aware of something happening in your employee’s home life, let her have time and space to recover from the issue on her own. Show that you care by not pushing for high performance until she’s ready—this leads to an effective recovery, instead of a buildup of stress and resentment.

**It’s a poor cultural fit:** Sometimes an employee is a great fit for the role, but not your work culture. This is an incredibly difficult gap to close. In this case, it’s usually best that the employee leave the organization—otherwise, they will be held back in a culture or among colleagues that they’re always at odds with.

#### 5\. Nudging Mediocrity One Way or the Other

Sometimes, you’ll have an employee who is simply average—they regularly hand in work that’s good but not great, and don’t show much evidence of growth. There are several reasons an employee can get stuck in _mediocrity._ Sometimes, they’re uninterested in changing—either they fear taking a step back in order to restart on a new path, they feel pressure to keep their position, or they’re in their position solely for the money and power. Other times, the boss doesn’t want to go through the effort of the firing process. Many bosses hesitate on this process because they think it will be too hard to find and train a new person, or the discomfort of the conversation and the employee’s negative feelings is too daunting.

A good boss treats a mediocre employee fairly—this means knowing her well enough to decide if you should let her go or give her space. **Letting your employee go is the fair choice when she’s clearly stuck in a position she’s not suited for or thriving in.** It’s unfair to assume that mediocrity is just the best she can do. While the process of firing takes time and effort, and feels like the “mean” thing to do, it’s selfish and cruel to stifle an employee’s potential by keeping her onboard just so you can avoid effort and discomfort. **Giving your employee space is the fair choice when she needs to recover from a personal event.** A boss who cares personally about her employees understands what’s going on in their lives and how it may cause their work to fall short, and knows to avoid pushing for better performance in a moment when their employee can’t handle it.

**Growth Management Mistakes to Avoid**

Bosses often make a couple mistakes when thinking of how to manage their employees. First, they think of their employees in terms of their “potential”—this automatically ranks superstars above rock stars, even though they’re equally important. It’s helpful to reframe how you think. Instead of focusing on potential, consider your employees’ past performance, growth, _and_ willingness or interest in continuing their growth. This line of thinking gives you the best idea of whose work is consistently valuable, and what type of growth trajectory each of your employees is on.

Second, many bosses think that pushing _all_ employees into a rapid growth trajectory will lead to better results. However, the best results are delivered when you see and honor the motivations of each of your employees. Your rock stars shouldn’t be forced into doing work or taking on roles that come with a work or stress level they’ll find overwhelming. Keeping them on a gradual growth trajectory contributes to great results because it prevents burnout. Your superstars, on the other hand, _can and should_ be put on a rapid growth trajectory—this contributes to great results by preventing boredom and frustration.

**While it’s important to manage all of your employees, you’ll want to focus most of your time on supporting your rock stars and superstars.** Otherwise, you end up wasting time trying to take “okay” to “good” when you could be focusing your efforts on taking “good” to “great.” When you have a strong team and you can trust that all your employees are doing great work, then you can trust that they’ll work together in a way that drives great results.

### How (and Why) Labels Change

**These labels are not permanent—growth trajectories and goals change constantly, based on work or life events that dictate the amount of work someone can take on.** Someone who was once a high performer may reach a point where they’re no longer invested in the work and become a low performer, or one of your superstars may have a situation in their home life that slows their growth for the time being. For example, Scott—usually in a superstar role—found herself needing extra time to readjust after the birth of her twins. She asked to be placed in a rock star role for several years, allowing her to spend more time with her family. When she was ready, she jumped back onto her superstar trajectory.

**Because circumstances are constantly changing, it’s important that you frequently check in with your employees to learn about what’s going on in their lives, talk about their ambitions, and ensure that their growth trajectory suits them.** In the next chapter, we’ll discuss how to have these conversations and put all your team members on the right track. ****
