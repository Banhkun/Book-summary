## Step 3: Develop a Vision

Now that Louis has assembled the right penguins and turned them into a real team, **they need to figure out what to do about the danger that the melting iceberg poses.** In this part we’ll see how the team brainstorms solutions, and then comes up with short- and long-term plans.

(Shortform note: _The Leadership Challenge _combines this step and the next (Spread the Word) into a single principle: **Be Inspirational.** In other words, both your vision and the way you communicate it are part of inspiring your colleagues to make the change that your organization needs.)

### The Visitor

The team of penguins started thinking about possible solutions to the expanding water inside the iceberg and also asked other penguins in the colony for suggestions. However, none of the ideas they came up with were practical.

Eventually, a passing seagull landed on the iceberg, and Buddy and the Professor went to speak to it. They learned that the gull was a scout for a nomadic flock—the seagulls lived by constantly moving from one place to another, and this particular bird helped find places for the flock to go.

> The penguins’ traditional ways of thinking couldn’t adapt to this new situation, so none of them could come up with a solution to the iceberg melting. Like the penguins, it’s important to realize when old practices and thought patterns can’t handle a changing world.
> 
> For example, marketing guru Seth Godin wrote _Purple Cow_ because he believed that traditional marketing methods weren’t effective anymore. Godin goes on to say that, even though conventional mass-marketing is expensive and ineffective, countless companies rely on it to sell their products, because **they’re stuck in traditional ways of thinking.**
> 
> Had the penguins remained stuck like those companies, they’d have stayed on the iceberg until it shattered, and the colony would have been wiped out.

#### The Vision

The visiting seagull gave the penguins an idea for a simple, practical solution: They would leave the iceberg.

The Professor wondered why nobody had thought of that as soon as they realized that the iceberg was in danger. Louis responded that it wasn’t so surprising—they’d only ever known life on the iceberg, so leaving would be completely outside of their experience. **They’d needed inspiration from an outside source in order to think of it.**

> Seeking wisdom from unfamiliar sources, as the penguins did by befriending the seagull, does more than just give you new ideas—it boosts your ability to think creatively and improves your mood as well.
> 
> In _The Magic of Thinking Big_ , author and life strategist David J. Schwartz suggests finding friends and social groups with diverse backgrounds, religions, and political views. He describes such connections as “psychological sunshine”—both enlightening and enjoyable—and says that they’re part of building an ideal environment for yourself.
