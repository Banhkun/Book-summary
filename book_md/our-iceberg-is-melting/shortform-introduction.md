## Shortform Introduction

_Our Iceberg Is Melting_ is a fable about a colony of penguins who realize that their home might be destroyed soon, and that they need to move the entire colony to a new iceberg. However, despite the looming threat, making such a big change isn’t easy.

This book by Dr. John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber will teach you, through the penguin fable, the necessary steps in making major changes to your company or your personal life.

In this guide, we’ll explore some of the topics in greater detail and present alternative theories or points of view; we’ll provide the kind of in-depth study that a short story like _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ has to forego in favor of simplicity and clarity in its lessons.

### About the Authors

Dr. John Kotter is a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and the founder of the management consulting firm Kotter International. He’s widely regarded as one of the world’s top authorities on effective leadership and driving change.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Penguin Random House

Imprint: Portfolio / Penguin

The original edition of _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ was published in 2006. The 10th anniversary edition—published in 2016—adds new illustrations, an updated afterword, and a Q&A from Kotter and Rathgeber. (This guide references the 2016 edition.)

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

The original edition of _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ came out in 2006, around the time of the U.S. housing market crash and just before the Great Recession. It was a time of major changes in the economic world, so the lessons in this fable were especially important.

#### Intellectual Context

_Our Iceberg Is Melting_ is a spiritual successor to _Who Moved My Cheese, _another animal-centric fable about making necessary changes _._ However, while _Who Moved My Cheese?_ focused on making changes at the personal level (a mouse finding a new food source), _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ expands those ideas to the organizational level (moving an entire penguin colony to a new location).

**_Who Moved My Cheese?:_** **7 steps for personal change** | **_Our Iceberg Is Melting:_** **8 steps for organizational change**  
---|---  
Step 1: Be prepared for change  | Step 1: Create urgency   
Step 2: Let go of the past  | Step 2: Assemble a team   
Step 3: Adapt—be open to new things  | Step 3: Create a vision   
Step 4: Imagine success  | Step 4: Enlist volunteers   
Step 5: Handle your fears  | Step 5: Remove barriers   
Step 6: Learn to enjoy change  | Step 6: Win small victories   
Step 7: Be prepared for continuous change  | Step 7: Accelerate change   
| Step 8: Cement the changes   
  
**There are distinct parallels between the two processes:**

  * Step 1 of personal change is to be ready for it, while step 1 of organizational change is to create urgency—thereby making sure that your colleagues are ready for change. 
  * Step 4 of personal change and step 3 of organizational change are both about imagining the future; what’s your goal, and what do you need to do in order to reach it?
  * Step 5 in both processes is to eliminate obstacles. This step is explicitly stated in the organizational change process; meanwhile, when it comes to personal change, the biggest obstacle you’re facing is probably your own fear.
  * Step 6 of both processes is to appreciate and celebrate what you’ve already accomplished, even if you haven’t achieved your main goal yet.
  * Step 7 of both processes is to be ready to make more changes, and strive for continuous improvement. 
    * The organizational change process goes a step further by advising that you take steps to make the changes permanent within your organization—this step may not be necessary in personal change, because there won’t be other people trying to undo what you’ve accomplished. 



Fables are generally seen as learning tools for children (_Aesop’s Fables _are the most famous examples). Fables for adults, including business fables like _Who Moved My Cheese?_ and _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ ,__ are quite recent by comparison. However, increasing numbers of people are finding that stories are more engaging and memorable—even for adults—than dry lectures or purely informational books.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Our Iceberg Is Melting_ has become a go-to book for organizations who are looking to make major changes. Amazon reviews, as well as the quotes at the beginning of the book itself, show that organizations ranging from local church groups to major multinational corporations have used the lessons in _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ to drive positive internal change.

The publisher’s page for _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ states that it has “...changed millions of lives in organizations around the world.”

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Our Iceberg Is Melting_ is a New York Times bestseller, and high-ranking executives from many different corporations have praised the book __ for its simple, clear approach to the difficult topic of driving change _._

For example, Tom Curley, President and CEO of the Associated Press, said that they’d “moved quickly on several fronts,” thanks to the lessons in this book. Richard Kosinski, a category development officer at Yahoo, said that it’s a “must-read” for anyone in charge of a major change at a company.

However, some reviews on Amazon, Goodreads, and other sites argue that the book’s approach was too simple to be useful—that it glosses over all the actual work of driving change with a cute story. Others felt that the authors were talking down to them by writing _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ in the style of a children’s book.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The information in _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ is presented as a fable, to show why each step of driving change is important, and how each step plays out in practice. This approach is intended to be more engaging and more helpful than a simple list of steps to follow.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_Our Iceberg Is Melting_ is well organized—each action the characters take logically leads to the next, and you can see how those actions drive the necessary changes to save the penguin colony. The authors also include a simple list of their eight steps for change at the end of the book, which is a helpful reference after you’ve read the penguin fable.

Since each of Kotter’s eight steps relies upon the steps before it, and the penguin story follows those eight steps, this is the best way to organize the information that Kotter and Rathgeber present within this book.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we look beyond the penguin fable in order to highlight the actionable lessons within it. We also explore certain topics in greater detail, such as the difficulties that you’re likely to encounter at each step and how leadership experts suggest that you tackle those problems.

The original text of _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ includes a somewhat modified version of Kotter’s eight-step process:

  1. Create urgency
  2. Assemble a team
  3. Create a vision
  4. Spread the word
  5. Empower others
  6. Win small victories
  7. Continue driving change
  8. Make a new company culture



As some of the steps are naturally included in others, we’ve reworked Kotter’s eight steps down to six.

  * The original Step 5 was to empower others, and Step 6 was to win small victories. 
    * We’ve combined those steps because the entire purpose of empowering other people is to let them handle the small problems (and win the small victories) that your team doesn’t have the time or resources to take care of personally.
  * The original Step 7 was to continue driving change, and Step 8 was to create a new culture. 
    * Creating a new culture _requires_ you to continue driving change, so we’ve grouped those steps together. 



Finally, since pitching a new company culture to your employees is a lot like advertising a new product to your customers, we’ve included connections to helpful marketing tips and insights that will help you to do so.
