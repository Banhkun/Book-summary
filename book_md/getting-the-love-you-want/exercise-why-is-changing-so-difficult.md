## Exercise: Why Is Changing So Difficult?

According to Hendrix and Hunt, making gradual change is essential to growth, and yet it’s the hardest part of any process. They suggest that the most difficult changes to make are ones that contradict lessons we were taught as children.

* * *

Think of a time when someone (a colleague, friend, or member of your family) asked you to change in a way you didn’t like. What was the change they asked you to make?

What feelings did the change request bring up? (Name as many as you can think of, whether or not you openly expressed them.)

Is there a message or value that you may have learned from your caregivers that led you to feel the way you did?

If so, does this message or value still apply to the present? Why or why not?
