## Exercise: Which Childhood Feelings Drive Your Actions?

Hendrix and Huntâ€™s underlying premise is that we carry the emotional reactions we learned as children with us into adulthood. Even without knowing, we may react to an event in the present by replaying a scenario from our past.

* * *

Recall a time when you felt angry or hurt as a child. What happened to make you feel that way, and how did you react?

What specific emotions did you feel? (Name as many as you can think of, whether or not you openly expressed them.)

Has anything happened to you as an adult that made you feel the same way? If so, what was it?
