## Exercise: Design a New Habit

In this exercise, you’ll think through what you could do to create a positive new habit using the techniques we discussed in the guide.

* * *

Briefly describe a behavior that you would like to make habitual.

What will you use as a cue to trigger your new habit? Remember that it should be something that you won’t easily forget or overlook. Consider building onto an existing habit that’s already part of your routine.

What immediate reward will you get for performing the behavior? Recall that an immediate reward is necessary for the action to become a habit. What could you do to maximize the reward or maximize your anticipation of the reward?

Now that you’ve designed your habit, think about how you could break it down or scale it back so that it’s extremely easy to begin. Remember, the easier something is, the more likely it is you’ll actually do it, and repetition is important for habit formation. Describe the smallest, easiest step you could take toward creating your new habit.
