## Exercise: Change an Existing Habit

In this exercise, you’ll think through what you could do to change a habit you already have for the better using the techniques we discussed in the guide.

* * *

Briefly describe a habit you already have that you would like to change. What is the habit routine (the behavior), and what do you want to change about it? For example, maybe you have a habit of sitting in bed and browsing social media for a long time before you go to sleep. Maybe you just want to quit browsing social media in bed, or maybe you want to substitute something else, like reading a book for half an hour each night.

What cue or cues trigger your habit? If you’re not sure, think about the last few times you acted out the routine of the habit and brainstorm a few possible cues that might have triggered it. For example, in the case of browsing social media in bed, the cue could be feeling lonely when you’re alone in your bedroom.

What immediate reward is reinforcing the behavior? If you’re not sure, brainstorm a few possible rewards and describe how you could experiment on yourself to test them. For example, in the case of browsing social media in bed, maybe browsing social media alleviates loneliness.

What would have to change about the habit’s rewards, or about how you perceive and anticipate them, for the routine to change the way you want it to? Try to brainstorm a few different possibilities. For example, could reading an autobiography alleviate feelings of loneliness better than social media by giving you a deeper sense of connection with the author?

Select one of the possibilities from the previous question and identify the smallest possible step you could take toward creating that change. Describe it below. For example, maybe when you get into bed each night, you’ll open the book you want to read, and you’ll read one word.
