## Exercise: Look Back on the Joy of Learning

Through his lifelong love of solving puzzles and figuring things out, Richard Feynman exemplified the notion that curiosity, persistence, and fun go hand-in-hand. Think about the times in your life when youâ€™ve felt driven to solve some puzzle or learn something new, and how the process of discovery made you feel.

Describe a skill or an area of knowledge (such as painting, trading stocks, or driving a car) that you felt an urge to master at some point in your life. What process did you use to go about learning?

What was the hardest part about learning that skill? How did you persist through whatever difficulty you encountered, and what sort of breakthrough did you experience after?

Looking back on the experience of learning your new skill, what was the most enjoyable moment? How would you encourage others who are undertaking the same process?
