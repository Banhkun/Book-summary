## 1-Page Summary

Is there something you wish you could change about your past? If so, you're not alone. Most people live with regrets—yet believe that an ideal approach to life is to live with "no regrets." In _The Power of Regret,_ Daniel H. Pink, _New York Times_ best-selling author of Drive and To Sell Is Human, argues against this approach. Regret is a normal, healthy part of life, according to Pink, and he maintains that regret plays an important role in _improving_ your life. By processing and learning from your regrets, you can lead a happier and more fulfilling life.

Our guide will cover _The Power of Regret_ in four parts:

**Part 1: What Is Regret?** explains the process of experiencing regret to ground our discussion.

**Part 2: Common Regrets** takes a look at the types of things people regret most about their lives.

**Part 3: The Wrong Way to Handle Regret** explores what Pink considers to be the worst approaches toward regret.

**Part 4: How to Turn Regret to Your Advantage** examines Pink's process for responding to and growing from regrets. We also consider his advice for using regret to make better decisions in the future.

Throughout the guide, our commentary will extend Pink's advice with actionables and insights from other authors while exploring the psychological research underpinning his ideas.

### Part 1: What Is Regret?

Before we explain the benefits of regret, it helps to ground our discussion in Pink’s definition of regret. Most people identify regret as a _painful feeling_ that arises while reflecting on past decisions and wishing they had acted differently. However, **Pink argues that we should view regret not as a feeling, but as _the outcome of a process_ —not as something we _have_ , but as something we _do._**

He explains that our brains must engage in a multi-step process to create an experience of regret. In this section, we'll walk you through the three steps of regret and explain the different factors that enable it.

#### The Three-Step Process of Regret

Pink explains that the process of regret involves three steps: telling a story about the past, inventing a new story about an alternative past, then comparing the two.

##### Step #1: Telling a Story About the Past

Pink explains that **the first thing someone needs to experience regret is a story about their past.** He suggests that we as humans are unique in our ability to tell stories and to “time travel” in our imaginations. We begin the process of regret by creating a narrative about something we did or didn’t do in the past.

(Shortform note: Psychologists explain that the story you tell about yourself changes throughout your life. Storytelling is a way of reconciling past events with your present self-image. Storytelling also plays an important role in defining your trajectory in life—your sense of where you’re going and where you’ve been. Therefore, the story you tell yourself about your past may not be an accurate reflection of events, but rather a reflection of how you feel and think about your life in the present.)

##### Step #2: Imagining an Alternative Story

Pink explains that **the second step in the process is creating a new narrative in which you behaved differently in the past.** You imagine that your life in the present is different because your past self acted differently.****

If your original story was about a poor decision you made or an opportunity you let slip through your fingers, this alternative story is a fantasy where you made the opposite decision or took advantage of the opportunity. In the alternative story, your life played out differently because of this change in the past. At this point in the process, you haven't yet compared the two stories—you've simply created them.

(Shortform note: Understanding the psychology behind daydreaming and fantasy can help explain why we tell alternative stories. Researchers have found that people often daydream hypothetical solutions to problems they can't solve in their current lives. This is why daydreams often feel like wishful thinking: They show us a world in which problems like isolation, lack of career advancement, or failed romantic relationships have been resolved. Therefore, imagining alternative stories of your past self may be a way of exploring hypothetical solutions to the real problems you're struggling with now.)

##### Step #3: Comparison and Evaluation

**Pink explains that you complete the process by comparing and evaluating the two presents.** You’ll then decide which one you like better: your current life (original story) or the alternative present (alternative story). This stage has two potential outcomes, and one of them leads to regret.

**Outcome 1: You like your _actual life_ more than your _imagined life_. **This comparison will produce a sense of relief that you’ve avoided a worse fate than your current life. However, this outcome is extremely rare because most people are more inclined to dwell on what could have gone _better_ in their lives than what could have gone _worse_. Outcome 1 occurs most often with people who have had near-death experiences or survived natural disasters.

**Outcome 2: You like your _imagined life_ more than your _actual life_. **When you see that you’re happier and more fulfilled in the imagined scenario than in your current life, you may feel a sense of pain, loss, or grief. You then attribute this feeling to the decision you made in your first story, leading you to experience _regret._ For example, if you have a relative who recently passed away and you didn’t spend much time with them, you may think, “If only I'd reached out to this relative sooner, I would have had this relationship in my life.” Pink explains that this second outcome is far more common than the first.

> **Understanding Negativity Bias**
> 
> In understanding why the second outcome (liking the alternative present more than the real present) occurs so much more often than the alternative (liking your real present more than the alternative), it helps to explore something psychologists call negativity bias.
> 
> Researchers have found that people are far more attentive to negative parts of their lives than positive ones. They remember painful interactions more often than enjoyable ones, spend more time thinking about the distressing parts of their lives than parts of their lives going well, and will pay more attention to bad news than good news.
> 
> Psychologists argue the explanation lies in evolution. Human minds are fine-tuned to focus on dangers and threats so that people can overcome them and survive. Therefore, it's no surprise that people will focus more on the parts of their lives that didn't turn out well than the parts that did.

#### Conditions for Regret

Pink suggests that, beyond creating a story of a preferable imagined life, two additional factors determine whether someone will engage in the process of regret: personal agency and opportunity.

##### Regret Condition #1: Personal Agency

**Pink clarifies that people only feel regret if they believe _themselves_ to be the _cause_ of their negative situation.** The comparison between their two possible presents will only produce regret if their negative situation is due to their past actions or decisions.

While almost everyone experiences painful emotions when events don't work out the way they’d hoped, if they don't consider themselves the _cause_ of their negative situation, they feel _disappointment_ rather than _regret_.

(Shortform note: Pink distinguishes disappointment from regret and focuses his advice on overcoming regret. However, disappointment can be just as painful and debilitating, and it is worth mentioning how psychologists recommend approaching this emotion. Many people make their disappointments feel worse because they catastrophize—"I didn't get this job and so I'll never have a satisfying career,” or they personalize—"This romantic partner rejected me because I don't deserve a happy relationship." Instead, psychologists recommend that you learn from your disappointments: Set realistic expectations, but keep trying.)

That said, Pink offers one important caveat: **Sometimes people incorrectly attribute an outcome to their actions when it was actually beyond their control.** For example, someone who is laid off from their job may attribute the situation to poor work performance, when actually their company simply decided to eliminate the role entirely. This false attribution may lead them to regret inconsequential mistakes, such as coming to work late once or making a typo on an email. As we will see later in this guide, _correctly analyzing_ the situation is an important part of growing from regret.

(Shortform note: The tendency to blame yourself for everything that goes wrong in your life may be a symptom of anxiety. Psychologists argue that people with high anxiety will falsely attribute outcomes to themselves because it soothes the feeling that they lack control—even though blaming themselves may be painful, it could be less scary than being at the mercy of fate.)

##### Regret Condition #2: Opportunity

Pink explains that **people only regret past decisions if they believe they could have chosen otherwise.** If there wasn't a choice they could have made to change the outcome, they can't really attribute their present situation to this choice. Therefore, people who have more opportunities in a given situation tend to have more regrets.

For example, you’re more likely to regret your career choice if you live in a town with a diverse range of industries because you had lots of potential career options. However, if you live in a small town with only one or two industries, you have fewer alternative paths to take and therefore fewer opportunities to imagine how your life could have been different. You’re less likely to regret your career choice because you’ve given up fewer alternative paths.

(Shortform note: In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz expands on why more options leads to a higher probability of regret. He explains that the more options you have, the higher the opportunity cost of the choice. An opportunity cost is simply the economic term for what is lost by pursuing one course of action over another. Since you must let go of more options, the opportunity cost of your decision goes up with the number of alternative choices you could have made—and therefore making a choice creates a stronger sense of loss.)

### Part 2: Common Regrets

Now that we understand _how_ people come to experience regret, we'll explore the _kinds_ of things people regret most. In this section, we'll cover the difference between regrets of things done and regrets of things not done, and we'll also explore Pink's four categories of regret.

#### Regrets of Things Done vs. Regrets of Things Not Done

**Pink first divides regrets into two categories: regrets of things done and regrets of things not done.** A regret of things done occurs when people _do something_ and then wish that they hadn't, such as stealing from a grocery store or cheating on their spouse. A regret of things not done occurs when someone _doesn't do_ _something_ they wish they had. This could be an opportunity they let pass by, such as starting their own business or asking someone out on a date.

**Most people tend to have more regrets of things not done than regrets of things done.** Pink also notes that the ratio between the two types also grows more lopsided with age: Young people tend to have an equal number of regrets of things done and regrets of things not done, but as they age, they gain more regrets of things not done. This is because, as time goes by, they have fewer opportunities to finally do the things they wish they had done earlier in life.

(Shortform note: Psychologists have also found that the passage of time changes your relationship to both types of regrets, but in opposite directions. You are more likely to regret a thing done if you did it recently. However, the more time passes, the less you will tend to regret it. Regrets of things not done work in the opposite direction. You are _less likely_ to regret not doing something if you failed to do it recently, but as time goes by, you’ll come to regret it _more and more_.)

#### The Four Main Categories of Regret

**Pink clarifies that most of the regrets people have in life fit into one of four categories.** Each of these categories includes either regrets of things done or not done, but they refer to _the areas of people's lives where they wish they'd acted differently._ Pink derives these categories from a broad national survey asking people to share their regrets. In this section, we’ll explore his four main categories of regret: stability, ethics, personal risk-taking, and relationships.

##### Regret Category #1: Stability

**Stability regrets occur when people wish they’d done more to invest in creating a stable life for themselves.** People experience stability regrets when they realize the destabilizing consequences of their lifestyle late in life and wish they could go back and adopt different habits or attitudes in the past. Common stability regrets include wishing that they had taken better care of their physical health, invested more in their education and skill development, or handled money more responsibly.

(Shortform note: In considering stability regrets, it helps to understand the role of social comparison in regret formation. Researchers have found that you’re more likely to regret a perceived failure if you see others who have achieved what you want. For example, you may be more likely to regret not making money if you have wealthy friends, or to regret not exercising if your friends are all physically fit.)

##### Regret Category #2: Ethics

**People experience ethical regrets when they feel they've acted against their personal code of ethics.** These are _regrets of things done_ more often than _regrets of things not done_ , as people reflect on their moral transgressions. However, some people have ethical regrets of things not done as they look back on missed opportunities to serve their communities or stand up for their values.

The most common ethical regrets voiced by participants in Pink’s survey were bullying and infidelity. Many participants also regretted having abortions or missing out on the opportunity to serve their countries through the military or other branches of national service.

(Shortform note: To understand how ethical regrets can be so long-lasting and painful, it helps to explore "decision-justification theory." Psychologists studying regret propose that our ability to justify the decision we regret determines the intensity of our feelings of regret: If we have a good justification for the regretted decision, the regret won't feel as intense. However, if we lack a justification, we will feel the regret more intensely. This explains why ethical regrets can be some of the most painful: Because people have violated their own code of ethics, it becomes much harder to justify the decision, leading to a more intensely felt regret.)

##### Regret Category #3: Bravery

**People experience bravery regrets when they fail to take a risk that is important and meaningful to them.** These are almost always regrets of things not done, as people look back on their lives and wish they’d taken a risk to do something they really wanted instead of playing it safe. They imagine how their lives would be different if they had followed their dream and see a loss of growth and potential.

People with bravery regrets may wish they had started a business, invested themselves more fully in passions like music or art, chosen a more ambitious career path, or made a big life decision like moving to a new country.

(Shortform note: Psychologists have found that bravery regrets often stem from a person's failure to live up to their "ideal self." The theory of the ideal self stems from the work of psychologist Carl Rogers, who maintained that each person has an ideal self (who they want to be) and a self-image (who they think we really are). Rogers argues that people suffer from low-esteem when there is a substantial difference between their _ideal self_ and their _self-image_. Therefore, if you find yourself experiencing a lot of bravery regrets, the problem might be how you view yourself _right now_ instead of what you did or didn’t do in the past.)

##### Regret Category #4: Relationships

**People experience relationship regrets when they feel they've missed an opportunity for a meaningful connection with someone.** They compare the life they have without an important person—a friend, family member, or romantic partner—and imagine the life they could have had with this relationship.

Relationship regrets can be either regrets of things done or regrets of things not done. Some people lose relationships because of an action they took, such as starting a fight or pushing someone away out of anger. Others may lose relationships simply because they failed to invest as much as they wanted to and drifted apart over the years.

**Relationship regrets are the most common type of regret reported on Pink's survey.** Psychologists have identified quality relationships as the most important predictor of someone’s mental and emotional well-being. Therefore, people feel a great sense of loss at missing out on important relationships, leading them to experience regret.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found that people often feel regrets about relationships more intensely than regrets about domains like career or education. Psychologists attribute this not just to a need for connection but also to a fundamental need for _belonging_. Because humans are social by nature, anything that threatens our belonging within a group also threatens our sense of safety. Therefore, lost relationships may threaten our sense of well-being more than other missed opportunities in life.)

### Part 3: The Wrong Ways to Handle Regret

Now that we understand how regret works and the types of regret you'll most likely experience, we can turn to Pink's insights on the worst and best ways to handle regret. Handling regret the wrong way will prevent you from growing from your regrets and using them to improve your life. In this section, we'll cover his explanation of the three wrong approaches to regret: the philosophy of no regrets, avoiding, and wallowing.

#### Wrong Way #1: The Philosophy of “No Regrets”

**Pink explains that many people hold the view that they should live life without any regrets.** This philosophy appears in popular music, self-help books, commercials, and celebrity culture, just to name a few. Pink explains that this philosophy views regret simply as something to avoid because it is painful and because no one can change the past. Therefore, the reasoning goes, a life without regrets is well-lived.

However, Pink counters that this view is foolish and can even prevent people from living their best life. He makes two counterarguments which we will discuss in depth: 1) Regret is a universal part of life, and 2) it is highly beneficial to our lives.

(Shortform note: Those who espouse the philosophy of "no regrets'' may disagree with Pink's characterization. Some claim the philosophy is not about never growing from mistakes, but about doing what is most important in life while you have the chance so that you have fewer regrets at the end. However, Pink still makes the case that this philosophy encourages people to view regret negatively, overlooking its universal nature and benefits, which we will discuss next.)

##### 1) Regret Is Universal

**Pink argues that regret is a natural and universal part of human psychology.** People are hardwired for regret because, as we will see in the next section, regret benefits their survival. Psychologists have identified only two groups incapable of experiencing regret: small children whose brains are still developing, and people who have suffered acute brain damage. This suggests regret is a normal part of any healthy adult's brain. Furthermore, research demonstrates that regret is one of the most commonly experienced negative emotions.

(Shortform note: Research in neuroscience supports the notion that humans are "hardwired" for regret. Specifically, neuroscientists have found that regret and remorse are consistently processed in the _medial orbitofrontal cortex_ , a region of the brain in our foreheads just above the eyes. This supports the idea that the "hardware" for regret is simply part of our biology, and therefore regret is universal as Pink claims.)

##### 2) Regret Improves Decision-Making

Pink cites studies that have found that **regret helps people make better decisions**. When people are encouraged to look negatively at a past decision and then given a second chance at making it, they’ll take much more time and consider a wider range of options before making a decision. In other words, regret inspires people to _make decisions more carefully._

(Shortform note: While a little regret can lead you to be more careful and considerate in your choices, psychologists have found that an overwhelming amount of regret can lead to decision paralysis. Some people take feelings of regret to extreme conclusions about themselves, such as believing that they "always make the wrong decisions" and should therefore avoid deciding altogether. As we'll discuss later in this guide, getting the full benefits of regret requires processing them in a healthy and productive way.)

##### 3) Regret Improves Motivation

Pink explains that **regret also has the power to improve people’s motivation and persistence**. Studies have found that people encouraged to look negatively on their performance of a task would then invest _more time and effort_ in the task given a second chance. By experiencing regret, they felt inspired to persevere beyond their usual effort.

(Shortform note: To tap into the motivational power of regret, it's important to avoid letting your regret lead to rumination. Psychologists define rumination as repetitive or obsessive patterns of thought dwelling on perceived failings and mistakes. Self-critical rumination is associated with increased risks of depression, which is known to severely _undermine_ a person's motivation. Therefore, as you regret past actions, be mindful of repetitive or compulsive patterns of negative thinking.)

##### 4) Regret Leads to Fulfillment

Lastly, Pink explains that **regret has the power to help people live more meaningful and fulfilling lives**. When people understand the things they regret in life, it can clarify the things they want most.

Recall the four main categories of regret: stability, ethics, personal risk-taking, and relationships. Pink explains that these regrets provide an inverse reflection of the life we want. We want to build a strong foundation of personal stability, live according to our morals, take bold risks when pursuing our dreams, and form strong personal connections with others. By reflecting on your regrets, you’ll discover the true goals that will lead you to a more fulfilling life.

(Shortform note: In learning from your regrets, it's important to note that any decision will lead to positives and negatives and therefore provide the potential for regret. For example, someone who gets married may regret feeling tied down, while someone who stays single may regret their lack of connection. Therefore, consider the things you might regret if you had chosen otherwise. Do they outweigh the regrets you feel now or are they about equal?)

#### Wrong Way #2: Avoiding

**A lot of people will respond to their regret by simply trying to avoid feeling it.** Pink argues that this is what most people who hold a "no regrets" philosophy in life are actually doing. This approach may be tempting because it gives someone an excuse to not feel something painful.

However, this approach has two significant drawbacks. First, you can't avoid the feeling of regret forever. By avoiding your emotions, you’re simply storing the feelings of regret away to cause you pain later in life. Secondly, by avoiding regret, you’ll miss out on the important chance to learn and grow from it.

(Shortform note: A deeper understanding of avoidance can help you overcome this approach. Psychologists argue that avoidance can be destructive because in addition to putting off the experience of negative emotions, it also leads to _increased rates of anxiety and depression_. People often adopt avoidant coping mechanisms either because they have a low tolerance for uncomfortable emotions or because they haven't learned more productive coping mechanisms. Psychologists recommend that you practice allowing yourself to experience uncomfortable emotions or work on learning healthier coping mechanisms, such as those we'll explore later in this guide.)

#### Wrong Way #3: Wallowing

**Many people also respond to their regrets by simply wallowing in them.** Pink concedes that this response allows people to feel their regrets very deeply but also argues that it offers no solutions for growing from them and moving past them. He explains that wallowing comes from a philosophy that elevates emotion as the highest personal truth. According to this perspective, feeling emotions at their highest intensity has intrinsic value regardless of whether it helps someone grow.

However, Pink disagrees with this philosophy. He explains that wallowing in your emotions doesn't provide any benefit because you neither resolve your emotions nor learn from them—they simply continue to cause you pain.

(Shortform note: Psychologists explain that we are prone to obsessing about negative experiences because we are sensitive to contradictions or things we don't understand. For example, if you see yourself as a good person, you might feel confused by the apparent contradiction of acting against your ethics. In the short term, allowing yourself to feel painful emotions like sadness and regret can benefit your personal growth. However, it becomes a problem when you fall into a pattern of repetitive rumination. Research has demonstrated that instead of helping you move on, this will simply deepen the painful emotions over time.)

### Part 4: How to Turn Regret to Your Advantage

As we’ve seen,**Pink argues that regret has the power to benefit our lives,_but only if we know how to use it._** In this section, we'll cover Pink's strategies for processing and growing from regret, and how to improve decision-making by anticipating future regrets.

#### Processing and Growing from Regret

**Pink identifies _processing_ as the best approach for dealing with regret. **Broadly speaking, processing includes thinking and reflecting on your past decisions, analyzing the source of your regret, and making new decisions to guide your future actions. Pink considers this a proactive approach that leads directly to action. Once you process and understand your regrets, they can lead you toward a better life.

Pink identifies five steps to help you process and grow from your regret: reveal the regret; forgive yourself; find something positive; find a lesson; commit to action.

##### Step #1: Reveal the Regret

**Pink explains that before you can begin processing regret, you’ll need to reveal it, either to yourself or others.** People often carry regret around as a personal secret, which can make it much more difficult to process.

Pink cites research that demonstrates the benefits of talking about your regrets. He states that people find talking about themselves intrinsically rewarding. He also explains that talking through negative experiences helps people organize their thoughts and integrate their experiences into a larger positive narrative of their lives. Telling someone else about regrets can also relieve feelings of shame or guilt.

You can reveal your regret by talking about it with a close friend, family member, or therapist. If that sounds too intimidating, you can even start by simply writing about your regrets in a journal.

(Shortform note: Psychologists shed light on why secrecy makes it so much harder to process regret. People tend to _ruminate_ on their secrets, an unhealthy process similar to the "wallowing" approach Pink identifies earlier. Secrets are also felt as a physical burden—those who carry them feel as though their physical energy is drained away. Lastly, secrets prevent people from forming strong connections with others. Those who carry secrets in relationships feel less authentic in their relationships and therefore less connected.)

##### Step #2: Forgive Yourself

**Pink advises that as you reveal and process your regrets, it's essential to treat yourself with forgiveness.** Self-forgiveness is simply being kind to yourself—viewing your mistakes with empathy and understanding rather than judgment—as you look at moments of your life that you're not very proud of. Self-forgiveness has the power to normalize negative experiences so that they feel less overwhelming and painful. People often blow unforgiven transgressions out of proportion because they _feel overwhelming_. By treating yourself with empathy, your mistakes will appear normal and manageable.

Pink stresses that _self-forgiveness_ differs from _self-esteem_. Self-esteem, he reasons, simply means having a positive opinion of yourself. Pink argues that many people maintain positive self-esteem by focusing on the best parts of themselves while trivializing or ignoring the negative parts of themselves. This can result in avoidance rather than processing. Self-forgiveness, instead, requires you to focus on the traits and habits that you don't view highly. You just need to go about it in a kind and empathetic way.

(Shortform note: Many people might find self-forgiveness counterintuitive or feel that it doesn't come naturally. Psychologists argue that treating yourself with compassion and empathy is a skill you must develop through practice. This practice begins with self-observation. Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings as you go about your day. Then work on responding to your inner self the way you would respond to a close friend.)

##### Step #3: Find Something Positive

**Pink recommends that regret can be easier to process if you can find something positive that happened as a result of your past decision, or at least a way that things could have gone worse.** Recall that the process of regret requires comparing your current life with an imaginary narrative of how things could have gone. Finding something positive requires you to imagine ways your life could have gone worse without this decision.

For example, a relationship might not have been right for you, but you grew a lot and came to a better understanding of your needs because of it. Or a job might not have given you the skills to advance in your career, but you made some great new friends with your coworkers. Had you not had this relationship or this job, you would have missed out on positive things as well as negative ones.

> **How to Find the Positive**
> 
> If you're someone who struggles to see the positive in situations, psychologists recommend these three tips.
> 
>   * Acknowledge your ability to be positive. This seems simple, but if negativity is your default, it can be easy to forget that you even have a choice.
> 
>   * Practice awareness of your negativity and positivity. Try stopping yourself throughout the day and asking whether your outlook is negative or positive. This self-observation will give you more control over your responses.
> 
>   * Practice gratitude. Make a habit of acknowledging and appreciating what's going right in your life.
> 
> 


##### Step #4: Find the Lesson

**To grow from your regret, Pink explains that you need to find the lesson.** Recall that**** regret has the power to teach us our priorities in life. However, this lesson usually isn't immediately obvious. You need to analyze your regret and think through what it has to teach you. Ask yourself what you would do differently if granted a chance to make a decision like this again. Then you can ask yourself what you want to do now or what decisions you would like to make in the future.

Pink recommends that you try to view the situation from an outside perspective. Imagine that a friend came to you with this regret. What advice would you give someone else in your position? How would you guide someone else through your exact situation? This often yields the best approach for you to take.

(Shortform note: Motivational experts extend Pink's advice for learning from your mistakes. First, they emphasize the importance of first reframing your mistake as an opportunity to learn. This will motivate you to find the lesson and do better next time. Second, they recommend four questions to help you analyze the situation thoroughly: 1) "What was I trying to do?" 2) “What went wrong?” 3) “When did it go wrong?” and 4) “Why did it go wrong?”)

##### Step #5: Commit to Action

**Pink explains that the last part of growing from your regret is committing to action.** To get the most out of your regret, you must use it to proactively improve your life. Pink explains that there are two approaches to acting in response to regret: 1) trying to reverse the regret and 2) consciously re-shaping your decisions in the future.

**Reversing the regret** is the process of trying to remedy the detrimental effects of a past decision. This could include apologizing to someone you've wronged and making amends. Furthermore, if there's something you wish you had started doing earlier in life, like exercising or learning a musical instrument, you can simply start doing those things now.

But some things can't be reversed. Sometimes the window of opportunity has closed and you really can't change a situation. For example, you can't apologize to someone once they've passed away. However, **you can still learn from your regret and use those lessons to guide future actions.** For example, if you regret how you treated someone who has passed, consider your current relationships. Where are the opportunities to deepen your relationships and treat people ethically? Are there people in a similar situation whose lives you could improve? Regret can still play an important role in helping you find a new path in life.

> **Tips for Committing to Action**
> 
> Committing to an action will only complete your process of growing from regret if you follow through with your decision. Motivational experts recommend three tips for keeping yourself accountable and following through with a decision.
> 
>   * **Find an accountability partner.** Inform someone of your intentions and ask them to follow up with you to make sure you've completed your goal. For example, if you want to undo a regret by reaching out to an old friend, tell your intentions to another friend or family member.
> 
>   * **Make your intentions public.** Letting your broader social circle know about your plans will add peer pressure to encourage you to follow through. If you plan on setting new goals or developing new habits, consider posting about it on social media or sharing it with your social circle.
> 
>   * **Change your environment.** If you're trying something new, a change of scenery can reinforce your intention and help you follow through. If you regret never taking on a personal project like writing a novel, try finding a new work space like a cafe or library to focus on this goal.

#### Forecasting Regret to Make Better Decisions

**Lastly, Pink recommends that you can use your regret to help you make better decisions by _forecasting future regrets_. **When you are facing a difficult decision in life, try to imagine your life years down the road and ask yourself: “Which choice would I regret more?” This can clarify what is most important in your life and help you make better decisions.

However, this advice comes with a catch. People often incorrectly forecast how much they will regret a choice. They tend to overestimate how much they will regret small things in life, like overpaying for an appliance. Many poor decisions are quickly forgotten because life simply goes on.

Therefore, Pink recommends that **you use this tactic only for life decisions involving the four main categories of regret.** Recall that these are: stability, ethics, personal risk-taking, and relationships. If you are facing a decision that will directly impact these areas of your life, Pink recommends you try to forecast which will cause the greatest regret. Otherwise, there’s no need. You're unlikely to regret a wrong decision on the smaller things in life.

(Shortform note: In Stumbling on Happiness, Daniel Gilbert cautions that making decisions out of forecasted regret often leads people to play it safe and make lower-risk decisions. They reason that the large costs of a personal risk will lead to regret, and so they make low-risk decisions to avoid it. However, recall that bravery is one of Pink's categories of regret. People are actually more likely to regret playing it safe than taking personal risks even though they often anticipate the opposite to be true. So if we aren't careful in applying Pink’s categories, the practice of forecasting regret could lead us to make decisions that we will actually wind up regretting more.)
