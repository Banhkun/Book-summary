## Exercise: Forecast Regret to Inform Your Decision Making

In this exercise, you will have a chance to forecast future regrets to help you make a decision.

* * *

Write down a decision for your future that youâ€™re currently considering. What are the different options you are weighing?

Now ask yourself if this decision relates to one of the four main categories of regret (stability, ethics, personal risk-taking, or relationships)? If so, write down which one and explain how it relates. If not, explain why you feel this decision is important to you nonetheless.

Now consider your options. Write down which one you expect to regret more and explain why.
