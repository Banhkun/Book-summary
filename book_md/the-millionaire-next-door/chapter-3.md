## Chapter 3: Use Time and Money Efficiently

**To build wealth, you must use time and money efficiently**. Prodigious accumulators and under-accumulators take vastly different approaches.

  * Prodigious accumulators spend significantly more time budgeting expenses and planning investments, which enable them to accumulate wealth. As a result, they don’t spend time worrying about a precarious financial future.
  * In contrast, high-income under-accumulators of wealth focus on maintaining their present high-consumption lifestyle. They don’t control or budget expenses, and they don’t spend nearly as much time as prodigious accumulators in planning investments. As a result, under-accumulators worry about not being able to live comfortably in retirement.



### Investment Planning

Smart planning is essential to wealth accumulation. **Wealthy people spend a significant amount of time—8.4 hours a month or 1.2% of their time—planning their financial future.** They do regular planning each month and prioritize managing their financial assets over other activities.

High-income under-accumulators—many busy doctors are a prime example—feel they don’t have adequate time to plan their financial future. Compared to millionaires, they spend half as much time—4.6 hours a month—on financial planning.

Of course, simply increasing the amount of time you spend planning doesn’t automatically translate into building wealth. You need to focus on the right kind of investments, educate yourself, get quality financial advice, and follow that advice.

Prodigious accumulators and under-accumulators have different ideas on investments. One reason UAWs spend less time on financial planning is that they consider assets that are easily convertible to cash to be investments—for instance, saving accounts, money market funds, and short-term Treasury bills. In fact, under-accumulators are two times more likely than prodigious accumulators to keep at least 20% of their wealth in cash or near-cash, which they can easily access and spend. These types of assets take less time to plan than those pursued by PAWs. High-income under-accumulators also have more of their wealth tied up in vehicles and other assets that depreciate.

Millionaires are more likely to invest in assets that appreciate in value without producing taxable income, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. Also, they have more of their wealth invested in businesses, real estate, stocks, and other tax-deferred assets.

#### Investing in Stocks

**Fully 95% of millionaires own stocks. Most keep 20% or more of their wealth in publicly traded stocks.**

However**, very few millionaires—less than one in 10—are active traders**. Most don’t closely track the daily ups and downs of the markets or trade stocks in response to current events—32% keep their investments for more than six years; only 9% hold them for less than a year.

It’s expensive and time-consuming to trade constantly. Active traders or brokers often spend more time trading than thinking about and planning investments. They don’t accumulate much wealth because they don’t give investments enough time to grow. Further, any short-term gains are taxed.

In contrast, millionaires spend more time managing a small number of stocks. **They’re focused investors, often investing in industries they’re knowledgeable about**. Millionaires prefer to deal with brokers who study the markets and don’t act precipitously.

#### Financial Advisors

To more efficiently plan their investments, many millionaires consult competent financial advisors. But before hiring anyone, they do their homework.

They research and interview potential advisors and seek referrals from other professionals they trust—for instance, their accountants and attorneys, as well as other business associates. They request references, a credit check, and documents showing training and experience.

Cold-callers who target high-income people aren’t good prospects and are unlikely to help anyone accumulate wealth. One wealthy man who was interviewed for this book got rid of cold-callers by asking for their personal income and wealth appreciation data so he could evaluate them. None ever called back.

In contrast, under-accumulators who invest in stock often do so on the advice of multiple advisors, including cold-callers touting a stock of the week. They often get poor advice because they don’t take the time to find quality financial advisors.

### Self-Employment and Investing

More than half of millionaires (59%) are self-employed, compared to 25% of high-income under-accumulators. Self-employed PAWs typically spend more time planning investments than do those employed by others.

A self-employed PAW’s goal is to become financially independent, and so they devote more of their work time to planning investments to build wealth. They also tend to be self-reliant—they have to be resourceful to manage a business through economic ups and downs. They counter the effects of down cycles with financial planning and investment.

Under-accumulators who are employees are dependent on their employers and less inclined to focus on planning their futures.

### Controlling Household Spending

As previously noted, **controlling your household spending and lifestyle is critical to having enough money and time to invest wisely**. In prodigious accumulator households, all members follow a frugal lifestyle and budget.

Under-accumulators not only fail to control their own spending—they don’t control spending by other members of their household either. The adults also spend independently of each other, so that neither knows the total being spent.

Further, high-income UAWs’ children tend to emulate them. The children become addicted to overspending, and to maintain their lifestyle in adulthood, their parents often continue to support them. The adult children are unlikely to become self-sufficient because they’ve never learned to live within their means. In addition, supporting adult children makes it even more difficult for under-accumulator parents to build wealth for their own future.

Sometimes, high-income under-accumulators turn to CPAs or other professional planners to help them save money to invest. Their CPAs put them on a budget, but like people who suddenly go on a diet, their willpower soon fails and they resume their high-consumption lifestyle.

### Concerns About the Future

**Because they don’t prioritize planning or investing, under-accumulators worry more about the future than prodigious accumulators**. The latter have fewer concerns and fears because they focus on planning and acting in the present to build the future they want.

Both prodigious accumulators and high-income under-accumulators are concerned about what the federal government might do, but they respond differently.

  * **High-income under-accumulators, who are trying to sustain an expensive lifestyle, worry about paying increasingly high federal income taxes**. Higher taxes leave less money for spending. But prodigious accumulators address the potential for tax increases by minimizing taxable income and maximizing non-taxable assets, primarily stocks. They pay more attention to what they pay in income tax as a percentage of their total wealth than as a percentage of income.
  * **Under-accumulators worry about inflation or a decline in purchasing power because they’re constantly trading up to more expensive homes and cars**. Prodigious accumulators are less worried because inflation will increase the value of some of their investments.
  * Both PAWs and UAWs are concerned about increased government regulation of business and industry. However, prodigious accumulators who are self-employed don't need to worry as much because they have greater control in responding to government actions.



In a nutshell, millionaires view money as a resource that shouldn’t be wasted. **Because they devote time to budgeting, controlling spending, and investing for the future, they have fewer worries and look forward to a comfortable retirement**.
