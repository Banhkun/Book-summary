## Introduction

Most Americans don’t understand wealth.

  * They don’t know how to define it.
  * They don’t understand what it takes to become wealthy. 
  * They have a misleading image of millionaires and how they live.



In _The Millionaire Next Door_ , authors Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko counter the myths and sketch a surprising portrait of the average millionaire that could resemble someone living in your neighborhood. They assert that **many more Americans could become millionaires by adopting habits and characteristics common among millionaires.**

For decades, the authors studied and profiled America’s millionaires—the 3% of the population with a net worth of more than $1 million, who account for more than half the country’s personal wealth. Although this book was first published in 1996, the principles the authors identify for how to accumulate wealth and ultimately achieve financial independence are applicable today.

The popular image of a wealthy person in the U.S. is someone in a high-income occupation, or someone who benefited from an inheritance or windfall—for instance, an athlete with a multimillion-dollar contract. He displays all the status symbols of wealth, including a big house, expensive vehicles, expensive clothing, and private schools for his children. But that image is of a big spender rather than someone building wealth.

### What Is Wealth?

Wealth and income aren’t the same thing. **Your income is what you earn; your wealth is what you accumulate**. If you make a lot of money and spend it all, you’re not wealthy—you’re living a high-consumption lifestyle.

When it comes to wealth, appearances can be deceiving. **High-income people can work hard, yet live paycheck to paycheck, not accumulating any wealth—and hard-working people with lower incomes can accumulate great wealth**.

Many higher-income people wonder why they aren’t rich—they feel they can barely keep up with expenses. Many lower-income people feel the same way. Neither type of household could survive more than a few months without a paycheck. Both believe that financial independence is out of reach; it seems to be a matter of luck or inheritance.

But**if you start young and embrace the right habits, you have a better chance of accumulating enough wealth to become a millionaire than you do of winning the lottery**. You have a 1 in 4,000 probability of becoming wealthy in your lifetime due to a windfall. But the proportion of households with a net worth of over $1 million is 3.5 in 100.

### Characteristics of the Wealthy

**The millionaires in this book could maintain their lifestyles for years without a paycheck—they’re financially independent**. But they didn’t inherit their wealth from their families. More than 80% of them accumulated it over their own lifetime.

The typical millionaires in this book defy stereotypes of the wealthy. They’re self-made businesspeople who have lived in the same town most of their adult lives. They own a business, are married, and live in a modest neighborhood. **The key to their success is they live a lifestyle that makes it possible for them to build wealth**.

The authors’ research found that **average millionaires share these common characteristics** :

  * They spend far less than they earn (live below their means).
  * They use their time and money efficiently to build wealth.
  * They prioritize attaining financial independence over displaying social status.
  * Their parents didn’t provide them with financial support as adults.
  * Their adult children are self-supporting.
  * They’re skilled at identifying investment opportunities.
  * They chose the right line of work.



These findings stem from years of research, including interviews with over 500 millionaires and surveys of 11,000 high-net-worth or high-income people in the 1990s. **The bottom line is that building wealth and becoming financially independent take hard work and discipline**.

**Many more Americans can become millionaires if they’re willing to consume less, control their spending, and focus on steadily building their wealth.** The trade-off for spending less of your income today is financial independence tomorrow.
