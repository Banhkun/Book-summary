## Exercise: What’s Your Net Worth?

Your expected net worth is what you should be worth, given your income and age. It gives you an idea of whether you’re a spender or an accumulator of wealth. Calculate your expected net worth as follows:

  * Multiply your age by your realized (taxable) annual income
  * Divide by 10



* * *

Calculate your expected net worth. Does the result surprise you, or is it about what you expected? How does it compare to where you are now?

What factors (for instance, your lifestyle) contributed to your current level of accumulated wealth, and how?

What habits/traits would you have to change to accumulate or significantly increase your expected level of wealth?
