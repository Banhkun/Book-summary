## Chapter 1: Who Is the Millionaire Next Door?

High-income people who spend freely and ostentatiously fit the Texas description, “big hat, no cattle.” In other words, they put on a show, but lack substance—they have very little accumulated wealth.

In contrast, **those who are truly wealthy typically don’t flaunt it** —for instance, they don’t wear expensive clothing or jewelry, or drive luxury or even late-model cars. They aren’t interested in status symbols.

The authors’ research paints the following picture of the average millionaire:

  * They didn’t inherit their wealth: 80% accumulated their wealth in their lifetime.
  * **Many are self-employed**. They’re entrepreneurs or professionals in non-flashy fields—for instance, they may be welding or paving contractors, factory owners, accountants, or auctioneers.
  * **They live below their means**. For instance, they live in modest-looking, rather than showy, homes. They wear non-brand name clothing and accessories, and often drive used cars.
  * **They’re extremely frugal and budget their expenses.** Their total annual realized (taxable) income is less than 7% of their wealth, meaning they spend less than 7% of their wealth a year.
  * On average,**they invest 20% of their realized household income a year**. They pay for expert financial and legal advice, but also study the markets and make their own investment decisions.
  * They’ve accumulated enough to live without working for at least 10 years.



### Definition of Wealthy

Most people would say someone with a lot of expensive material possessions is wealthy. But **most people living high-consumption lifestyles have little accumulated wealth; they spend all they earn**. Instead of acquiring material possessions, especially status symbols, the truly wealthy focus on building financial assets that appreciate or increase in value.

Net worth—the current value of your assets minus liabilities—is one way of defining wealth.

In this book, being wealthy is defined in two ways: 1) having a net worth of at least $1 million, and 2) having a high net worth for someone of your age and income.

(Shortform note: at the time this book was published, 3.5% of U.S. households had a net worth of at least $1 million. In 2018, the figure was 3%, or 11.8 million U.S. households.) About 95% of millionaires have a net worth of $1 million to $10 million. They are the focus of this book because their level of wealth is attainable by many Americans.

### Are You As Wealthy As You Should Be?

**A way to assess your own wealth is by calculating what your net worth _should be_ based on your income and age**.

The greater your income, the greater your net worth should be. Also, the older you are—that is, the longer you’ve been earning income—the greater your net worth should be. For people your age who earn what you earn, there’s an expected level of net worth. If your net worth is significantly below that level, you're probably living a consumption-oriented lifestyle; if your net worth is significantly above the level for your age/income category, then you’re wealthy.

We’ll explain how to calculate that in a moment. First, consider two examples—the first is a lower-income household that’s wealthy because they spend less, and the second is a high-income household with a less-than-expected net worth because they spend much of their income:

1) A 41-year-old firefighter and his wife, a secretary, make $55,000 a year. They spend modestly, save, and invest, resulting in a net worth of $460,000. The expected net worth for this age/income group is $255,000—so for their category, this couple is wealthy.

2) A 56-year-old doctor makes $560,000 a year. His net worth is $1.1 million, but it should be more than $3 million. He lives a consumption-oriented lifestyle and isn’t wealthy for his category.

#### Calculate Your _Expected_ Net Worth

Here’s how to calculate how much you should be worth:

  * Multiply your age by your realized (taxable) annual income
  * Divide by 10
  * Subtract any inherited wealth
  * The result is your expected net worth, or what you should be worth, given your income and age.



For example, for a 61-year-old with an annual income of $235,000, her net worth should be $1,433,500 ($235,000 X 61 divided by 10).

Similarly, for a 41-year-old with an earned income of $143,000 plus $12,000 investment income, his net worth should be $635,500 ($155,000 X 41 divided by 10).

  * If you’re in the top quartile (25%) for wealth accumulation in your category, you’re a PAW or “prodigious accumulator of wealth.”
  * If you are in the bottom quartile (25%), consider yourself a UAW, or “under-accumulator of wealth.”



To be solidly in the PAW category, you should be worth two times your expected level of wealth. Often, PAWs have four times the wealth of UAWs in their category. If you’re at half or less than the expected level for your category, you’re an under-accumulator. Here’s an example of each (both people are in the same income/age category):

  * Prodigious accumulator: Richards, 50, owns a mobile home dealership and his income is $90,200. His net worth should be $451,000, but it’s actually $1.1 million. He lives a modest, blue-collar lifestyle.
  * Under-accumulator: Davidson, 51, is an attorney with an income of $92,330. His expected net worth is $470,000, but it’s actually $226,511. He lives above his means, spending significantly more than Richards to maintain the lifestyle/status associated with attorneys. 



### The Role of Inheritance/Ancestry

People often think it takes inheriting wealth to become rich. However, the authors’ research on millionaires shows inheritance plays a minimal role:

  * Fewer than half received any inheritance; under 20% inherited 10% or more of their wealth.
  * Just 19% receive income or wealth from a trust or estate.
  * Under 10% expect an inheritance in the future.
  * Under 25% received a gift of $10,000 or more from a relative.
  * Only half received college tuition from their parents.
  * Fewer than 10% received part ownership of a family business.



People of average backgrounds who become millionaires have confidence in their own ability to achieve wealth. **There is opportunity in the U.S. for anyone wanting to become wealthy because social and economic status aren’t predestined.** This dates as far back as 1892, when a study of more than 4,000 U.S. millionaires found that 84% had achieved their wealth rather than inheriting it.

**Achievement matters more than inheritance or ethnic origin**. Many first-generation Americans become wealthy through hard work, frugality, and discipline—the same traits shared by millionaires as a whole.

Also like millionaires as a whole, first-generation Americans tend to be self-employed. However, their children and grandchildren tend to be less successful economically and often consume the family fortune entirely.

This is because their parents want them to have a better life, so they encourage them to spend years in college to become professionals with a higher status, rather than entrepreneurs. They enter the labor market late and start earning later. They reject their parents’ austere lifestyle in favor of American-style consumerism. Thus the second- and third-generation Americans with wealthy parents typically become UAWs.

So while some people work, plan, and invest to become wealthy, many of those who inherited affluence spend it away.
