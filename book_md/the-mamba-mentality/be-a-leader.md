## Be a Leader

As you work toward your goal, your hard work and commitment will make you stand out among peers and colleagues. Embrace that position, and use the opportunity to set an example and be a leader to those around you.

Kobe spent much of his career as his team’s leader, and that role came with many responsibilities. **Kobe demanded a lot from his teammates, but he was also willing to carry the team on his back in order to win.** At times, that meant scoring dozens of points a game, enduring physical pain, and pushing through mental and emotional exhaustion. He knew that his effort set the tone for the team.

As the team leader, Kobe also had to match up against opposing teams’ best players, like Kevin Garnett. Garnett was a strong defender with long arms, impressive athleticism, versatility, and a big voice for effective communication on the court. Kobe made a point to play hard against Garnett, in order to show Garnett’s teammates—and his own—that he wasn’t intimidated.

### Inspire and Impact Others

Kobe’s unrelenting drive to be the best had a major impact on the people around him. His teammates and coaches witnessed firsthand the traits and habits that characterized the Mamba Mentality, which included:

  * Single-minded focus on winning
  * Incredible attention to detail
  * Unwavering dedication to preparation
  * Determination to be the best, and the willingness to work hard to achieve that goal
  * Insistence on challenging those around him—including players and coaches—to also be their best, even at practice



These stood out immediately to Phil Jackson, who coached Kobe from 1999-2004 and 2005-2011. When Jackson became the Lakers coach, then-20-year-old Kobe exclaimed that he was a student of the game, and that he knew about Jackson’s triangle offense and was excited to try it. The triangle offense system requires players to be disciplined because they have to maintain specific positions and spacing on the court—including three players forming a triangle on one side of the key.

The triangle offense system allows little room for players to go off-script, and, despite Kobe’s enthusiasm, he initially felt limited by its strict parameters. Jackson quickly recognized Kobe’s talent, but he worried that the young star was such a playmaker that he would put his own glory above the team’s best interest. However, **Jackson worked with Kobe and taught him that team playing and collective discipline were the only way they could win the championship.** From then on, Kobe put the team’s success ahead of his love of scoring.

With Kobe and veteran Shaquille O’Neal, the Lakers went on to compete in the Finals in four out of five years. After Shaq and the rest of the starting players left the team, Kobe became the team leader. From rookie to MVP, Kobe kept up his grueling schedule of workouts, practice, and film sessions.**Although his teammates couldn’t match Kobe’s dedication, they all became better by striving to follow his example.**
