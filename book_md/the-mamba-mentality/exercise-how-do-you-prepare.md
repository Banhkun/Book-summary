## Exercise: How Do You Prepare?

Consider how well your day-to-day habits are priming you to perform in the moments that matter.

* * *

Describe one mid- to long-term goal you’re currently working toward. For example, you may be striving for a promotion or trying to learn a new skill.

How—and how often—do you practice and improve in order to reach your goal?

What would be considered fundamental skills in this context (comparable to footwork in basketball), and how could you do more to refine your fundamentals?

What is a more advanced skill that you need to reach your goal, and how could you improve it?
