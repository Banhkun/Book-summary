## Learn Constantly

The Mamba Mentality is about the effort to reach success, not the moment you reach the finish line. Throughout his 20-year career, despite his mastery of the game, Kobe never ceased learning and striving to improve. In 2003, he felt that he had reached his pinnacle and had become unstoppable—but he didn’t view that moment as the beginning of his decline. Instead, **Kobe was driven to continue working and refining his game because he consistently looked ahead toward future goals, instead of looking back and admiring what he’d already achieved.**

### Learn From the People Around You

When Kobe joined the Lakers, he knew he was becoming part of an organization with an impressive legacy, where many of basketball’s greatest players had shone, including James Worthy, Elgin Baylor, and Byron Scott. Kobe worked hard to honor and continue that legacy. Although he was only 17 when he joined the team, the Lakers staff, players, and alumni quickly recognized Kobe’s drive and embraced him as a member of the Lakers family.

Once Kobe joined the league, his support team included people who were as obsessive and passionate about their crafts as he was about his. These people included:

  * His coach, Phil Jackson. **Jackson took a big-picture approach to coaching, emphasizing the importance of teamwork and encouraging players to harness their focus and energy to improve their game.** Jackson’s calm focus complemented Kobe’s fire. Initially, their differences caused them to misunderstand each other and butt heads, but, over time, they got on the same page and balanced each other. 
  * His assistant coach, Tex Winter. Whereas Jackson focused on the big picture, Winter homed in on details. **During Winter and Kobe’s first year together, they re-watched every game together to examine the details.**
  * His teammate and coach, Byron Scott. Scott played for the Lakers during Kobe’s rookie year, and Kobe often picked Scott’s brain for technical advice and tidbits on retired greats, such as Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. When Scott returned to the Lakers as a coach during Kobe’s final years, their relationship picked right back up. As a coach, Scott had a gift for giving players the tools to excel. 
  * His physical therapist, Judy Seto. Seto was still early in her career when Kobe joined the team, so they grew and matured together throughout his career. Seto became so indispensable to Kobe that she even traveled with him on work trips and family vacations. 
  * His trainer, Gary Vitti. Vitti was a master and a perfectionist when it came to taping up Kobe’s ankles and finger. Seeing Vitti’s dedication, Kobe could trust that he was in good hands and keep his focus on training and playing. 



As a professional—and a top player in the league—Kobe also had access to retired basketball stars, whose careers and techniques he admired. **Kobe valued the opportunities to build relationships with these players, whom he could learn from and look up to.** Kobe asked endless questions, and most players appreciated his attention and genuine interest. When Kobe encountered people who became annoyed with his questions, he shook it off—he’d rather be informed and potentially embarrassed than miss a chance to learn.

Among Kobe’s friends, teachers, and mentors were:

  * Jerry West, who had been a player, coach, and general manager. West answered Kobe’s relentless questions honestly and bluntly, which Kobe learned was a sign that West genuinely cared about him. 
  * Magic Johnson, a former Laker and an all-time great. Kobe admired Johnson for his contributions to the game, and **Kobe appreciated that Johnson—and other former players—had already faced the challenges and learned the lessons that were still ahead of him.** He tried to learn from the knowledge and experience of Johnson and others. Specifically, Kobe learned from Johnson how to throw a cross-court bounce pass. 
  * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, a former Laker who had been friendly with Kobe’s father, Joe Bryant, when Joe was on the San Diego Clippers. Kobe had done a book report about Abdul-Jabbar in school, and, as Kobe got older, he continued following and learning about Abdul-Jabbar. When Abdul-Jabbar joined the Lakers staff, Kobe jumped at the chance to form a relationship and ask plenty of questions. 
  * Muhammad Ali, whose hard work and dedication in boxing inspired Kobe on the court. **Although they competed in different sports, Kobe picked up two important lessons from Ali** : First, the fame and glory that comes with accomplishment requires a huge amount of hard work and focus behind the scenes. Second, find a way to use your opponent’s strength against him. 
  * Bill Russell, a former NBA player and coach. Kobe read Russell’s autobiography and was struck by the advice that, in order for a team to win a championship, each player needs to have the freedom and focus to do what he does best. The message made an impression on Kobe, and he immediately reached out to Bill and forged a relationship.



#### Learn in Unexpected Ways

Kobe learned from everyone, including referees. He read the referee’s handbook and learned that each ref is supposed to be in a particular position on the court. With this knowledge,**Kobe figured out where the refs’ blind spots were, and he was able to hold, travel, and make other small violations without getting caught.**

Additionally, Kobe maintained friendly relationships with the referees. He appreciated the difficulty of their work: They had to think and act quickly, deal with high emotions, try to remain objective, and take the blame for bad calls. Kobe also hoped that his rapport with the refs would make them more open to his view when he challenged their calls.

### Study Yourself and Your Opponents

In order to become great, honestly assess your strengths and weaknesses, and learn from your competitor’s strengths and weaknesses. Kobe’s film sessions were just as critical as his gym workouts. He watched tape of himself and also studied players across the league to learn their strengths and shortcomings, so that he knew exactly how to play against them. He was never intimidated by facing talented opponents—he merely adjusted his game accordingly. He explained his strategies for many of the NBA’s top players, past and present, including:

  * Allen Iverson, who was such a skillful player that his primary weakness was his short stature. Kobe looked for ways to use his height advantage to shoot over Iverson. Kobe also learned that Iverson had a pattern of attack: He generally hung back during the first few minutes of a game, then he became more aggressive. **Kobe tried to disrupt Iverson’s routine by letting him get the ball when he wasn’t expecting it, which lulled Iverson into a false confidence** that made him more likely to create an opening that Kobe and his teammates could exploit. 
  * Dikembe Mutombo and Hakeem Olajuwon, who used their left hands to pull down opponents who were dunking the ball. The tactic was so subtle that the referees wouldn’t notice. Once Kobe realized this, he started putting his left arm up in order to create space between them and also to imply that he was willing to be as physical as Mutombo. 
  * Tim Duncan, who was a strategic defender and a major reason that the Spurs swept the Lakers in the 1999 playoffs. Kobe eventually realized that Duncan and his teammates never pushed in to make contact when an opposing player drove to the basket—instead, they backed off. Shooters generally expected contact from their opponents—and they welcomed the opportunity to draw a foul—so when the Spurs left that space open, it threw the shooter off-balance. Once Kobe caught onto this technique, he simply used that space as a runway for his shot. 
  * Cuttino “Cat” Mobley, who relied on his speed and agile hands. Kobe learned to push his body against Mobley, which irritated him. **Kobe frustrated opponents as often as he could, in order to disrupt their focus.**
  * Tracy McGrady, who was such a well-rounded offensive player that he was the toughest matchup Kobe ever faced. Kobe found ways to frustrate McGrady by pushing into certain parts of his body (including his hips, legs, and back) that made McGrady uncomfortable. Kobe also knew that McGrady constantly tried to knock the ball out of opponents’ hands, so Kobe always kept the ball far from McGrady’s reach. 
  * Chris Paul, who was particularly skillful when moving to his right side. Accordingly, when Kobe guarded Paul, Kobe always used his left hand to block Paul from moving in that direction. 
  * LeBron James, who was not only taller but also bigger than Kobe. However, **Kobe enjoyed physicality—hitting other players as well as being hit—more than James, so Kobe used his physical aggression to his advantage.**
  * Russell Westbrook, who wasn’t a strong shooter when he first got in the league but quickly improved. Although Westbrook was easy to block at first, once he became a skilled shooter, Kobe frustrated Westbrook with grabs and holds that were too subtle for the referees to notice. When the roles were reversed and Westbrook was on defense, Kobe knew that Westbrook’s competitiveness would make him try to block Kobe’s shots, so Kobe fooled him with pump fakes and either drew fouls or created openings to move around Westbrook. 
  * Shane Battier, who would block the view of the basket when guarding shooters. Kobe wasn’t fazed by this strategy, because **he had practiced so much that he could rely on muscle memory and experience to shoot without seeing the basket.**



Kobe also knew his teammates’ strengths, and he found ways to collaborate on the court. For example, when Shaq was on the Lakers, Kobe didn’t merely rely on Shaq’s size and skills—he found ways to help Shaq by misleading defenders. Kobe made opponents think that he was about to take a shot (he’d even bring his feet off the ground as if to shoot) so that the defender would put his arms up to block the shot. When the guard’s arms went up, it created an opening for Kobe to pass the ball to Shaq to score.

### Try New Things

As you strive to achieve your goal, you may find opportunities and lessons on the periphery of your craft. After the first decade of Kobe’s career, he’d competed in the NBA Finals in four out of five consecutive years, and he’d won three championship rings. Furthermore, he had scored a career-high 81 points in one game, the second-most of any player in NBA history. Kobe’s achievements earned him praise and recognition within the league, as well as opportunities outside of it.

#### Combine Your Old and New Knowledge to Innovate

When Kobe had the opportunity to design shoes with Nike, he was characteristically meticulous. **He wasn’t concerned with making a flashy design—his primary focus was to create a shoe that allowed him to perform at his best.** Kobe’s feet had to carry him up and down the basketball court every day, and he needed them to be comfortable, agile, and supported. The staff at Nike matched his passion, and they worked tirelessly to innovate and improve on the shoe design for each subsequent version.

A few years into the deal, in 2008, Kobe told Nike that he wanted to make a low-top sneaker. Kobe had been inspired by watching soccer players torque their ankles even more than basketball players, and doing it in low-cut sneakers. Kobe realized that basketball players’ belief that high-top shoes supported and protected their ankles was wrong—in reality, high-tops were actually weakening their ankles and decreasing their mobility.

Nike was initially resistant, but Kobe pushed. **He was convinced that it was time for a sea change in the sneaker world—he just needed to convince others.** Kobe even had to pitch his low-top Kobe IV shoe to Foot Locker, so that the retail giant would know how to sell the sneaker.

#### Adapt Your Habits to New Circumstances

In 2008, after Kobe had won three championships, he played in the Olympics alongside LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, and other basketball greats. **Although Kobe was the senior statesman on the team, playing with the best players in the NBA elevated his game.** Because Kobe knew that other players excelled at stealing, scoring, and other elements of the game, Kobe was free to focus on his greatest strength: defense.

Playing in the Olympics also gave Kobe the chance to play under Duke University coach Mike Krzyzewski. Coach K had met and formed a close bond with Kobe years earlier, when he’d tried to recruit him to play at Duke. During the Olympics, Kobe reveled in the opportunity to finally play under Coach K.

The biggest challenge of playing in the Olympics was the uncertainty. In the NBA, Kobe knew the practice, game, and travel routine. He was familiar with the buses, the training rooms, and the arenas for every game, and he could easily maintain his training and preparation routine. However, while traveling through Spain, China, Turkey, and the UK, Kobe didn’t know what to expect, so he had to adapt. Still, **Kobe trained and worked out as best he could, and he maintained his mental intensity.**
