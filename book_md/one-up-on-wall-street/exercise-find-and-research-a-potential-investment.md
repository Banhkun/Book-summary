## Exercise: Find and Research a Potential Investment

Practice using Lynch’s strategy for finding and researching potential investments.

* * *

Think back to the last few days: Did you encounter any companies whose product or service piqued your interest? Do any of these companies have one or more of Lynch’s preferred traits—does it have a mundane name or business, exist in a no-growth industry, or is it a spinoff of an existing company? You don’t have to do in-depth research for this exercise—simply jot down your thoughts about the company that seems most promising to you.

Now, reflect on what type of stock it is: a slow-growth, dependable, fast-growth, cycle, underdog, or hidden-treasure company. Again, you don’t have to investigate this in detail for this exercise, but simply use your existing knowledge and a few minutes of online research to place the stock as one of these types.

Next, do a quick online search for the company name and try to find answers to some of Lynch’s questions about the stock: Is the company buying back shares? Has the company recently diversified? Does the company have any special assets? Does it have a large inventory? Note any findings you make below.

Finally, write down a brief speech or paragraph detailing why the company is a good investment opportunity.
