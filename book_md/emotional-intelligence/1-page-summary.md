## 1-Page Summary

Many cultures, particularly Western ones, place a lot of emphasis on intelligence as a barometer of success. We’ve even developed tests to measure our intelligence, resulting in a score known as our intelligence quotient, or IQ. But data suggests that **IQ accounts for only about 20% of success in life, with the remaining 80% being made up by other factors, emotional intelligence included.** And much more research has been done on IQ than on emotions and emotional intelligence, despite the fact that emotions are hard-wired in the human brain and make us the species we are.

IQ is fixed: what we’re born with is what remains throughout our lives. But **emotional intelligence can be taught and learned—we have the ability to improve upon our emotional intelligence throughout our lives.** In this one-page summary, we cover a broad overview of what emotions are, what emotional intelligence is, and how we can use it in a couple different areas of life. The full summary goes into much more detail about each of these categories.

### Emotions

#### What Are They

Emotions are strong impulses that urge us to take immediate action. They’re based on fundamental needs (usually survival) and neurologically **designed to propel us into action without overthinking** : “Run from the tiger before considering options gets us killed!”

**There’s nothing wrong with feeling emotions** —the problems arise when the emotions are out of tune with the situation and when we don’t express our emotions productively or safely.

#### The Science Behind Them

The human brain was built from the bottom up:

  * The brainstem is responsible for all our basic necessary functions (breathing, eating, sleeping).
  * The limbic system built on the brainstem, and this system is responsible for our basic emotions. It also gave us the ability to learn things and remember them, which allowed us to adapt to new environments.
  * Then our neocortex formed on top of the limbic system, and this is our rational mind. This gives us the ability to choose how we respond to our emotions, reflect on our actions, and feel empathy for other people.



**We essentially have two minds: a thinking one and a feeling one.** Our feeling mind is associative, categorical, absolutist, and individual—and it reacts to information before our thinking mind even gets all the information and has an opportunity to weigh out the best action.

Our feeling mind is more fully-formed at birth, while our neocortex can learn, change, and adjust throughout our lives. This means our emotional reactions to things are formed before we have high-level thoughts to make sense of them. **We can’t change our emotional reactions to things, but we can learn how to respond to our emotions differently.**

_Emotional hijackings_ occur when our limbic system receives the information first and responds with an emergency alert. This sends our body into panic mode and makes it more difficult for our neocortex to control the actions we take based on our emotional impulses.

### Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence encompasses the following skills:

  * Knowing your emotions
  * Managing emotions
  * Motivating yourself
  * Recognizing emotions in others (empathy)
  * Handling relationships



#### Knowing Your Emotions

**Self-awareness is the ability to recognize a feeling as it’s happening to you.** Being able to monitor our feelings as they’re occurring helps us understand ourselves and our psychology. **The more certain we are about our feelings, the easier it is to make personal decisions.**

People who know their emotions are aware of their moods as they happen but can be mindful about how they deal with them. They’re more sure of their boundaries since they know how they’ll feel. They tend towards a positive outlook on life since they know they can manage whatever moods are thrown at them. They don’t dwell on bad moods and can get out of ruts faster. They can be mindful of their emotions and manage them successfully.

The goal is to be self-aware in relation to our emotions, but most people deal with their emotions in one of two unhealthy ways:

  * **Engulfed**. People who deal with emotions this way aren’t aware of what’s happening to them. Their moods shift often and overpower them. They do little to change their feelings, and feel out of control often.
  * **Accepting**. These people are more clear on what they’re feeling, but they also don’t feel like anything needs to change. They’re either in good moods, so they don’t have any motivation to change their moods, or they’re in bad moods but are resigned to feeling like there’s nothing they can do about it.



#### Managing Emotions

Once we’re aware of our emotional responses as we’re having them, we can start to regulate how they influence our actions.

There are three emotions that most people find hard to regulate: anger, anxiety, and sadness.

  * We get angry when we feel attacked. The worst thing you can do for anger is dwell on it. Instead, try challenging the assumptions that are making you angry, physically cooling off with exercise or distraction, using relaxation techniques, or writing down your angry thoughts to reflect on them.
  * Anxiety is a form of worrying, a kind of rehearsal of what could go wrong and potential ways we might deal with it. Relaxation techniques can help anxiety, and challenging the anxiety by asking realistic questions (like “Does it actually help to go through these thoughts over and over again?”).
  * Sadness is usually the mood people want to change the most, but they do it in ways that can worsen the sadness: isolating themselves, or dwelling on the sadness under the guise of analyzing it. Try challenging the sad thoughts to find a positive spin on them, scheduling pleasant distractions, or engineering small successes for yourself.



#### Motivating Yourself

We also need to be able to delay gratification and overcome our impulses to be more productive and effective—this is where motivation, the ability to push ourselves to do something, comes in. Being able to manage our emotions is the first step to motivating ourselves to finish tasks and achieve goals.

Motivation mostly has to do with what you _believe_ about your own abilities. People who are good self-motivators:

  * View themselves as resourceful and try different ways to accomplish their goals.
  * Tell themselves it will get better when times are tough.
  * Try different approaches towards reaching their goal or switch goals if one proves too difficult to achieve.
  * Break down large, scary tasks into smaller, more manageable goals.



#### Empathy

**Empathy is the fundamental people skill** , allowing us to interpret what others want or need. Empathy changes the way you look at the world: When other people are in pain, you work to understand their pain and help them through it. You also work not to cause people pain: This is where morals and morality begin. **Empathy makes you a better person.**

**Our most basic emotional life lessons are laid down in small, repeated life exchanges between us and our parents.** How our parents responded to our emotions is how we respond to others’, and it shapes our capacity for empathy and the emotional expectations we bring into our adult relationships. Treating children with empathy creates more empathetic adults in the future.

#### Relationships

When we recognize our own emotions, manage them, motivate ourselves to do better, and can empathize with others—a culmination of the previous skills—our personal relationships are bound to improve.

The ability to manage relationships breaks down into four distinct and separate abilities:

  * _Organizing groups_. An essential skill for leaders, this is the ability to initiate and coordinate the energy and efforts of a group of people.
  * _Negotiating solutions._ This skill involves avoiding or resolving conflicts.
  * _Personal connection_. Empathizing and connecting are the heart of this skill. 
  * _Social analysis_. This skill involves detecting and intuiting the emotions, motivations, and concerns of other people. 



### Using Emotional Intelligence

#### In Romantic Relationships

Relationship strife usually has to do with partners having differing expectations about how emotions will be handled. **Agreeing how to disagree or confront each other is the key to a successful relationship.**

Here are some things couples can do to improve their emotional intelligence in arguments:

  * **Stick to one topic.** Keep the argument focused on the specific incident.
  * **Use the XYZ formula.** X is the action, Y is how it made you feel, Z is what you’d prefer they did next time.
  * **Give each person a chance to explain their perspective at the forefront.**
  * **Show your partner you’re listening.** Most people in the throes of any emotional distress just want to be heard and understood.
  * **Learn how to soothe yourself first.** It’ll be easier to deal with your partner’s emotions.
  * **Challenge toxic thoughts.__** Intentionally remind yourself of all the good times or all the times your partner did what you want them to do more of. 
  * **Don’t get defensive.** What feels like an attack to you is really just your partner having strong feelings about this issue and wanting to improve it.
  * **Validate your partner.** Articulate to your partner that you can see things from their point of view and that their perspective is valid. 
  * **Take responsibility or apologize if you’re in the wrong**. A simple and honest apology can go a long way to smoothing over the worst disputes.
  * **Agree on a time-out.** Agree on a phrase or method of calling the time-out that both partners will recognize, and then actually use the cooling off time to cool off.



#### In Families

**Parents who are emotionally intelligent set better examples for their children.** If you want a better life for your kid, work on improving yours first.

Three common difficult situations parents have to deal with are: angry kids, depressed kids, and kids with eating disorders.

  * Angry kids are at risk of becoming bullies or social outcasts. They usually perceive threats where there are none (and they most likely learned it from you).
  * Depressed kids usually have trouble socializing and bouncing back from setbacks. 
  * Eating disorders stem from misinterpreting overwhelming emotions as signs of hunger, or misguidedly attempting to take control of emotions by controlling food intake.



**Parents who address emotions healthily:**

  * Take their kids' feelings seriously and try to understand them.
  * View emotional moments as opportunities to coach their kids through what to do.
  * Offer up positive ways to deal with emotional reactions.
  * Practice these three steps in relation to their own emotional moments as well.



#### At Work

**Issues at work usually arise from prejudice in the workplace or friction among employees who have to work together.**

Prejudices are any preconceived opinions that are not based on experience or fact, but we see this most commonly in discrimation against other races, genders, sexualities, or classes. Prejudices are passed down from our parents and taught to us emotionally before we understand the logic behind them. It’s nearly impossible to change your own prejudices or anyone else’s on a neurological level—but it is possible for a workplace to suppress the expression of prejudice for the sake of a healthier and better-functioning workplace.

Friction among employees usually stems from low group IQ, or low emotional intelligence. People with high emotional intelligence are better at working together.

To combat both of these situations, **managers must be good at both giving feedback and receiving it.** Here’s how:

  * Give feedback early, before the problem has gotten bigger. 
  * **Give praise first**. **Keep it specific.** **Offer solutions.** **Do it face to face, if possible, and be present.** **Use empathy.**



When receiving feedback, remember that **feedback is a tool to help you improve, and an opportunity for you to work with your manager to do your job better.**

#### In School

Family life doesn’t necessarily offer the same connections and instruction it once did, so schools have become the one place communities can depend on to educate their children and correct their behaviors.

**High anxiety and emotional distress take a devastating toll on student performance.** Emotionally distressed students have a harder time focusing, following through, controlling their behavior, and making friends.

**Schools and teachers can do a few things to help combat the low emotional literacy of students:**

  * Introduce emotional intelligence training early in and throughout education.
  * Integrate emotional intelligence education into already-existing curriculum and subjects (such as teaching good study habits, encouraging self-motivation in math, reading stories in English, and discussing empathy).
  * Adjust the protocol for disciplining students. Remember, children are learning all the time. Disciplinary incidents are an opportunity to teach children healthy emotional intelligence habits, not reinforce bad ones (like letting your emotions control you or ignoring how the other person feels).



#### In Health

**Emotions are deeply connected to sickness and health.** For the most emotionally healthy population, emotional interventions should be routine practice in any hospital or doctor’s office.

Three emotions have extremely detrimental effects on health: anger, anxiety, and depression.

  * Anger reduces your heart’s pumping efficiency. While it can’t cause heart problems, chronic anger has significant correlation to dying younger, and in patients with preexisting heart conditions, chronic anger can be fatal.
  * Anxiety suppresses your immune system, and can make you more vulnerable to infections and disease.
  * Depression negatively interferes with a patient’s ability to recover by affecting their energy or their will to take care of themselves. The symptoms of depression often overlap with the symptoms of other diseases, and many doctors miss depression in patients they’re already treating.



**Medical offices that would like to increase emotional intelligence should:**

  * Give patients reassurance and autonomy by offering more information on diagnoses so patients can make better decisions and programming that teaches patients how to ask effective questions of their doctor.
  * Address anxiety for presurgery patients through relaxation techniques.
  * Design and build recovery rooms that allow family to care for recovering patients.
  * Put programming in place to increase the emotional intelligence of all staff.
