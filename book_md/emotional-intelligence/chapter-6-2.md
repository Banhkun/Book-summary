## Chapter 6-2: Managing Emotional Intelligence in Families

**Our family is the first place we learn about emotions and how to handle them. Children learn not just through the things parents say, but the things they see parents do as well.**

There are 3 common parenting styles that are harmful:

  * 1) **Ignoring feelings completely.** This method leads children to believe emotions are inconveniences. These parents don’t use emotional moments as teaching moments, and they don’t usually develop closeness to their kids.
  * 2) **Being too accepting.** These parents acknowledge their children’s emotions but don’t teach them acceptable and healthy ways of controlling their reactions to those emotions.
  * 3) **Treating emotions with contempt.** These parents are harsh critics and disapprove of any emotional display. Ironically, they usually deal emotionally with their children, punishing out of anger and meeting emotional responses with bigger, more overwhelming emotional responses of their own.



We’ll look at 3 common issues parents face with their children—anger, depression, and eating disorders—and the danger of letting these issues go unmitigated.

### Anger in Children

Angry kids usually become bullies who, incapable of handling their own emotional reactions, take their anger out on other children, leading to social isolation, disciplinary actions, and judgment from teachers.

Bullies are more likely to drop out of school and end up with criminal records, and they’re likely to pass their violence and aggression down to their kids—not only through genes but through nurturing and the environment of the household—which creates more bullies.

**Bullies typically come from households where punishment is an emotion-based system.** When parents are in a bad mood, the punishment for misbehaving is severe. When parents are in a good mood, the kids can do whatever they want without consequences. This volatility and lack of logic creates a kind of chaos that encourages letting emotions dictate one’s actions, violence and aggression as the primary ways of dealing with negative emotions, and a lack of boundaries.

Very often, bullies come from households of abuse or neglect. Abused children are more likely to abuse their own children, creating whole family lineages of abuse passed down through the generations. Abuse shatters trust in people and the world around them, and often makes the victims feel as though something about themselves caused the abuse, or that they deserve it for some reason. On the opposite end are households where parents emotionally neglect their children—and neglect can be more detrimental than abuse, some studies find.

Anger doesn’t always result in bullying—sometimes angry children are social outcasts, withdrawn and overreactive to perceived insults. This is the common tendency among angry kids, whether they’re bullies or not: **angry children perceive threats or slights where they’re not intended** —someone bumping into them accidentally in the hall, for example—and then lash out at those perceived threats, furthering their isolation. Most of these kids see themselves as victims who are merely acting in self-defense.

### Depression in Children

**International data reflects a modern epidemic of depression in today’s young people**. Each generation since the beginning of the 21st century has a higher risk than their parents of suffering major depression.

  * This is partially because of the erosion of the nuclear family due to industrialization. Many children don’t have connections to their extended family due to increased mobility, and don’t get the attention of their parents due to divorce rates and longer working hours.
  * Waning religious beliefs also contribute to this epidemic -- kids have less resources to turn to in the face of a crisis than they once might have.



Some people think kids grow out of depression, but the opposite is true: **mild episodes of depression in childhood often lead to more severe episodes in adulthood.**

Depressed children, like angry children, are more likely to be isolated and ostracized in school, making it harder for them to learn social skills and build relationships that could help pull them out of depression. Depression also affects concentration and memory, leading to worse grades and poorer academic performance.

**Relationship problems of any kind are the most triggering factor for depression in young people.**

  * Depressed youths have difficulty understanding or talking about their feelings, specifically sadness. Because of this, they seem to translate depression into other emotions—anger, irritability, impatience, specifically toward their parents. This of course makes it harder for their parents to connect with them and help them, which in turn isolates the children more.



**Handling setbacks is another frequent trigger for depression.** Interpreting their failures as personal shortcomings they can’t change, or things that don’t work no matter what they seem to do, drives them deeper into depression.

### Eating Disorders in Children

Eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia develop primarily due to an inability to tell the difference between negative emotions (sadness, anxiety, anger) and bodily impulses (hunger or lack of appetite). They’re essentially incorrect responses to impulses.

Therapy that addresses these emotional deficits can go a long way in helping rehabilitate people suffering from eating disorders. Learning how to identify and distinguish between feelings, how to self-soothe or manage relationships more productively will lead to improvements in their relationship to food.

### What Parents Can Do

Parents who want emotionally healthy kids first need to work on their own emotional health. **Setting a good example for your children is the first step you can take to better their future.**

Then, parents need to encourage and help their children develop good emotional habits. This will lead to better academic performance, more social skills and better relationships, better performance in the workplace, and better health.

**Parents who address emotions healthily:**

  * Take their kid’s feelings seriously and try to understand them.
  * View emotional moments as opportunities to coach their kids through what to do.
  * Offer up positive ways to deal with emotional reactions.
  * Practice these three steps in relation to their own emotional moments as well.



Here are the qualities a child needs to be the most efficient student and a successful person. Parents can help their children learn and practice these qualities:

  * **Confidence**. Control over their behaviors, their bodies, and their environments, and a belief that they can achieve what they set out to do, and that people will help them.
  * **Curiosity**. Taking pleasure in discovering things and learning about them.
  * **Intentionality**. Wanting to have an impact and persistently acting upon that desire.
  * **Self-control**. Controlling their own emotions and actions in appropriate ways.
  * **Relatedness**. Engaging with others based on understanding them and being understood by them.
  * **Communication**. Wanting to and being capable of exchanging feelings, ideas, and concepts with other people, trusting others enough to communicate with them, and taking pleasure in communication.
  * **Cooperativeness**. Balancing their own needs versus the needs of others, specifically in group activities.
