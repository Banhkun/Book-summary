## Exercise: Responding to Emotions

Self-awareness is one of the first major steps towards controlling your emotional responses. Use this exercise to help analyze your own emotional responses and improve the way you act on them.

* * *

Think of a situation where something small seemed to set off an overwhelming emotional response in your brain. Briefly summarize the situation, what it was that set you off, and what emotions it sparks in you (refer back to the list for emotion words in Chapter X).

How do those feelings affect your actions afterwards? For example, some people lash out and attack the other person when they feel hurt, or shut down emotionally and withdraw from the conversation if they feel embarrassed.

Based on what we’ve covered, what’s one small thing you could do the next time you feel that way to better handle your emotional response? (For example, physically cool off, remind yourself the other person’s acting out of love, use the XYZ formula for expressing complaints.)
