## Exercise: Articulating Your Biggest Takeaway

As we know, putting thoughts and feelings into words is one way to process them, reflect on them, and take ownership of them. Use this exercise to help solidify your biggest takeaway from the book.

* * *

In a few sentences, what was your biggest takeaway from the summary? What idea lodged in your brain, or what’s the first idea that jumps into your brain when you think about this summary?

How can you apply this takeaway to your life, and how will it help you? For instance, you know now that emotions can’t be controlled, but you _can_ control how you act on them. This might help you avoid judging your emotions, and take time to decide what to do about them.
