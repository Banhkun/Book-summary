## Exercise: Identifying Your Top Priority

Once we begin improving our emotional intelligence skills in any arena of life, they translate over to other arenas--but we have to start somewhere. Use this exercise to explore which of the 5 life areas you’d most like to improve in, and how to start.

* * *

Which of the 5 arenas (romance, family, work, school, and medicine) would you like to improve your emotional intelligence in first? Why is that arena important to you?

Referring back to the “what X can do” section for your chosen arena, pick one of the helpful suggestions and write down how you can apply it to your own life immediately or the steps you can take right now to start putting that suggestion into action.
