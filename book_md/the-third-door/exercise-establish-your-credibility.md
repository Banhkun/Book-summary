## Exercise: Establish Your Credibility

When starting out, one of the hardest challenges you may face is convincing a skeptical client or business partner that you can deliver what you promise. Consider some of the tips from Tim Ferriss, Bill Gates, and Maya Angelou to plan how you might improve your credibility.

* * *

Is there an organization you can associate yourself with that you can borrow credibility from? Is there somewhere you can volunteer or offer your services to meet some need of theirs?

How might you use information to impress the company or client youâ€™re pursuing? What data might you gather about your industry or product that might assure them of your expertise?

What skills would it benefit you to have to achieve your goal? In what way could you learn them? For example, is there a class you could take or a book you could read? How might you structure your day to make time to learn or practice something?
