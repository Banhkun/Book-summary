## Exercise: Make a Strong Point

Schwartzberg argues that to make a point that compels people to action, you have to first identify what your point is, then craft, hone, and market it effectively.

* * *

Reflect on Schwartzberg’s three-pronged approach to identifying, strengthening, and honing your point by using the “I believe” statement, and asking “So what?” and “Why?” Write down a point you’d like to make, then strengthen and hone it.

Consider Schwartzberg’s seven strategies for marketing your point—for instance, silence your inner criticism, choose your first word, pause, and project confidence. Which strategies do you think will be most helpful to you and why?

Think about a time you pitched a point unsuccessfully. After reading this guide, how might you do it differently?
