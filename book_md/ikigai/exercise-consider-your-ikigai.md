## Exercise: Consider Your Ikigai

Chapter 1 introduced you to the concept of ikigai, the Japanese term for a person’s life mission or purpose. This exercise asks you to think about what your personal ikigai may be.

* * *

How does the very concept of ikigai make you feel? Does it feel “right”? Does it make sense to you? Why or why not?

Describe someone who has a strong ikigai. It could be someone you know personally or some famous person in history (an artist, athlete, inventor, or anyone else). What’s their ikigai? How can you tell?

What do you think your ikigai is? (Remember, some people have more than one, so if that’s you, list them all.)

If you don’t know your ikigai, why not? What’s standing in the way of you figuring out your purpose in life?
