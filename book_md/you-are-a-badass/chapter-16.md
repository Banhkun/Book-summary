## Chapter 16: Learn to Go With the Flow

Going with the flow of life, dealing with the unexpected in a positive way, and finding the joy in frustrating situations are ways to grow as a person and create a richer life.

The author recounts an experience during a trip to India that taught her how to go with the flow and get to know your neighbor instead of stressing. She says you can learn everything you need to know about spirituality and life by taking a 12-hour bus ride through India during wedding season.

On what was supposed to be a 5-hour nonstop bus ride to Delhi from Agra, she instead found herself on a bus that seemed not to recognize the idea of times and stops. Instead, they traveled through weddings, which were more like parades, where the entire bus would get off to join in the party. The bus also kept pulling over to let random people on, have tea, have a smoke, and other various reasons.

At one point it let on a man who screamed to the entire bus in Hindi. Instead of being annoyed, the travelers cheered and chanted. They pulled over again, and it turns out the yeller was a holy man who gave the crowd a tour of the temples in a village. They were there for two hours, wandering through temples, skipping in a circle before a statue of Krishna, praying and clapping. When finally back on the bus, even though they were still 5 hours away from Delhi when they should have been there hours before, everyone was cheerful and chatty. They stopped a few more times until they arrived at their destination at 3 am.

Here’s what India taught Sincero about tapping into the “Mother Lode”:

  * Talk to strangers — we’re all family.
  * Expect the unexpected — and enjoy it.
  * Find the humor in a situation.
  * Join the party.
  * Live in the moment.
  * Time spent enjoying yourself is never wasted.
  * Share your space.
  * Love yourself.
