## Chapter 5: Your Negative Self-Perception Is Holding You Back

Too many of us have a negative self-perception. We think we're inferior and inept. But you get to choose how you perceive your reality, and it takes the same amount of energy to see yourself as a loser as it does to see yourself as a rock star. Wouldn’t life be more productive and fun if we embraced ourselves?

The author refers to self-perception as a zoo. Intelligent people think they’re dumb, beautiful people think they’re ugly, great speakers think they’re boring. People vacillate between seeing themselves as awesome and unworthy.

When someone we admire does something phenomenal, we are happy for them but not surprised. Of course they did something phenomenal. They _are_ phenomenal! But we have a hard time accepting _ourselves_ as a phenomenal being.

### Perfectly Imperfect

To counter a negative self-perception, try seeing yourself through the eyes of someone who admires you, someone not connected to your negative beliefs and insecurities. This person will see only your full potential and talents. Eventually you can become your own fan, look at yourself from the outside, absent of self-doubt, and see your true potential.

The reality is, as the author puts it, “You are a badass.” It is how you were born, who you are, and what you’ll always be. The Universe loves you unconditionally and wants to give you everything you desire, including happiness. It wants you to see in yourself what it sees in you.

You are perfectly imperfect and it’s your job to love yourself and laugh at yourself.
