## Chapter 11: Our Thoughts Create Our Realities

Getting a handle on your thoughts is key to changing your life. Albert Einstein once said, “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”

Your thoughts and beliefs dictate your reality, so if you want to change your reality, you have to change your thoughts. When you change your thinking, you’ll see evidence of a new life being created around you. It’s not the other way around — you can’t wait for the evidence and _then_ change your thinking.

Understand that everything you want is available to you; you just have to shift your perception to see it become reality. Your job isn’t to figure out _how_ your dreams will become reality; it’s to know what you want and be open to receiving the how. You do this with your thoughts.

**Keep your thoughts directed toward your goal, do what you know to do to keep moving in the right direction, and be on the lookout for your opportunities.**

### How to Steer Your Thoughts in the Right Direction

When you want to get a handle on your thoughts and use them to positively change your reality, try these strategies:

**Ask for what you want**. When you get quiet, clear the clutter in your brain, get in touch with Source Energy, and send thoughts of what you want. This begins the manifestation process.

**Act like it’s already happened**. When you want something badly, act like it’s yours already. Prepare for it. Stay open to opportunities that can lead you toward that goal.

**Make some upgrades where you are now**. When you’re actively visualizing a better reality, and you’re thinking and imagining the change, it helps to make some upgrades to your current situation. If you want a better lifestyle, clean the clutter in your home. Put inspiring art on the walls. This keeps your frequency high and shows The Universe you’re not joking around.

**Make a vision board**. Feeding your mind the images of the things and experiences you want to manifest is powerful; your mind sends those images to Source Energy, which begins the manifestation process. Paste pictures of people, places, things and experiences you want onto a board; hang it where you can see it.

**Surround yourself with support**. Hanging around with bleak whiners will drag you down. To keep yourself in a positive headspace, find people who see limitless possibility as their reality. Find people who act on their big ideas. If you don’t know anybody like this, make new friends.

**Love yourself**.
