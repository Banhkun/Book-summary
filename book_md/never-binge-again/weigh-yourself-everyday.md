## Weigh Yourself Everyday

Weighing yourself everyday gives you continuous feedback on how you’re doing. **It allows you to make fast corrections before you spend weeks going off track.**

Think about how you drive. Do you open your eyes for a second, adjust the wheel, then close your eyes for 5 seconds hoping for the best? Obviously not. You make tiny corrections in fractions of a second.

Weighing yourself is the same. Ideally, weigh yourself at the beginning of every day, so you can adjust your eating plan for the rest of the day.

**Any decision NOT to weigh yourself is the Pig convincing you not to because you’ll feel bad.** But without knowing you’re going off course, it’ll be much easier to Binge.

> _Pig Squeal:_ So much can change day to day! How salty was your meal last night? Did you poo this morning yet? Did you exercise? Maybe you should spend some more time to empty yourself first, and meanwhile let’s binge!
> 
> Response: What matters isn’t my literal weight today, it’s the overall trend. Even if I gained a pound compared to yesterday, I shouldn’t feel bad for the whole day—I should follow my food plan like any other day.

> _Pig Squeal:_ The scale is just a number. Are you going to let it define you? Better not to worry about it.
> 
> Response: Your heart rate is also a number, and it matters if that number is 0. These important numbers exist whether you look at them or not. By looking at them, you take control and can make better decisions.

> _Pig Squeal:_ Congratulations! You’re 5 pounds down! Take it easy—it’s time to binge!
> 
> Response: I committed to following my food plan 100%. It doesn’t matter how much progress I’ve made, I’m following the plan. Also, if I haven’t reached my goal yet, I can’t take it easy.

> _Pig Squeal:_ You gained weight! You’re pathetic! Just give up and be content with being fat. You’re obviously never going to make progress.
> 
> Response: First, recent factors might have caused my weight to change [it can vary by up to 5 pounds based on your diet.] Next, even if I’ve had a setback, the strong thing to do is to get back on course.
