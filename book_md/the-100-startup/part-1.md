## Part 1: Deciding on a Product or Service

The first step of creating a business is deciding on a product or service. Ultimately, your product needs to have worth: In other words, it should make people’s lives better or easier. Ideally, this product or service should also be something that you’re passionate about. However, before you dive into transforming a passion or hobby into a business, **consider the following questions:**

  * Could you invest a minimum of 20 hours per week into the field you’re passionate about?
  * Do you like teaching others about that field?
  * Do you enjoy most aspects of that field, even the seemingly mundane details?
  * If you had to put an administrative process onto your passion, would you still enjoy it?
  * Is there a market surrounding your passion?
  * Are there other businesses in that market? 
  * Do you have an idea of how _your_ business could be unique in that market?



**If you answered “yes” to all of the above questions, you’re ready to start developing your product or service.** To do so:

  * Find your target audience.
  * Create an experience.
  * Stay open to new ideas.



### Find Your Target Audience

**As you create your product, determine _who_ you’re trying to sell to. **To do this, break your ideal customers down into demographics. There are two kinds of demographics:

  * Traditional demographics include age, sex/gender, income, race/ethnicity, and location.
  * New demographics include beliefs, skills, interests, passions, and values.



Traditional demographics still have a place for some small businesses, especially those with storefronts. It’s often helpful to know the traditional demographics of the area around your storefront because you want to make sure your product or service can thrive in the region. For example, if you know that you cater mostly to women in their 50s, you wouldn’t want to open in a storefront in an area with a younger population.

However, traditional demographics can be rather vague. For example, catering to “middle-class, 20-to-25-year-old men” could mean a variety of things, since men in this group may have diverse interests and preferences. Are they young professionals? Gamers? Athletes? Traditional demographics don’t answer these questions.

**On the other hand, new demographics help businesses shape their product based around the wants and desires of their customers.** For example, if you ran a clothing boutique, you could use new demographics to decide that you want to cater to young women in the workforce who are interested in climbing to the top of the corporate ladder. With this knowledge, you could shape your product and marketing by creating stylish, but professional attire that appeals to your target market.

#### Two Strategies to Create Products Based Around a Target Audience

**When building products around your target audience, consider the following strategies:**

##### Strategy One: Jump onto a popular trend that appeals to your target audience.

**When deciding what you want to sell, look at trends that are popular with your target audience.** These often pop up in the areas of dieting, fitness, technology, social media, and entertainment. For example, you could coach people interested in fitness through a trendy diet plan such as Whole30 or Paleo by giving personalized meal plans and grocery lists.

##### Strategy Two: Ask your audience.

**Using surveys and interviews, ask people within your target demographic what they're looking for in a product** —for instance, the issue that they'd like the product to solve. One of the most straightforward ways to get people interested in your business is to sell them a product they already want. When creating your questionnaires, include questions such as:

  * What makes **____** a struggle?
  * What’s your biggest question or concern about **____**? 
  * How can I help you with **____**?



Once you have an idea about the products you’re looking to offer,**reach out and ask for feedback on your ideas.** You could ask people to rate your product ideas based on what they’d find most helpful or if they could see themselves buying any of the products in the near future.

Note: Be careful about _over_ -involving the customer in product design. While asking for feedback on fleshed-out ideas is helpful, asking customers to do too much work can cause stress or overwhelm them.

For example, if you order a steak at a restaurant, the waiter will probably ask how you’d like the steak done. Your opinion helps shape the preparation of the food and doesn’t require too much work on your end. However, if the chef came to your table and asked you to come back to the kitchen to help with the process, you may feel stressed or frustrated.

#### The Decision-Making Matrix

Once you’ve conducted your market research, you may have so many product ideas that you don’t know where to begin. **To organize your thoughts and determine which ideas are the best, use the decision-making matrix.** The decision-making matrix contains four scoring categories, scored between 1 and 5:

  1. Impact: Will this idea make an impact on my audience? (1 = no impact; 5 = immense impact)
  2. Effort: How much time and effort does this idea require? (1 = a significant amount of effort; 5 = a small amount of effort)
  3. Profitability: How profitable is this idea? (1 = not profitable; 5 = very profitable)
  4. Vision: How closely does this idea align with my vision or mission? (1 = not remotely aligned; 5 = perfect alignment)



At the end of each row, tally the total score of each idea. When you’re finished, the matrix should look something like this:

| Impact  | Effort  | Profitability  | Vision  | Total   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Idea 1  | 4  | 2  | 5  | 5  | 16   
Idea 2  | 2  | 5  | 3  | 3  | 13   
Idea 3  | 3  | 2  | 2  | 1  | 8   
  
Using the above example, you could reach the following conclusions:

  * Idea 1 would likely be the best idea to move forward with because it scored the highest in the matrix. Though it would require a fair amount of effort, high scores in impact, profitability, and vision make it a concept worth investing in. 
  * While Idea 2 may have scored lower in impact, profitability, and vision, it’s a project that requires little effort, meaning it may be a good side project for further down the line.
  * Idea 3 may need to be discarded. Scoring low across the board, the payoff doesn’t seem to be worth the effort.



### Create a Positive Customer Experience

When selling your product, focus on the _experience_ that your product creates. **To do this, attribute the value of your product to its _benefits_ , or the ways that it can help your customer, not to its _features_ , or the details of the product. **Instead of marketing what your product _does_ , you’re marketing the positive _experience_ a customer will receive.

For example, if you were marketing a meditation retreat, the benefits of the retreat would be “freeing the mind” or “calming the body,” while the features would be “sound-bath meditation” or “guided practice.” While your customers would need to know the features eventually, they’ll likely be more drawn to your product by the promise of freedom and relaxation.

#### Three Strategies to Create a Positive Experience Around Your Product

**Use the following three strategies to provide an experience for your customer that goes above-and-beyond:**

##### Strategy One: Fulfill unspoken or unrealized needs.

Often, customers don’t know what they _actually_ want. They may have an idea, but **it’s your job as the expert to lead them to a product or service that’s going to give them an excellent experience that they didn’t necessarily anticipate.**

Note: This doesn’t mean ignoring their requests. If the customer asks for something specific, give them what they’re asking for. However, you can guide them in a certain direction or provide an additional service if you believe it’s going to elevate the value of their experience.

For example, if you’re a wedding photographer, some couples may ask for “non-traditional” photos, but you know people tend to regret not taking traditional photos after the fact. To accommodate for this, shoot the non-traditional photos, then ask if you can take just a few quick traditional group photos. Worst case scenario, they don’t like the photos. Best case scenario, they’re given a beautiful memory that they’ll cherish the rest of their life.

##### Strategy Two: Make the customer look good.

**People often look for products or services that will help make them look impressive or skilled.** When defining the value of your product, show your customers how your business can elevate them at home or in the workplace.

For example, if you run an online course on website creation for aspiring web designers, you’re helping your clients gain the skills they need to successfully and efficiently provide _their_ clients with stunning websites. Explain how your product will make them look like heroes to the people that they serve.

##### Strategy Three: Don’t get bogged down with unnecessary details.

Customers are typically looking for a simple, clear solution to their problem. If you bombard them with too much information about the details of your product in your marketing materials, they may get overwhelmed or confused, disengaging with the item or service in the process.

Keep your promises concise and straightforward. This allows the customer to clearly understand what they’re getting from your product, making them more likely to purchase. If they _ask_ for more details, then feel free to provide them with more information. Just don’t assume that everyone wants an in-depth breakdown of your product.

For example, if you’re starting a voice studio, don’t lead by explaining the intricacies of every single vocal methodology that you’ve studied. Simply explain that you want to help people become better singers and that you’re going to give them the tools to succeed. If they want to know more, they’ll ask.

### Stay Open to New Ideas

**As you start your business, changing trends in the market may lead to new ideas.** Don’t be afraid of exploring these avenues because they often reflect changes in customer demand. For example, consumers are more aware of environmental issues than ever before. This has created a market trend towards sustainability, which may create an opportunity for you to develop new products using recycled materials to appeal to this trend.

The following are common sources of inspiration that could help you adapt to an ever-changing marketplace:

  * **Ineffective models:** Observe other organizations that offer a similar product to yours and look for what works and what doesn’t. When you see something that’s ineffective, you can come up with a solution to offer your clients a more streamlined process. 
  * **New technology:** Technology is changing and improving constantly. By keeping an eye on new technological trends, you can give your customers innovative and updated experiences. 
  * **Unexpected space:** If you have a storefront or office space, be on the lookout for innovative space solutions. For example, if you run a clothing boutique, renting a former restaurant space to house your storefront may be a unique draw to bring in curious customers.
  * **Side projects:** When a particular product or service is selling well, think about spin-off projects that could boost income or give customers a new experience. For example, if your acting coaching business is booming, consider starting a teacher training program for other acting coaches. 



#### Non-Traditional Business Models

By staying open to new ideas and ways of working, you will find the business model that works best for you and your product or service. The following are specific, non-traditional business models that you may be interested in exploring.

##### Consulting

To run a successful business, you need a product that satiates demand or solves a problem. If your passion doesn’t create a clear product, then you’re probably not going to make money without some adjustments.

**Consulting is a good option for people whose passions won’t make a profit on their own but can be used to help other people.** For example, you probably won’t make money by blogging about your travel experiences. However, if you can help _other_ people travel, you can transform your travel hobby into a profitable travel consultancy business.

This can be done in many different models. You need to find what works best for you and your product:

  * Create coursework then sell it for a flat fee. 
  * Teach live courses that run for a set amount of time. 
  * Offer private consulting sessions at variable rates.
  * Start a podcast and take on sponsors and advertisers.



Once you know what model you want to use, consider the following:

  * **Be specific about your title.** This lets your potential clients know what they’re paying you for. Don’t just call yourself a “life coach” or a “business consultant.” For example, if you’re an expert in analytical accounting, call yourself an “analytical accounting consultant.”
  * **Don’t undercharge.** If you undercharge for your consulting services, people may question the quality of your information. (You’ll learn more about setting prices and developing offers in Part 2.)
  * **Share client testimonials.** Share at least two stories of people that have been helped by your service. If you have no paying customers yet, offer your service to someone you know for free and have them share their thoughts.



##### Self-Publishing

**In addition to consulting, another common startup model is self-publishing.** Thanks to advances in technology, self-publishing your book is easier than ever, allowing you to share your knowledge or expertise without having to go through a traditional publisher. The result is higher profits and more direct control over your product.

To become your own publisher, use the following steps:

  1. Pick a topic that people will pay to learn about. 
  2. Research the topic and write down or record what you find.
  3. Organize your information into a sellable package such as an e-book or online course.
  4. Set a price point and have a way to get paid, either through a credit card processing system (such as Square or Stripe) or online services (such as PayPal or Venmo).
  5. Release the digital package and spread the word through marketing, primarily by encouraging word-of-mouth or referrals.



##### The Traveling Entrepreneur

**If you’re able to start a successful online business, you may not have to stay in a particular location, allowing you to travel to your heart’s content.** If you want to see the world while maintaining your startup, consider the following tips:

  * Don’t try to _start_ your business while on the road. Make sure you’ve taken the time to get your business running before you set off.
  * Take the time to research visa requirements for international travel.
  * Use cloud-based software such as Google Docs or Dropbox. This lets you access documents from anywhere, even if you don’t have access to a laptop or home computer. 
  * Change your passwords often.
  * Look at hotel-alternatives such as CouchSurfing or AirBnB for the best prices.
  * Check how “tech-friendly” your destination is before traveling. You may have to buy travel adapters or adapt your data plan before you take off.
  * Balance your work schedule with your adventures. Take the time to take in your surroundings and explore, but you need to make sure you’re putting the proper amount of time into your business to keep it profitable.
