## Exercise: Make Adjustments to Increase Profitability

Growth requires more funding. Make adjustments to your current model to ensure that you're maximizing your revenue.

* * *

List 2-3 ways you can increase your average price per sale. Think about upselling, cross-selling, and making sales after a sale.

Describe 1-2 new products or services you could offer to existing customers or clients.

How might you develop a new product from your existing service (or vice versa)? (For example, you could create a subscription model themed around your product for product-to-service, or write a book about your service for service-to-product.)
