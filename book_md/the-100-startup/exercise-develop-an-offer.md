## Exercise: Develop an Offer

Before selling your product, you have to develop a clear offer that entices your target audience by describing benefits, quelling concerns, and creating urgency.

* * *

What are you charging for your product? What benefits could you use to justify that price?

List 2-3 objections that your audience may have to buying your product.

How would you respond to each of these objections?

Why should customers want to buy your product or service right now? What could you do to make your offer more urgent?
