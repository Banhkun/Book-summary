## Introduction

**If you’re looking to break away from your current work arrangement and start doing something that you’re passionate about, consider starting a microbusiness.** Microbusinesses, or businesses typically run by one person, give you the freedom to set your own schedule and focus on a product that you care about.

Though microbusinesses have been around since the days of Ancient Greece and Rome, the advent of the internet and social media have made them easier to start and more lucrative than ever before. Where you once needed to have a fair amount of funding to start your own operation, you can now do so for as little as $100 and without loaning a cent from the bank.

Before you start building a business plan or developing marketing plans, develop a clear idea of what you want to do and which of your skills may help you to do this:

  1. **Do something that you’re passionate about that also has consumer demand.** This may mean that you need to find something tangentially rather than directly related to your passion to ensure profitability. For example, you may enjoy eating ice cream, but no one’s going to pay you to do that. However, you could create an ice cream parlor, combining your enjoyment of the treat with a practical business model.
  2. **Take the time to consider what skills you’ve learned over the course of your current career or education.** You’ll find that you have aptitudes that you’ve never considered before that may help you as you form your business model. For example, if you’re a good waiter, you likely have strong interpersonal skills, a good memory, and an affinity for problem solving, traits you could apply to your new startup, such as a PR consultancy.
  3. **Remember that combining passion and skills with a useful product will yield success.** By creating an in-demand product in a field that you care about, you can build a business model that provides both profit and personal fulfillment.



Once you have a grasp on these three concepts, you’re ready to get to work on your startup. You don’t need bank loans or an MBA to begin building your business. In fact, there are really only six steps you need to take to launch your business:

  1. Create a product or service. (Read more about this in Part 1.)
  2. Create a website.
  3. Create an offer. (Read more about this in Part 2.)
  4. Have a way to process payments (either a credit card processing system such as Square or Stripe or an online resource such as PayPal or Venmo).
  5. Market and launch your business. (Read more about this in Part 3.1.)
  6. Repeat steps 1-5, using the lessons you’ve learned.



**Throughout this summary, you’ll learn how to expand on these steps to grow your business from a barebones model and find success as a startup entrepreneur.**

(Shortform note: While this summary does follow the general structure of the original book, some sections have been restructured for the sake of clarity.)
