## Part 3.1: Continuing Development Post-Launch

The work doesn’t end once you’ve launched your product. Once your initial launch cycle is complete,**keep your business moving forward through self-promoting and ensuring profitability.**

### Promote Yourself

**Effective self-promotion is a balance between style and substance.** Style is your ability to effectively market your product, while substance is the quality of your product:

  * If you have style, but no substance, your shoddy product or service will undermine your charm.
  * If you have substance, but no style, people likely won’t hear about your product, no matter its quality.
  * If you have a quality product and market it effectively, you’ll be able to grow your client base and grow your business.



To organize your promotion efforts, **build a promotion plan using the following template as a guide:**

  1. Goal
     1. What is the primary goal of your self-promotion? This could be to bring in more customers, to increase sales, or to develop relationships.
  2. Daily Promotion
     1. Maintain your company’s presence on social media by creating 1-3 posts, responding to customer comments, and addressing any concerns.
     2. Monitor 1-2 metrics. These can be anything from cash flow to website traffic. Keep it limited to avoid overwhelming yourself with data.
  3. Weekly Promotion
     1. Collaborate with business partners on joint promotions.
     2. Communicate with your clients and potential customers. 
  4. Monthly Promotion
     1. Reach out to existing customers about their satisfaction and ask if they need anything else from you.
     2. Prepare contests, events, and product launches. 
     3. Develop a long-term marketing plan that connects different promotions.



#### Four Strategies for Effective Self-Promotion

As you create your promotion plan,**use the following four strategies to help expand your audience and spread the word about your business.**

##### Strategy One: Reach out to friends and colleagues.

**When starting a business, use the allies you already have by sending a message to your friends and colleagues about your business.** Don’t spam them with marketing materials or try to “sell” them on the product. Instead, explain what your company does, the primary product you’re trying to sell, and the goals that you’re trying to achieve. From there, provide one to three ways that they can help you if they’re willing. Be sure to thank them for taking the time to read your message.

##### Strategy Two: Help others without expectation.

**Offer your services free-of-charge or at a low cost when you see friends, colleagues, or customers in need of assistance.** Don’t put conditions onto your help or demand something in return. If you show that you sincerely want to help others, not just sell them on your product, you’ll be able to build long-term relationships that may help you in the future.

For example, if you run an interior design company, you could offer online consultations free of charge. If you use the time to genuinely assist the client instead of trying to make a sale, you’re going to form a stronger relationship.

##### Strategy Three: Say “yes.”

**Saying “yes” to requests from both customers and other businesses can help you develop new relationships and reach unique audiences.** While you may need to become more selective as your business grows, allow yourself to explore different avenues while your company is young. For example, if another business reaches out to you about a cross-promotion opportunity, agreeing to the request will create connections with both the business owner and their audience.

##### Strategy Four: Give something away for free.

**While you’ll have to embrace a little cost or time upfront, giving away products or services can help you build your audience.** There are two reasons for this:

  1. More people engage with your business, creating word-of-mouth promotion in the process.
  2. People will be more likely to buy from you if they’re given the opportunity to use your product before committing. Fear of “wasting” money often keeps people from purchasing a product they’re not familiar with. 



There are many ways to go about providing a free product, including a free consultation, a contest, or a giveaway. Experiment with different methods to see what works best for your business.

Note: There _is_ a difference between contests and giveaways. Contests include some form of competition between customers, where giveaways only require customers to provide a name or email to be entered into the draw. Contests require more work but usually generate more engagement than a giveaway.

### Ensure Profitability

**Above all else, in order for your business to survive, you must be able to make a profit.** While social media followers and dedicated customers are great to have, they mean very little if your company isn’t making money. Ensuring profitability can be boiled down to two basic concepts: spend money wisely and generate more income.

#### Spend Money Wisely

It’s often tempting to spend significant amounts of money on large ad campaigns, complex websites, or custom merchandise. **However, if a purchase won’t build your brand or generate sales, then the cost isn’t justified.**

**Especially in the early stages of development, keep costs low by only spending money on items that have a direct impact on sales.** For example, if you buy a branded hoodie for $20 and sell it on for $40, that’s an investment that has a direct impact on sales. However, if you spend $750 on a custom website that ultimately doesn’t generate significant traffic or sales, then you generate no return on your investment.

##### Avoid Taking Out Loans

**In the internet age, there are many ways to start a company on limited funds.** Online storefronts and digital consulting remove the need for a physical space, thus reducing costs. As a result, the need for business loans has decreased.

Of course, there are still costs associated with starting a business.**** If possible, avoid borrowing money as it starts your business in the red. **Instead, consider starting a crowdfunding campaign online.** This allows you to raise money while building an audience in the process. You can offer gifts for different levels of donation but be sure to keep your promises realistic.

#### Generate More Income

While this seems obvious, many companies struggle to bring in enough cash to stay afloat. **To generate more income, consider the following strategies:**

##### Strategy One: Price your product based on its benefits.

**When pricing your product, charge your customers based on the benefits they’re receiving, not the cost of producing the product.** For example, if a single physical book cost you $1 to produce, you wouldn’t charge $2 for the product. Instead, you’d determine the value of the content of the book and charge $20-25.

When you set your prices, be prepared to defend your product. People will complain that the price is too high, or that they can find it for a lower price. If someone is unwilling to pay for your product at its price point, don’t crumble to their demands. You may lose one or two sales in the process, but appeasing people who don’t see the value of your product is not worth it.

##### Strategy Two: Offer tiered packages.

**Once you know the value of your product, create tiers that offer more pricing options for your customers.** If you can, price up from your base model, not down, and keep the range limited. For example, if you charge $75 for your service, you could offer a $100 advanced service and a $150 complete service.

If people are going to spend their money on a product or service, they want to feel like they’re getting the complete experience without breaking the bank. Because of this, typically, a few people will go for the basic item, and a few people will go for the premium item, but most will go for the central item, allowing you to make more money in the process.

The following shows a potential income difference from 20 sales using a single pricing model versus a tiered pricing model:

| Single Pricing Model (Sales/Income)  | Tiered Pricing Model (Sales/Income)   
---|---|---  
Basic Website Package ($100)  | 20/$2,000  | 5/$500   
Comprehensive Website Package ($150)  | Not Offered  | 10/$1,500   
Premium Website Package ($200)  | Not Offered  | 5/$1,000   
Total  | 20/$2,000  | 20/$3,000   
  
##### Strategy Three: Create a recurring payment model.

Instead of selling a single product per customer, **find ways that your business can offer a subscription or membership service that includes a recurring payment.** Recurring payments create a more reliable source of income and keep your customers coming back.

For example, if you make olive oils, you could start a box subscription service where you send the “oils of the month” to your customers. If you get 100 subscribers at $20 per month, you’ll make $2,000 per month. Without that subscription model, you’d have to rely on individual purchases, which can vary wildly from month-to-month.
