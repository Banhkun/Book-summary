## Exercise: Consider Your Career in the Flat World

Globalization has affected nearly every aspect of modern life, from macroeconomics to the way we spend our time. For individuals, however, the most important aspect of globalization may be its effect on the job market. In this exercise, you’ll reflect on how you can remain gainfully employed in a flat world by building your versatility, cooperative skills, and ability to integrate ideas.

If you’re in school now, how do you feel about the future job market? If you’re currently working, how might the industry you work in change in the coming years? Now, jot down some skills and knowledge you might acquire to be versatile and able to take on new roles and tasks in the changing labor market. (These might be skills like coding or learning a new language.)

The ability to cooperate and communicate is vital in today’s society. Think about a time recently in which a lack of cooperation made your job or your life harder. What could you do in the future to work more effectively with others? (These might be things like improving your listening skills or developing a stronger relationship with coworkers.)

Thriving in a flat world may require combining multiple skill sets in new and interesting ways. Think about two or more skills or abilities you have. How might you combine these skills to add a new form of value to a company? (For instance, if you have a strong social media presence and can also code, you might offer to create a video series about coding to help others in the company learn.)
