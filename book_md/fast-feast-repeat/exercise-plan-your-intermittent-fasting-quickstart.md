## Exercise: Plan Your Intermittent Fasting Quickstart

Stephens recommends starting to fast intermittently with a four-week adaptation period. Below, reflect on your goals, plan your approach, and commit to intermittent fasting.

* * *

Consider why you’re interested in intermittent fasting—what do you want to achieve? (For instance, you might want to lose weight, feel more energetic, or just experiment with a popular lifestyle.)

With this goal in mind, consider whether you want to start with time-restricted eating (TRE) or alternate-day fasting (ADF). Describe your choice and explain why it’s best for your goals.

Next, pick your fasting approach. Consider Stephens’s plans from “Commit to a Four-Week Quickstart,” or make your own, and describe why this plan is best for your goals. (For instance, you might start with a 16:8 TRE plan for two weeks and do an 18:6 TRE plan for the next two. For ADF, you might start slow with a 5:2 plan or jump right in with 4:3.)
