## Part 2: Challenge Your Reality

We’ve learned that we don’t have to continue to hold the harmful beliefs society has taught us and what our lives can look like when we’re free—now, let’s explore how to shed those beliefs and achieve freedom.

The authors present a five-step process to escape the mirage of “the real world” by reframing your perspective to adjust your reactions to the messages you receive. **By practicing the five steps in your own life, the naguals say, you begin to reconnect with your needs and desires and reclaim the freedom to be satisfied with yourself as you are.** You embrace the seed of doubt and embark on the path to the freedom of control. In other words, what follows is the Toltec road to enlightenment.

(Shortform note: There are many paths to discarding self-limiting beliefs and reclaiming a feeling of self-worth, and the Toltec road is just one of these. For example, cognitive behavioral therapists specialize in mindset-change—helping clients adjust the way they think about themselves and their day-to-day lives to gradually eliminate self-criticism and shame. Additionally, Daniel Kahneman, author of _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , suggests that the most high-impact determinant of personal happiness and life satisfaction is social connection. He recommends making more friends, teaching and mentoring, and sharing our stories with others. Finally, others suggest that a daily practice of meditation is the ideal route to an improved sense of well-being and happiness.)

Let’s look at each step in detail.

### Step 1: Use Your Words Wisely

The first step in the Toltec process is to **use your words wisely.** In the mirage of “the real world,” we use words to denigrate, criticize, and attack not just those we dislike, but our friends, our children, and even ourselves.

“Use your words wisely” means**don’t weaponize your words against yourself.** Don’t describe yourself in hurtful ways, inside your head or aloud—for example, by telling yourself you’re ugly, stupid, or a failure. When you do that, **you accept those messages as truth and make those negative beliefs a part of your reality.** It’s no wonder you’re not happy when you see yourself that way.

(Shortform note: Another important thing to remember is that self-criticism typically doesn’t reflect reality. For example, psychologists note that those who self-criticize often feel that they receive less support from others, that they’re less attractive, and that they’re less happy than others. However, studies show that in most cases, these feelings don’t reflect their reality—instead, the tendency to self-criticize trains us to overestimate the negative aspects of our experience and underestimate the positive.)

**Instead, allow yourself to be as you are without judgment** —nothing about you is inherently imperfect, even if you’ve been taught to believe otherwise. Don’t demand any more from yourself.

> **Don’t Internalize Self-Criticism**
> 
> Therapists identify two primary types of self-criticism: comparative and internalized. For now, we’ll examine internalized self-criticism, which is based on a feeling that we don’t measure up to our own standards, ideals, or expectations. In short, **we have a vision in mind of how we should be and we don’t measure up to it.** As a result, we often feel we’ve failed even when we succeed—because we didn’t succeed “enough.” When we use our words wisely, as the Ruizes suggest, we don’t pigeonhole ourselves into a no-win scenario like that.
> 
> As the Toltec note, our habit of self-criticism is usually established during childhood—our parents expect certain things from us, and we “internalize” those expectations. Therapists suggest that this happens most when our parents are particularly authoritarian, controlling, or rigid. **The more we’re judged and criticized, the more we learn to criticize ourselves.**
> 
> It’s worth noting that self-criticism isn’t _always_ unhealthy—used constructively, it can improve your self-awareness and help you grow as a person. Pinpointing where you’ve done wrong helps you learn from your mistakes. But **constructive self-criticism generally identifies a particular behavior for improvement:** “I stayed up too late last night; I need to adhere to my bedtime.” It focuses on actionable change to identifiable behavior.
> 
> **Self-criticism becomes _un_ healthy, however, when it’s applied broadly,** and we make nuance-less statements about our personhood. “I’m a failure,” “I never do anything right,” “I’m ugly.” As the Ruizes note, **using our words in this way only hurts us.** Therapists explain that describing ourselves like this prevents us from taking risks, defending our needs, or believing we’re capable. Be kind and forgiving to yourself—after all, you’re only human.

#### Treat Others Wisely

Further, **let others be as they are, too: Don’t externalize the voice that hurts you.** The authors say that when you use your words against others, to spread gossip, criticism, or hurt, you’re not using them wisely. You further the hurt others already feel and push them to conform to the harmful societal beliefs you’re attempting to move away from. Additionally, you invite a future in which that hurt comes back to you as mistreatment. Respect the power your words can have, over others as well as yourself.

(Shortform note: When you use your words to hurt others, you risk starting long-term conflicts. In _The Anatomy of Peace_ , the Arbinger Institute explains that when we provoke, demean, and infuriate others, we motivate them to respond in kind and initiate a cycle of mistreatment. As the cycle continues, we stop seeing them as people, instead seeing them as distasteful objects that can’t be reasoned with. Over time, the conflict festers and grows, dragging in those around us as we grow further and further apart. Do others the courtesy of seeing them as people, with needs, struggles, and hopes of their own—you’ll find it harder to justify using your words and actions to hurt them, and that will keep you out of cyclical conflicts.)

### Step 2: Remember It’s Not About You

The second step on the Toltec path to reclaiming your personal freedom is to understand that the words and actions of others are based on their own relative perceptions: They’re not actually about _you_.

Why is this the case? Because, as we’ve discussed, we all live in our own private world. We see things differently and we hold our own subjective beliefs. The authors explain that due to this subjectivity, **everyone you know has an image of you in their head wholly based on their subjective perception of you and your actions.** This image includes assumptions about who you are, what you think, what your life is like, and what you’re good and bad at.

Ultimately, these assumptions can’t possibly reflect the truth of who you are because **nobody has a clue what’s going on inside your head.**

> **People Don’t Know You as Well as You’d Think**
> 
> The naguals say we shouldn’t take it personally if others don’t see us for who we really are because, bluntly, nobody can. In fact, Dr. Heidi Grant Halvorson, author of _No One Understands You and What To Do About It_ explains that **we think others know us better than they really do.** We assume anyone can tell what we want, what we think, or what we mean—but that’s not the case at all. It’s possible for someone to get _close_ , but it takes so much effort that most people won’t bother.
> 
> The mental picture others have of us, Dr. Halvorson says, is built by a two-part system of thought. “System one” thinking is automatic, hasty, and reflexive; people engage system one when they see a small slice of us and make a series of snap judgments. In contrast, “system two” requires conscious effort and focused intent; people engage system two when they deliberately put aside their snap judgments and get to know the real you.
> 
> Often, people don’t use system two at all: Unless they make an intentional effort to be open-minded, they go with their first impulse and leave it at that. Even those who make the effort are still missing a lot—they only see what you show them and they may not eliminate _all_ their assumptions, biases, and filters. Take the perspectives of others with a grain of salt.

#### They’re Not Angry at _You_

**Because most people don’t know the real you, if someone’s angry or frustrated because you didn’t do what they wanted, don’t blame yourself for it.** According to the authors, people expect you to act in a way that conforms with their imaginary version of you—remember, they think their perception of you is _real_. If another person claims to want something from you, they really want it from the person they _think_ you are. The real you isn’t obligated to do anything they want, to be what they want you to be, or to play along with their imagination.**** In short, it’s not your fault if you don’t live up to someone’s expectations.

Relatedly, the authors say,**when someone mistreats or misunderstands you, don’t take it personally.** When others lash out at you, they’re responding to a perceived offense in the reality they see—not yours. The people around you don’t act according to the reality you see—they act according to their _own_ reality. Nothing they say or do happens because of you.

> **How to React to Demands and Attacks**
> 
> The naguals don’t explain what to do when others blame or mistreat you—they just explain why you don’t need to take such attacks personally. In the heat of the moment, though, it can be difficult to know what to do, so here’s what therapists recommend: Maintain your composure and don’t overreact to the situation. Here’s how they suggest you do that:
> 
>   * **Pause and take a deep breath.** Instead of reacting immediately, slow the situation down to give yourself time to think. This interrupts the fight or flight response.
> 
>   * **Recognize the other person’s perspective.** Their opinion and perspective are real and important to them, but they don’t match your own. So, as the naguals say, don’t take their words personally—but accept that they feel the way they say they do.
> 
>   * **Respond respectfully.** You’re not obligated to do what the other person wants from you, and you don’t have to apologize for choosing not to fulfill their desires. However, you’re still responsible for your words—so don’t use them to strike back.
> 
> 


### Step 3: Don’t Guess People’s Intentions

The third step in the Toltec path is to accept that you can’t guess what someone else is thinking or what’s going on in their life. This is essentially the previous step in reverse: **The naguals explain that your assumptions about another person’s reasoning or behavior aren’t based on what's really going on with them, but on your (probably false)_perception_ of them.** Therefore, when you expect others to behave a certain way, you set yourself up for disappointment. The naguals’ suggestion? To avoid disappointment and be happy socially, stop making these kinds of assumptions.

(Shortform note: In his book _Talking to Strangers_ , Malcolm Gladwell explains that while we think we’re good at reading people, we’re actually terrible at it. We assume people are telling the truth and that the way they present themselves outwardly is an accurate and reliable representation of their inner feelings and intentions. But don’t we all occasionally hide our true feelings, tell half-truths, or mask our intent—and haven’t we gotten away with it? Why should others be any different?)

> **Guesswork Leads to Conflict and Stress**
> 
> When we conflict with others, the naguals say, it’s often because we make assumptions and create unrealistic expectations. Parents and their children, for example, often argue because they live in different worlds—kids see a reality that doesn’t exist to their parents, and vice-versa. Both parties are stuck in their own subjective realities, and **conflict results when they make assumptions about each other’s circumstances.**
> 
> **Further, we often stress ourselves out by creating imaginary scenarios.** If your husband is late coming home from work, you may try to explain why. Maybe he’s been hurt, or he’s cheating on you. Whatever story you come up with, it only exists in your mind—but the fear, the anger, and the stress you feel are real. When he arrives and you realize nothing was wrong, your concerns feel silly—perhaps even shameful. **It’s the assumptions that cause you pain, the authors say, so don’t assume.**

#### Communicate Openly

**Instead of making assumptions, the authors say, communicate openly with others.** If you want to know why someone’s doing what they’re doing or you want someone to know why _you’re_ doing what you’re doing, just talk to them. When you want something, communicate it clearly. According to the authors, open communication is the key to social happiness, since it’s the only way we can learn others’ realities and express our own. That’s important, the naguals say because sharing our joys and experiences with others elevates their meaning and impact.

> **How to Communicate Openly**
> 
> In their book _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel Heller explain that when you communicate openly, you set a good example, encouraging openness and honesty in your relationships. Like the naguals, they emphasize transparency and reciprocity: Openly give others what you want them to give you. When you communicate your needs and expectations directly and in a nonthreatening manner, you make it easy for others to understand what you want without forcing them into conflict.
> 
> As you communicate your needs, desires, and thoughts with others:
> 
>   * **Be brave and assertive.** Don’t apologize for feeling what you feel; summon your courage and speak openly. You’re initiating the conversation because you feel your concerns are legitimate, even if the other person doesn’t seem to agree.
> 
>   * **Focus your words on what you need or want.** Use phrases like “I need,” “I feel,” and “I want.” For example: “I know your work is important, but I’ve been feeling lonely. I need more time and affection than you’ve been giving me lately, and when you put your work first I worry you don’t want me around as much as I want you.”
> 
>   * **Use specific examples to illustrate your concerns.** Be concrete; don’t force the other party to make assumptions—your goal is to avoid further misunderstandings.
> 
>   * **Avoid blaming, judging, or accusing.** The goal isn’t to make the other person feel inadequate—it’s to open a dialogue that improves the way you treat each other.
> 
>   * **Time your discussion for when both parties are calm and collected.** If the situation is already volatile, let it simmer down so you can have an honest, forthright discussion.
> 
> 


### Step 4: Be the Best You Can, Without Comparing

The fourth step on the Toltec path is to do the best you can. As you work to challenge and adjust your beliefs and implement the first three steps, the naguals say you’ll inevitably experience missteps and mistakes. Don’t take that to mean you’re not improving. **As long as you’re always doing your best, you’ll continue to progress.** Growth takes time, the naguals admit, and a mindset shift like this is a big adjustment.

While striving to do your best, the naguals explain that it’s critical to maintain a realistic expectation of what your “best” is: Like everything else in our world, your “best” is relative. **In short: Your best is whatever you can do right now.** That capacity will change from moment to moment, and day to day.

If you define your “best” as the highest bar you’ve ever achieved and expect that of yourself no matter the circumstances, you set yourself up for failure and disappointment. In contrast, the naguals suggest, when you accept that you’ve done what you can for the day, you have no reason to beat yourself up; self-criticism becomes unnecessary and unreasonable.

> **Maintain a Growth Mindset**
> 
> When we don’t succeed, we often punish ourselves—sometimes we spend years beating ourselves up for one mistake. But mistakes happen even when we try our best, the naguals say; they’re a sign that we’re growing. Don’t dwell on them—focus on getting better each day.
> 
> In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink recommends maintaining a growth mindset. He explains that **people with a growth mindset believe they have the potential to get better at anything they want to do.** As a result, they see effort as the driver of improvement, focus on progress over results, and examine their failures for useful feedback. He points out that it’s not possible to achieve total, effortless mastery, no matter the skill. **There’s always more to learn and new situations to apply your knowledge to, and improving isn’t easy.**
> 
> As you practice changing the way you see your world, keep in mind that judgment and self-criticism are deeply ingrained habits. Changing your thinking is difficult, and it won’t happen overnight—so just do what you can each day. **Take pride in incremental progress; improvement _is_ success.** Your capacity isn’t static: If you couldn’t succeed today, don’t take that to mean you never will!

#### Avoid Comparison

**You won’t grow at the same rate as those around you, the naguals say, so don’t compare yourself to others.** Their reality is different, as is their capacity, and focusing on the idea that you’re doing “better” or “worse” than they are will only harm you both. Holding yourself to an unrealistic standard is what makes you unhappy, and you’re not helping others by demanding they be “better” than they are. Each person’s best is unique to their needs, circumstances, and abilities.

(Shortform note: The type of social comparison the naguals recommend we avoid are those we use as vehicles for judgment—to denigrate ourselves or others. But not all social comparisons are negative: For example, an “upward” comparison, say between oneself and a role model could be a source of motivational inspiration. Similarly, a “downward” comparison, between yourself and someone less fortunate, can highlight opportunities to be generous or helpful. However, be careful: The more comparison you engage in, the more likely it is to damage your self-image.)

### Step 5: Doubt Every Message

Once you arrive at the fifth step, you’ve done the hard work of reframing your beliefs and adjusting your worldview in a way that better serves your health and happiness. Now, you’re ready to move to the third stage of Toltec enlightenment—the freedom of control. In other words, since you’re no longer being controlled by beliefs you didn’t choose, it’s up to you to decide how to live. You have the freedom to choose the shape and tone of your subjective reality.

How do we make the most of this freedom? The naguals recommend avoiding:

  * Blindly accepting new beliefs
  * Making new assumptions
  * Taking messages at face value



**To maintain total freedom, the naguals say, doubt and question everything you hear.** No matter how well you manage your environment, you’ll still live in a shared world. As such, you’ll often see upsetting or manipulative messages—your culture and society, for example, will still attempt to tell you what to believe, how to feel, and who to be. Social media will still blast you with emotional content. If you blindly take these things at face value, the naguals warn, assuming they’re true, valid, and “real,” you risk being dragged back into the mirage.

(Shortform note: The “doubt” the naguals are promoting is what’s often called “healthy skepticism.” It’s important to note that a skeptic is different from a cynic: While a cynical person leverages doubt to _avoid_ adjusting their worldview, doubting evidence that contradicts their beliefs, a skeptic holds off on making adjustments until they’ve gathered sufficient evidence to determine what’s really true.)

Instead, the naguals recommend you **use doubt as a tool to detach yourself from your knee-jerk, automatic response to incoming messages.** If you don’t immediately accept an upsetting message as fact, its impact is dulled and slowed, and you have time to think about it before it becomes part of your subjective reality. That ability to detach and delay, emotionally and intellectually, allows you to control what you believe, feel, and think, as well as how you behave, regardless of what’s happening around you. It’s how you maintain the freedom of control.

(Shortform note: Part of doubting what you hear is holding off on deciding whether it’s true or not—or whether you believe or agree with it. In short, you’ll need to embrace uncertainty, which psychologists argue is a healthy practice. Doing so is critical to becoming emotionally stable, and it builds resilience—the ability to adapt to change. That’s part of what the naguals want for you: To be able to face the uncertainty of your social and personal future with bravery and hope.)

#### Doubt Peoples’ Messages, but Respect Their Perspectives

It’s particularly important, the naguals note, to apply this principle to our interactions with other people. **Respect the perspectives of others but doubt the messages they send.** Allow others to express their perspective without judging or influencing them—but don’t blindly accept their expressed perspective as truth.

**What others say is often a surface-level attempt to convey their true message** —if we believe it, we risk accepting a falsehood or an obfuscation of the truth. Look past the subjective words they’re using to describe their reality and see what they’re really trying to communicate.

For example, “you’re lazy” might really mean, “I’m worried about you because you’re staying in bed a lot,” or, “I wish I could be as relaxed as you look,” or, simply, “I don’t like you.” You won’t see the true message unless you doubt the words, and if you’re caught up in the emotional turmoil of reacting to “you’re lazy,” you won't have the bandwidth to see clearly.

(Shortform note: The naguals don’t explain _why_ people don’t just say what they mean, but it’s usually because they’re afraid to. It’s not always safe, acceptable, or wise to say exactly what we’re thinking or feeling, and it can be difficult to tell when it is and isn’t okay to be straightforward. Further, it’s risky to be open because doing so leaves us vulnerable to judgment and attack. As such, be compassionate: Most people aren’t “lying” to be malicious.)

> **How—and Why—to Respectfully Hear Stories You Doubt**
> 
> There’s another practical application for the naguals’ “doubt, but respect” philosophy: learning from others. To learn from others, you must give them a safe space in which to express themselves—that’s what the naguals mean by “respect.” Conflicts and disagreements are opportunities to develop mutual understanding and build common ground—they are not wars you need to win.
> 
> You may disagree with the story another person tells—that is, you may doubt their words—but when you respond with hostility, try to shut them down, or tunnel in on “winning” the “argument,” you’re not respecting their story. Instead, in shutting them out or attacking them, you throw away the opportunity to learn, connect, teach, and even coexist. In short, that kind of behavior won’t lead you toward peace, freedom, or acceptance.
> 
> Instead of reacting strongly when you find a point of disagreement, don’t defend _or_ attack; get curious:
> 
>   * Be willing to explain your perspective, but—more importantly—to hear theirs. Listen to the actual substance—the _message_ —not just the headline of what they’re saying.
> 
>   * Ask them to elaborate: “What makes you say that?” “What makes you feel that way?”
> 
>   * Take note of areas where you _do_ agree with each other, and remember you’re disagreeing with the _perspective_ , not the _existence of the person_.
> 
>   * Frame your sentences as “I” statements, not “you” statements: “I’m finding it almost impossible to save money while paying my student loans,” not, “You boomers ruined the economy, and now I’ll never be able to afford a house!”
> 
>   * Stay open to the possibility that your perspective is flawed; you may not be right about _everything_ you believe, and this might be the person who opens your eyes to something. Give them a chance to show you they’re struggling, too.
> 
>   * Finally, remember that having the conversation _is_ a win. You don’t have to agree—it’s enough if even one of you got to see something you were blind to.
> 
> 

> 
> Like the naguals note, in the end, _we_ get to choose what we believe—and so does everyone else. Don’t waste your energy trying to force a belief on someone else, and don’t feel obligated to accept a belief you don’t feel is right for you. Step 5 is about developing the ability to listen without hurting others or being hurt yourself—that’s a strength that will serve you well.
