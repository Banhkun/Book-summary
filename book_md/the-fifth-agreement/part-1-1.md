## Part 1.1: Doubt Your Perception

In the guide, we’ll often refer to the authors, don Miguel Ruiz and don Jose Ruiz, as “the naguals.” Naguals, sometimes referred to as dreamers, masters, or scholars, act as a conduit between the spirit and the world, and pass on the teachings of the Toltec—whom the Ruizes say were the intellectual and cultural predecessors of the Aztec. To them, a Toltec is an artist of the spirit: a master storyteller who paints his own reality.

We open by exploring their foundational principle—that reality is subjective—in Part 1.1, and follow that in Part 1.2 with a discussion of the nature of and path to enlightenment. In Part 2, we discuss the five “agreements,” or adjustments, the authors recommend we make in pursuing our personal freedom. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll call these the five steps on the Toltec road to enlightenment.

### Our Reality Is Subjective

In the opening chapters of _The Fifth Agreement_ , the authors invite us to challenge our perception of reality. What we see isn’t all there is, they say, and much of what we _do_ see isn’t objectively real. Further, they argue that our knowledge and beliefs are just as subjective as our perception, and that accepting the values and mores of our cultures without doubt restricts our freedom and prevents us from being truly happy. In challenging what we see and believe, the naguals say we can reclaim the power to experience the world we enjoyed as children, free of judgment, self-criticism, and shame.

In the following sections, we’ll explore the subjectivity of reality—in particular the subjectivity of perception and language—and how our personal reality is affected by the beliefs we internalize.

#### Perception Is Subjective

The authors’ first point is that the world we perceive through our senses is only a subjective interpretation of a thin slice of what actually exists in the world. **They argue that the information our senses give us is heavily filtered and fabricated:** Our brains interpret a narrow band of radiation as “color,” the presence of certain particles in large enough numbers as “smells,” and waves of compressed air as “sounds.” Without eyes, ears, and noses—and brains to interpret their signals—colors, smells, and sounds would not exist; in a literal sense, they don’t exist outside of us.

Furthermore, “reality,” the authors explain, isn’t perceived the same way by everyone who experiences it. Some of us are more sensitive to smells, see fewer colors, or can hear at higher frequencies. Plus, other creatures on our planet interpret the same world in very different ways—bats, for example, “see” reality in a way that’s so foreign to us that we can’t accurately imagine it. In short, we can’t assume that we all perceive the same world.

##### Shortform Commentary: Magenta Doesn’t Exist

As the Ruizes say, the world we experience using our senses isn’t an accurate portrayal of what’s really out there. **We often take our brains for granted, failing to realize how untrustworthy they are.** There are dozens of studies showing how the brain’s hasty processing leads us to see things that aren’t there, come to conclusions that don’t make sense, or ignore important details.

It’s not just that our brains are often too rushed to do a good job; sometimes they just make things up. You may have heard, for example, that the color magenta doesn’t exist. In the image below, you can see the frequencies and wavelengths of each of the visible colors (colors generally correspond to a particular wavelength of radiation). **Magenta isn’t there**.

The reason we see magenta in our daily lives is because our brains are used to averaging the colors we see into a blend. Green and red, when seen together, become yellow because yellow is the average wavelength between green and red. When red and purple appear together, we _should_ see green—it’s the average wavelength between the two. But it doesn’t “make sense” for red and purple to mix into green, so our brains substitute “magenta.” Essentially, we only see magenta because “it looks right”—not because it reflects reality.

#### Language Conveys Subjective Beliefs

Further, the naguals argue that our beliefs—and the languages we use to codify and communicate them—are also subjective. **Because our perceptions are subjective, they say, we each have our own ideas about how people should live,** what the things we perceive mean, and what’s right or wrong. These beliefs aren’t universal, but many of us still assume that the ones _we_ hold are factually correct.

(Shortform note: Indeed, the more correct we _think_ our beliefs are, the more likely it is we’re mistaken. A 2018 study discovered that the more certain people are that their view of a topic is correct, the less they tend to know about it. In short, once we’re convinced that we “know” something, we stop trying to learn more about it.)

**We use language to conceptualize and describe those beliefs, so our words carry preconceived notions about what is true, what is good, and what is bad.** The naguals believe that, as a result, when we communicate with each other, we describe our subjective reality in subjective terms. Two people can hear the same words and interpret them differently.

Each language has its own name for water, for example, and that name carries additional meanings and implications depending on the circumstances and beliefs of the people who named it. Those people might feel that water is sacred, that it has spiritual significance—or that it’s a resource to be tapped, a danger to be avoided, and so on. In short, the _meanings_ words carry are beliefs—and they’re as subjective as our perceptions.

> **Scientists Agree: Language Shapes Belief**
> 
> Modern science supports the authors’ claim that the language we use reflects and shapes our fundamental beliefs about the world. For example, linguistic researchers have discovered that people who speak different languages have different beliefs about blame and punishment in the case of accidents. If an English speaker witnesses someone accidentally knock over a vase, they’ll likely say, “He broke the vase.” On the other hand, if a Spanish speaker witnesses the same event, they’re more likely to say, “The vase broke.”
> 
> As a result of these different constructions, the English-speaking witness will remember more details about the man who broke the vase and assign more blame (and, consequently, punishment) to him, whereas the Spanish-speaking witness will treat the incident as a pure accident. In this way, the specific words people use impact their beliefs about the situation—just as the Ruizes describe.

##### Learning Language Means Learning Unhappiness

**The naguals explain that this linguistic subjectivity—and our blind acceptance of subjective beliefs as concrete facts—is the source of our unhappiness.** As children, the naguals say, we’re happy because we’re not yet programmed by language to believe certain things. Instead, we accept the reality we perceive for what it is, innocently and without judgment. We don’t have meanings, morals, and expectations assigned to our perceptions. It’s not until we learn language that we begin to distinguish between male and female, good and bad, or clever and stupid. We just see what is, and accept it as given. We’re free to be whatever we are because we’ve yet to learn it’s possible for us to be “wrong.”

(Shortform note: As the Ruizes note, it’s impossible for children to think critically about what they learn. By the time we’ve acquired the majority of our first language—before the age of 6—we’re still a few years away from being able to think logically. Further, the kind of abstract thinking required to analyze and evaluate a culturally-conveyed value like sexism doesn’t even _begin_ to develop until age 11—and the part of the brain that handles it doesn’t fully develop until age 25. In short, we spend a _long_ time thoughtlessly believing claims we accept at face value—and being miserable because of it.)

As we learn language—internalizing our culture’s values and beliefs—we’re disconnected from that childish freedom. We become unhappy, the authors say, because we learn the meaning of words like bad, imperfect, and ugly, and accept the implication that _we_ can be those things. We accept, if our teachers tell us this is true—that women should be subservient, that men must be strong, that hairstyles are gender-restricted, and so on.

(Shortform note: One of the easiest—and therefore most popular—ways to research the effects of cultural messaging on our happiness is to study the differences between people who do and don’t watch TV. Many studies have found, for instance, that watching a lot of TV leads to an increase in self-objectification and body-shaming, as well as decreased trust in other people and society as a whole. It’s not the TV itself that’s causing this—it’s the fact that we compare ourselves to the people on TV _and find ourselves lacking_.)

### We Believe What We “Know”

According to the authors, even if words aren’t universal and their meanings are variable, they do have a powerful effect on us. **The words we use to describe ourselves, our environment, and the people around us set the tone of our perceived world.**

(Shortform note: The segment of our personal language we use to describe ourselves or our world—both vocally and internally—is called “self-talk,” and it heavily affects our mood. People who use their internal voice to attack themselves are more likely to be depressed or anxious. When your internal voice keeps telling you, “I’m too stupid to do this,” or, “I’m too ugly to be loved,” you stop feeling hopeful about your future. As a result, you’re less likely to invest in that future by taking care of yourself or focusing on long-term goals—which, like the authors say, can profoundly impact your life.)

The authors believe that if our personal language is full of criticism and judgment, we live in a world where acceptance must be earned and everyone’s pressured to live up to a standard. On the other hand, if the words we use to describe our reality are warm, loving, and cheerful, we feel more hopeful, loved, and worthy. And if we take the underlying cultural implications of the words we use as gospel, accepting them as concrete knowledge rather than subjective interpretations of reality, our perspective is aligned with the beliefs of our culture, and deviation from those beliefs will trouble us.

(Shortform note: Why are we so quick to accept cultural beliefs as objective truth rather than subjective interpretations? It may be because we feel the need to conform to a group standard in order to fit in and find acceptance. Research shows that this compulsion to conform to the beliefs and norms of the group is so powerful that it can cause us to develop prejudice against others—and that outside of an environment in which we think we’re _supposed_ to be prejudiced, we often behave very differently.)

This is the curse of knowledge, as the Toltec explain it. **The more we know—the more we agree to believe and accept as fact—the less free will we have, because the more our view of the world is restricted**. For instance, if our culture teaches us, through language, that it’s bad to be fat, _and we believe that_ , we’re no longer free to be both fat and content. When we’re fat, we believe we must be ashamed of it, and that we can’t be happy with ourselves as we are. **Our knowledge becomes a judge that lives in our head, pointing out every way in which we fail to live up to what we’ve learned to believe we should be.**

(Shortform note: In the early 2000s, the link between belief and perception or behavior was clarified by several studies centering around the then-popular debate regarding the existence of free will. The results of this research can arguably be extrapolated to show that _other_ beliefs or “knowledge” can change the way we approach our lives and relationships: Researchers found that people who believed there was no such thing as “free will” were more likely to cheat, steal, and make excuses to avoid helping others. In contrast, those who _did_ believe in free will were more generous, worked harder, and felt life was more meaningful.)

##### Belief Determines Happiness

**The naguals’ point is largely that it’s our _belief_ that matters most**—how deeply we believe the things we “know” informs how much power those beliefs have over us. This is particularly important given most of our beliefs come from our society; we don’t _choose_ those, so much of our perception of reality is out of our control.

Indeed, a core point the authors make is that in most cases, **societal standards, norms, and beliefs are both deeply unhealthy and totally fabricated.** The benchmarks we use to determine who’s good, bad, successful, unsuccessful are social constructs. In most cases, they’re nonsense, and they only matter because we’ve agreed they do. In short, the naguals suggest, we wouldn’t _feel_ deficient if we weren’t taught to _believe_ we’re deficient.

But—the naguals say—just because we believed everything our culture taught us as we grew up, when we didn’t have the capacity to doubt, doesn’t mean we have to keep believing it now. **If each of us lives in our own subjective reality, why not interpret that reality in a way that encourages us to be happy?**

> **Positive Psychology: Four Happiness-Killing Mindsets**
> 
> The naguals don’t explicitly state _which_ societally-advocated beliefs get in the way of our happiness, but positive psychologists (those who study happiness) identify four particularly damaging beliefs that prevent us from being happy. Each one identifies a success condition that’s impossible to achieve, and ties our value or satisfaction to our ability to achieve it.
> 
> To be sustainably happy, positive psychologists say, we must discard the following beliefs:
> 
>   * **Perfectionism: “I can and should attain perfection.”** When you hold this belief, you attempt to meet unrealistic expectations and intangible goals. You can’t be happy unless you’re perfect and consistently generate perfect results.
> 
>   * **Social Comparison: “I must compare favorably to others.”** When you hold this belief, you compare your attributes to those of others and focus on the ways in which you fall short. You can’t be happy when you’re not the best.
> 
>   * **Materialism: “I’m only worth as much as I have.”** When you hold this belief, you can’t be happy because there’s always more to accumulate. Worse, if you lose your possessions, you lose what makes you feel valuable, so you’re always at risk.
> 
>   * **Maximizing: “I can always do better.”** When you hold this belief, you can’t enjoy what you have because it’s inferior to what you _could_ have. There’s always a better job, a more attractive partner, or a faster car.
