## 1-Page Summary

In _The Fifth Agreement_ , don Miguel Ruiz and don Jose Ruiz describe five “agreements” to make with yourself that adjust the way you see the world and your place in it. As you put these principles into practice, you’ll rediscover your true self and recapture the freedom and wholehearted love and joy you enjoyed as a child.

According to the authors, these agreements speak to the hearts of all people—everyone who’s learned a language, participated in a culture, and grown up around other people. They’re a series of intuitively common-sense principles we are all aware of, but which few of us actually practice. Those who have mastered the five agreements, the authors say, completely accept themselves as they are, and accept everyone else as _they_ are, and the result is eternal happiness.

In this guide, we’ll begin by exploring the idea that each person’s reality is separate, relative, and unreal; we don’t see the “real” world, and we don’t see the same world. Then, we’ll learn how to escape that false reality through the five “agreements,” or five steps on the path to enlightenment.

### Part 1.1: Doubt Your Perception

In the guide, we’ll often refer to the authors, don Miguel Ruiz and don Jose Ruiz, as “the naguals.” Naguals, sometimes referred to as dreamers, masters, or scholars, act as a conduit between the spirit and the world, and pass on the teachings of the Toltec—whom the Ruizes say were the intellectual and cultural predecessors of the Aztec. To them, a Toltec is an artist of the spirit: a master storyteller who paints his own reality.

We open by exploring their foundational principle—that reality is subjective—in Part 1.1 and follow that in Part 1.2 with a discussion of the nature of and path to enlightenment. In Part 2, we discuss the five “agreements,” or adjustments, the authors recommend we make in pursuing our personal freedom. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll call these the five steps on the Toltec road to enlightenment.

#### Perception Is Subjective

The authors’ first point is that the world we perceive through our senses is only a subjective interpretation of a thin slice of what actually exists in the world. **They argue that the information our senses give us is heavily filtered and fabricated:** For instance, our brains interpret a narrow band of radiation as “color.” Without eyes—and brains to interpret their signals—colors would not exist; in a literal sense, they don’t exist outside of us.

Furthermore, “reality,” the authors explain, isn’t perceived the same way by everyone who experiences it. Some of us are more sensitive to smells, see fewer colors, or can hear at higher frequencies. Plus, other creatures on our planet interpret the same world in very different ways—bats, for example, “see” reality in a way that’s so foreign to us that we can’t accurately imagine it. In short, we can’t assume that we all perceive the same world.

##### Shortform Commentary: Magenta Doesn’t Exist

As the Ruizes say, the world we experience using our senses isn’t an accurate portrayal of what’s really out there. **We often take our brains for granted, failing to realize how untrustworthy they are** —and that sometimes, they just make things up. You may have heard, for example, that the color magenta doesn’t exist. In the image below, you can see the frequencies and wavelengths of each of the visible colors (colors generally correspond to a particular wavelength of radiation). **Magenta isn’t there**.

The reason we see magenta in our daily lives is that our brains are used to averaging the colors we see into a blend. Green and red, when seen together, become yellow because yellow is the average wavelength between green and red. When red and purple appear together, we _should_ see green—it’s the average wavelength between the two. But it doesn’t “make sense” for red and purple to mix into green, so our brains substitute “magenta.” Essentially, we only see magenta because “it looks right”—not because it reflects reality.

#### Language Conveys Subjective Beliefs

Further, the naguals argue that our beliefs are also subjective—and that, because we use language to describe those beliefs, **our words carry preconceived notions about what is true, what is good, and what is bad.** The naguals believe that, as a result, when we communicate with each other, we describe our subjective reality in subjective terms. Two people can hear the same words and interpret them differently.

(Shortform note: Modern science supports the authors’ claim that the language we use reflects and shapes our fundamental beliefs about the world. For example, linguistic researchers have discovered that people who speak different languages have different beliefs about blame and punishment in the case of accidents. In this way, the specific words people use impact their beliefs about the situation—just as the Ruizes describe.)

According to the authors, even if words aren’t universal and their meanings are variable, they do have a powerful effect on us. **The words we use to describe ourselves, our environment, and the people around us set the tone of our perceived world.** In short, the language we use dictates our beliefs.

(Shortform note: The segment of our personal language we use to describe ourselves or our world—both vocally and internally—is called “self-talk,” and it heavily affects our mood. People who use their internal voice to attack themselves are more likely to be depressed or anxious. When your internal voice keeps telling you, “I’m too stupid to do this,” or, “I’m too ugly to be loved,” you stop feeling hopeful about your future. As a result, you’re less likely to invest in that future by taking care of yourself or focusing on long-term goals—which, like the authors say, can profoundly impact your life.)

##### Belief Determines Happiness

**The naguals’ point is largely that it’s our _belief_ that matters most**—how deeply we believe the things we “know” informs how much power those beliefs have over us. This is particularly important given most of our beliefs come from our society; we don’t _choose_ those, so much of our perception of reality is out of our control.

Indeed, a core point the authors make is that in most cases, **societal standards, norms, and beliefs are both deeply unhealthy and totally fabricated.** The benchmarks we use to determine who’s good, bad, successful, unsuccessful are social constructs. In most cases, they’re nonsense, and they only matter because we’ve agreed they do. In short, the naguals suggest, we wouldn’t _feel_ deficient if we weren’t taught to _believe_ we’re deficient.

But—the naguals say—just because we believed everything our culture taught us as we grew up, when we didn’t have the capacity to doubt, doesn’t mean we have to keep believing it now. **If each of us lives in our own subjective reality, why not interpret that reality in a way that encourages us to be happy?**

> **Positive Psychology: Four Happiness-Killing Mindsets**
> 
> The naguals don’t explicitly state _which_ societally-advocated beliefs get in the way of our happiness, but positive psychologists (those who study happiness) identify four particularly damaging beliefs that prevent us from being happy. Each one identifies a success condition that’s impossible to achieve and ties our value or satisfaction to our ability to achieve it.
> 
> To be sustainably happy, positive psychologists say, we must discard the following beliefs:
> 
>   * **Perfectionism: “I can and should attain perfection.”** When you hold this belief, you attempt to meet unrealistic expectations and intangible goals. You can’t be happy unless you’re perfect and consistently generate perfect results.
> 
>   * **Social Comparison: “I must compare favorably to others.”** When you hold this belief, you compare your attributes to those of others and focus on the ways in which you fall short. You can’t be happy when you’re not the best.
> 
>   * **Materialism: “I’m only worth as much as I have.”** When you hold this belief, you can’t be happy because there’s always more to accumulate. Worse, if you lose your possessions, you lose what makes you feel valuable, so you’re always at risk.
> 
>   * **Maximizing: “I can always do better.”** When you hold this belief, you can’t enjoy what you have because it’s inferior to what you _could_ have. There’s always a better job, a more attractive partner, or a faster car.
> 
> 


### Part 1.2: Adjust Your Focus

Before we move on to the five agreements, we’ll explore the naguals’ description of three subjective “realities” we can inhabit.

**Each subjective reality is a stage in the Toltec road to total personal freedom,** culminating in the ability to choose what we believe and thereby determine our own satisfaction and happiness. Essentially, that final stage is a form of enlightenment—so we’ll compare each stage along the way to other enlightenment philosophies, like Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism.

In short, the naguals contend that our perception of reality—and therefore the way we think, feel, and behave—changes based on what we believe. As we begin to challenge and overcome the false “truths” we accepted as children, we grow progressively freer.

**The following are the three stages we’ll explore:**

  * **Stage 1: The Mirage of “The Real World,”** in which we take what we see at face value
  * **Stage 2: The Seed of Doubt,** during which we challenge our perceptions and beliefs
  * **Stage 3: The Freedom of Control,** in which we grow beyond what our society teaches



#### 1\. The Mirage of “The Real World”

Most of us, the naguals say, aren’t critical of what we perceive and learn. **We trust what our culture, society, and teachers tell us, innocently and without reservation.** We believe that what we’re seeing is all there is—we think we live in “the real world” and never realize that it’s only a mirage. This is the most common way to live, the naguals say. We’re handed a flawed belief system, and we accept it as-is.

(Shortform note: The authors suggest that this blind acceptance is almost universal. In _A New Earth_ , spiritualist Eckhart Tolle agrees that, historically, only exceptional religious figures (such as the Buddha, Lao Tzu, and Jesus Christ) have learned to see past the mirage. However, Tolle also suggests that it’s becoming more and more common for people to see the flaws in our societal belief systems—potentially leading to what Tolle calls a “transformation of human consciousness.”)

Living in the mirage is torture, the Toltec say, because our belief in its reality leaves us no escape—we take the picture we’re handed of what the “correct” way to live is and hold ourselves to it. We copy the behaviors, beliefs, and emotions we believe to be “right,” burying our true selves under so many layers of conformity that we forget who we are or what we want. Furthermore, we live in fear that others will see us living “incorrectly” and punish us for it—and we validate that fear by attacking those around us who misbehave.

(Shortform note: Eckhart Tolle argues that the mirage doesn’t just harm us as individuals: It’s also actively destroying our social and physical environments. The values we’re taught to hold, he argues, are insane to the point of self-destruction: Society’s obsession with productivity and profit leads us to abuse and slaughter our own people and jeopardize the livability of our planet. If we want to survive, he says, we must collectively evolve beyond the materialistic values that are driving us apart. Instead, we must put _people_ first.)

#### 2\. The Seed of Doubt

**To reclaim our freedom, the Toltec say, we must replace judgment with acceptance.** In other words, we must stop demanding everyone be “better” and just love them as they are. To love _ourselves_ as we are, and experience the world as it is. In short, the second stage of Toltec enlightenment involves learning to accept what’s already here instead of focusing on how flawed it all is.

During the second stage, the naguals explain, we become aware of the ways our beliefs harm us and begin to disconnect from the mirage. We begin to doubt that the mirage is truly “the real world,” and awaken to the many small ways in which the beliefs we grew up with manifest as harm. We make adjustments to the way we respond to, think about, and see ourselves, others, and the world. We start to see what’s actually here, instead of what’s _not_ here.

##### Shortform Commentary: What Does Acceptance Mean?

Other philosophies drive at this core principle—accepting things as they are—from different directions, but come to remarkably similar conclusions. For example, the _Tao Te Ching_ is very direct. It tells us that the workings of the universe aren’t truly comprehensible or explainable and that **we don’t have to know, label, or understand anything in order to experience it** —or even to enjoy it. In fact, it’s often best _not_ to stress about the whys and hows because what’s happening will happen anyway. What is, _is_ , and that’s okay.

Like the Toltec, other philosophies also recommend showing yourself this same acceptance. For example, the _Bhagavad Gita_ suggests that in order to find ourselves, we must discard every outside influence: Our search for peace and righteousness, our selfish desires, and our indulgence in sloth and despair. It’s the false “reality” created by our senses that gives rise to those things, not the true self at our core. **To be yourself, discard everything you think you’re _supposed_ to be and just focus on being what you already are.**

#### 3\. The Freedom of Control

The final stage in the Toltec path is a form of what’s often called “enlightenment.” Let’s take a look at what enlightenment looks like for the Toltec:

**The naguals say that the best stage of your life begins as soon as you completely stop judging.** When you can allow yourself and others to simply exist, you lose the need to find yourself, to try to be someone else, or to “fix” yourself. Your personal story no longer describes a struggle against yourself, others, or the world—instead, it becomes a record of your existence, of the message you carry from the universe, to the universe. In short, because you’re no longer actively making yourself unhappy, **you regain the childish freedom of being what you are without burden, expectation, or demand.**

(Shortform note: Like the Ruizes, the _Tao Te Ching_ says enlightenment is about living in the here and now, following the natural pull of your moment-to-moment experience. It’s about being at peace with the reality you live in—without expectations, self-consciousness, or attempts to control the actions of others. Similarly, the _Bhagavad Gita_ explains that an enlightened person is content to exist in every moment, believing that their purpose is simply to be a part of this world. In short, there aren’t any rules; you’re free to simply experience the moments you get to experience.)

### Part 2: Challenge Your Reality

We’ve learned that we don’t have to continue to hold the harmful beliefs society has taught us and what our lives can look like when we’re free—now, let’s explore how to shed those beliefs and achieve freedom.

The authors present a five-step process to escape the mirage of “the real world” by reframing your perspective to adjust your reactions to the messages you receive. **By practicing the five steps in your own life, the naguals say, you begin to reconnect with your needs and desires and reclaim the freedom to be satisfied with yourself as you are.** In other words, what follows is the Toltec road to enlightenment.

(Shortform note: There are many paths to discarding self-limiting beliefs and reclaiming a feeling of self-worth, and the Toltec road is just one of these. For example, cognitive behavioral therapists specialize in mindset-change—helping clients adjust the way they think about themselves and their day-to-day lives to gradually eliminate self-criticism and shame.)

Let’s look at each step in detail.

#### Step 1: Use Your Words Wisely

The first step in the Toltec process is to **use your words wisely.** In the mirage of “the real world,” we use words to denigrate, criticize, and attack not just those we dislike, but our friends, our children, and even ourselves.

“Use your words wisely” means**don’t weaponize your words against yourself.** Don’t describe yourself in hurtful ways, inside your head or aloud—for example, by telling yourself you’re ugly, stupid, or a failure. When you do that, you accept those messages as truth and make those negative beliefs a part of your reality. It’s no wonder you’re not happy when you see yourself that way. **Instead, allow yourself to be as you are without judgment** —nothing about you is inherently imperfect, even if you’ve been taught to believe otherwise.

(Shortform note: Another important thing to remember is that self-criticism typically doesn’t reflect reality. For example, psychologists note that those who self-criticize often feel that they receive less support from others, that they’re less attractive, and that they’re less happy than others. However, studies show that in most cases, these feelings don’t reflect their reality—instead, the tendency to self-criticize trains us to overestimate the negative aspects of our experience and underestimate the positive.)

Further, **let others be as they are, too: Don’t externalize the voice that hurts you.** The authors say that when you use your words against others, to spread gossip, criticism, or hurt, you’re not using them wisely. You further the hurt others already feel and push them to conform to the harmful societal beliefs you’re attempting to move away from. Additionally, you invite a future in which that hurt comes back to you as mistreatment. Respect the power your words can have, over others as well as yourself.

(Shortform note: When you use your words to hurt others, you risk starting long-term conflicts. In _The Anatomy of Peace_ , the Arbinger Institute explains that when we provoke, demean, and infuriate others, we motivate them to respond in kind and initiate a cycle of mistreatment. As the cycle continues, we stop seeing them as people, instead seeing them as distasteful objects that can’t be reasoned with. Over time, the conflict festers and grows, dragging in those around us as we grow further and further apart. Do others the courtesy of seeing them as people, with needs, struggles, and hopes of their own—you’ll find it harder to justify using your words and actions to hurt them, and that will keep you out of cyclical conflicts.)

#### Step 2: Remember It’s Not About You

The second step on the Toltec path to reclaiming your personal freedom is to understand that the words and actions of others are based on their own relative perceptions: They’re not actually about _you_.

Why is this the case? Because, as we’ve discussed, we all live in our own private world. We see things differently and we hold our own subjective beliefs. The authors explain that due to this subjectivity, **everyone you know has an image of you in their head wholly based on their subjective perception of you and your actions.** This image includes assumptions about who you are, what you think, what your life is like, and what you’re good and bad at.

Ultimately, these assumptions can’t possibly reflect the truth of who you are because **nobody has a clue what’s going on inside your head.**

> **People Don’t Know You As Well As You’d Think**
> 
> The naguals say we shouldn’t take it personally if others don’t see us for who we really are because, bluntly, nobody can. In fact, Dr. Heidi Grant Halvorson, author of _No One Understands You and What To Do About It_ explains that **we think others know us better than they really do.** We assume anyone can tell what we want, what we think, or what we mean—but that’s not the case at all. It’s possible for someone to get _close_ , but it takes so much effort that most people won’t bother.
> 
> The mental picture others have of us, Dr. Halvorson says, is built by a two-part system of thought. “System one” thinking is automatic, hasty, and reflexive; people engage system one when they see a small slice of us and make a series of snap judgments. In contrast, “system two” requires conscious effort and focused intent; people engage system two when they deliberately put aside their snap judgments and get to know the real you.
> 
> Often, people don’t use system two at all: Unless they make an intentional effort to be open-minded, they go with their first impulse and leave it at that. Even those who make the effort are still missing a lot—they only see what you show them and they may not eliminate _all_ their assumptions, biases, and filters. Take the perspectives of others with a grain of salt.

#### Step 3: Don’t Guess People’s Intentions

The third step in the Toltec path is to accept that you can’t guess what someone else is thinking or what’s going on in their life. This is essentially the previous step in reverse: **The naguals explain that your assumptions about another person’s reasoning or behavior aren’t based on what's really going on with them, but on your (probably false)_perception_ of them.** Therefore, when you expect others to behave a certain way, you set yourself up for disappointment. The naguals’ suggestion? To avoid disappointment and be happy socially, stop making these kinds of assumptions.

(Shortform note: In his book _Talking to Strangers_ , Malcolm Gladwell explains that while we think we’re good at reading people, we’re actually terrible at it. We assume people are telling the truth and that the way they present themselves outwardly is an accurate and reliable representation of their inner feelings and intentions. But don’t we all occasionally hide our true feelings, tell half-truths, or mask our intent—and haven’t we gotten away with it? Why should others be any different?)

#### Step 4: Be the Best You Can, Without Comparing

The fourth step on the Toltec path is to do the best you can. As you work to challenge and adjust your beliefs and implement the first three steps, the naguals say you’ll inevitably experience missteps and mistakes. Don’t take that to mean you’re not improving. **As long as you’re always doing your best, you’ll continue to progress.** Growth takes time, the naguals admit, and a mindset shift like this is a big adjustment.

While striving to do your best, the naguals explain that it’s critical to maintain a realistic expectation of what your “best” is: Like everything else in our world, your “best” is relative. **In short: Your best is whatever you can do right now.** That capacity will change from moment to moment, and day to day.

If you define your “best” as the highest bar you’ve ever achieved and expect that of yourself no matter the circumstances, you set yourself up for failure and disappointment. In contrast, the naguals suggest, when you accept that you’ve done what you can for the day, you have no reason to beat yourself up; self-criticism becomes unnecessary and unreasonable.

> **Maintain a Growth Mindset**
> 
> When we don’t succeed, we often punish ourselves—sometimes we spend years beating ourselves up for one mistake. But mistakes happen even when we try our best, the naguals say; they’re a sign that we’re growing. Don’t dwell on them—focus on getting better each day.
> 
> In _Drive_ , Daniel H. Pink recommends maintaining a growth mindset. He explains that **people with a growth mindset believe they have the potential to get better at anything they want to do.** As a result, they see effort as the driver of improvement, focus on progress over results, and examine their failures for useful feedback. He points out that it’s not possible to achieve total, effortless mastery, no matter the skill. **There’s always more to learn and new situations to apply your knowledge to, and improving isn’t easy.**
> 
> As you practice changing the way you see your world, keep in mind that judgment and self-criticism are deeply ingrained habits. Changing your thinking is difficult, and it won’t happen overnight—so just do what you can each day. **Take pride in incremental progress; improvement _is_ success.** Your capacity isn’t static: If you couldn’t succeed today, don’t take that to mean you never will!

#### Step 5: Doubt Every Message

Once you arrive at the fifth step, you’re ready to move to the third stage of Toltec enlightenment—the freedom of control. In other words, since you’re no longer being controlled by beliefs you didn’t choose, it’s up to you to decide how to live. You have the freedom to choose the shape and tone of your subjective reality.

**To maintain total freedom, the naguals say, doubt and question everything you hear.** No matter how well you manage your environment, you’ll still live in a shared world. As such, you’ll often see upsetting or manipulative messages—your culture and society, for example, will still attempt to tell you what to believe, how to feel, and who to be. Social media will still blast you with emotional content. If you blindly take these things at face value, the naguals warn, assuming they’re true, valid, and “real,” you risk being dragged back into the mirage.

(Shortform note: The “doubt” the naguals are promoting is what’s often called “healthy skepticism.” It’s important to note that a skeptic is different from a cynic: While a cynical person leverages doubt to _avoid_ adjusting their worldview, doubting evidence that contradicts their beliefs, a skeptic holds off on making adjustments until they’ve gathered sufficient evidence to determine what’s really true.)

Instead, the naguals recommend you **use doubt as a tool to detach yourself from your knee-jerk, automatic response to incoming messages.** If you don’t immediately accept an upsetting message as fact, its impact is dulled and slowed, and you have time to think about it before it becomes part of your subjective reality. That ability to detach and delay, emotionally and intellectually, allows you to control what you believe, feel, and think, as well as how you behave, regardless of what’s happening around you. It’s how you maintain the freedom of control.

(Shortform note: Part of doubting what you hear is holding off on deciding whether it’s true or not—or whether you believe or agree with it. In short, you’ll need to embrace uncertainty, which psychologists argue is a healthy practice. Doing so is critical to becoming emotionally stable, and it builds resilience—the ability to adapt to change. That’s part of what the naguals want for you: To be able to face the uncertainty of your social and personal future with bravery and hope.
