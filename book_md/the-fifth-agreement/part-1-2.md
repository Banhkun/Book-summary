## Part 1.2: Adjust Your Focus

Before we move on to the five agreements, we’ll explore the naguals’ description of three subjective “realities” we can inhabit.

**Each subjective reality is a stage in the Toltec road to total personal freedom,** culminating in the ability to choose what we believe and thereby determine our own satisfaction and happiness. Essentially, that final stage is a form of enlightenment—so we’ll compare each stage along the way to other enlightenment philosophies, like Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism.

In short, the naguals contend that our perception of reality—and therefore the way we think, feel, and behave—changes based on what we believe. As we begin to challenge and overcome the false “truths” we accepted as children, we grow progressively freer.

**The following are the three stages we’ll explore:**

  * **Stage 1: The Mirage of “The Real World,”** in which we take what we see at face value
  * **Stage 2: The Seed of Doubt,** during which we challenge our perceptions and beliefs
  * **Stage 3: The Freedom of Control,** in which we grow beyond what our society teaches



### The Three Stages of Toltec Enlightenment

Enlightenment is a simple concept that’s easy to understand logically, but difficult to understand intuitively. It often evades explanation or description for the same reasons the naguals say that language is flawed; it’s a felt, lived experience. Many cultures and philosophies discuss the concept, however, and agree that an enlightened person has found freedom through understanding some fundamental truth. Until we “get it,” it’s hard to achieve lasting happiness.

To the Toltec, enlightenment is achieved primarily by discarding the set of beliefs that lead us to judge ourselves and others, returning to a state in which we’re content to live and let live. Each of us, they say, inhabits one of the three following stages—or perceptions—of reality. Most of us inhabit the first stage, but those who seek enlightenment—the third stage—must first progress through the second. Let’s look at each stage in detail below.

#### 1\. The Mirage of “The Real World”

Most of us, the naguals say, aren’t critical of what we perceive and learn. **We trust what our culture, society, and teachers tell us, innocently and without reservation.** We believe that what we’re seeing is all there is—we think we live in “the real world” and never realize that it’s only a mirage. This is the most common way to live, the naguals say. We’re handed a flawed belief system, and we accept it as-is.

(Shortform note: The authors suggest that this blind acceptance is almost universal. In _A New Earth_ , spiritualist Eckhart Tolle agrees that, historically, only exceptional religious figures (such as the Buddha, Lao Tzu, and Jesus Christ) have learned to see past the mirage. However, Tolle also suggests that it’s becoming more and more common for people to see the flaws in our societal belief systems—potentially leading to what Tolle calls a “transformation of human consciousness.”)

Living in the mirage is torture, the Toltec say, because our belief in its reality leaves us no escape—we take the picture we’re handed of what the “correct” way to live is and hold ourselves to it. We copy the behaviors, beliefs, and emotions we believe to be “right,” burying our true selves under so many layers of conformity that we forget who we are or what we want. Furthermore, we live in fear that others will see us living “incorrectly” and punish us for it—and we validate that fear by attacking those around us who misbehave.

(Shortform note: Eckhart Tolle argues that the mirage doesn’t just harm us as individuals: It’s also actively destroying our social and physical environments. The values we’re taught to hold, he argues, are insane to the point of self-destruction: Society’s obsession with productivity and profit leads us to abuse and slaughter our own people and jeopardize the livability of our planet. If we want to survive, he says, we must collectively evolve beyond the materialistic values that are driving us apart. Instead, we must put _people_ first.)

According to the Toltec, our belief in the mirage contains two primary flaws. First, we believe we’re imperfect. Second, we believe we’re separate individuals. These two beliefs, the Toltec say, lie at the root of our suffering. Let’s look at each belief in detail.

##### We Believe We’re Imperfect

According to the authors, much of our unhappiness arises from the false belief that we must always be improving ourselves: that it’s wrong to believe we’re good enough as we are.

(Shortform note: In the _Tao Te Ching_ , Lao Tzu takes a bold stance on this kind of self-evaluation: He argues that there is no “good” or “bad” in the first place—no “enough” or “not enough.” All that exists comes from the same source—it’s all part of the Tao, the universe, God, or whatever you prefer to call it—so it’s all equally valid and doesn’t need constant improvement.)

**When you live in the mirage of “the real world,” the Toltec say, you struggle with self-criticism and self-doubt because you think they’re your fault.** You’re focused on the many ways in which you fail to live up to the standard of expectations set by your culture—the ways in which you’re “good” and “bad.” You feel you have much to be ashamed or embarrassed about: Perhaps you didn’t get married early enough, your career isn’t as successful as it “should” be, or you don’t own a house. Whatever your hangups, you’re stuck in the gap between what you _should_ be and what you are. **You’re focused, primarily, on what you _aren’t_.**

(Shortform note: The experience of the mirage that the Toltec describe here is deeply emotional; fraught with shame and embarrassment. The Toltec present these as very real feelings you may struggle with—but, according to the _Bhagavad Gita_ , emotions don’t reflect concrete reality either: They, too, are only subjective interpretations of our circumstances, colored by our beliefs. Most of us don’t realize that, the _Gita_ explains, so we get stuck in a loop of reacting to our feelings, suffering from the result, and reacting again. The good news, though, is that _knowing_ our feelings aren’t an accurate reflection of reality is often enough to help us take them less seriously—which allows us, as the _Gita_ recommends, to look past them at what’s _really_ going on.)

**Further, the authors say, when we’re unsatisfied, we assume it’s because there’s something wrong with us or someone around us,** rather than with the expectations we’ve agreed to subject ourselves to. As a result, we project, into the world, all the cultural and societal messages that are hurting us. Perhaps we mock others for being fat, or homeless, or unsuccessful. Or we blame those around us for our own struggles, failures, and unhappiness.

(Shortform note: In other words, when we suffer, we look for someone to blame—but according to the Buddha, suffering is a universal fact of life. According to him, all that exists has both desires and fears—every creature has resources to acquire and dangers to avoid, and that’s nobody’s fault. Fear and desire serve a necessary purpose; they’re neither inherently good nor bad, and experiencing them isn’t a sign that there’s something wrong with you.)

##### We Believe We’re Separate Individuals

The second flaw that our belief in the mirage causes, according to the Toltec, is that we fundamentally misunderstand our place in the world: We think of ourselves as individual, physical beings, and deny that we’re part of a greater system. We identify with our “personal” bodies, thoughts, and emotions. The truth, according to the Toltec, is none of those things: You aren’t your body _or_ your mind; you’re the force of intent that moves it. That force moves every living thing—plants, animals, even bacteria. In humans, the authors explain, it’s the source of your love and your desire for connection with others. That connection, and the exchange of love which facilitates it, is our shared purpose.

(Shortform note: The Toltec aren’t the only ones who say it’s unhealthy to think of ourselves as individuals. In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach translates the words of Buddha, who said that our suffering arises from the belief that we, as “individuals,” are separate from the world around us. According to him, there _is_ no “self;” instead, we’re part of a universal presence of awareness and love. Lao Tzu, in his _Tao Te Ching_ , essentially agrees: All that exists, he says, is part of the Tao—the universe, “reality,” or source of all things, and to make distinctions is therefore pointless.)

#### 2\. The Seed of Doubt

**To reclaim our freedom, the Toltec say, we must replace judgment with acceptance.** In other words, we must stop demanding everyone be “better” and just love them as they are. To love _ourselves_ as we are, and experience the world as it is. In short, the second stage of Toltec enlightenment involves learning to accept what’s already here instead of focusing on how flawed it all is.

During the second stage, the naguals explain, we become aware of the ways our beliefs harm us and begin to disconnect from the mirage. We begin to doubt that the mirage is truly “the real world,” and awaken to the many small ways in which the beliefs we grew up with manifest as harm. We make adjustments to the way we respond to, think about, and see ourselves, others, and the world. We start to see what’s actually here, instead of what’s _not_ here.

It won’t be easy; we’re struggling to shift to a perspective that’s almost the antithesis of what we’ve been taught. We’ll have to resist the impulse to judge others for “missing the point,” or to hold ourselves to new rules. If we keep at it, though, the naguals say we’ll be rewarded with emotional stability, self-love, and the ability to be present, engaged, and alive in every moment.

(Shortform note: In _A New Earth, _Eckhart Tolle explains that this process of awakening is irreversible—once you _start_ to doubt, he says, you never return to a total, blind acceptance of the mirage. Whether you manage the “full” awakening or not, you’ll gain some degree of permanent freedom simply through your awareness that the status quo is wrong: You’ll naturally stop holding yourself and others to rules you know aren’t as set in stone as you once thought.)

The fundamental truth the naguals are driving at boils down to this: You are not broken, or wrong. You don’t need to change to matter. Things don’t have to make sense, or be right, or be good. There are no rules to living “correctly” because there isn’t a “correct” way to live. All you’re required to do is exist, live, and experience the journey. All other requirements, obligations, and expectations are a distraction, a social construct, or a mirage.

As such, the Toltec say: Stop punishing and abusing yourself—be whoever you are _today_ , and let bygones be bygones. Forgive yourself; nobody else can give you permission to enjoy the time you have left. Finally, believe in yourself—in your capacity to know what you like and don’t like, want and don’t want. No belief is more important.

##### Shortform Commentary: What Does Acceptance Mean?

Other philosophies drive at this core principle—accepting things as they are—from different directions, but come to remarkably similar conclusions. For example, the _Tao Te Ching_ is very direct. It tells us that the workings of the universe aren’t truly comprehensible or explainable and that **we don’t have to know, label, or understand anything in order to experience it** —or even to enjoy it. In fact, it’s often best _not_ to stress about the whys and hows because what’s happening will happen anyway. What is, _is_ , and that’s okay.

Like the Toltec, other philosophies also recommend showing yourself this same acceptance. For example, the _Bhagavad Gita_ suggests that in order to find ourselves, we must discard every outside influence: Our search for peace and righteousness, our selfish desires, and our indulgence in sloth and despair. It’s the false “reality” created by our senses that gives rise to those things, not the true self at our core. **To be yourself, discard everything you think you’re _supposed_ to be and just focus on being what you already are.**

Similarly, the Buddha’s prescription is to combine awareness with compassion, and mindfulness with tenderness. In other words, **don’t punish yourself for living, or worry about how “well” you’re doing it; just _live_. **When you hurt, yearn, or enjoy, Buddha explains, _notice_ that and respond with acceptance and compassion. Don’t judge, evaluate, or compare; it’s natural to suffer, to want things, and to enjoy yourself. None of that is wrong; those are equally valuable pieces of your experience.

In the same vein, Zen master Seng-tsan said that to be free is to live without worrying about imperfection. **Imperfection is a natural aspect of all that exists, so just accept yourself and others without judgment.** We are what we are, and that’s okay, too. _Becoming_ perfect is as unnecessary as it is impossible; you don’t need perfection to experience joy.

#### 3\. The Freedom of Control

The final stage in the Toltec path is a form of what’s often called “enlightenment.” Let’s take a look at what enlightenment looks like for the Toltec:

**The naguals say that the best stage of your life begins as soon as you completely stop judging.** When you can allow yourself and others to simply exist, you lose the need to find yourself, to try to be someone else, or to “fix” yourself. Your personal story no longer describes a struggle against yourself, others, or the world—instead, it becomes a record of your existence, of the message you carry from the universe, to the universe. In short, because you’re no longer actively making yourself unhappy, **you regain the childish freedom of being what you are without burden, expectation, or demand.**

(Shortform note: Like the Ruizes, the _Tao Te Ching_ says enlightenment is about living in the here and now, following the natural pull of your moment-to-moment experience. It’s about being at peace with the reality you live in—without expectations, self-consciousness, or attempts to control the actions of others. Similarly, the _Bhagavad Gita_ explains that an enlightened person is content to exist in every moment, believing that their purpose is simply to be a part of this world. In short, there aren’t any rules; you’re free to simply experience the moments you get to experience.)

##### What to Do When You’re Enlightened

In doubting and re-examining our beliefs about reality, as the naguals recommend, we reclaim the power to decide for ourselves what we “should” be, how we’ll behave, what we care about, and why. You may still feel that you should dress nicely for work, but instead of that belief being an unthinking obligation, it’ll be a decision you make—and you’ll have your own reasons to back it up. This is a major component of the freedom of control—it’s the power to shape your own reality. You’ll never again be forced to do something just because you think you’re supposed to. It’ll be genuinely up to you.

Once you’ve reached this point, you’ve eliminated the influences—both external and internal—that drove your unhappiness. Most of us want more than that, though: We want to be happy. How do we do that? According to the Toltec, happiness is found through connection and service. When you find your peace and no longer feel driven to fix, acquire, and win, the naguals suggest it’s natural to discover desires to give, share, and experience cooperatively.

> **Living an Enlightened Life**
> 
> Other than connecting with and serving others, what should you do with your newfound freedom? The Ruizes don’t say, but Taoist philosophy provides recommendations on how to spend the time you’re no longer wasting on trying to live up to expectations.
> 
> For example, the _Tao Te Ching_ suggests embodying “the supreme virtue,” putting aside all personal perspectives or biases and making decisions based upon the flow and call of the universe only. Remember that in the Tao, there is no good, evil, right, or wrong—only what _is_. When you embody the supreme virtue, you help someone up after they fall simply because you feel like it—it doesn’t matter who they are or what you think; just that you feel drawn to act. To the Tao, that’s the best reason to do _anything_.
> 
> In both Toltec and Taoist philosophy, what you do when you’ve found your freedom is up to you.**** For the rest of your life, you only have to do exactly what you want to do.
