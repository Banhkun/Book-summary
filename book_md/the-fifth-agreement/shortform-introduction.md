## Shortform Introduction

In _The Fifth Agreement_ , don Miguel Ruiz and don Jose Ruiz describe five “agreements” to make with yourself that adjust the way you see the world and your place in it. According to the authors, these agreements speak to the hearts of all people—everyone who’s learned a language, participated in a culture, and grown up around other people. They’re a series of intuitively common-sense principles we are all aware of, but which few of us actually practice. Those who have mastered the five agreements, the authors say, completely accept themselves as they are, and accept everyone else as _they_ are, and the result is eternal happiness.

### About the Authors

(Note: In the guide, we’ll often refer to the authors, don Miguel Ruiz and don Jose Ruiz, as “the naguals.” Naguals, sometimes referred to as dreamers, masters, or scholars, act as a conduit between the spirit and the world, and pass on the teachings of the Toltec—whom the Ruizes say were the intellectual and cultural predecessors of the Aztec. To them, a Toltec is an artist of the spirit: a master storyteller who paints his own reality.)

don Miguel Ruiz is a Mexican author and Toltec nagual whose works focus on personal authenticity and freedom. He’s published multiple international bestsellers, including _The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love, The Voice of Knowledge, _and _The Circle of Fire, _under the banner of “The Toltec Wisdom Series.” He also appears on talk shows, podcasts, and YouTube, and he’s considered a “national treasure” in his home country.

In his younger years, Ruiz graduated from medical school in Mexico City and became a practicing neurosurgeon in Tijuana before changing the trajectory of his life after a near-fatal car crash. He describes the accident as an enlightening revelation, saying that he rediscovered the truth of life—that we are not our physical body, that the gift we’re given is life itself, and that our only mission is to enjoy that life. Following his recovery, he left medicine to study under his mother, following her nagual teachings and coming to a deep understanding of the physical universe and the virtual reality of the mind. As a result, he says, he has “an attitude of love.”

### The Book’s Publication

_The Fifth Agreement_ was published by Amber-Allen Publishing, Inc. in 2010 as an expanded sequel to _The Four Agreements_ (1997). It contains the entirety of _The Four Agreements_ as well as a new fifth agreement, several chapters discussing the stages of the progressive journey toward personal freedom, and a new afterword.

_The Four Agreements_ was published as part of don Miguel Ruiz’s Toltec Wisdom series; it sold over 10 million copies in the US and was a New York Times bestseller for over a decade.

don Miguel Ruiz’s other books in the Toltec Wisdom series explore the same underlying philosophy in more depth, each with a different focus. His foundational theme, which he describes in most detail in _The Voice of Knowledge_ , revolves around the conflict—in our world and within ourselves—between truth and lies. Everything we learn that teaches us to believe we’re not enough, to self-hate and self-criticize, is a lie, he says; to be happy, we must reject those lies and return to the truth of being what we are. It’s a simple concept, and he uses it to explain our struggles in many areas.

In _The Voice of Knowledge_ , he includes the four agreements as a means of challenging self-criticism. The goal of following the agreements, he says here, is to return to the childish freedom of existing without thought, of just feeling what we feel and experiencing what we experience. This is, essentially, enlightenment.

In _The Mastery of Love,_ Ruiz focuses on the lies we learn about love. He explains that our false beliefs lead us to seek—or just accept—controlling, abusive relationships. We actually deserve real, unconditional connections, Ruiz says, but—as he notes in _The Fifth Agreement_ —we can’t have what we _really_ deserve until we stop chasing what we’re taught to _think_ we deserve.

don Jose Ruiz takes a similar tack in his own work; the foundational principles of truth vs lies and reality vs dream remain core to his philosophy. don Jose explores these principles from the perspective of shamanism. In _Wisdom of the Shamans_ , he explains that each of us is a part of a greater whole. In the same way an oak tree relies on the existence of the earth, water, and sun to be what it is, so are we reliant on the world we’re part of—remove any major aspect of that world, and we become unable to exist as we are.

To him, each of us is connected to a universal force—this is a common philosophical idea; some call that universal force life, light, God, unity, or the Tao, while others are content to call it “the universe.” Regardless of the name you choose for it, Ruiz says, a shaman is one who has awoken to that connection and is therefore able to engage with his world on his own terms. His books, _The Wisdom of the Shamans, The Medicine Bag,_ and _Shamanic Power Animals,_ teach the reader how to find and make use of that connection.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

don Miguel Ruiz and his son claim a direct lineage to the Toltec of old, and—as naguals—credit their knowledge, teachings, and spirituality to the Toltec.

In some cases, historians refer to the Toltec as a Mesoamerican legend; a semi-mythical culture revered—and perhaps invented by—the Aztec. In other cases, experts describe the Toltec as the warrior culture from which the worship of Quetzalcoatl originated, and from whom the Aztec inherited the alleged practice of human sacrifice. Overall, historians appear to disagree on whether the Toltec were an imperial power, a small-time kingdom, or something else entirely.

In their work, the Ruizes describe the Toltec as a group of scientists and artists who came together to study and conserve the spiritual practices and knowledge of their predecessors. Perhaps corroborating this claim, in the language of the Nahua, one of the indigenous peoples of Mexico, Toltec means artist, artisan, or wise man.

Either way, most of the information we have about the Toltec comes from Aztec and post-colonial texts and oral traditions. Given the worship-like esteem the Aztec held for the Toltec, historians express uncertainty regarding the reliability of Aztec information about them. What we _can_ be sure of is that the Toltec were masters of sculpture and architecture, as their buildings and sculptures are the only first-hand evidence that remains of the culture.

#### Intellectual Context

The ideas put forth in _The Fifth Agreement_ , and _The Four Agreements_ before it, can be found—albeit described differently—in various philosophies and religions.

The book’s core principle, that the world we perceive is a subjective construct that distracts us from what’s really “true,” is shared by Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, and Christian texts, among others. In Western philosophy, the same idea is expressed by René Descartes, who arrived at his famous claim “I think, therefore I am” in the process of eliminating from his personal belief system anything that could be doubted—including the world his senses showed him.

The Ruizes extend this core principle by noting that not only do humans perceive a different world than really exists, but each human also perceives this world differently. This idea is similarly foundational to the discipline of phenomenological psychology, which notes that a person’s lived experience can be dramatically altered by changes in their mindset, their emotional state, or their physical body. A person whose leg was recently amputated, for example, will perceive, experience, and navigate a room very differently from a person whose legs are both sound; their “reality” is fundamentally different.

Further, psychology notes that our subjective perception of the world and the events of our lives can be altered willingly—we assign meaning and value to what we see according to our personal belief system, and those beliefs can be altered or discarded. The process of examining and adjusting our beliefs—about ourselves, others, and the world—enables successful therapeutic interventions for illnesses like depression and anxiety by allowing us to determine our own benchmarks for success, happiness, and freedom.

The five “agreements” presented by the Ruizes constitute their approach to adjusting our perception of—and reaction to—our world to maximize our freedom to determine how we feel. The Ruizes call this state of total freedom and effortless control “the dream of the third attention.” This final state is essentially what other philosophies refer to as “enlightenment.”

In the sphere of enlightenment philosophy, _The Fifth Agreement_ is unique in that it presents a five-step plan to attaining enlightenment. It’s uncommon that enlightenment—a state that’s difficult to describe in words, let alone teach another person to feel—is boiled down to such a straightforward process. We’ll delve into the connection between _The Five Agreements_ and various interpretations of enlightenment later in the guide.

#### The Book’s Impact

_The Fifth Agreement_ encompasses most of the information in _The Four Agreements_ , which has been hugely influential. _The Four Agreements_ has been a _New York Times_ bestseller for over a decade and spent over two years on _Publisher’s Weekly_ ’s bestseller list, selling over 10 million copies in the US alone. It has been translated into 46 languages.

The book’s cultural impact is evident in the fact that Oprah Winfrey promoted it multiple times—in her magazine and tv show in 2001, and again twelve years later on her show Super Soul Sunday.

The agreements are still widely discussed on the internet today, in forums and articles on psychology, philosophy, wellness, and spirituality. Their ubiquity is also visible in the attention their authors have enjoyed. For example, don Miguel Ruiz received a US Air Force challenge coin. Furthermore, he still hosts talk shows and podcasts about his philosophy years after the books’ publication.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

It’s difficult to address the critical reception of _The Fifth Agreement_ without acknowledging the impact of its predecessor, _The Four Agreements_. The first book was wildly popular, and while the second has enjoyed some success since it was published, it has much to measure up to. Further, since _The Fifth Agreement_ contains the entirety of _The Four Agreements_ , praise and criticism for one is often applied to the other.

A criticism solely leveled at _The Fifth Agreement_ is that the authors wrote it primarily as a cash grab. Critics argue that _The Four Agreements_ was well-written, helpful, and generally beloved, and that _The Fifth Agreement_ retreads the same ground without adding much of consequence.

Otherwise, criticism for _The Fifth Agreement_ follows the same trend as that of _The Four Agreements_. Critics of both books claim that the “agreements,” if followed without proper thought, can be actively harmful. Blindly following a principle like “don’t take anything personally,” these critics say, can be interpreted as permission to ignore all external criticism or discard self-awareness.

Those who dislike the books also describe the foundational principle as “mystical nonsense,” say that the books are too long-winded, or claim that the actionable steps—the “agreements”—are too simplistic to take seriously.

Those who praise the books, however, describe the life-changing effects of beginning to doubt the “truth” of societal expectations, shame, and excessive self-criticism. Many reviewers highlight the freedom and relief that can come with understanding _why_ life is what you make of it, and many claim _The Four Agreements_ is a book everyone should read. Often, the ideas in the book are praised _because_ they’re simple; the underlying logic may be too much for some readers, but the actionables can be put into practice regardless.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The state of mind the authors of _The Fifth Agreement_ want their readers to embody is a felt experience rather than one describable in words. As such, they often lead the reader to an intuitive understanding of the principles by describing relevant anecdotes or trains of thought that evoke an emotionally tangible “lived experience” for the reader, rather than by stating their conclusions outright.

For example, in one section, the reader is asked to imagine sitting in a theater and watching the movie of their life. They see their parents, friends, and acquaintances, and all the familiar formative events centered around them as the main character. After a time, the reader is led to watch the movie of their mother’s life and discovers how differently she’s interpreted the same events. They notice that she sees _everything_ , including them, very differently than they do. Events that felt significant to them are only sidenotes in their mother’s story, and vice-versa—thus, the reader is guided to the realization that “everyone lives in a different reality.”

This meandering approach can be rewarding if the reader is open to being led to the principles indirectly, but it can equally be frustrating for those who prefer a more direct style.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

The book is split into two main parts. The first part centers around the power of symbology and belief: We’re surrounded by implied meanings, values, and expectations, the authors say, and our freedom is determined by how strongly we believe in those symbols. This part also contains the first four of the titular “agreements.” They’re each a means of adjusting our beliefs and assumptions to better enable us to be happy and free.

The second part centers on the power of doubt. Doubt, the authors say, is the tool we use to challenge our societal, cultural, and personal expectations and beliefs about ourselves, others, and the world we live in. The authors explore the titular fifth “agreement” here: Doubt the words others use to convey their true message and that message becomes easier to see. They follow this agreement with a description of three stages of “dream”—or perspectives on life—that we progress through on our road to the Toltec equivalent of enlightenment.

The five “agreements” presented in the book don’t each have their own chapter; rather, they’re often presented as mid-chapter “conclusions” to a train of thought. As such, it can be difficult to flip through the book and find, say, the third “agreement” and its rationale.

### Our Approach in This Guide

We open by exploring the foundational principle—that reality is subjective—in Part 1.1, and follow that in Part 1.2 with a discussion of the nature of and path to enlightenment. In Part 2, we discuss the five “agreements,” which are the adjustments the authors recommend we make in pursuing our personal freedom—or, the Toltec road to enlightenment.

In this guide, instead of presenting the discussion of “the three stages of dream”—the evolution of awareness that leads to enlightenment—at the end of the work, we discuss this topic much earlier. Discussing the journey through the “dreams” early provides helpful context for the ultimate purpose of the five “steps” to happiness and freedom, or five “agreements.” Relatedly, we’ve extracted the principles of the agreements from the book’s anecdotes and tangents to aid clarity and highlight the logical flow that underpins those principles.

Our commentary—particularly in Part 1.2, where we discuss the Toltec path to enlightenment—connects the Ruizes’ ideas to other enlightenment philosophies, particularly from Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism. The Toltec interpretation shares many similarities with these other philosophies but explains the core principles quite differently.
