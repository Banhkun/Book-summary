## Chapter 4: The Floodgates Open

Although Weinstein was delighted by NBC’s utter capitulation, he was keenly aware that Farrow’s reporting still existed and could be dusted off and revived at any time by future reporters. He was determined to make sure that all evidence of the story was destroyed root-and-branch.

Accordingly, **litigation counsel for the Weinstein Company sent a letter to CAA (the agency representing Farrow), making several extraordinary demands**. Among other things, the letter demanded that Farrow hand over all his notes and recordings to NBC, that he surrender the names and contact information of any other news outlets he might be working with, and that he provide written assurance that the reporting had been terminated. The letter also threatened him with a multi-million dollar lawsuit should he publish _anything_ about the Weinstein Company or its employees.

Legal counsel at _The New Yorker_ thought the letter was ridiculous and its legal arguments thin, at best. They were blown away by the sheer audacity of many of the claims it made and urged Farrow to plow ahead with his reporting. So, with the magazine backing him up, he continued to plug away at the story.

### New Revelations

**In September, Farrow made contact with actress Mira Sorvino. Like McGowan, she had been a rising film star in the 1990s, only to see her career suddenly and curiously derailed**. Her history with Weinstein explained why.

In 1995, while she was in Toronto promoting a film distributed by Weinstein, Sorvino found herself alone in a hotel room with Weinstein. He made a move on her, massaging her shoulders and chasing her around the room trying to kiss her. On another occasion a few weeks later, he suddenly showed up at her New York apartment in the middle of the night. He only backed off when Sorvino told him that her boyfriend was on his way. She knew that her career had paid a hefty price for rejecting him—her part in the smash hit _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy was later snatched away after Miramax placed a call to the director, telling him that Sorvino was difficult to work with.

Shortly after contacting Sorvino, Farrow got in touch with the actress Rosanna Arquette. She told him that in the early 1990s, Weinstein had summoned her up to his suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel. When she arrived, he was wearing nothing but a bathrobe and insisted that she give him a massage. When she refused, he violently grabbed her hand and placed it toward his exposed and erect penis. Terrified, she ran out of the room and told Weinstein, “I’ll never be that girl.” **It fit the pattern of the other Weinstein assaults: an ostensible business meeting, a sudden change of venue to an upstairs hotel suite, request for a massage, and sexual assault.**

Farrow then spoke to Italian actress Asia Argento. She shared that, in 1997, the head of Miramax Italy had brokered what she thought was going to be a professional meeting with Weinstein. She didn’t know that “head of Miramax Italy” really meant “pimp” in Weinstein’s world. The meeting was no meeting at all, but instead, a liaison with Weinstein at his hotel room.

When Argento got to the room, Weinstein demanded a massage from her, to which she reluctantly agreed. **He then pulled her skirt up and forcibly performed oral sex on her while she told him to stop** , with the assault only ending when she feigned orgasm. But the sexual abuse continued for years thereafter, as Weinstein exploited the power dynamic between himself (a powerful Hollywood producer) and Argento (an actress who relied on kingpins like Weinstein for acting jobs). She also agreed to go on the record with Farrow.

Argento pointed to yet _another_ woman who had been assaulted by Weinstein, the French actress Emma de Caunes. At the Cannes Film Festival in 2010, Weinstein convinced de Caunes to accompany him to his hotel room to retrieve a book that he claimed to want to adapt into a film starring her. When they arrived, he went into the bathroom and left the door open while he took a shower. He then emerged, naked and erect. De Caunes fled, petrified and outraged.

One final source who came to Farrow was a marketing consultant named Lucia Evans, who had met Weinstein in 2004 at a Manhattan club. He lured her to his offices with promises of casting her on _Project Runway,_ a show he helped produce. **At the office, he sexually assaulted her, taking his penis out, pushing her head down, and forcing her to perform oral sex on him**. Evans noted to Farrow that the whole ordeal had a routine and streamlined quality to it, as though he’d done it countless times before.

One former employee who’d documented Weinstein’s pattern of verbal, emotional, and sexual abuse put it succinctly, declaring, “I am a 28-year-old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64-year-old world-famous man and this is his company. **The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”**

### A Potential Scoop?

By early fall 2017, Farrow had also become aware that the _New York Times_ was also working on a story about Weinstein. After all the work he’d put in, there was now a real danger that his story would be scooped by another outlet. Two respected investigative reporters, Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, were on the case for the _Times_ and had been in contact with some of the same sources as Farrow.

Although Farrow was happy that the story now seemed certain to go public (and that the _Times_ would draw some of the backlash from Weinstein), he did not want to see his own efforts go to waste. In late September, Farrow learned that Twohey and Kantor had filed their report and that it was set to go online. The race was now on at _The New Yorker_ to finalize _their_ story and get it out as soon as possible. The team at the magazine began fact-checking and drafting the piece at a furious pace, pulling gruelling hours as they checked and re-checked every source.

Weinstein’s legal team (including the “feminist” attorney and onetime Farrow confidante Lisa Bloom) now directed its threats at _The New Yorker_. **In a letter to the magazine, the attorneys derided its reporting as “defamatory,” demanded that _The New Yorker_ refrain from publishing the story**, and further ordered that they hand over to the Weinstein Company all statements that Farrow had collected from the company’s employees. They were, essentially, demanding that _The New Yorker_ betray its sources and open up employees at the Weinstein Company to retaliation.

**The letter further went on to impugn Farrow _himself_ , arguing that he harbored personal animus toward Weinstein over the latter’s relationship with Woody Allen** (to whom Weinstein had placed a personal phone call, asking Allen to provide dirt on his own son). Even _more_ ludicrously, the letter claimed that Farrow could not be trusted to report on matters of sexual abuse because Farrow’s maternal uncle had been convicted of sexually abusing two boys. They argued that, because Farrow had not publicly denounced this member of his family, he was not credible as a journalist.

The letter was making astounding claims: that any negative reporting on Weinstein constituted defamation and that any reporting that used NDAs as a source was illegal. The team at _The New Yorker_ was aghast at the tone and over-the-top legal threats contained in this communication from Weinstein’s counsel. **David Remnick told Farrow, “This is the most disgusting letter I’ve ever gotten about a story.”** He further made it clear that the magazine would legally defend Farrow against any actions taken by Weinstein.

### The _Times_ Shoots First

That very same afternoon, the rival _Times_ piece, “Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades,” went live. Farrow and the team at _The New Yorker_ were relieved. While the _Times_ article went into detail about unwanted advances on Weinstein’s part towards women throughout his career (including an account from actress Ashley Judd in which she called out Weinstein by name) it was far short of what Farrow had uncovered. **There were no allegations of rape or assault. The _Times_ had let Weinstein off relatively easy.**

(Shortform note: Kantor and Twohey have since released their own memoir of their experience in breaking the Weinstein story, called _She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement._ Twohey, Kantor, and Farrow ultimately shared a Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on Weinstein.)

The story was weak enough that Lisa Bloom, now showing her true colors as a public and full-fledged Weinstein defender, was able to spin it away with a canned statement characterizing the allegations as, at worst, mild indiscretions. In her statement, Bloom wrote that Weinstein was an “old dinosaur learning new ways,” whose inappropriate actions stemmed more from his innocent misunderstanding of changing social and workplace norms than from any underlying predatory intent. **According to Bloom, it was all an innocent misunderstanding.**

Although the _Times_ story was hardly as powerful as it might have been, it was enough to get CBS News and ABC News to cover the Weinstein scandal on their evening news programs that night. Among the major television networks, there was only one that didn’t cover Weinstein that first evening—NBC. Even NBC’s _Saturday Night Live,_ which had eagerly done material on the abuse allegations against Donald Trump and Bill Cosby, had nothing to say about Weinstein.

But to Farrow, the point was clear. The _Times_ had taken the first shot—and missed. It was all systems go for his story _._
