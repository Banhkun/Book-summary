## Chapter 1: Rumors

### Shortform Introduction

_Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies and a Conspiracy to Catch Predators_ is primarily about journalist Ronan Farrow’s year-long journey to expose the story of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein’s decades of sexual abuse. As such, it is part journalistic account, part spy thriller, part detective story.

But the book touches on other figures and storylines as well, such as:

  * the sexual harassment and abuse scandals of Donald Trump, including both the Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels stories, an entire subplot involving a pair of Eastern European spies hired by Weinstein’s private espionage firm to track Farrow, and the crisis of conscience that leads one of these men to reveal the workings of this operation to Farrow
  * Dozens of conversations with sources, including celebrities, PR agents, and film executives that hint at Weinstein’s crimes



While these details are rich and make for a compelling read, to create a concise and coherent summary, we focused our narrative on the main action of the book—the pursuit of the Weinstein story and the Hollywood mogul’s attempts to sabotage Farrow’s reporting. We’re confident that this summary will enjoy the benefits of a thorough exploration of the major themes, plot developments, and key figures.

This summary contains descriptions of violent **acts of rape and sexual assault**. Such material may be traumatic or upsetting for some readers.

### A Story Shelved

On Sunday, October 9, 2016, NBC News reporter Ronan Farrow and his producer, Rich McHugh, were working on a story about campus sexual assault for the _Today_ show. It was a hard-hitting, well-researched piece, which made it all the more surprising when word came down from the leadership of the network that the piece would _not_ air—in its place, _Today_ would show a segment about Adderall addiction.

Why the sudden turnabout? Why would NBCUniversal (the parent company of NBC News) decide to shelve a solid piece of reporting by one of the network’s rising stars? The answer had to do with _another_ bombshell piece of news that had set off a media frenzy two days earlier, and NBC’s own complicity in it. The network’s reaction was a sign of things to come, as Farrow and McHugh would encounter the same pattern of **stonewalling and hedging from their bosses as the duo worked to uncover one of the biggest scandals ever to rock the media and entertainment world.**

### “When You’re a Star, They Let You Do It”

On October 7, 2016, the Friday before Farrow and McHugh were told their campus sexual assault piece wouldn’t air, the _Washington Post_ broke the story that Donald Trump, businessman, television star, and current Republican nominee for President of the United States, had been caught on video back in 2015 bragging about committing sexual assault. The audio captured Trump’s now-infamous boast about how he committed sexual offenses against women with impunity, “Grab[bing] them by the pussy” and claiming,**** “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.”**** The story dominated headlines and even prompted calls from some Republican Party officials for Trump to step off the ticket.

**Yet NBC’s coverage of the incident was strangely muted.** Why? Because Trump, at the time of the video recording, had been an NBC employee, as the host of the popular reality television contest show _The Apprentice_. To make matters _worse_ , Billy Bush, a current NBC host, was seen on the video laughing at and encouraging Trump’s comments, piping in with, “Yes! The Donald has scored!” To make matters worse _still_ , Billy Bush was being promoted as a new _Today_ host in the fall of 2016. Questions immediately arose about NBC’s prior knowledge of the Trump video: how long had they known about it and did they deliberately cover it up?

_This_ was why the network spiked Farrow’s reporting. NBC didn’t want a story about sexual assault airing during the same news cycle in which one of its hosts was apologizing for cheering on sexual violence with another former network star and now-presidential candidate. **As Farrow would discover, however, covering up stories of sexual misconduct was part of NBC’s standard operating procedure.**

The fallout from the Trump video sparked an immediate national conversation about sexual violence toward women in particular. How frequently was it happening? Why aren’t more assaults reported to the authorities? And how many women were survivors? One voice emerged the loudest from this conversation: actress and activist Rose McGowan. In a tweet, McGowan alleged that she had been raped by a Hollywood studio head and that it was an “open secret” in the film industry. Who was she referring to and why had this person been able to operate with impunity if so many people knew about his predatory behavior?

### Harvey Weinstein

**As the news broke later, McGowan’s rapist was Harvey Weinstein, a major Hollywood power broker.** Weinstein and his brother, Bob, had founded Miramax, which distributed major films including _Sex, Lies, and Videotape_(1989); _Pulp Fiction_(1994); _The English Patient_(1996); and _The King’s Speech_(2011). A leading figure of the indie movie scene of the 1990s and a producer of some of the biggest films of the 2000s and 2010s, Weinstein was a Hollywood titan and one of the most-thanked figures in the history of the Academy Awards—coming second only to God.

But there was a dark side to Harvey Weinstein. He was known for his abusive style as a boss,**** frequently subjecting subordinates to rage-filled tirades which featured him throwing objects against the walls and even at people. To work for Weinstein in any capacity was to be emotionally abused and even physically threatened on a near-daily basis. But people who aspired to succeed in the film industry nevertheless jumped at the opportunity to work for him, knowing that he wielded the power to make their careers—or end them if they dared cross him.

Around the time of McGowan’s cryptic tweet, rumors about sexual impropriety of some kind or another had also been swirling around Weinstein for years. Yet nothing ever seemed to come of them—there was never any big exposé or TV news story about Weinstein’s alleged pattern of behavior. Rumors would briefly fly, perhaps generate a few articles in minor publications, and then be quickly flushed out of the news cycle before any major media outlet looked deeper into them. Why was Weinstein so curiously immune from negative coverage?

### The National Enquirer

Part of the answer lay in an alliance that Weinstein had forged with the publishers of the _National Enquirer,_ a tabloid paper with dubious journalistic standards, best known for salacious, lurid, and borderline-slanderous cover stories involving Hollywood celebrities. But the magazine and its parent company, American Media, Inc. (AMI), were also known for protecting powerful men like Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein from negative press. They did this by blackmailing and threatening people (chiefly women) who accused such men of misconduct.

For decades, AMI had been protecting Trump by acquiring the legal rights to the stories of former mistresses or employees who had accused him of sexual impropriety or marital infidelity. The media company got these women to sign away their rights to ever publicly discuss the accusations against Trump, in exchange for hush money.

**Such agreements would be finalized in a contract known as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).** Women who signed NDAs would be threatened with financially punitive legal action if they ever breathed a word of their story to anyone or even acknowledged the _existence_ of the agreement. AMI would then bury the stories in their vaults. If the accusers were reluctant to sign, AMI would threaten to humiliate them in the pages of the _National Enquirer_ by running negative stories about them. **In the journalistic world, the practice was known as “catch and kill.”**

Of course, AMI and its CEO, David Pecker, weren’t merely doing this out of personal loyalty to Trump (although Pecker and Trump did share a personal friendship). The “catch and kill” operations gave the company enormous leverage over a powerful figure like Trump, because there was always the implicit threat that AMI _could_ run these stories if they wanted to. And this leverage became immeasurably more valuable to AMI on November 8, 2016, when Donald Trump was elected to the presidency. Pecker’s relationship with Trump provided real material benefits. In 2017, the Trump White House, using a French businessman as an intermediary, brokered a business meeting between Pecker and the Saudi crown prince.

But Donald Trump wasn’t the only figure on whose behalf AMI was working. AMI was performing the _same_ services for Weinstein that it had for Trump, forging a close working relationship between the tabloid empire and the Hollywood mogul. When McGowan’s claim began to get some traction and prompted speculation about the identity of her rapist, AMI went into full attack mode as part of a preemptive defense of Weinstein, with the editor-in-chief of the _Enquirer_ declaring to his staff, **“I want dirt on that bitch.”**

### The Dark Side of Hollywood

During 2016, Farrow had been working on a series of news segments called _The Dark Side of Hollywood_ , which were meant to air on the _Today_ show. This was meant to be a wide-ranging exploration of Hollywood scandals, covering everything from racial bias in casting decisions to rigged campaigns for the Academy Awards. It wasn’t intended to be specifically about sexual harassment. But in January 2017, Noah Oppenheim, producer for _Today_ and soon to be the president of NBCNews (and, thus, Farrow’s boss) suggested that Farrow talk to Rose McGowan about her allegation, believing that there might be a potential bombshell story behind her tweet (Oppenheim did not know that Harvey Weinstein was McGowan’s rapist at this time).

Farrow was intrigued by the idea of doing investigative reporting into the widely alleged show business practice of the “casting couch,” wherein aspiring female stars perform sexual favors for producers and directors, in exchange for being cast in films and TV shows. The McGowan accusation seemed like a good angle to approach this story, so Farrow dove in.

But as Farrow began outreach to sources, he found that **he was having trouble getting people to go on record about the things they’d seen, heard, and experienced** —although Weinstein’s name kept popping up in these conversations. Farrow got the sense that potential sources were either being intimidated against speaking out or were choosing to keep silent out of fear for their careers or their reputations.

### Rose McGowan

That changed when he made contact with McGowan in February 2017. In their phone call, the actress was direct, pointed, and specific in naming Harvey Weinstein as the man who had sexually assaulted her. In a subsequent meeting with Farrow, McGowan detailed exactly what transpired between her and Weinstein.

During the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, McGowan had a meeting with Weinstein that had initially been scheduled at a restaurant. In what Farrow would later learn was his _modus operandi_ for committing sexual assault,**the location of the meeting was abruptly changed from the restaurant to Weinstein’s hotel suite**. It was at this meeting (which McGowan quickly realized was _not_ a professional meeting at all) that Weinstein raped her.

Disturbingly, when McGowan shared her story with a criminal attorney, she was told that she was not a credible accuser because she had done sex scenes in her film work. McGowan was advised not to press charges. This attorney instead brokered a deal with Weinstein whereby **the actress was paid $100,000 in exchange for signing an NDA which forbade her to talk about her ordeal and which prohibited her from ever suing him.** If she were to speak about her experience and violate this NDA, McGowan would open herself up to a financially ruinous breach of contract lawsuit from Weinstein.

(Shortform note: In the wake of the Weinstein scandal and other #MeToo scandals in which abusers used NDAs to silence their victims, several jurisdictions are seeking to curtail the practice. As of 2019, in New York, NDAs are only legal if they come at the request of the victim; in September 2018, California governor Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that prohibits nondisclosure provisions in cases involving sexual assault.)

Like the ruse he used to lure McGowan into his hotel room, the under-the-table payment and gag order was a tried-and-true Weinstein tactic, a standard part of his decades of sexual predation.

After sharing her story with Farrow, however, McGowan was still unsure about going on camera to name him—she had tried to go public with this story before, she claimed, but the media had refused to take her claims seriously. She also knew that Weinstein had the power to retaliate. In fact, she believed that he already _had_ retaliated against her, using his vast influence to derail her once-promising acting career and blackball her from mainstream Hollywood productions. Farrow also knew that NBC’s legal team would have to vet the story and give final approval before it went to air, as **McGowan would be violating her NDA by naming Weinstein on camera.**

But McGowan was willing to consider taking that chance. Why? Because she was talking to Ronan Farrow. And Ronan Farrow had his own unique history that made him someone whom McGowan felt she could finally trust with her story. He could report on a story about sexual assault because he had _lived_ one.

### A Family History

Ronan Farrow is the son of famed Hollywood couple Woody Allen and Mia Farrow. Woody Allen’s daughter (Ronan Farrow’s sister) Dylan had accused their father of molesting her in 1992, when she was seven years old. By the time he began speaking to McGowan, Ronan Farrow had long been estranged from Allen, largely out of solidarity with his sister, whose claims against their father he fully believed.

About a year before Farrow’s call with McGowan, the _Hollywood Reporter_ had published a profile on his father, celebrating his career as a director and actor, while hardly mentioning the extremely troubling and highly credible accusations of sexual abuse levelled against him by his daughter. In response, Farrow employed his journalistic skills to bring the charges against his father fully into the light, combing through court records and any other documentation he could find. He had also interviewed Dylan herself about her experiences.

The final product of this work was a guest column published in the very same _Hollywood Reporter_ in May 2016, in which Farrow characterized his sister’s accusation as the kind of credible allegation of sexual abuse that often goes unreported in major entertainment industry trade publications. He detailed the specific nature of Allen’s abuse of his sister, as well as the director’s attempts to disrupt the investigation in the early 1990s through the use of private investigators whom he hired to dig up dirt on law enforcement officers assigned to the case.

_This_ was the world from which Ronan Farrow had come and the set of experiences he had lived. And it’s what made him a uniquely credible party to whom McGowan and other survivors of sexual assault could reveal their own stories.

### A Pattern of Predation

Farrow’s investigative journalism wound on. He spoke to a man named David Rice, who had worked for Weinstein as vice president of marketing for Miramax in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Rice told Farrow that the company had set aside a pool of hush money that was to be used to pay off women to prevent them from going public with their accusations against Weinstein. Rice also attested that he had personally witnessed Weinstein inappropriately touching women throughout his time at Miramax and knew that Weinstein had engaged in retaliatory actions against women he had abused. He said **this was standard behavior on Weinstein’s part, and that knowledge of it was widespread throughout the company and the broader film industry.**

A producer who had worked with Weinstein, named Dede Nickerson, admitted to Farrow that she had signed an NDA which forbade her from going public with what she had seen, but she labelled Weinstein as a serial predator who was unable to stop himself. Moreover, she claimed that the Weinstein Company had people on the company payroll with nominal jobs, but whose _real_ functions were to act as pimps for their boss. **Complicity in his abuse was deeply embedded in the corporate culture**. Farrow uncovered more and more of these accounts as he spoke to more people who had worked with Weinstein or knew those who had.
