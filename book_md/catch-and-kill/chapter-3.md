## Chapter 3: Assembling the Pieces

While Farrow was fighting an uphill battle to get his story heard at his own network, he dutifully continued on, gathering more stories from women who had survived assaults from Weinstein. The stories had the same elements in common—promises from Weinstein to advance their careers and make them into stars; a “meeting” scheduled; the time and location of the “meeting” being changed at the last minute from a day meeting in a hotel lobby to a night meeting in a hotel suite; and the violent assault that would follow when he lured his victims into his private room. **The common threads running through each of these stories lent credibility to all of them. It was clearly a pattern of practiced, rehearsed predation.**

Weinstein was brazen in his conduct, with his predation an open secret. Many employees were complicit in Weinstein’s crimes, helping him procure victims and arranging his liaisons with them, knowing full well what their boss’ intentions were. **The abuse was systematic and routine—trusted assistants were even made to keep track of all the women Weinstein had assaulted.**

Farrow was getting valuable information from Ken Auletta, an older journalist who had come close to breaking the Weinstein sexual abuse story for _The New Yorker_ in 2002. At the time, Auletta had uncovered some leads on Weinstein’s history as a sexual predator, but had never gotten enough people willing to go on record for him to be able to publish the story. But Auletta believed what he’d heard about Weinstein to be true and wanted Farrow to finish what he had started 15 years before. It was through Auletta that Farrow made contact with a British woman named Zelda Perkins, who had worked as an assistant for Weinstein in London in the late 1990s.

### Zelda Perkins

Perkins told Farrow that Weinstein’s problematic behavior was clear from the start. She said that **Weinstein would often appear naked around her and would try to pull her into bed when he summoned her for meetings at his hotel.** Perkins was also wracked with guilt over her own complicity in Weinstein’s crimes, claiming that she enabled his abuse of _other_ women by acting as a “honeypot”—luring women into her boss’ private quarters for liaisons which she _knew_ would result in non-consensual sexual contact.

In 1998, Perkins hired an assistant of her own. She warned the female applicants about Weinstein’s behavior and even rejected candidates that she deemed to be too attractive, in the hopes of minimizing the likelihood of abuse. She ultimately hired Rowena Chiu, a young graduate from the University of Oxford.

In September 1998, a tearful and shaken **Chiu told Perkins that Weinstein had attempted to rape her in his hotel room at the Hotel Excelsior in Venice.** Believing her employee, Perkins immediately confronted Weinstein, who furiously denied any wrongdoing. Outraged, Perkins and Chiu resigned from Miramax and notified their now-former employers that they would be pursuing legal action against Weinstein and the company.

The London-based attorneys hired by the two women, however, strongly advised their clients against bringing the matter to court and instead urged them to reach a settlement out of court. In the end, Perkins and Chiu agreed to accept a payment of £250,000, split between the two (“blood money,” as Perkins later characterized it) in exchange for signing an NDA which forbade the two from ever going public with their experiences.

### Ally Canosa

Once again defying the orders of his bosses at NBC, Farrow flew out to Los Angeles in spring 2017 to interview Ally Canosa, **a woman who had worked for Weinstein since 2010 and claimed that she had been repeatedly sexually abused by him since then.**

While working as an event planner and aspiring to become a producer, she met Weinstein during an event she had planned for his distribution company. He handed her his business card and insisted they meet. Although she found him “creepy,” she eventually relented and agreed to meet at a hotel, ostensibly to discuss planning another event. As with other Weinstein assaults, the location of the meeting was suddenly changed to his hotel suite. He tried to initiate sex with her there, but she refused and left. Still unwilling to reject him outright (out of fear for her career) she met him for dinner shortly after. Outside the restaurant, Weinstein grabbed her by the arm, pressed her against the railing, and kissed her against her will.

He apologized and told her that he wanted to help her in her fledgling career as a producer. Still dazzled by the idea of making it in Hollywood, she agreed to come work for Weinstein. It would be a fateful decision. One night when she was in his hotel room (to which she had been frequently summoned) he advanced on her. When she initially rebuffed him, he became aggressive and menacing, telling her, “Don’t be a fucking idiot.” **He then pushed her onto the bed and raped her.**

The abuse became regular, with Weinstein reacting furiously if she ever denied his sexual demands. His assistants were fully knowledgeable and complicit in his abuse of her, frequently bombarding her with texts declaring, “Harvey wants to see you.”

Although intimidated and fearful of retaliation, Canosa was determined to see justice done and to stand, as she said, “on the right side of history,” someone who _didn’t_ stay silent and helped to stop a serial predator. **She agreed to go on camera for the interview. Another domino had fallen for Harvey Weinstein.**

### Farrow Goes to _The New Yorker_

After Oppenheim had ordered Farrow and Rich McHugh to cease all contact with sources and potential sources, the story was effectively killed at NBC. But Farrow refused to let it die. So many women had risked so much to share their experiences. This _had_ to come out. If NBC wasn’t going to run with it, Farrow needed to take it somewhere that would. In summer 2017, his mentor throughout the Weinstein story, journalist Ken Auletta (who had nearly cracked the Weinstein case himself back in 2002), brokered a meeting between Farrow and David Remnick of the print magazine _The New Yorker._

Remnick was floored when he was presented with the mass of evidence Farrow had against Weinstein: **allegations from five women about multiple acts of sexual harassment and abuse, the Gutierrez recording, and corroboration from 16 current and former executives and assistants.**

He was even more astounded and outraged to learn that NBC was refusing to air the story or let Farrow speak to more sources. Remnick told Farrow that if NBC was unwilling to air the story, _The New Yorker_ would. He told Farrow to continue his reporting and keep the magazine fully apprised of any new developments. When Farrow warned _New Yorker_ senior editor Deirdre Foley-Mendelssohn about the potential legal risks of the story, he received the affirmation that he never got from his bosses at NBC: “I don’t know the specific legal risks here. But I don’t think you should cancel things. And you never stop reporting.”

The team at the magazine subjected Farrow’s story to a thorough grilling and fact-checking. Unlike NBC, they believed in the story and wanted to run with it, but they needed to make sure the facts were in order before they faced the inevitable legal retaliation from Weinstein.

### Farrow Fired at NBC

By this time, NBC was dismayed and angry at Farrow’s refusal to comply with the order to cease reporting. Little did Farrow know that members of Weinstein’s legal team had already been in touch with Susan Weiner, general counsel for NBCUniversal. Weiner had assured Weinstein’s team that the story was dead once and for all and that Farrow was no longer with NBC News. In September 2017, Farrow sat down for a meeting with Oppenheim, where his boss told him that there was no longer room in the budget for him. **It was official: Farrow had been fired.**

Even more distressingly, Weiner threatened that NBC would publicly disclose that Farrow’s contract had been terminated with the network. This, of course, would damage his credibility with past and future sources while he worked on the story for _The New Yorker_. Not only was NBC killing his story, they were trying to indirectly damage it at _other_ news outlets as well. **In their threats, NBC had taken a page directly out of the Harvey Weinstein playbook.**

Meanwhile, Weinstein was ecstatic over the news. Employees later claimed that he paraded around his offices, jubilantly and triumphantly declaring that, “I got them to kill this fucking story!”
