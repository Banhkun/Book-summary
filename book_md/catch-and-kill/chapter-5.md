## Chapter 5: Fallout

As the draft took shape in late September and early October, there were ongoing disputes among members of the editorial staff at _The New Yorker_. Some argued that to use the word “rape” would be taking the description of Weinstein’s behavior too far, but in the end, the word stayed in—to do otherwise would have been to sanitize or whitewash the gravity of his crimes.

**There was one final piece that was needed before the story could be finalized: a response statement from the Weinstein Company**. On October 5, Farrow called them for comment. To his astonishment, the front desk assistant put Farrow through to Weinstein himself. Weinstein was wildly emotional on the phone, combatively and furiously ranting at Farrow that there was nothing to any of the allegations, and mocking and sneering at him for having been fired by NBC.

In subsequent, clarifying conversations with Farrow, Weinstein changed his tone. Although he would still threaten to sue Farrow and destroy his reputation, he would also be alternately charming, funny, even conciliatory. Farrow got the sense that Weinstein felt trapped, that he _knew_ the battle was lost and was only trying to contain the damage. He also inadvertently let slip key information that Farrow _hadn’t_ uncovered, like when he tried to explain away a sexual abuse allegation that the original reporting had missed. When these incidents happened, Weinstein’s handlers would desperately hang up the phone, claiming that they’d lost the connection.

At one point, **Weinstein expressed his belief that a sexual encounter couldn’t be rape if the woman had consensual sex with him on subsequent occasions**. This was wildly at odds with the true nature of how sexual abuse works, especially when it happens in the context of a workplace and a boss/subordinate relationship. The victim will often feel the need to submit to the abuse, or else face job termination or career sabotage.

In the end, Weinstein and his team went with a blanket denial of all “non-consensual sex.” He didn’t deny outright that he’d had sexual encounters with women who had worked for him, but he asserted instead that these liaisons had been fully consensual.

### The Story Hits

**On October 10, 2017, Ronan Farrow’s piece,“From Aggressive Overtures to Sexual Assault: Harvey Weinstein’s Accusers Tell Their Stories,” appeared in _The New Yorker_**. It proved to be a bombshell: within hours of the story going live, Farrow had texts and emails from countless strangers, sharing their own stories of sexual abuse at the hands of figures in government, media, business, and law. Farrow had broken open the dam on an ugly aspect of American life that extended to the highest levels of power.

**After the publication of the piece, the actress Anabella Sciorra reached out to Farrow to share her _own_ story of abuse by Weinstein**. She told him that, one night in the early 1990s, he had barged into her hotel room, shoved her onto the bed, pinned her down, and violently raped her. This pattern of abuse continued for years. Like McGowan and Sorvino, Sciorra was certain that Weinstein had worked behind the scenes to sabotage her once-prominent career in the years following the assault.

Overnight, Farrow went from being the guy who NBC unceremoniously tossed out to the journalist _everyone_ wanted to book on their show—including his former employers at NBC. At the same time, the network was petrified at the idea of the public becoming aware of their own complicity in covering up the Weinstein story. After all, the publication of such a groundbreaking piece in _The New Yorker_ by someone who had so recently been under contract with NBC raised the question, “Why didn’t NBC run with this?”

Pretty soon, media personalities like Jake Tapper and Rachel Maddow were asking the same question. NBC’s public explanation was that, at the time Farrow was working on the story for them, it hadn’t been fully fleshed out and did not meet their journalistic standards to go live. This was, of course, patently absurd. Farrow had on-the-record statements from dozens of Weinstein employees as well as victims, not to mention the Gutierrez recording—all of which he had shown to Noah Oppenheim and Andy Lack.

On an appearance on Maddow’s show, Farrow revealed the truth: that the Weinstein story _had_ been reportable by the time he brought it to NBC and that the network had buried it for other reasons. **He had not only exposed the truth about Weinstein, he had exposed his own network’s lies in their efforts to cover it up.**

### Black Cube Exposed

After the Weinstein story broke, Farrow also became aware of just how deep and extensive the surveillance effort against him and his sources had been. He began receiving cryptic emails from a burner email account called “Sleeper1973” (a winking reference to the 1973 Woody Allen film _Sleeper_). This source was actually a female Black Cube operative who was morally outraged by the work her firm had done to help Weinstein smear his accusers.

She revealed to Farrow the terms of the contract Weinstein had signed with the Israeli private investigative firm. **Black Cube had put its army of analysts, social media engineers, and double agents to work on behalf of Harvey Weinstein.** The full range of Black Cube’s activities made it clear that the company flouted international privacy and data laws.

Sleeper1973 revealed the true identities of the double agents, like Diana Filip, who had targeted and infiltrated key Farrow sources, like Rose McGowan. Filip, who told McGowan she worked for a financial institution called Reuben Capital Partners, was actually a hired Black Cube double agent. Her real name was Stella Penn Pechanac, and she’d grown up in war-torn Bosnia during the Balkan conflict of the 1990s. After failing to make it as an actress, Pechanac was drawn to the world of espionage because it allowed her to dress up and assume a fake identity—as close to her dream of acting as she was going to get.

Beyond Black Cube, Weinstein had, in fact, hired multiple private investigative and surveillance agencies to harass and collect information on his accusers. After the story broke, these firms began leaking to Farrow about each other’s espionage activities, in an attempt to deflect public outcry onto their competitors. The leaks showed the extent of information Weinstein had on his victims: photos of himself and his accusers together in public _after_ the alleged assaults (which, he believed, would disprove the notion that he had assaulted them); psychological dossiers on the women, including McGowan; and files on the sexual histories of his victims. This was all material that Weinstein believed he could use to smear and blackmail his accusers.

The Black Cube exposé itself led to another _New Yorker piece for Farrow_ , in which he detailed how enmeshed Weinstein was in the shadowy world of private surveillance. **Never before had the public see the extent to which wealthy private individuals could intimidate and surveil journalists.**

The Weinstein smear campaign extended beyond the world of international spies to include good old-fashioned muckraking tabloid journalism, courtesy of his allies at the _National Enquirer_ (whose parent company, AMl, had been doing “catch and kill” operations for years on behalf of Weinstein and Donald Trump). **After Farrow’s _New Yorker_ piece came out, the editor-in-chief of the _Enquirer_ publicly vowed to his staff that he would “get” Farrow. **

For a brief period in late 2017 and early 2018, Farrow was the scandal rag’s public enemy #1, with the _Enquirer_ running cover stories about the journalist’s estranged uncle who’d been convicted of sex crimes—which, while true, had nothing to do with Farrow (it was also one of the absurd “discrediting” claims made against Farrow in the infamous letter from Weinstein’s counsel to _The New Yorker_). The _Enquirer_ even surveilled Farrow’s fiancee, the former Obama and Hillary Clinton speechwriter Jon Lovett, in an effort to find dirt on the couple, although the contractor hired by the _Enquirer_ ultimately gave up the effort upon discovering that Farrow and Lovett’s personal life was too mundane to provide adequate fodder for scandal.

### The Walls Close in on Weinstein

**After the Farrow and _New York Times_ stories came out in fall 2017, the board of the Weinstein Company fired Weinstein and the company slid into bankruptcy.**

But worse was to come for Weinstein. Dozens of women who hadn’t been identified in the two journalistic investigations came forward with their own stories of abuse. Eventually the number grew to 80. He wasn’t merely a boss with a poor understanding of workplace boundaries, as Lisa Bloom’s PR statement had tried to portray him. **The weight of the testimony suggested that Weinstein was, in fact, a serial predator and rapist.**

Eventually, the NYPD Cold Case Squad contacted Lucia Evans, the marketing consultant who had been assaulted by Weinstein in 2004. They told her that if she filed a complaint, she could help initiate a criminal investigation into the now-disgraced Hollywood producer, one that might send him to prison. Although Evans was fully aware of how harrowing it would be to serve as a witness in a rape trial, she chose to file the complaint. On May 25, 2018, Weinstein was booked in New York on charges of rape and a criminal sex act, being led to the police precinct in handcuffs. In addition, authorities in Los Angeles and London started building cases and he was facing an avalanche of civil claims against him.

(Shortform note: On February 24, 2020, a New York jury found Weinstein guilty of criminal sexual assault in the first degree and rape in the third degree. He was, however, acquitted on the more serious charges of predatory sexual assault and rape in the first degree. On March 11, 2020, Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison for his two felony convictions. In his statement to the court, Weinstein expressed remorse for his actions, but also portrayed himself as the victim, comparing his situation to that of blacklisted Hollywood celebrities during the McCarthyite Red Scare of the 1950s. He said, “Dealing with the thousands of men and women who are losing due process, I'm worried about this country.”))

### Matt Lauer: The Story Comes Full Circle at NBC

**The Weinstein story set off a cascade of new allegations of sexual misconduct all across the worlds of media, politics, and business.** This was the beginning of the #MeToo movement, with survivors of sexual assault making public their stories of abuse at the hands of powerful men—and of coverups by the companies they ran. NBC would soon have its own reckoning with #MeToo, perhaps shining some light on why the network had been so reluctant to run with Farrow’s story about Weinstein.

In late November 2017, Matt Lauer was promptly and unceremoniously fired from NBC. As one of the co-hosts of _Today_(where Farrow had initially attempted to run the Weinstein piece) and a major public face of the network, the move was a shock. Why were they giving one of their biggest stars the axe?

**The network admitted that an unnamed employee at NBC had accused Lauer of sexual misconduct.** But beyond this admission, the network was furiously spinning its wheels to sanitize the story. According to the party line that NBC began pushing in press releases and public statements, Lauer’s dismissal was about behavior on his part that violated NBC’s terms of employment. Yet they were vague on the specifics of what Lauer had been accused of. The truth about Lauer’s predatory history soon came out, as well as NBC’s complicity in covering it up.

**Lauer had, in fact, cultivated a sexually demeaning and predatory environment at _Today_ for years**. Former female employees came forward with sexually aggressive emails Lauer had sent them, in which he advised them how to dress and told them how sexy they looked in certain outfits. Outtake videos emerged of him telling production assistants (and even his co-host, Meredith Vieira) to “bend over” so he could get a closer view. But this was hardly the worst of Lauer’s misconduct.

A woman named Brooke Nevils came forward to Farrow with her Lauer story. In 2014, Nevils had been working for Meredith Vieira, helping NBC cover the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. She, Lauer, and Vieira got drunk on vodka one evening at the Olympic Village. After Vieira retired to her room, Lauer unexpectedly summoned Nevils to his hotel room, on a loose professional pretext (similar to Weinstein’s _modus operandi_). **Once Nevils arrived, Lauer aggressively kissed her, pushed her onto her stomach, and violently anally raped her.** Afterwards, he warned Nevils not to say anything to Vieira. Lauer’s abuse of Nevils went on for months afterwards, during which he repeatedly propositioned her for and forced her into sex at NBC’s offices.

As the story came out, it was revealed that Nevils and dozens of other women had been reporting Lauer’s behavior to higher-ups at NBC for years. **The network’s response was remarkably similar to that of the Weinstein Company: denials, threats, professional sabotage, and finally, the signing of non-disclosure agreements.** Under the leadership of Oppenheim and Lack, NBC had presided over a toxic culture of abuse and cover-up. Women who came forward with accusations about Lauer were told to either keep quiet or face career sabotage.

Rich McHugh later told Farrow that he suspected the Weinstein Company, through its contacts, knew about Lauer and the toxic culture at NBC. Weinstein knew that he could use this knowledge as blackmail against NBC, to prevent the network from running stories about his _own_ history of sexual assault. **This begins to explain NBC’s refusal to air the Weinstein story. They didn’t want to expose a predator, because they were harboring one of their own.**

### Courage

The story of Weinstein’s decades of abuse can tell us a lot. We can look at it as a negative and dispiriting story, one in which a handful of high-status men—Harvey Weinstein chief among them—used their power, wealth, and influence to commit sexual assaults with impunity over a period of decades. We can also see it as a tale about the corruption of key institutions of American society, like the free press and law enforcement, that are supposed to promote the public good. And indeed, **men like Weinstein, Trump, and Lauer do _not_ operate in a vacuum: they are predators because they operate within a system and a culture which enables their predation.**

But we can also see it as an uplifting story, in which a handful of brave women staged an act of rebellion and defiance against a criminal patriarchy, with the help of a journalist, Ronan Farrow, who wanted to tell their stories. **_Catch and Kill_ is ultimately not a story of exploitation: it is one of courage. **
