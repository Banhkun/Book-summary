## Exercise: Create Multisensory Associations

Experts suggest that incorporating sensory information can enhance memory recall. Let's practice creating multisensory associations to remember information more effectively.

* * *

List the titles of four random movies. (For example, you might list _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ , _Jaws_ , _Star Wars III_ , and _Ratatouille_.)

How would you associate imagery with the first movie on your list? (For example, for _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial_ , you might visualize the iconic flying bicycle silhouette against the moon.)

How would you associate sound or music with the second movie on your list? (For example, for _Jaws_ , you might recall the ominous two-note motif representing the approaching shark.)

How would you associate a physical sensation with the third movie on your list? (For example, for _Star Wars III_ , you might imagine the weight and hum of wielding a lightsaber.)

How would you associate a specific smell with the fourth movie on your list? (For example, for _Ratatouille_ , you might recall the rich aroma of freshly cooked French cuisine.)
