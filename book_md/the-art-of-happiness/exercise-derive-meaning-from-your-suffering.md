## Exercise: Derive Meaning From Your Suffering

Practice the Dalai Lamaâ€™s recommendation to find meaning in suffering.

* * *

Describe an instance in the last two weeks when you suffered. This can be mundane, everyday suffering. (For instance, you might have completed the wrong assignment for a class and received a failing grade on it.)

Reflect on what you learned from this moment of suffering. What new knowledge, however minor, did you gain from the experience? (You might have learned to read the course syllabus more carefully, for instance.)

To solidify your learning, imagine a future situation in which you apply your new knowledge to avoid the suffering you recently encountered. Jot down how you behave or react differently this time. (In the future, when you sit down to complete your assignment, you carefully review the syllabus, for instance.)
