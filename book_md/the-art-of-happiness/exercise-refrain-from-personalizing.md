## Exercise: Refrain From Personalizing

Work to stop taking events in your life personally to free yourself from suffering.

* * *

Think about an instance in the last two weeks when you took something personally. Note the circumstances in as much detail as possible. (Perhaps someone at a party made a rude comment about your outfit.)

Write down how this incident or problem made you feel. What thoughts ran through your head? Were you hurt? Angry? (You might have felt both offended and angry at the person who insulted your outfit).

Now, as much as possible, step outside your own shoes in this situation and look at it critically and analytically to understand how the problem came to be. Consider other causes of the issue or angles you might not have noticed, and write these down. (You might realize that the person who insulted you is going through a divorce and is therefore in a difficult emotional place.)

Finally, write down some ways you can bring empathy or understanding to such problems in the future. Can you practice compassion toward the person or situation that you felt harmed you, and if so, how? (You could be empathetic toward the person who insulted your outfit—it’s unlikely they meant to hurt you.)
