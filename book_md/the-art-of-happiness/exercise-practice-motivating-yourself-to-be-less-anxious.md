## Exercise: Practice Motivating Yourself to Be Less Anxious

Reflect on how you can pivot away from unrealistic expectations and toward realistic, constructive goals to reduce your anxiety.

* * *

Write down a recent occasion when you experienced anxiety. Describe what expectations of yourself you feared you couldn’t meet. (For instance, in a social situation, you feared you wouldn’t be able to make good small talk.)

Think about how, next time you’re in a similar situation, you can pivot away from the need to meet those concrete expectations and toward the goal of being a better person. What alternate, simpler goals could you strive toward? (In a social situation, your goal might be to simply become a better listener.)

Now, put yourself back in this situation and try to re-experience it with the goal of being a better person. How does this feel different from working toward meeting specific expectations? Does it take some of the pressure off? Do you feel you can set this goal for yourself in future situations?
