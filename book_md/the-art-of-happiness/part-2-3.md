## Part 2.3: Cultivating a Happiness Mindset | Step 2: Develop Your Motivation to Change

After educating yourself on how and why you become happy or unhappy, the next step of cultivating a happiness mindset is to **develop your _motivation_ to change your mindset**, advises the Dalai Lama. In this chapter, we’ll cover how to motivate yourself to change your thinking. We’ll then again use the specific negative emotions of anger and anxiety to show what motivating yourself to change those emotions might look like.

### How to Develop Your Motivation

Simply _understanding_ what makes you unhappy can’t alone eradicate unhappiness, claims the Dalai Lama. **You must _desire_ to rid yourself of unhappiness and negative emotions**. Awaken this desire by, for instance, periodically reminding yourself of your learning from Step #1: that negative emotions destroy your happiness, while positive ones reinforce it.

(Shortform note: Cutler and the Dalai Lama tell you to motivate yourself to change but provide only one tool for doing so. Another way to cultivate motivation is to write down the goals you hope to achieve—for instance, to rid yourself of ignorance. Achieving enlightenment is a long and winding path, but by writing down your goals, you help yourself stay on that path.)

According to the Dalai Lama, if you struggle with building your motivation to change, you may need to take better care of your physical body so you’re more capable—for instance by going to fewer parties that leave you tired the next day.

(Shortform note: Countless self-help books echo the recommendation to take better care of yourself to improve. In the classic _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Stephen Covey argues that by adopting seven personal habits, including listening better, taking initiative, and prioritizing efficiently, you become a more effective human—in other words, more able to accomplish your goals.)

#### Anger: Develop Your Motivation to Be Less Angry

According to the Dalai Lama, to be less angry, **develop your motivation to become patient and tolerant—cures for anger and hatred** , as we learned in the last chapter. The greater your motivation to strengthen these positive emotions, the easier it will be to change your mindset.

(Shortform note: The Dalai Lama recommends fostering patience and tolerance but doesn’t elaborate on how to do this. Build patience by, for instance, finishing one task before moving on to the next. Cultivate tolerance by becoming aware of your conditioned beliefs and how those affect your tolerance for other behaviors or beliefs.)

#### Anxiety: Develop Your Motivation to Be Less Anxious

The Dalai Lama recommends not developing a motivation to be less anxious, but rather to **_pivot_ your motivation toward being a kinder person**. Here’s why: Anxiety often arises when you feel you can’t meet expectations. If, instead of worrying about expectations, you develop the motivation to just be the most compassionate person you can be, then, says the Dalai Lama, no matter whether you meet expectations, you’ll feel good because your intentions were good.

> **The Noble Eightfold Path**
> 
> The Dalai Lama recommends focusing your motivational energy on simply being a compassionate person, rather than meeting specific expectations. This corresponds to the “Right Effort” step of the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism. In this step, you work to eliminate negative feelings and cultivate positive ones.
> 
> As discussed earlier, the Noble Eightfold Path is the last of the Four Noble Truths: the path toward ending suffering. By pursuing the Noble Eightfold Path, you eliminate suffering. The eight parts of the path are:
> 
>   * Right Action
> 
>   * Right Speech
> 
>   * Right Livelihood
> 
>   * Right Mindfulness
> 
>   * Right Effort
> 
>   * Right Concentration
> 
>   * Right View or Understanding
> 
>   * Right Intention or Thought
> 
> 

> 
> These are often represented as a wheel with eight spokes, called the Dharma Wheel. The eight parts of the path are in turn organized into three categories, called The Threefold Way: Ethics, Meditation, and Wisdom.
