## Exercise: Build Your Network of Intimate Connections

Think about how you can increase the number of meaningful relationships in your life, and then take action to do so.

* * *

Reflect on your current relationships. Is a type of connection lacking in your life? Describe an area of life, big or small, in which you’d like more connection with others. (If you’re a teacher but don’t feel close to your fellow teachers, you might want more workplace intimacy, for example.)

Now brainstorm a few people you might reach out to or avenues you might pursue to establish greater connection in this area. (If you want to feel closer to your fellow teachers, note the names of a few teachers you think you’d get along with.)

Finally, set up a concrete plan for building connectivity. Hote how and when you’ll reach out to the people or groups you wrote down in the last step. If helpful, even note how you’ll follow up the first meeting to create a long-term connectivity plan. (If you ask a fellow teacher out for coffee, be sure to schedule a second coffee date not long after.)
