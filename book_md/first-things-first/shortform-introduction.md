## Shortform Introduction

In _First Things First,_ Stephen R. Covey, author of _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,_ presents a time management approach that focuses on priorities, or “first things.” This approach teaches you to use your time effectively, meaning you focus more on prioritizing _what_ you’re spending your time on, rather than _how much time_ you're spending on each task.

**The foundation of Covey’s system is learning to recognize when something that seems pressing isn’t actually important for your long-term goals.** By ignoring these urgent-but-insignificant tasks, you reclaim time and energy that you can put toward your true life goals.

### About the Author

Stephen R. Covey was a world-renowned author, motivational speaker, teacher, and entrepreneur. Although best known for his breakout bestseller _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Covey wrote a number of books about productivity, motivation, and effective leadership. He’s often lauded for his revolutionary approach to self-help, which focuses first on who you are instead of what you do.

Covey received a number of awards and recognitions throughout his life, including being named one of _Time Magazine’s_25 most influential Americans in 1996.

Covey held an MBA degree from Harvard University and a doctorate in religious education from Brigham Young University.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Free Press, which was later acquired by Simon and Schuster.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

_First Things First_ was originally published in 1994, and it was Covey’s second big hit after _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ (1989).

_First Things First_ came out just one year after the World Wide Web became publicly available (1993), and the book proved prescient about the ever-increasing workloads and obligations that we’d face as the world became more interconnected and information-driven.

#### Intellectual Context

_First Things First_ expands on the third of Covey’s _7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , which is to focus on important things over urgent or time-sensitive things.

As Covey explains in the first chapter, _First Things First_ is a pushback against the myriad of time management methods that only focus on how to get as much done as possible. Instead, following in the footsteps of Professor Charles Manz, Covey pushes for a system of “personal leadership” where you **maximize both your productivity and happiness by only doing those tasks that are truly important to you.**

In short, Covey was rebutting the then-current trend of time management by arguing that _what_ you do is more important than _how much_ you do.

#### The Book’s Impact

_First Things First_ was a huge success upon release, eclipsing even the sales of _7 Habits_. Simon and Schuster were quoted as saying that _First Things First_ was the single best-selling time management book ever written.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_First Things First_ received (and continues to receive) largely positive reviews. Fans describe the book as insightful and comprehensive, yet accessible. They also laud Covey for his focus on people and relationships, rather than just on tasks.

Critics of the book argue that Covey’s ideas are simplistic, and that _First Things First_ is an unnecessary dragging-on of what he already explained in _7 Habits_. Others, focusing on Covey’s advice for the workplace, argue that his ideas about employee empowerment and value-driven decisions are only practical for CEOs and high-level executives.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Covey’s focus on personal leadership—on finding and pursuing your own priorities—was, at the time, revolutionary. _First Things First_ identified a major weakness in the current trends of time management: Namely, that most books of the time saw productivity as an end in itself. In other words, Covey firmly and effectively rejected the idea that just _doing more_ is the key to success and happiness, **and instead pushed for a person-focused approach that ensures you’re working toward the right goals.**

However, because Covey was trying to break new ground in several areas with _First Things First_ , his messages and the connections between them aren’t always clear. He begins by talking about past theories of time management and his proposal for a new theory, then shifts to talking about finding meaning in your life, then shifts again to discussing synergy and empowerment in the workplace. The result is a book that’s part leadership guide, part self-help book, and part philosophical text.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Covey divides his book into four sections:

  1. Why you should be concerned with _what_ you do, instead of _how much_ you do
  2. How to find what’s important to you and focus your energy on it
  3. Understanding how your goals tie into each other and into other people’s goals 
  4. How his time management system leads to outer success and inner peace 



The book’s organization is clear and builds on itself logically. The first section explains what we’re doing and the reasoning behind it, then the second section explains how to do it.

The third section may seem out of place at first glance, but understanding how you can pursue multiple goals at once is key to Covey’s system. It’s equally important that you understand how your goals can help other people with theirs, because the reverse is also true: People pursuing their own goals can help you achieve yours.

Finally, the last section explains the point of it all—Covey promises that following this system will lead you to a happy and fulfilling life.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Our commentary provides context for Covey’s ideas by linking to other popular self-help and time management books like _The 4-Hour Workweek _and _Ego Is the Enemy_. We also provide insight into the history and thought processes behind Covey’s system with philosophical and spiritual ideas from books such as Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations_ , or Robin Sharma’s parable _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_.

We’ve also consolidated the content in _First Things First_. Covey tends to repeat his ideas throughout the book in order to reinforce and build upon them; for brevity’s sake, we’ve removed most of that repetition. Finally, since the fourth section of Covey’s book __ is quite short and mainly serves as a conclusion wrapping up his ideas, we’ve relabeled it as such.
