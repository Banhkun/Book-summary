## Part 3.1: Creating Synergy Through Interdependence

Beyond the tools and strategies already discussed in the Zone 2 organizing process, Covey says that one of the most powerful ways you can make the most effective use of your time is through creating synergy—or collaborating—with other people. **Your relationships with other people have a huge influence on how you spend your time and the quality of life you create.**

Traditional time management techniques are based on management and control, which causes you to see other people in a shallow way: They’re either tools to use or interruptions to your schedule. This short-sighted view ignores the potential of creating synergy with others in order to achieve both your and their goals more effectively.

**By contrast, Covey’s fourth-generation approach to time management applies the skills you’ve practiced to create synergy among your roles and goals to your interactions with the people around you.**

> **Collaboration Requires Trust**
> 
> In another of his self-help books, _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , Covey explains that collaborating with other people requires _trust_. He breaks trust down into three levels, and he posits some likely outcomes of each level of trust:
> 
> **Low trust:** People who don’t trust each other will be defensive and suspicious, which will further damage any chance of a working relationship between them. Such people will not be able to collaborate in any meaningful way.
> 
> **Moderate trust:** People with a moderate level of trust will be polite to one another, and willing to work together up to a point. However, they will likely try to avoid confrontation and conflict, which might lead them to _compromise_(create a less effective solution to appease both parties) rather than truly _collaborate_(create a better solution than either one could alone).
> 
> **High trust:** People with a high level of trust will be open and honest with each other. Such people will try to understand each other and build on one another’s ideas. They will be able to collaborate by looking for mutually beneficial solutions to their problems, rather than rushing to a compromise to avoid conflict.

### People’s Lives are Interdependent

**Almost everyone in the world depends on others to fulfill** **their priorities, roles, and essential needs.**

At this point, Covey encourages you to think about your priorities—the most important things in your life. You’ll probably find that most of them relate in some way to other people: For example, a goal of getting promoted at work probably connects with a desire for financial security for your family, or a desire for greater responsibility and respect.

Your roles also depend on others: Your role as a parent, spouse, sibling, child, employee, friend, or community member can only exist in the context of other people. Your goals and accomplishments are similarly interdependent: Although you might work independently to achieve your goal, you’re almost certainly using knowledge or resources that came from the work of other people.

Even fulfilling your own essential needs is interdependent.

  * **Survival** —which encompasses both health and financial security—depends on medical providers to keep you in good health and your job as a source of income. 
  * **Interaction** depends on others by definition. 
  * **Learning** often involves studying the writings and lessons of others, or gaining insights through interactions with other people.
  * **Giving back** is about using your abilities to benefit others.



(Shortform note: Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations_ takes the concept of interdependence even further than Covey does. Aurelius tells us that, not only are all human lives interconnected, but _all_ lives are interconnected: Plants feed animals, who feed other animals, who die and feed the insects in the soil. **We all exist in harmony with each other and because of each other.** Therefore, Covey’s assertion that our lives are interconnected isn’t just a statement about society; it’s a fact of nature.)

### The Interdependence Mindset

**Covey says that individuals _can’t_ live independently of the vast ecology formed by human relationships.** We all depend on each other to live, work, and thrive—and, similarly, the parts of our lives all depend on each other, as we said when discussing essential needs and our roles.

Three principles characterize Covey’s interdependence mindset.

(Shortform note: Not only is modern society founded on interdependence, but it was that very interdependence that made humans the dominant species on the planet. While scientists have observed basic cooperative skills in other animals, widespread cooperation (outside of families or tribes), extreme skill specialization, and division of labor to take advantage of those specializations are all unique to humans.**In short, interdependence doesn’t just mean that we have to rely on each other to live—it also means that we, as a species, are successful _because_ we have to rely on each other.)**

#### Principle #1: Public Behavior Is the Result of Private Behavior

**Covey says that the problems we think of as “public problems,” such as those in organizations and society as a whole, are the result of individual choices.** Many people blame “the system” without acknowledging that the system is created by individuals. Generally, you can trace problems in families, companies, and society back to the principles and choices of individuals. Therefore, these public problems are actually private problems.

For instance, family systems like marriages collapse not because marriage itself is flawed, but because the individuals in the marriage aren’t making principle-centered decisions.

> **Counterpoint: Systemic Problems**
> 
> While it’s true that systems like families and societies are made up of individual people and their choices, Covey underestimates how much those systems are affected by established rules and habits. **Remember: We don’t exist just as individuals, but as an interdependent network of people.**
> 
> To give an extreme example: Gayook Wong, MSW, writes about systemic racism in the US—that is, racism that’s encoded into laws and institutions, rather than the result of individual actions. **While it’s still individuals who carry out systemic racism, oftentimes those people don’t realize that they’re doing so.**
> 
> Wong’s point is that, in many cases, problems are so deeply ingrained in systems that the people who live or work within that system don’t even know it’s there. Wong’s solution is education and awareness: In short, learning what the problems are so that you can avoid them (or fix them, if possible). This solution to systemic problems ties back into Covey’s human gifts of self-awareness and learning.

#### Principle #2: Life Can’t Be Compartmentalized

Covey asserts that **you need to make principle-centered decisions in your private life if you want to be able to make principle-centered decisions in your public life.** You may think that you can keep your private life separate from your public life—but if you’re having personal problems, they’re going to show up in your work. For instance, if you’re continually arguing with your spouse, you’ll come to work tired, short-tempered, and distracted.

> **The Negative Effects of Stress**
> 
> It’s true that our private lives impact our public lives, as Covey says. However, the opposite is also true: Stress from work and other areas of life harms our private relationships too. There are a few reasons for this:
> 
>   * Stress tires you out.
> 
>   * Stress increases your vigilance—in other words, it puts you on the lookout for problems where there might not be any.
> 
>   * Stressed-out people tend to be distracted and unsociable.
> 
>   * Stress harms your mental and physical health.
> 
> 

> 
> **In short, stress—no matter which area of life it comes from—affects _all_ areas of life negatively. **Just like each person is part of the interdependent network of humanity, each of your roles is part of the interdependent network of your life.

#### Principle #3: Trustworthiness Leads to Trust

Trust is essential to effective communication and positive relationships, and therefore essential to public life. But Covey argues that trust starts in the personal sphere of the individual, with trustworthiness. If people aren’t trustworthy, there’s no way to build trust among them, and relationships and systems collapse.

For instance, if your employer speaks negatively to you about another employee, the employer is demonstrating that he can’t be trusted to support his staff in their absence. He’s showing his untrustworthiness. Even if he hasn’t said negative things about _you_ , you can no longer trust him. Therefore, Covey says, **the strength of the social glue of trust depends on the trustworthiness of individuals.**

(Shortform note: Covey writes that the best way to build trust is to have strong values and principles, and demonstrate them to others. In _Start With Why_ , although Simon Sinek says that trust is an instinctive feeling—impossible to rationalize or intentionally develop—he also says that we trust people whom we believe share our values, because we think that they’ll act the way we would want them to act. Furthermore, he says that we _won’t_ trust people who _haven’t_ proven to share our values, like the previous example with the employer bad-mouthing other employees.)

> **A Lesson in Interdependence**
> 
> Covey’s three principles of interdependence have more to do with how you can be reliable and contribute to society, rather than how society can help and support you.
> 
> So, to illustrate the benefits we all receive from being part of a larger society, a YouTube video from the channel How To Make Everything shows how difficult it would be to make a simple chicken sandwich if you had to do everything yourself: It took six months and cost $1,500.
> 
> By contrast—because we live in a society with extreme specialization and division of labor—you can buy that same sandwich at any deli for less than $10, or make it at home using ingredients from the grocery store.)

#### Redefining What’s Important

Covey says that shifting from an independence mindset to an interdependence mindset changes how we approach many different situations. We start asking questions like:

  * Is my goal to get this task done efficiently? Or is my goal to empower my employees to do it?
  * Is my goal to control others? Or is my goal to help them tap into their creative potential?
  * Is my goal to manage conflict? Or is my goal to make communication effective so we avoid conflict in the first place?



(Shortform note: To borrow a tactic from Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations_ , one way of figuring out what’s really important is to approach every task as if it’s the last thing you’ll ever do. Ask yourself: If you were to pass away tomorrow, would what you’re doing right now matter? If the answer is no, then Aurelius says you’re chasing a selfish goal that doesn't give back to the people around you.)

#### Interdependence and the Four Human Gifts

Covey believes that the four human gifts are the keys to shifting to an interdependence mindset:

  1. **Your self-awareness** allows you to be aware of how you impact others. Instead of just thinking in terms of what people can do for you, you also think about what you can do for others.
  2. **Your morality** gives you an awareness of the collective conscience. You find satisfaction in establishing a shared vision with your family or team, and you enjoy working toward that vision together. 
  3. **Your willpower** allows you to form an interdependent will with others. You find opportunities to create win-win solutions, and you hold each other accountable while enacting those solutions.
  4. **Your creativity** contributes to the collective imagination of the group. You find that, together, you can come up with more creative and effective solutions to problems than you could on your own. 



> **Different Ways to Connect With Others**
> 
> Covey believes that the four human gifts, when used correctly, will show you that you’re part of a much larger collective of people and help you contribute to that collective. In _The Righteous Mind_ , social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has a rather different (and more controversial) approach to finding that human connection: nature walks, hallucinogens, and partying.
> 
>   * **Nature walks:** Haidt believes that taking time to observe and appreciate nature will help you feel more connected to the world as a whole.
> 
>   * **Hallucinogens:** Haidt points out that hallucinogenic drugs have been used for thousands of years in indigenous cultures to promote spirituality and sociality. He also notes that scientific studies have shown that people often feel an increased sense of connectedness after trying hallucinogens—and, frequently, decreased depression and anxiety as a result.
> 
>   * **Partying:** Specifically, Haidt talks about raves: All-night parties that feature loud music, dancing, and often drugs. He says that people who attend such raves report feeling “swept up” in the group—their sense of individuality disappears, and they simply become a small part of the collective party.
> 
> 

> 
> However you do it, Covey and Haidt agree that it’s both possible and healthy to move away from a self-centered mindset, and begin seeing yourself as part of a larger group.

### The Myth of Independence

Despite all his talk of interdependence, Covey still acknowledges that independence is important: It allows you to stay true to yourself and act with integrity in difficult situations. **However, focusing too heavily on independence creates a dangerous imbalance in our lives.**

Covey says that this imbalance arises because an independent mindset goes hand-in-hand with a focus on efficiency over effectiveness. People who think they’re supposed to do everything themselves start feeling like there’s not enough time to achieve their dreams and experience all that life has to offer. As a result, they try to accomplish as many things as possible while neglecting their essential needs.

  * **Survival:** Their health suffers because they overwork themselves. They might also eat a lot of unhealthy fast food, or not get enough sleep, both of which have serious negative effects in the long term. 
  * **Interaction:** They feel too pressed for time to develop deep, meaningful relationships. They only see others as means to reach their own goals. 
  * **Learning:** They race to learn only the bare minimum that they need to accomplish their tasks. They focus on narrow skills and quick-fix methods, instead of working with other people and benefiting from their knowledge. 
  * **Giving back:** They might make superficial contributions—donating pocket change to charity, for example—but their efforts lack commitment because they’re thinking about themselves, not about other people. As a result, they don’t feel the deep satisfaction that comes from effectively giving back. 



> **Focus Both on Yourself and on Others**
> 
> Covey’s point here is that, counterintuitively, people who focus only on themselves end up harming themselves in many different ways. Adam Grant’s book _Give and Take _explains why: Caring for yourself vs. caring for others isn’t a zero-sum game. **In other words, focusing more on others doesn’t mean focusing less on yourself.**
> 
> Also, while Covey says that caring for others helps you to take care of yourself, Grant says that the reverse is also true: Caring for yourself helps you more effectively care for others. Selfless givers are self-destructive and impulsive; they give everything they can of themselves to whoever needs it until they burn themselves out. Givers who also look after their own needs are choosier: they give what they can afford to give, to the places where it will have the most impact. Not only is the latter type of giving more sustainable, Grant says that it’s actually more effective.
> 
> **In short, taking care of yourself helps you to care for others, and vice versa—that is the meaning of interdependence.**
