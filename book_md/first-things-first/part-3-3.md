## Part 3.3: Empowering Yourself and Others

To find and implement win-win solutions, everyone needs to have the autonomy to carry out their own roles. However, Covey notes that many employees aren’t empowered to make their own decisions, and they aren’t given the freedom to take initiative on their own projects. This is bad for individuals’ job satisfaction and professional growth, and it’s also bad for the company.

If you’re an employee in an organization that doesn’t trust its employees, with managers who micromanage your work life, you may think there’s nothing you can do to improve the situation. However, Covey says that thought is the actual problem. **Even if you’re not the leader of your group, you can still empower yourself and lead others by focusing on what you _can_ influence, instead of what you can’t.**

In this section, we’ll look at three things you can do to empower yourself and others, regardless of your position within the organization.

> **Help Your Group Improve With a Growth Mindset**
> 
> In her self-help book _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck talks about two different ways of thinking:
> 
>   * **Fixed mindset:** You believe that things simply are what they are, and there’s nothing that anyone can do about it. You believe that people’s abilities and intelligence are innate and unchangeable; similarly, if you have a position without much authority in your group or organization, you think that means there’s no way for you to change things for the better.
> 
>   * **Growth mindset:** You understand that it’s always possible to improve your abilities and your situation.
> 
> 

> 
> Covey doesn’t use the phrase “growth mindset,” but that’s what he means by empowering yourself and others: **Understanding that, no matter what your position in the group is, there are always things you can do to improve the group’s performance and morale.**

### Step #1: Create Empowering Environments

To create an empowering environment, Covey believes that you need four conditions:****

  * Trust
  * Enthusiastic team members 
  * Systems suited to their goals
  * Responsibility 



> **The Fifth Condition: Your Workspace**
> 
> One thing Covey overlooks in creating an empowering environment is the _physical_ environment you’re working in. As Malcolm Gladwell explains in _The Tipping Point_ , our surroundings (what he calls “context”) greatly influence our behavior. For example, consider how you’re likely to dress and act if you’re eating at McDonald’s versus eating at a high-end restaurant—at the fancy restaurant you’ll put more effort into looking nice and minding your manners.
> 
> The same principle applies to work environments. If your office is dirty and cluttered, it sends the message that you don’t really care about what you’re doing and can’t be bothered to put in the effort to keep it clean—your teammates will pick up on that context and put in less effort themselves. **However, if you keep your workspace clean and organized, your teammates will see that you’re putting in effort and will improve their own efforts.**

Let’s look at each of those conditions in more detail.

#### Condition #1: Trust

Covey says that members of a group need to be both trusted and trustworthy for everyone to feel empowered.

**Trustworthiness is the combination of _ability_ and _integrity._**

  * **Ability** includes not only job-specific knowledge and skills, but the ability to see the big picture, alternate between different viewpoints, and work well with others.
  * **Integrity** includes the ability to face problems in a direct but compassionate way, the ability to see a number of different alternative solutions to a problem, and the ability to live according to universal principles.



Covey says that both are necessary: A person who’s honest and kind, but not competent, isn’t trustworthy. Conversely, a person who’s competent but lacks integrity is also not trustworthy.

(Shortform note: While trust between team members is important, trust is a vague concept—if someone said, “I need to know that I can trust you,” would you really know what he meant? That’s why, in _Dare to Lead_ , **Brené Brown suggests talking about trustworthy _behaviors_ instead of trust itself.** For example, if one of your team members tends to overpromise and underdeliver, that’s a specific behavior you can point to as untrustworthy; more importantly, it’s something that your teammate can work on in order to build trust.)

#### Condition #2: Enthusiastic Team Members

**Covey believes that part of feeling empowered is keeping yourself motivated and enthusiastic.** That’s because an environment founded on the first condition (trust) is an environment in which you’re responsible for your own work—you won’t have supervisors hovering to make sure that you’re doing what you’re supposed to. In other words, trust and freedom are empowering, but they also come with responsibility.

If you’re the leader, Covey suggests that you ask yourself questions like: Do I let others do their work their way, or do I try to force my own ways onto them? Do I give people enough space? And, conversely, do I check in with them often enough? In other words, am I striking the right balance between freedom and support to empower and motivate my group members?

If you’re a group member, Covey suggests asking yourself: Do I take initiative, or do I wait for someone to tell me what to do? Do I come up with my own ideas and systems, or do I just go “by the book?” In other words, do I feel empowered and enthusiastic, or am I just doing what other people want me to?

> **Motivation Comes From Action**
> 
> In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson discusses our misconceptions about motivation: He says many people believe that you have to be motivated in order to work on a project, when in reality the motivation _comes from_ working on it. Instead of imagining a straight line from motivation to action, Manson urges us to instead see it as a loop: action leads to motivation, which leads to more action, and so on.
> 
> That’s why Covey’s idea of a group where people are not just allowed, but expected, to take responsibility for their own work can lead to much better results. Those people will start their work because it’s their responsibility to do so, then they’ll discover their personal motivations to keep working on it—as opposed to working just because the supervisor is breathing down their necks.

#### Condition #3: Systems Suited to Goals

**Covey says that when systems don’t align with the purpose they’re supposed to support, no one feels empowered.** For example, if you want your salespeople to work together, but your system rewards the individuals who make the most sales, then your systems don’t support your purpose—instead of working together to get better results, your salespeople will drag down each other and your organization.

Therefore, you should find ways to align your systems with your goals wherever possible. That principle doesn’t just apply to your job: You might find opportunities in your family life, your volunteer work, and even in your hobbies. If you want your children to enjoy family time, but that time is rigidly scheduled and structured so that it feels like a chore, then your systems don’t align with your goals.

In short, Covey recommends asking yourself what systems are keeping you from reaching your goals (whatever goals those are), then ask which of those systems you’re in a position to change or influence. Once you’ve answered those questions, you’ll know where to direct your energy.

> **Example: Ludonarrative Harmony**
> 
> To illustrate what Covey means by matching systems to their goals, we can look at an example from a very different part of life: video games. In game design, matching a game’s systems to its story is called ludonarrative harmony, and it greatly improves the player’s experience.
> 
> For example, the popular game series _Dark Souls_ is about fighting back against hopeless odds in a bleak and uncaring world. The series features weighty, real-time combat; making the wrong move often means you can only watch as your opponent hits you back with a devastating attack. Furthermore, the series is famous for being extremely difficult, with many enemies able to kill your character in just a few hits. The difficulty and vulnerability drive home just how high the odds are stacked against you. They also give you an incredible rush of excitement when you finally manage to win a tough fight.
> 
> If _Dark Souls_ were too easy, or if it were an unsuitable type of game like a visual novel, it would never have achieved the popularity it enjoys today.
> 
> Covey is suggesting that we apply a similar principle to work, family life, or anywhere that you’ve made a group mission statement: **Make sure that you’re matching _what_ your objectives are with _how_ you achieve them.**

#### Condition #4: Accountability

Covey says that accountability requires checking your actions and others’ against the goals and guidelines your group has laid out for itself. **Therefore, it’s crucial to make sure that your group planning includes the specific criteria for determining responsibilities and assessing results.**

As you continually check your decisions, actions, and results against the agreement, you’ll develop a progressively better sense of how you’re doing, and how you can do better.

> **Effective Accountability Through Respect**
> 
> This condition may be challenging because it can be difficult to effectively hold people accountable when something goes wrong. An article from _Psychology Today_ suggests that, first and foremost, you must be respectful.**** Your goal should not be to shame or attack the other person, but to work together in figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it.
> 
> **To that end, the article suggests asking three questions:**
> 
>   * Why did this happen?
> 
>   * What was your thought process? (Again, ask respectfully. This isn’t, “What were you thinking?!” it’s, “How did you arrive at this conclusion?”)
> 
>   * What can we learn from this?
> 
> 

> 
> These three questions help both of you get to the heart of the problem and figure out how to avoid that problem in the future.

### Step #2: Seek Feedback

Another way Covey offers for you to empower yourself and others is to seek out feedback. **In fact, he says that it’s one of the most effective ways to build both your character and competency.** However, it’s also one of the hardest, because it requires humility and vulnerability. You have to recognize that you may not have an objective view of your own abilities, understand and accept how others see you and allow what you hear to influence your actions going forward.

Once you get feedback, review it carefully. Then, return to the person who gave it to you and thank them. Ask them to help you create an action plan to address their feedback.

You can seek feedback at work or at home. For instance, as a CEO, you might find that your employees want you to spend less time managing and working on projects and more time clarifying the vision for the company. As a parent, you can seek feedback from your children—they might surprise you with their maturity and thoughtfulness.

Covey offers a few guidelines to make sure that you’re getting (and giving) effective feedback.****

  * **Feedback should always focus on a person’s performance rather than her character.**
  * Feedback should be specific and based on the criteria established in your shared agreement. 
  * Feedback should come from everyone with a stake in your performance, including other group members, customers, and the larger community.



(Shortform note: In his book _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , leadership consultant Paul Marciano points out that feedback also serves another purpose: encouragement. **In fact, Marciano suggests that feedback be roughly 80% positive reinforcement for what the person is already doing well, and only 20% about how he or she can improve performance.** While Covey is right that it’s important to address problems and opportunities for improvement, he overlooks the fact that purely negative feedback—no matter how respectful—will frustrate and discourage the person you’re trying to help.)

### Step #3: Serve Your Subordinates

**Covey believes that the best leaders are those who serve and empower their subordinates, rather than trying to control them** ; he uses the term “servant leadership.”****

Note that this leadership style is only possible if you have the four conditions for empowerment detailed in Step 1—you can’t let go of control if doing so leads to chaos. However, once you’ve created a high-trust environment, you should spend your time engaging in Zone 2 activities like creating a shared vision, building relationships with your staff, getting feedback, and mentoring others.

**Covey says the crux of serving your subordinates is asking them how you can help, instead of telling them what to do.** Make suggestions and ask questions, rather than giving instructions. This principle applies whether the organization in question is a company, a volunteer group, or a family.

According to Covey, **your goal should be to help others develop the skills and knowledge to take initiative and work independently** , leading to ever-improving results as you empower more and more people. In the long run, this is much more effective than telling people what to do (or doing things for them), where the outcomes will always be limited by your own abilities and motivation.

> **Example:_Turn the Ship Around!_**
> 
> In _Turn the Ship Around!, _Naval captain L. David Marquet __ describes how he turned the worst-performing nuclear submarine in the US Navy into one of the best. **He did so by switching his command style from what he calls leader-follower toleader-leader, which empowers subordinates to do their best work. **Though Maquet called it by a different name, this embodies Covey’s idea of servant leadership**.**
> 
> According to Marquet, most workplaces (including the Navy) operate on a leader-follower model: Leaders give orders and followers carry them out. However, he believes that this is an outdated model designed for large-scale physical labor like mining and farming—in modern workplaces it just leads to unmotivated workers and frustrated managers. Marquet’s solution is the leader-leader style of command, where he expects each person to think and act like a leader, no matter what his position actually is.
> 
> One simple yet effective change Marquet implemented was that, instead of asking for permission or instructions, he expected his sailors to announce what they intended to do. Then their superiors would tell them to proceed, or correct their intentions if necessary. This simple change helped people feel engaged with and responsible for their work.

### Common Obstacles to Empowerment

Covey warns that creating an empowering environment isn’t easy—you could meet resistance from your boss, your coworkers, and the company’s established habits. According to Covey, these are a few of the most common problems:

**Problem:** The boss doesn’t know what a shared responsibility agreement is, or doesn’t want to make one.

**Solution:** Covey suggests working with your boss to create an informal agreement without using the words “shared responsibility.” Ask for a meeting where the two of you can lay out your responsibilities as an employee, and the company’s responsibilities to you (it may help to come prepared with a list of your responsibilities and priorities, and see if your boss agrees with it). That’s step 1 of Covey’s process for creating a shared responsibility agreement. At your next meeting you can tackle step 2, and so on, until you have a shared responsibility agreement in everything but name.

(Shortform note: A boss who isn’t willing to talk over your responsibilities to each other may be described as a laissez-faire boss: someone who doesn’t want to take any responsibility or do any work, and who prefers to simply let the department run itself. It’s important not to mistake this style of leadership for servant leadership—leaving workers to their own devices is not the same thing as empowering them to do their best work.)

**Problem:** The boss doesn’t want to empower his employees. He wants to keep doing things the way he always has.

**Solution:** If you have very little influence at your workplace and little chance for advancement, it might be best to look for a new job. However, Covey says that in most cases you can still work on developing your skills and knowledge, empowering yourself rather than seeking empowerment from your boss. Eventually, the company will recognize you as somebody who can handle more responsibility and be trusted with more authority.

(Shortform note: One problem Covey overlooks here is the fact that, in some workplaces, the problems come from the executive level rather than the supervisory level. Even worse, some companies prefer having powerless employees—their only concern is for short-term profits, and they see their employees as cheap tools to replace whenever necessary. Such companies probably can’t be fixed without a complete overhaul, scrapping long-established policies (and most likely the people behind them) to install new policies that focus on employee satisfaction and empowerment. Unfortunately, that’s not always realistic. **If you find yourself stuck in a toxic job, then as Covey suggests, it’s probably best to get out and look for a healthier workplace.**)

**Problem:** The employees aren’t interested in empowerment.

**Solution:** Meet employees where they are. If they don’t feel comfortable taking on more responsibility or taking initiative, don’t force them.**** However, make it clear that you value their talents and hope that they’ll eventually want to take on more of a leadership role. You can also ease employees into empowerment by declining to solve problems for them. Instead, try asking, “What do you recommend?”

> **Empowerment Starts With Consideration**
> 
> If employees aren’t interested in becoming more empowered, it may be a sign that they’re disinterested or disengaged from their work—in other words, that they’re just coming for the paycheck. In _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ , Marciano says **the cure to disinterested employees is building personal rapport with them,** which begins with showing consideration for them as people, not just as workers.
> 
> Marciano suggests a number of ways to show that type of consideration. A few examples include:
> 
>   * **Pay attention to their physical and mental health.** Let them know if you’re concerned about them, and encourage them to go home if they’re not feeling well.
> 
>   * **Provide “creature comforts” in the office** —for example, make sure your employees have comfortable chairs, and keep snacks available. Let them decorate their workspaces with pictures and knick-knacks from home.
> 
>   * **Keep meetings to a minimum.** Always start on time, and end early if possible. Ask your employees how you could reduce the number of meetings your team needs, or how you could get through those meetings faster.
> 
>   * **Show interest in your employees.** Ask _specific_ questions about them—demonstrate that you’re interested in their lives, and you want to get to know them better.
> 
> 


**Problem:** You don’t trust the people you work with.

**Solution:** This problem has a two-part answer.

  1. **Examine the way you perceive the people you don’t trust.** Covey suggests asking yourself, “Do I believe this person can change?” Assume that the people you work with have good intentions and just need some support to do their best work. 
  2. **Support the people you don’t trust.** Covey also suggests finding ways to foster the development of colleagues or employees. Use the shared responsibility agreement to decide together which expectations are realistic and which resources and professional development opportunities could help improve performance. Also, help people evaluate themselves by asking them how well they feel they’re performing, based on the agreement.



> **The Growth Mindset**
> 
> If you don’t think you can trust your employees or coworkers, you may be stuck in what psychologist Carol Dweck describes as a _fixed mindset._ In her book _Mindset_ , Dweck explains that **a fixed mindset is the false belief that people’s abilities are natural and unchangeable.** For example, if you think your coworker is “bad at his job,” that’s a sign of a fixed mindset—you don’t believe that he can improve.
> 
> Dweck contrasts that fixed mindset with what she terms a **_growth mindset:_ the understanding that people can always learn new skills and improve their abilities.** When Covey says to assume good intentions and support the coworkers you don’t trust, he’s encouraging you to adopt a growth mindset—to believe those coworkers can and will improve, so that you can feel comfortable trusting them.
