## Conclusion: Finding Peace With the First Things First Strategy

Covey believes that when you base your priorities on universal principles and put first things first, you find four different kinds of peace:

  1. The peace that comes from fulfilling your **four essential needs** : survival, connection, learning, and giving back.
  2. The peace that comes from developing your **four human gifts** : awareness, morality, creativity, and willpower.
  3. The peace that comes from **cooperating** with others instead of competing with them.
  4. The peace that comes from **living according to your conscience.**



(Shortform note:**Having clear priorities and knowing how to pursue them can also foster the peace that comes from confidence:** in this case, the confidence that you’ll always know the right thing to do and how to do it. In _The Confidence Code_ , journalists Katty Kay and Claire Shipman explain that confidence (also called self-esteem) boosts your happiness and helps you feel more fulfilled—which is, after all, the end goal of Covey’s system of personal leadership.)

### Obstacles to Peace

There are three roadblocks to peace that Covey says we should be aware of:

  1. Unrealistic expectations
  2. Lack of courage
  3. Pride 



We’ll look at each of them in detail.

> **Another Obstacle: Worry**
> 
> Another thing that can block peace is _worry_ —imagining future events and how you might prevent or respond to them. In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman explains that worrying can sometimes be beneficial—it’s a way of planning ahead—but far too often, people get stuck in obsessive loops where they worry about the same problem over and over.
> 
> Goleman suggests managing anxiety through daily relaxation exercises like deep breathing and meditation. When worry does take hold, fight back by asking yourself questions and forcing yourself to think rationally about the situation.
> 
> A few examples of effective questions include:
> 
>   * What steps can I take now to prevent this problem?
> 
>   * How else could that situation play out?
> 
>   * Is it really helpful to keep repeating these thoughts?
> 
> 


#### Roadblock #1: Unrealistic Expectations

**Covey says unmet expectations are one of the greatest sources of frustration in day-to-day life.** When you have the expectation that you’ll check every task off your to-do list, that you won’t run into difficulties, or that everyone will agree with your ideas,**** unexpected issues or interruptions cause frustration. You see the people around you as problems. Conversely, when you see your daily plan as a roadmap rather than a checklist—as in Covey’s Zone 2 scheduling method—you see problems as opportunities to create better systems and empower others.

**If you want to find peace, you need to mitigate frustration by changing your expectations.** Examine particular frustrations to identify the unrealistic expectations at their source.

If you work with others toward a shared vision and live a principle-centered life, your expectations will become more realistic.

> **Counterpoint: Acceptance vs. Expectation**
> 
> Tara Brach, a practicing psychologist and devout Buddhist, argues that **we have little control over our lives, so we should have no expectations at all**. In her best-selling book _Radical Acceptance_ ,__ she urges us to simply accept each experience as it comes.
> 
> According to Brach, there are two key parts of acceptance:
> 
>   * **Understanding:** In order to accept our experiences, we must first understand what they are. This means recognizing what’s happening to us physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Buddhists call this practice _mindfulness._
> 
>   * **Compassion:** Once we understand what we’re experiencing, the next step is to respond to it with openness and compassion. Instead of trying to control the experience—to make the pain stop, for example, or to heighten pleasant feelings—we simply acknowledge it and allow it to happen.
> 
> 

> 
> Brach believes that keeping a mindset of acceptance, rather than expectation, allows us to fully experience life without being overwhelmed by it.

#### Roadblock #2: Lack of Courage

When you lack courage, you keep doing things the way you’ve always done them, basing decisions on society’s priorities rather than your own, or not basing decisions on priorities at all. On the other hand, courage allows you to listen to your conscience and make decisions based on your principles.

**You can develop courage by achieving your goals, no matter how small** —for instance, your goal could be to get out of bed the first time the alarm goes off. Each time you set a goal and meet it, or keep a promise, you build your confidence. This confidence develops into courage.

> **Just Start Somewhere**
> 
> In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Manson says that when we’re stuck on a problem or afraid to pursue a goal, we can start by just doing something—anything we’re able to do in that moment. For example, if you’ve got a daunting math problem in front of you, start by just reading the question and writing down some numbers. Not only will that start getting you motivated (remember Manson’s action-motivation-action loop), but you’ll either realize that you know how to do it after all, or you’ll figure out exactly where you’re getting stuck.
> 
> By setting an extremely low bar like “write down some numbers,” you can start to overcome your fear of failure—after all, _anyone_ could write down numbers. **Once you achieve that first tiny goal, you’ll find the courage to take the next step, and the next one after that, until you’ve solved the problem.**

#### Roadblock #3: Pride

Pride, in the sense of having too large of an ego, is the biggest hindrance to leading a principle-centered life.

If you have too much pride, you:

  * Spend your time and energy comparing yourself to others.
  * Judge yourself by the number of friends you have and the praise you receive.
  * Value your contributions based on whether you contribute more than others and whether others recognize you for your contributions.
  * Listen to your ego instead of your conscience. 



(Shortform note: As Ryan Holliday points out in _Ego Is the Enemy_ , too much pride can also fill your mind with self-aggrandizing or self-promoting chatter, which blocks you from the peace and quiet you need in order to reflect and improve yourself.)

**Covey says that the antidote to pride is humility.** You can develop your humility by following the steps of the First Things First system to understand your true priorities; you’ll then focus on strengthening your relationships and empowering others, rather than focusing on your own ego.

(Shortform note: It’s important to note that humility doesn’t mean feeling bad about yourself or belittling yourself—rather, it means you understand that you aren’t perfect and have room to grow. An article from _Psychology Today_ says that being humble really means being open to new ideas, and open to the possibility that you may be wrong. That open-mindedness and willingness to learn is what Covey is urging us to develop.)

### Checklist: Characteristics of a Principle-Centered Person

Covey says that if you want to find true peace, you need to be a principle-centered person. He adds that principled-centered people display some or all of the following characteristics:

  * **Spontaneity:** You follow your plan as much as possible, but you see detours as opportunities rather than frustrations.
  * **Growth mindset:** You continually learn from people, books, and experience, and you know that growth comes from humility—from knowing what you don’t know. 
  * **Resilience:** You’ve established paradigms and systems to handle problems calmly and thoughtfully.
  * **Balance:** You work to meet your physical, social, mental, and spiritual needs in a balanced way.
  * **Integrity:** You keep your promises to yourself and others.
  * **Focus on what you can do:** You concentrate on what you can control or improve.
  * **Joy:** You live in the present and appreciate what you have.



> **Be a Principled Person to Be a Principled Leader**
> 
> Throughout the book, Covey emphasizes that being an effective, principled _person_ also helps you become an effective, principled _leader_. Accordingly, several of the criteria he lists above and the concepts he’s previously described align with the characteristics of principled leadership, as defined by the military college The Citadel:
> 
>   * Being authentic (this relates to having integrity and living by your principles)
> 
>   * Building trust with others (trust is key to interdependence)
> 
>   * Empowering others (Covey writes that this is crucial for finding and implementing win-win solutions)
> 
>   * Having courage
> 
>   * Leading with humility (this is part of a growth mindset)
> 
>   * Putting others first (this relates to Covey’s description of servant leadership)
>
