## Part 2.3: Develop a Weekly Plan

A key aspect of effective Zone 2 scheduling is choosing the right time frame for your planning. **Covey suggests planning within the framework of a week; he believes it’s a balanced compromise between daily planning and long-term planning.** A weekly schedule connects a big-picture perspective with day-to-day actionables.

In this section, we’ll explore some of the benefits of weekly planning.

(Shortform note: Life coach Brynn Johnson offers one possible benefit to weekly planning: You can start your Monday feeling calm and in control, instead of anxious about the upcoming week of work or school. With that goal in mind, Johnson suggests using each Sunday to plan for the week ahead.)

(Shortform note: _First Things First_ provides a weekly worksheet that includes space to carry out each of the following steps, but you can use any planner, digital scheduler, or simply a piece of paper to implement the Zone 2 organizing process.)

### Weekly Planning Encourages Balance and Perspective

**Covey believes that a week encompasses a natural balance of life: It includes work or school days, evenings, and weekends.** Therefore, he suggests that you set aside time for a weekly planning session, where you’ll prepare for the week ahead.

Planning through a weekly lens is all about balancing the big picture and the details. Your mission statement provides the “whole,” or the big picture, while the daily and weekly time management addresses the “parts”: your roles and your goals.

If you get too caught up in the whole, you lose focus and can’t take effective action—but if you get lost in the details, you’ll end up spending time on things that don’t serve your mission. Therefore, in order to maintain perspective, Covey recommends that you start with the big picture, zoom in to see the details (your weekly and daily goals), then zoom out again to see how those goals fit into your mission.

> **Use the Parts to Evaluate the Whole**
> 
> In _The 12 Week Year_ , author and CEO Brian P. Moran also pushes for weekly schedules as crucial steps toward larger, long-term goals—in other words, as parts of the whole.
> 
> He adds two elements that Covey doesn’t include to ensure that your weekly plans are effective and carried out properly:
> 
>   * **A weekly meeting** —Set a time each week to meet with people who know your plan—or, better yet, people who are directly involved in it. Use this weekly meeting to hold yourself accountable for your goals, to talk about what you did to work toward those goals (and let the others do the same, if applicable), and to make the next week’s plan.
> 
>   * **A scoring system** —Each week, look at how many tasks you were supposed to complete and how many you actually completed. Score your achievement for the week; for example, if you had twenty tasks planned and accomplished ten of them, your score for the week is 50%.
> 
> 

> 
> Moran’s scoring system makes no allowance for how lengthy or difficult each task is. You may find it helpful to weigh certain activities more heavily than others; it makes the system a bit more complicated but gives a better overall view of your progress for the week.

#### Create Time Blocks in Your Schedule

**One useful strategy for scheduling your priorities is to set aside blocks of time for high-priority Zone 2 activities.** Doing so helps ensure that you’re making time for important tasks while keeping your schedule flexible.

For example, you might make a two-hour time block every Saturday morning for housework. That doesn’t mean that every Saturday, you’ll start working on chores strictly at 9 a.m. and end at 11; rather, blocking out this time helps you schedule other activities around it and ensure that the housework still gets done.

**The other benefit of time blocks is that they create consistent times for activities that other people will become aware of, and plan around.** Your friends will know you’re most likely going to decline any invites for Saturday morning plans, because that’s your housework time.

Covey warns you not to completely fill your schedule with time zones—rather, use them to make sure you allocate time for high-priority activities. That way, if a one-time event disrupts a time zone—for example, a doctor’s appointment in the middle of your housework block—you’ll have the flexibility to move the housework to another time slot and still accomplish all of your goals.

(Shortform note: Peter Drucker’s book _The Effective Executive _was one of the first to talk about time blocking. In it, Drucker suggests breaking your schedule into blocks that are as large as possible—four to five hours per block at least.**** While that might not be practical for individual activities (most of us don’t have the time or interest to take a four-hour walk, for example), it works well for categories that you can subdivide into other tasks. For instance, if you set aside a four-hour block for family activities, you might subdivide that into two hours for a movie and two hours for board games.)

#### Build Preparation Time into Your Schedule

Covey says that people often get stuck trying to catch up with pressing tasks simply because they didn’t take enough time in advance to prepare for those tasks. **Weekly organizing prevents that problem; it lets you see what’s coming up and build in adequate preparation time.**

For example, if you do your weekly planning on Sunday, as Covey suggests, and you see that the week ahead includes an important exam on Thursday, you can schedule some time each day to prepare for it. Then you won’t get caught off-guard and end up cramming the night before the exam.

(Shortform note: Clinical psychologist Jeffrey Nevid suggests that you also build some worry time into your schedule. If you’re a chronic worrier, setting a particular block of time where you’re allowed to just sit and worry might help you get it out of your system, so to speak. However, that also prevents you from spending all day, every day worrying about things that you can’t control. Once your worry time is over, you get back to work on the things that you _can_ change.)

### Stay True to Your Mission in Each Moment

No matter how carefully and thoughtfully you plan your week during your weekly organizing session, or review the day’s plans and priorities each morning, unexpected events and demands are bound to come up.

**That’s why Covey’s Zone 2 organizing process is not simply about making your weekly plan and sticking to it—it’s meant to empower you to navigate those unexpected events along the way.** Zone 2 organizing keeps you closely connected with your mission, gifts, and principles to stay true to yourself through all of life’s twists, from medical emergencies to power failures.

Covey says that it’s easy to get frustrated and blame other people or external circumstances when unexpected events disrupt your carefully curated schedule, but you always have control over how you’ll respond: You can make your choice based on pressure and others’ expectations, or you can make your choice according to your conscience. When you let your conscience and self-awareness guide your decisions in these moments—just as you did to create your personal mission and your schedule—you’ll make principle-centered decisions that greatly improve your quality of life.

> **Take Responsibility, Not Blame**
> 
> When unexpected events and emergencies crop up—which, as Covey says, they inevitably will—don’t use them as excuses to give up on your goals or your tasks. In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson advises that you instead consider your situation (without assigning blame to yourself or anyone else), and then take responsibility: Make an active, conscious choice about how you’ll respond to it.
> 
> Manson draws an important and often-overlooked distinction between _taking blame_ for your situation and _taking responsibility_ for it. It’s tempting to blame outside forces for your problems and use that as an excuse to not even try to make things better—you just convince yourself that it’s outside of your control and there’s nothing you can do.
> 
> Manson warns us against that temptation by saying that it doesn’t matter who or what is to blame for your situation (whatever that situation is); what’s important is that you actively and consciously decide how you’ll respond to it. **In other words, your problems may not be your fault, but dealing with them is still your responsibility.**

#### Make Principle-Centered Choices

To make principle-centered decisions, you must commit to listen to and act on what your conscience dictates. **According to Covey, this works because your conscience will always point you toward universal principles.**

But how do you know if the voice you’re hearing is really your conscience, instead of some outside influence like societal pressure or conditioning?

To help you recognize your conscience, Covey suggests that you think for a moment about a relationship in your life that’s deeply important to you—one that you feel needs to be improved. What’s something you could do that would greatly improve that relationship? How do you know? **Most likely, you don’t know from any specific experience or from a process of logical thinking, you just _know_ ; it feels right.**

When you face moments of choice, it helps to have specific questions that guide the way you ask your conscience how to act. Covey suggests asking whether it’s a situation that you can control, whether it’s related to your mission, and what universal principles apply to it. You may also want to ask if there are other solutions that you haven’t considered yet. In addition, Covey suggests asking questions that can help you determine the principle-based choice to make. Remember the what, why, and how questions from the section on setting goals.

Covey says that pausing to ask these questions gives you a moment to reconnect with universal principles, and it empowers you to channel those principles and your conscience as you make your choice. This pause pulls you away from making a knee-jerk decision based on urgency, or stubbornly sticking to your predetermined schedule when a better option might be presenting itself. Just be sure that **when you ask your conscience what you should do, you commit to follow through on what it tells you, even if you don’t like the answer.**

> **Ask With Kindness**
> 
> In _Radical Acceptance_ , Brach also discusses asking yourself questions in order to figure out what you’re experiencing and how you want to respond to it. However, while Covey’s approach to this process is a sort of interrogation, Brach suggests treating it like a friendly conversation—imagine that you’re asking a close friend what she thinks about your situation.
> 
> **The key to Brach’s approach is that you’re not looking to judge your experiences or change anything; you’re just trying to figure out what your inner self is telling you.** It’s also crucial that, once you have the answer, you accept it—just like Covey says you have to accept and act on what your conscience tells you.

Covey believes that a sense of certainty means the knowledge came from your conscience. The more you listen to your conscience, the more you’ll be able to recognize and act according to its influence. This process takes time, effort, and integrity—it’s not always easy to do what your conscience tells you is right—but following your conscience is the only way to live by universal principles and cultivate greater quality of life.

> **The Social Proof Principle**
> 
> Listening to your conscience can also protect you from falling victim to the risks of the Social Proof Principle: the tendency to follow along with what other people do and think. In _Influence_ , psychology professor Robert Cialdini explains that this habit served our ancestors extremely well—for example, if everyone else was running away, it probably meant there was something dangerous nearby. However, **if what everyone else is doing seems wrong, you may be seeing manufactured social proof, or victims of such manufactured proof.**
> 
> Manufactured social proof means that an outside influence is knowingly and intentionally manipulating people’s reactions to a situation. Those reactions could be as innocuous as laughing along with a pre-recorded laugh track, or as deadly as the influence of propaganda and mob mentality in the January 6th attack on the US Capitol.

### Learn From Your Experiences

The last step in Covey’s Zone 2 weekly organizing process is to evaluate your experiences from the past week to inform your choices for the coming week. **The value of each week is not just what we accomplish during it, but what we learn from it and how we apply that to the weeks that follow.** This learning process creates an upward spiral of growth.

> To effectively learn from the past week, you need to know _how_ to learn. In _Limitless_ , Jim Kwik describes three crucial components to learning (no matter what it is you’re trying to learn):
> 
>   * **Mindframe** —In order to learn, you must first believe that you _can_ learn, and be open to new ideas.
> 
>   * **Drive** —You must be motivated to learn and interested in what you’re studying (in this case, your own life and experiences).
> 
>   * **Techniques** —You need specific methods to learn, which is what this section will discuss.
> 
> 


#### Strategies for Evaluating Your Week

Using a personal journal or making notes on the back of each week’s schedule may be helpful in your weekly evaluation practice. **Some people find it useful to create a list of five or six questions to ask yourself before you begin planning for the following week.**

Your questions will be personal and meaningful to you, but they should explore what goals you accomplished in the previous week, what challenges you faced, what universal principles you used, and whether you made the best possible use of your time. You should also ask yourself where you fell short and how you can do better in the coming week.

Covey encourages you to be honest and self-aware while answering your questions—**the more honest you can be, the greater the benefit to you and your future.** Connect with your conscience as you make these evaluations and use your creative imagination and independent will to imagine how you can make positive change from these lessons.

(Shortform note: In addition to helping you learn and improve yourself, evaluating your day or your week can build up your self-esteem and sense of gratitude by illustrating what you already have and how much you’ve accomplished. One way to practice gratitude is to write down three good things that happened each day. You could combine that practice with Covey’s weekly planning and evaluating session by remembering something good that happened each day in the week that just ended, and deciding what good things you’d like to happen in the week to come.)

### See Your Week in a Larger Context

Just as it’s important to connect the big picture of your life to your daily and weekly time management, it’s critical to evaluate your week in a larger context. In addition to each week’s evaluation, Covey suggests doing monthly or quarterly evaluations of your experiences and your lessons in order to see larger patterns that you might not recognize by looking at a single week.

During these evaluations, Covey suggests asking yourself some of these questions:

  * What patterns of success or failure do I recognize in how I set and achieve my goals?
  * Are the goals I’m setting both realistic and challenging? 
  * What obstacles impede me from achieving my goals?
  * How can I improve my patterns or process for setting and achieving goals?
  * Do I create unrealistic expectations? If so, how can I adjust them?



> **Your Personal Performance Review**
> 
> The questions Covey suggests here are part of any good performance review—which is, in essence, what he’s suggesting you do for yourself each week and quarter. Covey wants you to examine what you’re doing, determine how effectively you’re living out your mission statement, and what you can do to improve.
> 
> Andrew Grove’s book _High Output Management _outlines a four-step process for performance reviews, which you can use for these personal reviews with some minor tweaking.
> 
>   * **Determine expectations.** What did you hope to accomplish the previous week? This part should be easy, since you can just look at the plan you made for yourself a week ago.
> 
>   * **Assess performance.** How well did you stick to your plan? How many of your goals did you accomplish?
> 
>   * **Provide feedback.** What worked well in the previous week? What was _one_ major problem you had in the last week, and how can you avoid it in the future? How can you improve your performance for the week to come?
> 
>   * **Deliver the review.** Since you’re only reviewing yourself, it might seem like there’s nobody to “deliver” it to. However, this would be a good time to write down a few key ideas you came up with during this review, and keep it someplace where you can reference it in the week to come.
