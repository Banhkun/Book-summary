## Part 2.2: Set Goals

Zone 2 scheduling won’t be effective if you don’t have specific goals to work towards. That’s why Covey believes that setting goals is a key part of effective self-improvement and time management methods. **However, he warns that goals can be counterproductive if you don’t set and execute them judiciously.** In this section, we’ll first explain the risks involved in goal-setting, then explore how to set helpful goals and work toward them effectively.

Covey says that there are two major ways in which goals can end up working against you:

  1. Your sense of integrity and your courage take a hit when you fail to achieve a goal.
  2. Sometimes, even when you do achieve your goal, the outcome is unexpectedly negative. 



(Shortform note: Clinical psychologist Alisa Crossfield points out that goals can be powerful motivators, but they can also be sources of anxiety and stress. She writes that setting goals that are unrealistic or unsuitable for you, or setting too many goals at once can be harmful to your mental and emotional health. She warns that doing so can lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms like drug abuse and avoiding responsibilities.)

### Falling Short of Your Goal Hurts Your Integrity

Covey defines personal integrity as the trust you have in yourself to do the things you say you’re going to do. **When you successfully make and keep a commitment, you strengthen your sense of integrity, which makes you feel more confident and in control of your life.**

However, when you fail to achieve a goal or keep a commitment, you suffer a painful blow to your confidence. Frequent failures deplete your trust in yourself and others’ trust in you, making it harder to have the confidence and courage to set and achieve goals in the future—which just continues the cycle of low personal integrity and low confidence.

Covey believes that strengthening your integrity is like strengthening your muscles: It takes time and consistent effort. That’s why it’s important to maintain your sense of integrity through setting reasonable goals, and putting in the work to reach them.

(Shortform note: While Covey argues that personal integrity improves your individual confidence, accomplishment, and satisfaction, research similarly shows that high levels of integrity within an organization increase employee confidence and company profits. Researchers surveyed roughly 6,500 Holiday Inn employees to figure out how much they trusted their managers—in other words, how much integrity they believed their managers had. **The survey found that even a slight increase in managerial integrity predicted a huge increase in annual profits for that location, because employees performed better when they felt they could trust their bosses.)**

#### The Reasons We Don’t Reach Our Goals

Covey says that there are two main reasons we fail to reach our goals:

**1\. The goal is unrealistic.** Sometimes, in a rush of enthusiasm and motivation, we set goals that simply aren’t achievable. For example, if you’ve just started playing a sport, setting a goal to go professional is most likely setting yourself up for failure. Covey warns that each failure is a blow to your personal integrity.

> **Counterpoint:_The 10X Rule_**
> 
> While many self-help authors, including Covey, urge us to set realistic goals so we can enjoy the satisfaction of meeting them, Grant Cardone’s book _The 10X Rule _suggests the exact opposite: Set extreme goals, then do whatever is necessary to meet those goals. The title comes from Cardone’s rule of setting a “realistic” goal, then multiplying that goal by 10.
> 
> Whereas Covey argues that we’ll be unhappy if we set goals that we can’t reach, **Cardone says that only achieving part of a 10X goal is still greater success than fully achieving a mediocre goal.** However, Cardone also talks about putting 10X more effort into his career goals than others—it’s up to you whether you can put so much energy into a single area and still maintain a balanced life.

**2\. Circumstances change.** There are times when even reasonable goals stop serving your purposes. For example, professional athletes often develop severe or chronic injuries and have to retire. In such cases, they might feel like they’ve given up or betrayed themselves, causing a loss of personal integrity; however, it’s important to recognize when a particular goal isn’t helping you anymore, and to let go of it.

> **Adapting to Change Is a Zone 2 Task**
> 
> The business parable _Who Moved My Cheese? _illustrates the necessity of adapting to change. The story is about four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese (which, in this story, is a stand-in for success or happiness). For many days they always find the cheese in a particular place—then, one day, it isn’t there.
> 
> Two of the characters immediately recognize that the situation has changed, and they go off in search of a new source of cheese. Covey would say that they’re handling an important Zone 2 task: finding a new food source.
> 
> The other two stay where the cheese is “supposed” to be, and become more and more frustrated and angry that it isn’t reappearing. Finally, one of the holdouts—driven by hunger and desperation—does what the others did in the first place and goes out searching for new cheese. Covey would say that this character waited until a Zone 2 task had crossed into Zone 1 (significant and pressing) before dealing with it.
> 
> Eventually, three characters who went searching end up at a new, even larger stockpile of cheese. However, the two who immediately accepted the new situation got there much sooner and suffered much less hunger along the way. It’s unclear whether the fourth character ever found it.
> 
> The takeaway is that adapting to change is an important Zone 2 task—best handled before it crosses into Zone 1 and you’re urgently scrambling to make the needed changes.

### Reaching a Goal Doesn’t Always Bring the Results You Want

Covey also warns that, although failing to reach a goal can be a painful experience, sometimes achieving that goal can be painful in a different way. **If the goals you set don’t nurture balance in your life, accomplishing them can come at the expense of sacrificing something more important.**

Working hard to achieve a goal, then realizing that it caused more harm than good in your life, can cause you to become disillusioned and wary of the goal-setting process in general. That’s why it’s important to set your goals carefully, making sure that they’re in line with your mission and your roles.

> **An Example of Success Without Balance**
> 
> Robin Sharma’s _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari _offers a perfect (albeit fictional) example of someone whose goals didn’t promote a balanced life.
> 
> Julian Mantle was, by any common measure, a successful lawyer: He was rich, had every material possession he could dream of, and his skill in the courtroom was world-renowned. However, because his goals were all career- and money-driven, his life was imbalanced—he was exhausted and unhealthy. This unbalanced lifestyle culminated in a mid-trial heart attack, which led him to quit law and seek a new way of life.
> 
> Julian’s heart attack is a cautionary tale: If your goals don’t promote balance in your life, sooner or later that imbalance will catch up with you. When it does, the results could be devastating.

### Set Positive Goals Using the Four Human Gifts

Covey says that in order to make positive changes in your life and strengthen your personal integrity, you need to use your human gifts to create principle-based goals. **However, people’s goals tend to lean heavily on just two of the four gifts: creativity and willpower.** They use creativity to imagine the situation they want and think of how to make that vision a reality. Then they use willpower to achieve that goal.

**Without morality and self-awareness to guide you, you’re likely to set goals that lead to undesired outcomes.** According to Covey, you need to use your morality to make sure that your goals grow naturally out of your mission, passion, and principles. You also need self-awareness to make sure those goals are realistic for you. Let’s look more closely at how to use each of these human gifts to set effective goals in your life.

> **What Is a Goal?**
> 
> Psychologist Timothy Carey writes that a goal is our concept of how some small part of the world should be. That concept could be anything from how much we should weigh to what position we should have in a company. **He also says that literally everything we do is driven by some kind of goal.** When you’re hungry, your goal is to eat; when you’re tired, your goal is to rest and recover your strength.
> 
> In short, our goals are an essential part of who we are, and that’s why Covey says it’s crucial to make sure that you’re using all four human gifts to set those goals. Granted, simple goals like eating when you’re hungry aren’t likely to lead to unfortunate outcomes; however, more complex and long-term goals like your career or your family need to be carefully weighed with morality and self-awareness to make sure that you’re staying true to yourself and your ideas of how the world—or your life—should be.

#### Use Morality to Create Principle- and Mission-Based Goals

When you set a goal, you’re choosing a result you want to create in your life—but what’s dictating that choice? **According to Covey, if your goal is influenced by others’ values and expectations, then you may be setting yourself up to pursue a goal that’s unrealistic or that doesn’t align with your principles and mission.** For example, if you’re striving to become a doctor because that’s what your parents want you to do, you may find that medical work doesn’t make you feel happy.

On the other hand, if you use your conscience to create a goal that’s inspired by your mission and based on universal principles, it’ll always be a worthwhile effort because pursuing it will bring you closer to your mission. In addition, the passion of your vision will energize you as you work to accomplish your goal. If your goal is still to become a doctor, but you’re doing it because you want to heal people and cure diseases, you’ll be much more motivated and feel much more fulfilled.

**Covey suggests that you check in with your conscience by asking three simple—but critical—questions:**

  1. **What?** What do you want to accomplish? What do you want to contribute to the world? What result are you aiming for? 
  2. **Why?** Why do you want to achieve this goal? Is it an outgrowth of your mission, principles, and essential needs? 
  3. **How?** How will you achieve your goal? This includes both concrete steps that you’ll take, and how you’ll keep yourself motivated. 



> **Conscience and Confidence**
> 
> In _The Magic of Thinking Big_ , author and life coach David J. Schwartz draws a clear connection between conscience and confidence. He says that when you go against your conscience—when you do something that you know is wrong, or not in line with your values—it reflects in how you feel and how you behave. As a result, not only do you feel badly about yourself, others around you also become suspicious and uncomfortable.
> 
> The same principle holds true for setting goals: If you set a goal that isn’t in line with your conscience and your mission, it won’t feel right. You’ll feel guilty or uncomfortable about pursuing that goal, and the people around you might see you in a more negative light as a result.

#### Use Your Self-Awareness to Build Your Personal Integrity

As mentioned earlier, making and keeping commitments to yourself and others builds up your sense of integrity, while breaking commitments damages it. According to Covey, the key to making commitments that you can keep is to use your self-awareness to evaluate whether the goals and commitments you’re making are small enough to be achievable, yet large enough to be satisfying.

**When you do fail to reach a goal, self-awareness helps you to understand why that happened.** If you realize that you set an unrealistic goal, you can use that information to adjust your expectations going forward.

**Covey says that self-awareness also helps you recognize when changing circumstances _make_ a goal impossible or unwise.** Rather than allowing that change to damage your sense of personal integrity, understand that sometimes situations are simply out of your control, and that’s not a reflection on your abilities or your character. This understanding will allow you to let go of goals that aren’t serving your mission or your passion anymore.

Self-awareness requires being deeply honest with yourself, although it can be difficult. You need to honestly ask yourself if you have not only the ability, but also the drive to achieve a particular goal. Furthermore, ask yourself whether you’re willing to take full responsibility for your personal growth as you work toward that goal, including taking responsibility for any failures along the way.

Covey asserts that **setting and reaching goals that are both realistic and challenging is an empowering process that fosters inner peace and personal growth.**

> **Why and How Do We Lie?**
> 
> Rule 8 of Jordan Peterson’s _12 Rules for Life _is: Act according to your personal truth. This rule encompasses being honest with yourself as well as with others—in other words, acting with integrity.
> 
> In order to help you become more honest, Peterson explains why and how we lie.
> 
> **Why we lie:**
> 
>   * **To get what we want:** This could be a child saying that she “needs” another cookie because she’s starving, or an adult lying about his life to win over friends and earn respect.
> 
>   * **To avoid pain:** This is often why you lie to yourself about what you want (because you fear the pain of admitting you’re chasing the wrong thing), or why it’s impossible to pursue what you _really_ want (because you fear the pain of failing). For example, you might lie to yourself that you’re in a healthy and loving relationship when you’re not, or that you love your job when every day is torturous. You might even lie just to avoid admitting that you’re wrong.
> 
> 

> 
> **How we lie:**
> 
>   * **We start small.** Lies begin with some little distortion of the facts, usually for one of the reasons listed above. Eventually, we have to tell more little lies to support the first one and avoid getting caught.
> 
>   * **We change our thinking to avoid the shame of lying.** We’ll start telling ourselves that we had no choice but to lie, or that it isn’t a lie after all. We deflect responsibility away from ourselves with more lies.
> 
>   * **We solidify the lies and act upon them.** Eventually, we’re so deeply enmeshed in the lie that revealing it seems impossible. The pain of admitting our lies to others—and to ourselves—is simply too great to face, so instead we maintain those lies for as long as possible.
> 
> 

> 
> Peterson adds that lying to yourself and deflecting responsibility will twist your thinking into bitterness and anger at the world for not conforming to your lies. Therefore, it’s crucial to be honest with yourself and with others, to avoid getting trapped in that kind of thinking.

### Setting and Achieving Principle-Based Goals

In addition to using all four human endowments, Covey suggests three strategies to help you set effective, principle-based goals.

**1\. Set context goals.** Look at each of your goals not only in the context of _what_ you want to achieve (your mission statement and your long-term goals), but also in the context of _why_ and _how_ you want to achieve them. Doing so will make it more likely that you’ll find ways to meet multiple needs and fulfill multiple roles at the same time.

For example, say that one of your goals is to read more books. In considering _why_ you want to read more, you recognize that it’s because you want to explore new ideas and different perspectives. That realization might drive you to change from the contextless goal of “read more” to the context-based goal of “join a book club,” where you’ll be encouraged to read things you might not choose for yourself and to discuss what you read with other people.

**With this context goal, while achieving your original goal of reading more, you’re also meeting your essential needs of connection and learning.**

> **What’s the Reason for the Goal?**
> 
> Simon Sinek’s business guide _Start With Why _offers another reason why context goals are helpful: **Your reasons for doing something are also your motivation for doing it.**
> 
> For example, if you want to lose weight just because your doctor said you should, that’s probably not a very strong motivator; most likely you won’t succeed. However, if you want to lose weight so that you can feel better and more confident, or so that you have more energy to play with your children, you’re more likely to succeed. That’s because the reason behind the goal—the context—is much stronger and more motivating.
> 
> If you can’t think of a compelling “why” for one of your goals, consider whether that’s a goal you really need to be pursuing.

**2\. Make a “maybe” list.** Covey suggests keeping a list of goals that you aren’t quite ready to commit to yet.

If you don’t write those goals down, they’ll just bounce around your mind and clutter up your thoughts. However, if you put every goal you think of on a to-do list, it’ll grow faster than you can keep up with and mix important goals with unimportant ones.

Therefore, a “maybe” list is an ideal solution:**It gives you a place to put your ideas while you consider whether they’re realistic and in line with your mission statement.**

> **What Goes On a Maybe List?**
> 
> In _Getting Things Done_ , David Allen suggests some activities and goals that would be appropriate for a maybe list:
> 
>   * Family activities you want to try
> 
>   * Books you want to read
> 
>   * Food you want to try
> 
>   * Gifts you’re considering buying
> 
>   * Hobbies you want to explore
> 
>   * Movies you want to see
> 
>   * Skills you want to learn
> 
>   * Home improvement projects and purchases
> 
>   * Places you want to visit
> 
>   * Websites you want to explore
> 
> 

> 
> In short, a maybe list is a place to put ideas that intrigue you, but that you’re not ready to commit to or schedule time for yet.

**3\. Set weekly goals.** Don’t just think long-term; set weekly goals that build up your integrity and get you working toward your mission statement. These short-term goals will serve as constant reminders of your principles, your mission, and your vision.

(Shortform note: According to the _progress principle_ , achieving small, daily accomplishments is the single most effective way to boost employee morale. That same principle applies to self-leadership: Reaching and celebrating your small, weekly goals will keep you motivated to work toward fulfilling your mission statement.)

**4\. Determine your convictions vs. your interests.** Even among the goals on your to-do list (rather than your “maybe” list), there will be some that feel more important to you than others. Therefore, Covey recommends that you go through your list and recognize which goals are _convictions_ : Things that you’re determined to accomplish no matter what. These are the goals that will hurt your integrity if you fail to reach them. Convictions might include important meetings and appointments, family time, or personal projects that are meaningful to you.

Alongside your convictions are your _interests_ : Goals you’d like to work toward, but that you’re not as personally invested in. Falling short of these goals, or putting them off for another time, will not damage your sense of integrity. Common interests include physical fitness, as well as hobbies that are enjoyable but not especially meaningful.

(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , life coach Tony Robbins elaborates on what convictions are:**In short, a conviction is something you believe in so strongly that you’ll do almost anything to uphold it.** You might even feel like giving up on a conviction would be giving up a part of who you are. Naturally, this means that convictions are powerful motivators, for better or for worse. That’s why Covey says it’s crucial to use self-awareness and morality to make sure your convictions are positive and constructive ones.)

#### Create Synergy Among Your Goals When Possible

Synergy is the concept that a whole can be greater than the sum of its parts, the way different pieces of a car work together to create a means of transportation. Covey urges you to apply that principle to your goal-setting: **If you combine activities to accomplish multiple goals at once, you can achieve more than if you’d dealt with each separately.**

For example, if today’s goals include recreation and family time, why not invite your kids to go on a walk, or play a board game with you? You’ll address two goals—in two different roles—at once. Plus, you might find a new activity that you all enjoy doing together, which is a better outcome than if you’d addressed those two goals separately.

You can take synergy a step further by working together with your family, friends, or housemates. Consider setting a weekly meeting time: During that meeting, look for ways to create synergy by coordinating your activities to achieve everyone’s goals more effectively.

However, Covey urges us to remember a couple of things about synergy. **First, the point of synergizing your goals is to achieve better results, not to cram more goals into each day.** Second, some tasks—meditation, for example—require dedicated time and focus, so you might not be able to create synergies with such activities. Just focus on creating synergy _where possible_ , and don’t toss out important activities that don’t achieve multiple needs..

> **Another Approach: High-Level Goals**
> 
> Another way to make sure that your goals support and synergize with each other is to break your goals into levels, as Angela Duckworth suggests in _Grit. _
> 
> Your high-level goals are what Covey would call your mission statement: The things you ultimately want to achieve in your life. **Mid-level goals** are long-term goals that support your high-level goals—for example, if your high-level goal is to fight climate change, a mid-level goal would be earning a degree in a relevant field. Finally, your **low-level goals** are simple, short-term goals that support your mid-level goals—for example, doing your homework and getting to class on time so you can earn that degree.
> 
> If your low-level goals don’t support your mid-level goals, or your mid-level goals don’t support your high-level goals, then you lack synergy. Accomplishing a low-level goal with no synergy is a dead end. Conversely, trying to achieve a mid-level goal with no low-level goals supporting it will be difficult. Therefore, it’s important to make sure that your goals synergize and support each other whenever possible.
