## Part 1.2: Understand Covey’s Time Management Model

Covey says that two factors should determine how you spend your time:

  1. How _significant_ each task is
  2. How _pressing_ each task is—in other words, how soon you need to address it



**Covey’s model of time management emphasizes only doing significant tasks: activities that are in line with your values and get you closer to your goals.** Insignificant tasks, no matter how pressing they might be, aren’t worth your time.

This section will teach you how to recognize which tasks are significant, and how a simple model can help you determine the best use of your time.

(Shortform note: In _The 4-Hour Workweek_ , Tim Ferriss discusses pressing-yet-insignificant tasks like phone calls and unnecessary meetings. He calls them “interruptions” because they crop up unexpectedly and disrupt your flow. Ferriss adds that people are often reluctant or afraid to avoid these interruptions because they don’t have a good sense of what’s actually important. They worry that they’ll miss something crucial if they ignore a phone call, or that skipping a meeting or a get-together will create problems for them. However, it’s well-worth skipping such things if you can use that time for something more important—for example, ignoring a ringing phone because you’re playing with your children.)

### Significance vs. Pressure

Covey plugs these two factors into a simple grid that allows us to categorize our tasks. _This grid lets us quickly see what we should spend our time and energy on._

> **Background Info: The Eisenhower Matrix**
> 
> Covey’s grid is closely based on the famous Eisenhower Matrix, developed by US president Dwight Eisenhower. The Eisenhower Matrix also suggests methods for dealing with the tasks in each zone:
> 
>   * **Zone 1: Do it.** A task that’s both significant and pressing is, naturally, something you should handle as soon as possible.
> 
>   * **Zone 2: Plan it.** These are important tasks, but you don’t necessarily need to do them right this instant. Therefore, Eisenhower urges you to schedule time to handle them, and then stick to that schedule.
> 
>   * **Zone 3: Assign it.** Eisenhower defines this zone as tasks that need to be done, but you don’t need to do them personally. Therefore, the ideal solution for this zone is to delegate the tasks to someone else.
> 
>   * **Zone 4: Ignore it.** Tasks that are neither significant nor pressing are, by definition, tasks that you can safely ignore.
> 
> 


#### Zone 1: Significant and Pressing

**Zone 1 contains emergencies and problems that require your immediate attention.** For example, a serious injury or a clogged toilet in your home are both situations that need to be addressed as soon as possible.

Zone 1 tasks are always the first things you should handle. However, Covey urges you to prevent tasks from reaching this quadrant; **whenever possible, tackle significant tasks _before_ they become pressing.** This is crucial because putting things off leaves you with an ever-growing list of urgent tasks—you could eventually find yourself stuck in a cycle of constantly dealing with emergencies because you no longer have the time for preventative measures.

> **Why Do We End Up in Zone 1?**
> 
> We’re often tempted to ignore looming crises because they’re inconvenient or painful to deal with—in other words, we resort to denial. Unfortunately, denying that a problem exists and refusing to prepare will only make it worse.
> 
> _Poor Charlie’s Almanac_ , a collection of speeches and writings by billionaire business executive Charlie Munger, has some theories about why we’re so prone to denial, and how to break out of it. Munger speculates that denial must have had some survival benefit for our ancestors. Perhaps denial was necessary to keep functioning in stressful or frightening situations. He also notes that denial is the first stage of grief, suggesting that it is indeed a short-term coping mechanism for emotional pain.
> 
> Finally, Munger says that the way to escape denial is to repeatedly face the truth. **Whatever painful truth you’re avoiding, say it to yourself over and over until you accept it as fact.** Then you’ll be better able to handle the problem, hopefully before it becomes an emergency.

#### Zone 2: Significant, but Not Pressing

**Zone 2 is where you do prevention, maintenance, long-term planning, relationship building, and personal leadership activities like evaluating your values.** Zone 2 activities aren’t urgent, so you could easily put them off; however, every task you handle in Zone 2 is a task that never crosses into Zone 1 (significant and pressing).

Covey makes a point of saying that keeping ourselves healthy (both physically and emotionally) belongs on the list of important tasks, so that they don’t become urgent tasks. For example, eating a healthy diet is important, but not urgent—until you’re suffering from diabetes or another serious condition because you never made the time to take care of yourself.

According to Covey, there are six main types of Zone 2 activities:

  1. **Strengthening relationships** —For example, spending time with your children or attending a friend’s birthday party
  2. **Planning, organizing, and preparing for the future (near or distant)** —For example, creating a schedule for the coming week or putting together an emergency kit 
  3. **Practicing self-care** —For example, preparing healthy meals or pursue a hobby you enjoy 
  4. **Capitalizing on new opportunities** —For example, researching investment opportunities or expanding your professional network 
  5. **Engaging in personal development activities** —For example, learning a new language or going to the gym 
  6. **Empowering yourself and others** —For example, investing in your entrepreneurial dream or mentoring someone



(Shortform note: In _The Leadership Challenge_ , James Kouzes and Barry Posner note that leadership—including _self_ -leadership—is an ongoing process. It’s not about making occasional, dramatic gestures or big projects; instead, it’s about the little tasks you do each day that keep things running smoothly and consistently bring you closer to your goals. That’s the essence of Covey’s list of Zone 2 activities: An ongoing stream of small-but-important tasks that enable you to stay productive, fulfilled, and happy.)

#### Zone 3: Pressing, but Not Significant

**Covey’s Zone 3 is a dangerous time-sink: The urgency of these activities can make them seem significant, but they don’t actually align with your values or contribute to achieving your goals.** Oftentimes these tasks are important to other people, so you feel pressured into doing them to meet others’ priorities and expectations. The key to staying out of Zone 3 is simply recognizing when a task isn’t significant and refusing to do it.

According to Covey, Zone 3 activities might include answering emails, attending parties or events that you don’t really want to go to, or helping a coworker with something that’s not your responsibility.

> **Practice Rejection**
> 
> In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Manson says that we live in a society that tells us we should say “yes” to everything—that we should value everything and everyone. However, he argues, valuing _everything_ is effectively the same as valuing _nothing_ ; in either case, we have nothing to guide our decision-making.
> 
> Therefore, Manson’s solution is to practice _rejection_ : saying “no” to things that don’t align with our values and don’t get us closer to our goals. According to Manson, rejection is a skill that everyone should learn. Like any new skill, it will feel uncomfortable and difficult at first, but with practice you’ll find it easier to reject unimportant matters and focus your energy where it’s most needed. **Zone 3 activities are ideal for practicing rejection.**

#### Zone 4: Neither Significant Nor Pressing

**Finally, Covey says that tasks in Zone 4 are complete wastes of your time and energy** , like watching mindless movies in an addictive way, spreading rumors and gossip, or abusing alcohol and other drugs. These activities add no value to your life; even recreational activities don’t belong here, because recreation is a restorative and valuable Zone 2 (significant but not pressing) activity.****

Covey says that you might end up doing Zone 4 tasks out of confusion about what’s truly important, or as a mental escape. However, such tasks don’t substantially improve your circumstances nor your mental state.

> **How to Distinguish Between Zone 2 and Zone 4**
> 
> It’s sometimes hard to tell whether something is an important Zone 2 task, or an insignificant Zone 4 task, especially when it comes to recreation. However, we can use scientific evidence to try to determine which activities are worthwhile and which are not.
> 
> For example, a great deal of evidence suggests that social media use may actually be harmful to mental health, especially in young people—excessive scrolling and refreshing may cause (or worsen) feelings of isolation and anxiety. **Therefore, using social media for more than just staying connected to your friends and family is a Zone 4 activity** —it doesn’t improve your life or get you closer to your goals.
> 
> However, activities like listening to music, reading, or playing (some) video games do have significant benefits and should go in Zone 2 instead.
> 
> Exactly which things go into Zone 2 instead of Zone 4 is a personal decision, but the key is to be aware of which tasks actually bring you joy or boost your skills, and which tasks just leave you feeling drained and frustrated.

### Applying the Zones to Real Life

Now that you understand Covey’s significance-pressure grid, the next step is understanding how to apply it to your own life.

**1.** **Further prioritize within Zone 1:** Facing multiple Zone 1 (significant and pressing) tasks that are all pressing and significant can be overwhelming. That overwhelm could push you back toward an earlier-era model of trying to get _more things_ done, rather than get the _right things_ done.

Using the grid at the beginning of this section, you can plot your activities more specifically than just breaking them into zones: The farther to the right a task is on the grid, the more pressing it is. The farther up a task is, the more significant it is. Filling in the grid this way will allow you to easily see which tasks you should prioritize within each zone.

(Shortform note: In _Extreme Ownership, _retired Navy SEALs Jocko Willink and Leif Babin offer useful tips for personal leadership, especially in stressful and high-pressure situations. **On the subject of prioritizing, Willink and Babin suggest asking yourself whether any of the tasks on your list, if not handled, would make the other tasks irrelevant.** For example, if you have both a personal health crisis and a crisis at work, then the health crisis should be the first thing you deal with—after all, your career won’t matter if you’re too sick to work.)

**2\. Determine _why_ you’re in Zone 1:** Covey says it’s inevitable that you’ll sometimes end up stuck dealing with significant and pressing tasks in Zone 1; however, it’s always important to understand why you’re there. Except in genuine emergencies, it’s often because you focus too much on _pressing_ tasks instead of prioritizing _significant_ ones—remember, a lot of this zone may consist of tasks that you didn’t handle while they were in Zone 2 (significant, not pressing).

> **Prepare for Emergencies**
> 
> As Covey says, emergencies do happen in spite of our best efforts. Whether it’s a health crisis, a natural disaster, or an unexpected expense, there are many things in life that we simply can’t control. Therefore, it’s important to take steps beforehand to make sure that you’re ready for sudden Zone 1 events:
> 
>   * **Have an emergency kit.** Have a bag packed with non-perishable food, water, clothes, and medicine in case you have to suddenly evacuate, or if you end up trapped at home without power.
> 
>   * **Have an emergency fund.** Dave Ramsey, author of _The Total Money Makeover_ , urges you to have at least $1,000 set aside as a buffer against unexpected events.
> 
>   * **Prepare with your loved ones.** One of the most important things you can do is make plans for emergency situations. Ensure that you and the people around you know what to do when there’s a fire, hurricane, or sudden health emergency. A study from the University of Michigan found that less than 40% of adults had made such plans with their loved ones.
> 
> 

> 
> All of these preparations are important Zone 2 activities.

**3\. Create time for Zone 2:** This can be difficult, especially if you’re stuck in a cycle of urgency. Covey’s advice is to make time by moving away from Zone 3 (pressing but not significant); **recognize when urgent tasks are not important, and stop wasting your time on them.** By doing so, you’ll be able to reinvest that time and energy into Zone 2 (significant but not pressing).

(Shortform note: Recall that a key part of Covey’s fourth era of time management is using the skills from previous eras to achieve your goals. Time management and efficiency techniques will help you make time for your important Zone 2 activities; the key is to make sure that you’re not using those techniques for unimportant tasks in Zone 3 or Zone 4 (neither significant nor pressing).)

**4\. Focus on Zone 2, especially if you work in a Zone 1 environment:** Some people have jobs that inherently involve a lot of time in Zone 1, including firefighters, doctors, police officers, and news reporters. Covey says that **these are the people who need Zone 2 the most** —since they’re already facing a lot of issues that are both significant and pressing, they need to handle as much as possible _before_ it becomes pressing.

(Shortform note: Covey’s advice here is reminiscent of a Zen proverb that says you should meditate for 20 minutes every day, unless you don’t have the time—in which case you should meditate for an hour every day. Just like Covey’s insistence that we focus on Zone 2 activities when we’re already swamped with Zone 1 activities, the point of the proverb is that the people who are constantly overworked and stressed are the ones who need meditation the most.**In both cases, the point is to invest some time now— _especially_ if you don’t think you can afford to—so that you can tackle problems more effectively and easily going forward.)**

Covey says that once you recognize how you’re spending your time within the four quadrants, you can begin to shift your approach to prioritize truly important tasks. **If you can get out of Zones 3 (pressing but not significant) and 4 (neither significant nor pressing), and dedicate your time entirely to Zones 1 and 2, you’ll take more control of your life and time.**
