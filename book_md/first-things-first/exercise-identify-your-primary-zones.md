## Exercise: Identify Your Primary Zones

Use these questions to identify where you spend the most time: Zone 1 (significant and pressing), Zone 2 (significant but not pressing), Zone 3 (pressing but not significant), or Zone 4 (neither significant nor pressing).

* * *

Think about how you spend your time. Which zones do you occupy most?

Think about one frequent Zone 1 activity or type of activity. Perhaps you have a lot of work deadlines or frequently need to pacify angry clients. What’s one preventative thing you could do today to keep that activity from becoming urgent in the future?

What’s one Zone 2 activity you can do today to help you grow and make improvements in your life?
