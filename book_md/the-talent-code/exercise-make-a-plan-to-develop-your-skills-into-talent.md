## Exercise: Make a Plan to Develop Your Skills Into Talent

According to Coyle, developing talent depends on a combination of impassioned motivation and a commitment to meaningful practice. In this exercise, you’ll pinpoint your source of impassioned motivation and plan out your approach to meaningful practice.

* * *

What skill are you most interested in developing further?

What motivates you to want to develop that skill in particular? Is this motivation one that will help you commit in the long term? (For example, your motivation may be that it’s important to your family that you succeed, or you go to a highly competitive school, or someone from your neighborhood achieved success so you know you can do it, too.)

How are you currently practicing this skill? Explain how your current practice supports—or _doesn’t_ support—the type of challenge and struggle that contributes to myelination.

What could you change about your practice to make it more meaningful, or consistently challenging in a myelination-supportive way? Recall Coyle’s four methods that contribute to meaningful practice: chunking, staying attuned to flaws, condensing, and repetition in the development zone. (For example, you might develop as a sprinter by chunking: mastering your start, then your stride and arm movement, then your finish—then speeding up each step and eventually linking them together.)
