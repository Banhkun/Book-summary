## Exercise: Make a Plan for Managing Your Negative Self-Talk

Kross claims that negative self-talk can harm your happiness, health, and success. Reflect on how you engage in negative self-talk and which of his strategies may help quiet your internal cynic.

* * *

List five examples of negative self-talk that you regularly engage in. (For instance, you might think things like “I can’t do this,” “I’m not good enough to achieve my goals,” or “other people don’t like me.”)

When do you tend to experience this negative self-talk? (For instance, perhaps your internal cynic tends to pipe up when you’re receiving critical feedback, when you’re on social media, or when you’re working on your goals.)

How does this negative self-talk affect you? (Consider any of these impacts: activating your brain’s threat response, blocking your access to your skills, making you socially isolated, or taking a toll on your mental and/or physical health.)

Describe an experience on the horizon that you predict may awaken your internal cynic (such as a job interview, a date, a performance, or a family gathering). Why might this experience trigger your negative self-talk?

Describe a strategy you can use during or after that experience to quiet your negative self-talk, and explain how you’ll implement that strategy. (Consider any of these strategies Kross offers: Pursue amazement, seek out actionable empathy, adopt a new perspective, increase your sense of control, or engage in a ritual. Think about who else you might need to involve (such as someone in your support network) as well as how you’ll carve out time for that strategy (such as scheduling time to organize your physical space).)
