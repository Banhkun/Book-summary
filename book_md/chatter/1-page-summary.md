## 1-Page Summary

Right now, you’re not only reading these words. You’re also engaging in self-talk: your thoughts taking the form of words, all within your mind. Self-talk is the voice in your mind that says, “Interesting!” when you read something compelling. It’s the encouraging voice that tells you “Nailed it!” after you rock an interview, as well as the inner cynic that grumbles, “You’re a failure” after you bomb a first date. In _Chatter_ , Ethan Kross highlights this last type of voice—negative self-talk, which he believes interferes with your happiness, health, and success. He argues that **you can improve your life by quieting negative self-talk.**

_Chatter_ is the first book by Kross, a neuroscientist and experimental psychologist. He founded a lab at the University of Michigan that studies people’s self-talk. He and his colleagues design experiments to answer the following questions: Why do we engage in self-talk? How can we prevent negative self-talk from jeopardizing our well-being? _Chatter_ explores these same questions.

In this guide, we’ll present Kross’s insights on self-talk and share his research-based strategies for managing its negative form. In Part 1, we’ll provide some background: what self-talk is, why you engage in it, and how both your biology and your upbringing shape your internal voice. In Part 2, we’ll contrast how negative and positive self-talk impact your life. Finally, in Part 3, we’ll explore five of Kross’s strategies for managing your negative self-talk. Throughout this guide, we’ll compare Kross’s ideas and strategies to those of other experts on self-talk. Furthermore, we’ll provide additional actionable steps for quieting your negative self-talk.

(Shortform note: Kross primarily uses the term "inner voice" to describe the voice you hear in your head. Other names for this voice include “inner speech” and “inner dialogue.” Throughout this guide, we’ll primarily use the term “self-talk,” since it’s one that both experts and laypeople use. Furthermore, Kross uses the word “chatter” to describe your inner voice’s negative form. In this guide, we’ll use the terms “negative self-talk” and “internal cynic” to emphasize this voice’s harmful effects.)

### Part 1: Background on Self-Talk

#### What Counts as Self-Talk?

Is self-talk just another word for our thoughts? Not quite: Kross claims that **specifically, self-talk is thoughts that take the form of silent words you “hear” in your mind.** Here are several examples of self-talk:

  * After you say something awkward to your date, you mentally chastise yourself. Your internal voice moans, “Now they probably think I’m a _loser._ ”
  * Before you share your idea in a meeting, you imagine what you’ll say.
  * After you meet someone, you mentally repeat their name so you don’t forget it.



> **Self-Talk Also Manifests as an Imagined Dialogue**
> 
> Throughout his book, Kross’s examples of self-talk mostly take the form of a _single_ voice that enters your mind. In _The Voices Within_ , psychologist Charles Fernyhough claims that some people experience self-talk as multiple voices engaged in a conversation, such as a conversation between themselves and someone they know. Let’s reimagine what the aforementioned examples might be like for someone who experiences self-talk in this way:
> 
>   * After you say something awkward to your date, you imagine a conversation between them and their friend in which they rant about how awkward you were.
> 
>   * Before you share your idea in a meeting, you mentally review what you’ll say and imagine how people will respond to your ideas.
> 
>   * After you meet someone, you mentally replay your conversation so you don’t forget their name and what they said.
> 
> 


#### Why Do We Engage in Self-Talk?

According to Kross, **self-talk must be evolutionarily beneficial** —otherwise, this habit wouldn’t have persisted into modern times. He surmises that our ancestors who engaged in self-talk were more likely to survive and therefore pass this habit down to future generations.

(Shortform note: Kross’s claim that self-talk must have supported our ancestors’ survival reflects a common misconception about evolution: that all of our current traits are evolutionary adaptations. While some of our traits _did_ evolve because they supported our survival (such as the ability to digest milk), some of our other traits arose and stuck around for other reasons. For example, some traits arose from random mutations that occur when our DNA copies, and some of these mutations are neutral—meaning they neither improve nor harm our chances of survival. Self-talk could be a neutral mutation.)

#### The Neuroscience of Self-Talk

What happens in your brain when you’re engaging in self-talk? Kross shares three facts about the neuroscience of having an internal voice.

##### Fact 1: You Can Multitask While Engaging in Self-Talk

According to Kross, **you have a system in your brain called the _phonological loop_ that allows you to engage in self-talk while doing other things. **Your phonological loop has two jobs it can do simultaneously: 1) It temporarily stores verbal information, such as something you’ve just heard or read, and 2) it allows you to silently think in the form of words.

(Shortform note: Some researchers argue that the phonological loop is an adaptation that early humans evolved because it allowed them to store verbal information in their memory, enabling the development of human language. Language facilitated cooperation among early humans, and cooperation increased their chances of survival. However, these researchers don’t mention self-talk in their theories, which raises the question of whether self-talk itself is evolutionarily advantageous. Perhaps self-talk assisted with language development, supporting Kross’s claim that self-talk aided in early humans’ survival. Alternatively, perhaps our habit of self-talk was just a neutral byproduct of our phonological loop’s other functions.)

##### Fact 2: Our Self-Talk Is Lightning-Fast

Second, Kross cites a study revealing that **our self-talk happens remarkably fast.** Our internal voice “speaks” at a rate close to four thousand words per _minute_. Reading four thousand words _aloud_ would take at least 15 minutes.

> **Exploring the Speed of Self-talk**
> 
> Kross reveals the shocking fact that our self-talk happens remarkably fast. However, he doesn’t expand upon how researchers discovered this and what this finding reveals about the differences between self-talk and verbal expression.
> 
> This is how the researchers in the study Kross cites arrived at the figure of four thousand words per minute: First, they recorded how long it took participants to solve a problem silently. Next, participants shared a verbal explanation of the thoughts behind each step in their problem-solving process. Finally, researchers compared the number of words in participants’ _verbal_ explanations to their _silent_ problem-solving rate, concluding that participants averaged four thousand words of explanation per minute of silent problem-solving.
> 
> Why were participants able to do four thousand words’ worth of thinking in only a minute? Researchers offer two possible theories. First, it’s possible that our self-talk is “condensed,” meaning it uses simplified sentence structures and vocabulary that take less time to generate and mentally “hear.” Second, perhaps verbal expression is slower than the rate of self-talk because it takes time to physically form your thoughts into spoken words.

##### Fact 3: Everyone Engages in Self-Talk

Third, Kross elaborates that **everyone engages in self-talk to some degree** , even people who don’t express themselves out loud. For instance, deaf signers report having an internal voice.

> **Varieties of Self-Talk and the Absence of Self-Talk**
> 
> Kross mentions that deaf signers report having an internal voice, but he doesn’t describe what this internal voice sounds like. Research reveals that deaf signers’ self-talk manifests in a variety of ways. Some report that their self-talk takes a visual form, such as imagining signs from ASL (American Sign Language) or picturing printed words. Other deaf signers report that they “hear” their self-talk in their minds, much like hearing people. Furthermore, some deaf signers claim their self-talk manifests as a combination of these different forms.
> 
> In addition, some research contradicts Kross’s claim that _everyone_ experiences self-talk. For instance, many people with _aphantasia_ —having no capacity for mental visualization—claim that they lack an internal voice. Research suggests that aphantasia doesn’t necessarily hinder a person’s ability to succeed professionally and in life. Pairing this conclusion with evidence that many people with aphantasia lack the capacity for self-talk suggests that lacking self-talk doesn’t necessarily hinder your chance of success, either.

#### Social and Cultural Forces That Shape Self-Talk

Although our capacity for self-talk is hard-wired into our brains, it’s also shaped by the world outside our heads. Kross argues that **our upbringing and culture influence our self-talk.** We internalize the voices of those around us**,** especially those of our parents. Their voices usually reflect larger cultural beliefs.

For instance, imagine that your culture has the following social norm: Refrain from displaying intense emotions around strangers. While growing up, your parents repeatedly reminded you of this norm. Over time, you internalized their vocal reminders. Now, their words are part of your self-talk, reminding you to be emotionally reserved in public.

(Shortform note: When discussing social and cultural forces that shape self-talk, Kross focuses on parents’ influence. Research suggests that other adults, such as teachers, also significantly influence the development of self-talk. For instance, one study reveals that children engage in motivational self-talk during academic tasks by imagining their teachers giving them positive feedback. Given these findings, researchers argue that teacher education programs should train pre-service teachers to thoughtfully praise and motivate their students.)

### Part 2: Positive vs. Negative Self-Talk

Kross contends that **our self-talk is extremely important: It influences our happiness, health, and success.** In this section, we’ll contrast how positive and negative self-talk impact your life. We’ll begin with positive self-talk.

#### How Positive Self-Talk Improves Your Life

##### Role 1: Supporting You With Your Goals

Kross explains that **when your self-talk is positive, it’s an _internal mentor_ that improves your life by supporting you with your goals.** Your internal mentor does this in three ways:

  * **It motivates you** by offering encouragement.
  * **It prompts you to assess your progress** by reflecting on your accomplishments so far and comparing them to your goals. 
  * **It helps you plan for the future** by directing you to engage in behaviors that increase your chances of accomplishing your goals.



> **Questioning the Idea That _All_ Positive Self-Talk Is Beneficial**
> 
> Here, Kross focuses on how your internal mentor _supports_ you with your goals. However, he doesn’t explore in depth how this outcome may vary by the individual—or what your self-talk must sound like for you to experience these benefits.
> 
> Some research suggests that not everyone benefits equally from positive self-talk. For instance, a recent study found that people with high self-esteem benefit more from positive self-talk than people with low self-esteem. Researchers asked participants with varying levels of self-esteem to think positive thoughts such as “I will succeed.” Participants with high self-esteem felt slightly better after this exercise—but people with low self-esteem reported feeling _worse_. Researchers theorize that when you push someone with low self-esteem to focus too much on positive thinking, they find negative thoughts particularly discouraging.
> 
> Furthermore, this research suggests that _how_ you phrase your self-talk matters. The study’s researchers theorize that statements such as “I will succeed” may have been _too_ positive, explaining why participants with low self-esteem had a hard time believing these affirmations. Therefore, the internal mentor Kross describes may be most effective when it avoids overly positive statements and instead motivates you, prompts you to assess your progress, and helps you to plan for the future in _believable, specific ways._
> 
> For example, imagine you have the goal to release a musical album before the end of the year. Let’s compare believable, specific self-talk to overly positive self-talk for this situation:
> 
>   * **Motivate yourself** by thinking, “If I practice this song every day, I’ll get better at it” instead of just thinking, “You can do it!”
> 
>   * **Assess your progress __** by thinking “I’ve recorded half of my album, and there are only three months left to record. I need to pick up the pace a bit” instead of merely thinking, “You’ve done great so far, keep up the good work!”
> 
>   * **Plan for the future** by thinking, “If it’s hard to find time to record, I can use some of my vacation days to record songs” instead of just thinking, “I’ll try to record more songs.”
> 
> 


##### Role 2: Helping You Construct Your Identity

Second, Kross claims that **your internal mentor helps you form your identity, which makes life easier.** Think of your internal mentor as a silent voiceover narrating your life. This voiceover tells a somewhat oversimplified story, highlighting certain aspects of your past to construct a cohesive story about who you are. This story helps you recognize what you want and need in life, and it grounds you in your values so you can be resilient in the face of challenges.

For example, imagine you’re on a journey toward becoming less of a perfectionist, and your effort to record a musical album is forcing you to confront your perfectionist tendencies. Any time you slip into your old ways, your internal mentor steers you towards success by connecting your past, present, and future identities into a cohesive narrative:

  * It compares the present to the past: “You’re being a perfectionist again by trying to perfect each song. In the past, this prevented you from completing songs.”
  * It imagines a better future: “On future recordings, be less of a perfectionist. Remind yourself that ‘good enough is good enough!’ It’s better to have _imperfect but completed_ songs than _no_ songs.”



#### How Negative Self-Talk Harms You

On the other hand, Kross claims that sometimes, **your self-talk is negative—an _internal cynic_ who overwhelms and discourages you.**

(Shortform note: In the previous section, Kross focuses on describing the ways _positive_ self-talk contributes to your identity formation—but research reveals that _negative_ self-talk also shapes your identity. Engaging in excessively negative self-talk impacts how you see yourself, which informs your identity. For instance, in connecting your past, present, and future identities into a cohesive narrative, your internal cynic may say something like this: “You’ve always been a perfectionist, and you always will be.” This negative statement may then form part of your identity.)

Kross claims that, in contrast to your internal mentor, your internal cynic chastises you, fixates on negative memories, and worries excessively about negative scenarios. Let’s reimagine what it would be like to work on your musical album in the company of your internal cynic:

  * **It chastises you** by saying,**** “This song is impossible to play. I’m a failure.”
  * **It fixates on negative memories** associated with music-making, such as the time you forgot your own lyrics during a performance. Your internal cynic says, “That night proves that you’re not meant to be a musician.”
  * **It worries excessively about negative scenarios** and**** fails to provide solutions for course correcting. It says, “You’ll probably never finish your album.”



(Shortform: While Kross identifies our internal cynic’s voice as a harmful influence, other experts emphasize that the real problem is our failure to question this voice. Why do people tend to believe their internal cynic? First, some people think that chastising self-talk keeps them humble. For instance, you might not question your internal mentor’s claim that you’re a musical failure because you think this claim prevents you from becoming obnoxiously confident. Second, some people view their negative self-talk as deserved punishment. For instance, you may think you _deserve_ to revisit negative memories or worry about the future as punishment for procrastinating on your album. Later, we’ll explore strategies for questioning your internal cynic.)

Let’s explore how over time, this internal cynic can harm your success, happiness, and health. We’ve organized its negative impacts into five effects.

##### Effect 1: Increasingly Negative Feelings

First, According to Kross, **your negative self-talk prompts a vicious cycle in your brain that makes you feel _worse_. **Let’s break down the steps in this cycle:

**Step 1: Negative self-talk stresses you out** or worsens your existing stress.

**Step 2: Your brain activates a threat response.** Your hypothalamus, a region in your brain, interprets your stress as a threat. To prepare your body to fight this perceived threat, the hypothalamus activates a threat response similar to the one you experience when facing a physical threat. This response sends hormones into your bloodstream that speed up your heartbeat, raise your blood pressure, and increase your energy levels.

**Step 3: Your brain’s threat response makes you feel worse,** which amplifies your negative self-talk. Your internal cynic reflects your increasingly negative feelings by becoming increasingly cynical.

> **How to Interrupt a Cycle of Negative Self-Talk**
> 
> Some psychologists claim that you can interrupt this cycle of negative self-talk through self-compassion: consciously engaging in gentle, kind self-talk. While Kross shares a variety of strategies for quieting your self-talk (which we’ll explore later), self-compassion isn’t a strategy he touches on.
> 
> To interrupt your negative self-talk with self-compassion, use any of the following strategies:
> 
> **Take deep breaths.** Research reveals that deep breathing reduces your body’s threat response.
> 
> **Question your internal cynic’s negative words.** First, write down your stream of negative self-talk. Then, evaluate what you wrote down by asking how true each statement is. This technique helps you identify negative self-talk that’s overly critical or exaggerated.
> 
> **Summon honest, optimistic thoughts to “talk back to” your negative self-talk.** For instance, imagine that a publisher rejected your manuscript. You may think, “I’ll never be a writer.” To combat this, summon a more honest, optimistic thought: “A lot of writers face rejections early in their career. I’ll keep sending my work to publishers—maybe there’s a publisher out there who would be thrilled to publish my work.”

##### Effect 2: Reduced Access to Your Skills

Negative self-talk not only makes you _feel_ worse—it also makes you _perform_ worse. Kross explains that **when your internal cynic plagues your mind, you lose access to some of your skills.** Specifically, you can lose access to automatic skills stored in your muscle memory (such as driving a car, dancing, or reading).

To understand why negative self-talk has this effect, we have to understand your brain’s _executive functions_. These are the jobs your brain performs to guide you through your day, such as shifting your attention to a new task and holding information temporarily in your mind. Kross explains that **when you’re immersed in negative self-talk, your brain—which has limited capacity—lacks enough energy to fully perform its executive functions.**

(Shortform note: If negative self-talk reduces your access to your skills, as Kross claims, is the opposite also true—that _positive_ self-talk makes you _more_ skillful? Research suggests that the answer is yes. For instance, a recent study found that basketball players who engage in positive self-talk make more free throw shots compared to players who don’t. Researchers theorize that positive self-talk increases a player’s ability to pay close attention to their shot. Since directing and sustaining your attention is one of your brain’s executive functions _,_ this research suggests that positive self-talk makes you more skillful via your executive functions.)

##### Effect 3: Social Isolation

Third, Kross argues that **your negative self-talk harms your social relationships and makes you feel isolated.** He describes two ways in which this happens:

**1) You behave aggressively.** Kross cites research revealing that people who repeatedly verbalize their negative self-talk are more likely to act aggressively. Negative self-talk multiplies our frustration, and we unfairly direct it toward others. (Shortform note: Acting aggressively may do more than harm your social relationships: In many countries, certain forms of aggression, like violence or intimidation, can have legal consequences.)

**2) You frustrate and repel others.** When you repeatedly share your negative self-talk with others (whether verbally or in writing), people may grow frustrated with your negativity and start avoiding you.

(Shortform note: Other experts identify more subtle, insidious ways that your negative self-talk can harm your relationships. For instance, your internal cynic may critique your choices, such as your choice of a romantic partner. You may worry excessively that you have poor judgment and chose a partner who’s not right for you. Furthermore, your negative self-talk may inundate you with thoughts that you’re unlovable. Both of these types of self-talk make it harder to commit to and experience intimacy with your partner. This in turn may lead to the effect Kross outlines here: your partner feeling _frustrated and repelled_ by your lack of commitment.)

##### Effect 4: Poor Mental Health

Kress contends that**negative self-talk also degrades your long-term mental health.** He explains that people who deal with depression and anxiety often have an overactive internal cynic.

(Shortform note: Research demonstrates the links between negative self-talk, mental health issues, and social isolation. Studies reveal that for some people with anxiety and depression, negative self-talk can cause them to self-isolate; for others, it can cause them to be overly negative, which drives others away. Both outcomes reduce a person’s access to a mental health support network. Later, we’ll explore Kross’s strategies for deepening your connections and access to your support network as a way to reduce your negative self-talk.)

##### Effect 5: Poor Physical Health

Lastly, Kross provides evidence that **negative self-talk also harms your physical health.** As previously noted, when you can’t switch off your internal cynic, your hypothalamus activates a threat response, quickening your heartbeat and releasing stress hormones. If your negative self-talk persists for too long, this physical threat response does as well. This causes problems related to chronic stress, such as heart problems and insomnia.

(Shortform note: Kross discusses the negative effects of self-talk on your physical health, but he doesn’t discuss ways to _manage_ symptoms of chronic stress. Experts recommend the following treatments: 1) improving your physical well-being (such as through exercise, getting plenty of sleep, and healthy eating); 2) improving your mental well-being (such as through mindfulness meditation and engaging in leisure activities); and 3) reducing stressors by learning strategies for time management and realistic goal-setting.)

### Part 3: How to Manage Your Negative Self-Talk

Kross argues that, fortunately, we can prevent our negative self-talk from interfering with our success, happiness, and health. He claims that **we can’t get rid of our internal cynic completely, but we can _quiet_ it and therefore reduce its power over us. **In this section, we’ll share five of Kross’s research-based strategies for quieting your negative self-talk.

> **Exploring and Questioning the Idea of Trying to Quiet Your Internal Cynic**
> 
> Kross doesn’t fully explain why quieting your internal cynic is the _best_ way to manage it, nor does he explain why we can’t silence our internal cynic completely. Let’s further explore these two claims.
> 
> **Claim 1: Quieting your negative self-talk is the best way to manage it.** We can infer that Kross believes quieting your internal cynic is an effective approach because doing so reduces the negative effects that we explored in the previous section. However, _quieting_ your internal cynic isn’t the _only_ way of managing your negative self-talk: Some experts argue that you should spend time _processing_ your negative self-talk, either instead of quieting it or before quieting it.
> 
> For instance, rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) is a type of therapy in which you investigate the beliefs that underlie your internal cynic’s words. A therapist who uses REBT may ask you to identify where those beliefs may have come from (such as a verbally abusive parent) as well as determine whether those beliefs are irrational or rational. Then, the therapist teaches you strategies for forming new beliefs. A possible benefit to this approach is that it pushes you to question and reformulate the underlying causes of your negative-self talk, which may help prevent negative self-talk in the future.
> 
> **Claim 2: You can’t silence your internal cynic completely.** Neuroscience supports Kross’s claim that you can’t turn off your internal cynic. Research reveals that your subconscious thoughts tend to bubble up into conscious thoughts without you directing them to do so. You can’t choose which thoughts bubble up—but you can choose how much attention you give them. This research particularly supports a strategy Kross shares for quieting your internal cynic: directing your attention elsewhere. We’ll explore this strategy next.

#### Strategy 1: Pursue Amazement

According to Kross, you can quiet your internal cynic by**directing your attention away from your negative self-talk and toward something amazing.** Kross explains that amazing experiences can quiet your inner cynic because they reduce brain activity associated with _self-immersion:_ getting lost in your thoughts, including negative self-talk.

(Shortform note: Amazing experiences also provide additional important benefits that Kross doesn’t mention. For instance, research reveals that experiencing amazement helps you feel like you have plenty of time. This may help reduce some of the stress you experience when you feel rushed. Furthermore, amazing experiences inspire creativity. Studies show that amazing experiences make you more open-minded about different perspectives.)

Here are four of Kross’s tips for seeking out amazing experiences:

**1) Notice everyday, incredible moments.** Enjoy the moment when your child uses a new word they’ve learned, or revel in the miraculous taste of your morning coffee. (Shortform note: In _The Book of Delights_ , poet and essayist Ross Gay offers a strategy for noticing and appreciating everyday, incredible moments (which he calls “delights”): Write about them. He resolved to write every day about delights, from a bright red flower shooting up from a crack in the asphalt to getting a cheerful text message from a friend. He claims that the act of noticing and writing about delights led him to notice and appreciate even _more_ everyday delights.)

**2) Enjoy some art.** Read a work of fiction, see a play, or attend a live performance. (Shortform note: Consider not only _appreciating_ amazing art but also _creating_ your own. Research reveals that making art (such as writing a song) increases blood flow to your brain’s reward center and lowers stress**.** Given the aforementioned links between experiencing stress and engaging in negative self-talk, stress-reducing art projects may also quiet your inner cynic.)

**3) Witness something mind-blowing.** Have a conversation with someone who survived a life-changing disaster or read a book about the neuroscience of octopi. (Shortform note: Research shows that mind-blowing experiences can increase your desire to connect positively with others. One study found that after participants viewed panoramic videos of Earth’s natural beauty, they were more social, more likely to volunteer, and more likely to donate money. This research suggests that witnessing something mind-blowing could prevent the social isolation negative self-talk creates.)

**4) Spend time near nature.** Go on a walk, visit an aquarium, or gaze at the night sky. (Shortform note: A recent study reveals that spending time in nature also improves your body image. Researchers theorize that being outdoors distances you from sources that tend to trigger negative thoughts about your body (such as social media). Improving your body image may in turn help to silence your inner critic, as critical thoughts about your body often manifest as negative self-talk.)

#### Strategy 2: Seek Out Actionable Empathy

When we’re struggling with something, many of us seek out others for emotional support. But Kross warns that **seeking support from other people can sometimes make you feel _worse_ and increase your negative self-talk. **

Why does this happen? Kross explains that support-seeking often results in what psychologists call _co-rumination_ : when the person supporting you asks too many questions about your challenge. Excessive questioning makes you re-experience the pain of the challenge _and_ resurfaces related, painful memories. This is because brains process thoughts by making associations: When you recall one negative memory, your brain resurfaces other, related negative memories. When you re-experience all these memories, your internal cynic grows louder, intensifying your negative emotions.

(Shortform note: Research supports Kross’s claim that co-rumination can make you feel worse. A recent experimental study found that co-rumination makes the person sharing their problem feel more stressed and upset. Researchers also found that co-rumination causes a physical threat response that may harm your health in the long term, underscoring Kross’s claim that you should avoid it.)

According to Kross, **you can limit co-rumination and quiet your internal cynic by** **seeking out _actionable empathy:_** when someone offers you empathy _and_ provides solutions to your challenge. They show empathy by validating the difficulty of your situation and the emotions it’s giving you. Then, instead of engaging in co-rumination by asking you too many reflective questions about your situation, they instead offer advice. This advice prevents you from revisiting painful memories and directs your attention toward a more hopeful future.

(Shortform note: Kross describes the method and benefits of actionable empathy, but he doesn't provide strategies for explicitly requesting this specific type of support. According to experts, you should use direct, assertive language to specify what type of support you need. For instance, imagine that your friend is providing you with emotional support after a rough breakup, and you notice the two of you are co-ruminating. You might tell your friend, “I think I’m done re-hashing the breakup. Can we shift to brainstorming ways I can make it through the next several weeks?”)

#### Strategy 3: Adopt a New Perspective

Seeking out actionable empathy works if you have access to others—but what if you’re by yourself and you need relief from your internal cynic? Kross claims that **you can quiet your internal cynic by adopting a new perspective.** This allows you to get outside of your head, bringing you clarity and a break from your body’s threat response. In this section, we’ll share four of Kross’s tips for quieting your internal cynic by adopting a new perspective.

##### Tip 1: Think of Your Problem as a Project

First, according to Kross, studies reveal that you can **reduce your brain’s threat response by thinking of your problem as a _project_ instead of a threat. **When you approach your problem as a project that will develop your skills, you call upon your internal mentor, whose encouragement can drown out your internal cynic.

For instance, imagine you’re an organizer for housing justice and you’re feeling discouraged by your city’s lack of affordable housing. Instead of framing this as a threat to your coalition’s goals, think of it as a project that’ll push you and your coalition to develop new skills and tactics.

(Shortform note: Experts on public speaking offer wisdom that may further explain why it’s effective to reframe your problem as a project. When preparing for a speech or performance, experts recommend channeling nervous energy into excitement because it’s easier than trying to achieve calmness. This is because nervousness and excitement are more similar feelings than nervousness and calmness. This advice overlaps with Kross’s: Reframing your nervousness as excitement and reframing your problem as a challenge both involve _accepting_ and _embracing_ your energy level instead of trying to alter it.)

##### Tip 2: Compare Your Present to the Past

Kross claims that **you can also quiet your internal cynic by comparing your present situation to other challenges you’ve endured in the past.** Remembering these past successes offers hope that you’re capable of persisting through your current challenge. These feelings of hope can transform your internal cynic into an internal mentor.

For example, imagine you’re having trouble setting boundaries with a family member and your internal cynic is chastising you for being a pushover. To counteract this negativity, remind yourself of times in the past when you’ve effectively set boundaries with other people.

(Shortform note: During stressful moments when your internal cynic is reverberating in your mind and taking over your thoughts, it might be hard to focus enough to recall past challenges and follow Kross’s advice to compare them to your present. To make it easier to use Kross’s method in these difficult moments, start a list of your past challenges and accomplishments. Keep the list accessible so you don’t have to hunt it down next time you need it. For instance, keep the list at the top of your phone’s notes app or keep it in a small journal on your desk.)

##### Tip 3: Imagine How You’ll Feel in the Future

If comparing your current situation to the past doesn’t provide relief, look to the future instead. Kross claims **that you can quiet your negative self-talk by imagining a positive future**. Consider how you’ll feel about your current situation in one month, a year, and 10 years. Contextualizing your present in your future can trigger the hopeful realization that your current situation is temporary. As previously noted, hopefulness hushes your internal cynic.

(Shortform note: This strategy resembles one of the central tenets of Buddhist philosophy: that everything—including negative experiences—is impermanent. According to experts on Buddhist wisdom, remembering this tenet can help you endure difficult moments. Tell yourself, “These difficult emotions will pass.” The idea of impermanence also applies to positive experiences, which may feel disappointing: We often want positive moments to last forever. Buddhist leaders such as the Dalai Lama claim that you can deal with the impermanence of positive experiences by reminding yourself to savor them.)

##### Tip 4: Avoid Using the “I” Pronoun in Your Self-Talk

A final way to adopt a new perspective is to shift the pronouns your internal voice uses. Kross claims that **the pronouns you use in your self-talk affect the power of your internal cynic.** People who address themselves using the first-person pronoun “I” experience more negative emotions than people who address themselves using different pronouns. Pronouns other than “I,” such as “he,” “she,” “they,” and “you,” give you distance from your current situation, preventing you from losing yourself in negative emotions that fuel your negative self-talk. When you use these other pronouns, your brain’s threat response is less activated.

(Shortform note: Kross’s suggestion that you shift the pronouns in your self-talk suggests that you have some degree of control over what your internal voice says and how it says it. However, as previously noted, some experts claim that we can’t control which thoughts arise in our minds. This suggests that you can’t prevent your internal voice from using the negative “I” pronoun when the voice first arises. Therefore, think of Kross’s pronoun-replacing strategy as one you employ _after_ your internal cynic says something negative using the “I” pronoun.)

> **Combining Kross’s Pronoun-Replacing Strategy With His Other Strategies**
> 
> Although Kross doesn’t say so in his book, it may work well to combine his pronoun-replacing strategy with his other perspective-adopting strategies. Since each strategy targets your internal cynic in a slightly different way, combining them may increase your ability to quiet your internal cynic. To try this, avoid using first-person pronouns when using Kross’s first three perspective-adopting strategies. We’ll illustrate how to do so using this scenario: You did poorly on your job’s first performance review.
> 
>   * Use second-person pronouns to **think of your problem as a project.** Tell yourself, “You have a number of areas of growth, and making progress on these will both strengthen your skills _and_ impress your superiors.”
> 
>   * Use third-person pronouns to **compare your present to the past.** Tell yourself, “In her previous job, she also had a rocky start. She improved her skills in that job, so she can improve her skills in this one, too.”
> 
>   * Use second-person pronouns to **imagine how you’ll feel in the future.** Tell yourself, “The embarrassment of receiving a negative review will eventually pass, and then you’ll be able to focus on making improvements based on your boss’s advice.”

#### Strategy 4: Increase Your Sense of Control

According to Kross, **you can also quiet your internal cynic by increasing your sense of control.** Any time your internal cynic takes over, you feel overwhelmed by its voice and lose your sense of control. Strategies that replenish your sense of control give you hope that you can steer your future toward a positive outcome.

One way to regain control, Kross claims, is to organize your time and your physical space. For example, organize your time by making a schedule for your day or week. You can organize your space on a small scale (such as sorting your desktop files into folders) or on a large scale (such as cleaning your home).

(Shortform note: If your life is particularly busy, it can be hard to find time to replenish your sense of control by organizing your time and physical space. One technique for making this happen is scheduling time to devote to these tasks. First, consider setting aside 15 minutes each day to declutter your physical space. Some experts claim that you’re more likely to declutter if you do a little bit every day instead of waiting to do it all in one day. Second, commit to organizing your time by creating a consistent daily routine that prioritizes important tasks and also includes times for breaks. Experts claim that daily schedules save you mental energy because it’s mentally taxing to formulate a new schedule from scratch every day.)

#### Strategy 5: Engage in Rituals

Finally, according to Kross, rituals—from wearing a lucky hat to uttering a prayer—quiet our internal cynic. Kross explains that **rituals combine the benefits of multiple other strategies that also reduce negative self-talk**(some of which we discussed in earlier sections). Let’s explore three reasons why rituals are effective at quieting your internal cynic.

##### Reason 1: Rituals Often Involve Our Communities

Kross claims that rituals that involve other people, such as religious ceremonies, quiet our negative self-talk. This is because **other people can reduce feelings of isolation and help us cope with negative emotions.**

(Shortform note: Kross doesn’t explicitly explore why spending time with others reduces your negative self-talk, but we can infer that it accomplishes this in two ways. First, spending time with others reduces your self-immersion by directing your thoughts away from your cyclical self-talk and toward socializing. Second, community rituals can expose you to your support network, which increases your access to actionable empathy.)

##### Reason 2: Rituals Direct Our Attention Elsewhere

Kross also argues that **rituals require you to channel your brain power _away_ from negative self-talk and _toward_ the steps in the ritual behavior. **For instance, imagine you’re one half of a comedy duo. You and your partner engage in the following ritual before every performance: You drink a shot of soju, do a secret handshake, then look into each other’s eyes and exclaim, “You’re the funniest person I know!” This ritual distracts you from your internal cynic’s worries that you’ll freeze on stage and fail to deliver a funny routine.

(Shortform note: Rituals may be particularly effective before you engage in some sort of performance. While Kross focuses on the ways that rituals distract you from negative self-talk, other neuroscientists emphasize that rituals reduce overall performance anxiety. When you perform a ritual before a performance (such as a comedy act or a sports game), you experience less anxiety if you fail during the performance (for instance, by botching a joke or missing a goal).)

##### Reason 3: Rituals Give You a Sense of Control

Finally, according to Kross, **rituals give you a sense of control.** As we discussed earlier, having a sense of control reduces your internal cynic’s power over you. Kross elaborates that rituals create a sense of control because they’re a type of _placebo_.__ A placebo is something that you _believe_ will help you, even if there’s nothing specifically about the placebo itself that helps you. Believing in a placebo reassures you that the future will be better, which quiets your internal cynic’s pessimistic worries. Furthermore, when you believe a placebo will make things better, your brain’s threat response decreases.

For instance, imagine that you’re in the process of searching for a new job, and you develop the ritual of listening to your favorite song before each interview. Even if there’s nothing about the song itself that reduces your nerves, your _belief_ that it reduces your nerves gives you a sense of control. This sense of control quiets your internal cynic before and during your interviews.

(Shortform note: You may find it hard to commit to a ritual that you _know_ is a placebo: It may feel hard to “trick” yourself into believing it’ll help you if you know the ritual isn’t _inherently_ helpful. Therefore, consider engaging in rituals that provide _other_ clear benefits. You’ll engage in the ritual to experience _those_ benefits, then you may also __ experience the benefit Kross names—an increased sense of control, which can quiet your internal cynic. For instance, engage in a gratitude ritual every evening. Reflect on three things from your day that you’re grateful for. Research reveals that feelings of gratitude boost your well-being. The sense of control this ritual provides you with may also help quiet your negative self-talk.)
