## Exercise: Practice Gratitude and Focus on What’s Going Well

Shetty claims that the more you practice feeling gratitude, the easier you find it to remain positive and take advantage of opportunities that align with your values.

* * *

Consider your experiences over this past week and write down five things that you have to be grateful for. For example, you might feel thankful for the affection you got from your kids, the coffee your colleague brought to your desk, or the smile from your bus driver on a rainy day.

Think of an experience in your life that you initially thought of as a problem or a failure. List all of the ways this experience benefited you. For example, perhaps you lost your job but eventually moved onto a role that felt more satisfying to you.

Now think of a current problem or fear in your life. Imagine how you might feel grateful for this challenge once it has passed. For example, if you’re having a difficult time with your partner, you may strengthen your relationship once you work through your problems.

List several reminders you’ll use to take the time to practice gratitude every day. For example, making space for thankful thoughts in your daily journal or setting an alarm on your phone to stop and acknowledge the good things in your life.
