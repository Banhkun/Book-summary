## 1-Page Summary

In _Coach the Person, Not the Problem_ , Marcia Reynolds seeks to expand people’s understanding of coaching. She argues that coaching is a partnership in which coaches help clients examine and challenge deep-seated beliefs that limit them, rather than a surface level, problem-solving exercise in which an expert doles out advice.

Reynolds is a leadership and executive coach who hit rock bottom in a jail cell on drug abuse charges at age 20. Upon release, she began advising people on how to make positive change in their lives, but grew frustrated when she discovered that people easily fall back into old habits. She discovered that lasting change comes only when people confront the underlying assumptions and emotions that have led them into the same, problematic situations time and again.

Reynolds went on to earn master's degrees in education and communications as well as a doctoral degree in organizational psychology. She has worked with corporate clients including AT&T and American Express, as well as universities and government agencies. Reynolds has served as the global president and the global director of the International Coach Federation, and her other books include _The Discomfort Zone_ , _Wander Woman, and Outsmart Your Brain: How to Master Your Mind When Emotions Take the Wheel_.

This guide is broken into two parts:

  * Part 1 examines what coaching is and the mindsets and skills required of clients and coaches to work together effectively.
  * Part 2 outlines four essential coaching practices to support clients’ work to make positive change. 



In addition, we provide perspectives from other coaches and experts that support, counter, and contextualize Reynolds’ work.

Note: Throughout this guide we’ll refer to “you” as the coach.

### Part 1: Coaching: What It Is and What It Requires

In this first section, we’ll examine Reynolds’ definition of coaching, mindsets that clients and coaches need to have a productive working relationship, and skills required for coaches to work effectively with clients.

#### What Is Coaching?

Reynolds argues that coaching is a partnership aimed at helping clients root out underlying reasons for why they feel stuck and helping them to move forward in their professional or personal lives. A coach’s role is to support clients in a deep investigative process to identify and challenge assumptions that underlie their beliefs and limit their progress—not be an expert who doles out advice or solves clients’ problems from on high. She says that coaches view clients as capable of making change when given the proper support and tools.

(Shortform note: The coach-client partnership Reynolds recommends is broadly understood as best practice, but some coaches offer more detailed insight than Reynolds into why it can be challenging not to take on a stronger, less balanced role of “guide” with clients: Coaches are trained to take an impartial view of clients’ goals and share insights and observations from a place of non-attachment. This essentially suggests that coaches should have no feeling about whether a client accepts, rejects, or ignores their feedback. But the truth is, coaches are invested in their clients’ well-being and, like all humans, have egos and want to feel validated, so rejection of their feedback can hurt—all of which is a lot to process.)

Note: Reynolds doesn’t specify the type of coaching her book advocates, but her background is in leadership and executive coaching, so we can intuit that her strategies and recommendations are useful for people doing related work.

#### Required Mindsets for Clients and Coaches

Reynolds argues that coaching should only begin after prospective clients and coaches have established a clear, mutual understanding of the nature of their work together and their respective roles.

Before you begin sessions with a client, ensure that they’re looking for a coach, not some other type of professional or non-professional relationship, for help. You can determine this by asking what kind of support they think will be most helpful to them. If the client indicates that they’re looking for a shoulder to cry on, someone to vent to or fix their problems, or someone who will just listen to them, they’re better off talking with a mentor or a therapist, not a coach. Reynolds says that clues that clients are looking for a coach include their saying that they need help making a decision or moving forward in a situation, but feel overwhelmed, don’t know all their options or which steps to take first, or fear they’ll make a bad decision.

Once you’ve determined that a client wants a coach, assess your readiness to coach them. You’ll know you’re ready when you:

  * Believe the client has the basic skills and ability to self-reflect and choose the best path forward when provided support
  * Feel you can partner with them to help them identify and achieve their goals without imposing a specific agenda on their behalf
  * Want them to succeed



> **How Clients Can Make the Most of Coaching**
> 
> Others agree with Reynolds’ assertion that coaches and clients have to be on the same page about their relationship and respective roles, asserting that if clients are looking for someone to listen to their problems and examine their feelings, they should go to a therapist instead of a coach. They should also hold onto their money and avoid coaches if they:
> 
>   * Are looking for specific technical training that’s better found with a teacher or trainer who has expertise in their area of interest
> 
>   * Think that coaches will make their problems disappear overnight
> 
>   * Feel that a prospective coach isn’t truly invested in their success.
> 
> 

> 
> Once a client has decided that they want to be coached, they can make the most of sessions by spending five-to-10 minutes preparing for each meeting. This should include asking themselves questions such as: “How am I feeling right now?” What is and isn’t working well?” and “What do I want to achieve in this session?” Collecting their thoughts in advance will prevent them from drifting through sessions without a clear focus.
> 
> Clients should also enter each session committed to making the most of it. This means showing up to each session they’ve committed to, not holding anything back, and choosing to go deep into their experience to make the most of it.

Upon determining that you and your client are ready for a coaching relationship, discuss expectations. Clarify that you’re in a partnership where your role is to help them identify and address the root of challenges they face, and their role is to engage openly and wholeheartedly in that process. This will require that they:

  * Respond to your reflections and in-depth questioning, even when it’s uncomfortable
  * Be honest and explore things they may not currently be aware of or fully understand
  * Show up to sessions prepared to work and follow through on actions they’ve committed to taking between sessions
  * Set aside time before and after sessions to think about what they want to accomplish, what they’ve learned, and what else they want to know



(Shortform note: Experts say there are other key expectations you should set with clients from the outset, including how much time a week they can spend with you—particularly if your rates are low. For example, you might only be able to offer 30-minute sessions per week but have unlimited email availability. It can also help to tell clients what to expect if they’re unhappy with your services. For example, you should tell them if you provide refunds or a money back guarantee, and how and in what period of time you make those things available.)

#### Required Skills for Coaches

As you prepare to coach, you should be attuned to two skills that will help you do your job more effectively: Being in the correct mental state and being an active, empathic listener.

##### Skill 1: Be in the Correct Mental State

Reynolds says that strong coaches are fully “in the moment” in their sessions. This means a) **being constantly attuned to what your client is experiencing, what you’re experiencing, and the dynamic between you** and b) allowing and welcoming whatever arises in your session to unfold organically. Being in the moment allows you to meaningfully connect with your client and fosters an atmosphere that encourages them to be open.

(Shortform note: Experts expand upon Reynolds’ recommendation to be mindful of your client’s and your individual and shared experience, asserting that when you “hold space” for your client, yourself, and the coaching process, you build a vital three-way partnership. Holding space means taking the time to honor and reflect upon your client’s work without attachment or the feeling that you have to rush their—or your—process to fit a particular coaching model. By giving your client and yourself the space necessary to reflect together, you show respect for and strengthen your journey together.)

Reynolds says you can be in the moment during each coaching session by consciously reminding yourself to:

  * Choose one or two emotions that will best serve your client and keep you focused and present. For example, if your client is temperamentally anxious and negative, you might choose to be calm and positive.
  * Be a partner who sees your client’s strengths.



Choosing your emotions and focusing on what your client brings to the table will keep you, and them, in a balanced, open state that’s conducive to learning, understanding, and growth.

(Shortform note: Existential-Humanistic (EH) therapy takes a similar approach to the mindful work that Reynolds advocates for in coaching. A core practice of EH therapists—who believe in the inherent worth of all clients, including those deemed too wounded to heal—is being fully engaged in the present moment during sessions. One way they do this is by embracing silence unless or until they or their client have something relevant to offer, which encourages a deeper focus on clients’ immediate experience. EH therapists strive to remain present as clients work through the unknown to greater clarity, trusting that the necessary answers will reveal themselves through revelations that arise in the moment.)

Reynolds says that when you find your mind wandering during sessions, you can recenter yourself and connect with your physical body by releasing tension from areas where you feel it. For example, relax your shoulders or unclench your fists or jaw. You can also draw your attention to details of objects immediately in front of you. For example, notice the shape and color of the leaves on a plant in the room, or study the pattern on the rug at your feet. If you find your mind wandering, think to yourself, “Ah, my mind’s wandering,” then return to noticing the physical objects in front of you.

(Shortform note: Experts say that staying focused on the subject at hand is important not just for coaches, but for clients. Clients can avoid becoming distracted during sessions by taking a minute to be still before each meeting, turning off their phones, and taking notes on paper. They can also practice being present in their day-to-day life, which will carry into their coaching sessions. Some practices to improve this include putting your hands in water and focusing on how it feels on your fingertips and palms, picking up and noticing the weight and size of different objects, and holding a piece of ice and thinking about how it feels as it melts.)

##### Skill 2: Be an Active, Empathic Listener

Reynolds says that in addition to being mindful during coaching sessions, you should be an active listener who carefully observes and works to understand and validate what clients are saying. Different from casual listening—a process that centers around information gathering and often ends with giving answers to surface-level problems—active, empathic listening allows you to develop deeper connections and communicate to your client that you care about them. This bolsters your relationship and helps you grow and learn from one another.

(Shortform note: Science supports Reynolds’ call to be an active, empathic listener: In one study, research subjects rated evaluators who they perceived as actively listening to them more favorably, and neural activity in their brain was enhanced when they perceived they were being listened to actively—suggesting that they processed the action as rewarding.)

Reynolds says you can be an active, empathic listener during sessions by centering yourself, letting go of preconceived notions and judgments about your client, and being genuinely curious about them. To do this, when you enter coaching sessions you should:

  * Clear your brain of random thoughts.
  * Remind yourself that your goal is to be open and compassionate.
  * Release the ideas that you fully know your client, what they’re going to say next, and that your opinion is right and theirs is wrong.
  * Trust feelings you get when you notice shifts in your client’s emotions and behavior, which can indicate that something deeper is going on that could benefit from further exploration. 



(Shortform note: Therapists say there’s another way to get into an active, empathic listener mindset: Develop your “third ear”. The third ear is the ability to step back in a counseling session and consciously tune into your client’s emotions, your reactions, and the overall feeling of whether you’re in sync or if one of you is distracted or rambling. Developing your third ear grounds you in the reality of the moment, enabling you to be more present and listen in an authentically engaged way. You can cultivate your third ear by observing people in conversation, for example at a park or restaurant, and noticing shifts in their emotional dynamics, like when they agree, disagree, or look engaged or distracted.)

Reynolds notes that it’s particularly important to not judge or allow bias to interfere with your work with clients. You can curb these tendencies by acknowledging that you judge and have biases. Recognizing this truth allows you to stay attuned to and recenter yourself when you’re aware that you’re judging clients during sessions. It will also remind you that your job is not to judge your clients from on high, but to partner with and help them leverage their strengths to achieve their goals.

You can practice tuning into—then letting go of—your judgmental tendencies by:

  * Being kind to, rather than criticizing, yourself when you become aware that you’ve just had a judgmental thought (because judging is a normal, human reaction)
  * Asking yourself where a judgmental thought came from once you realize you’ve had one
  * Welcoming the idea that your judgmental thought isn’t necessarily correct and being open to learning things that could change or correct that thought



(Shortform note: Reynolds says that coaches should acknowledge that they’re judgmental to prevent that judgment from negatively impacting clients’ progress. In _Girl, Wash Your Face_ , Rachel Hollis shows that being judgmental is a universal problem and one that women, in particular, should confront so it doesn’t ruin their friendships. Hollis argues that women should judge less and support each other more by focusing on each other’s hearts, character, and experience rather than hair and clothes. Like Reynolds, Hollis argues that change begins with acknowledging that everyone judges, then recognizing that your opinion is not always the “correct” or the only one out there.)

### Part 2: Four Essential Coaching Practices

We’ve discussed what coaching is, the mindset that you and your clients need to have a successful working relationship, and key skills required to be a strong, effective coach. Now we’ll do a deeper dive into the “reflective inquiry” process and four practices that Reynolds says coaches should employ to make the most of coaching sessions.

**_Reflective inquiry_ is a practice coaches use to reflect back information or emotions to clients to help them identify and examine deep-seated assumptions that underlie beliefs that hold them back**. The process centers on restating what clients have said in different words—for example by summarizing or paraphrasing—pointing out shifts in clients’ emotions, and asking follow-up questions to probe for deeper truths about why clients believe and act as they do.

(Shortform note: Reynolds says that education reformer John Dewey originally defined the term “reflective inquiry” in his 1910 book, _How We Think_. Dewey rejected the idea of unloading information into students’ brains and having them regurgitate their memorized learnings. Instead, he believed that engaging students in a combination of critical thinking, thoughtful questions, and dialogue would help them more deeply investigate ideas, broaden their thinking, and make better decisions. Some conservative scholars have argued that this approach undermines instruction that develops character by encouraging teachers to abandon their role as guides and allow children to follow their impulses.)

Reynolds says that reflecting back clients’ words allows them to more objectively hear what they’ve said, examine and clarify their thoughts, and consider how their underlying assumptions and emotions influence their perceptions and behaviors. The reflective inquiry process jolts clients out of a state of automatic thought and into a deeper level of self-inquiry and reflection that can prompt them to think more expansively about how to move forward. She says that when clients understand why they think and act the way they do, they’re more likely to make lasting change than if you simply provide them with an answer to the problem they’ve presented to you.

(Shorform note: The benefits of reflecting back what people have said appear to have scientific backing: A 2012 study of the effects of empathic paraphrasing found that when researchers paraphrased participants’ responses to questions about a social conflict they’d experienced, participants reported feeling less negative. Researchers concluded from this that demonstrating cognitive empathy through paraphrasing can regulate negative emotions in the short term, possibly because it stimulates a deeper level of emotional processing that helps people transform and resolve conflict.)

Reynolds argues that coaching and reflective inquiry are critical because nobody can transform their thinking in a vacuum. She says that no matter how rational you think you are, most people don’t make decisions rationally and many blame others for their problems. As a result, it’s helpful to have another voice in the room, such as a coach, to support clients as they challenge their assumptions and expand their beliefs.

(Shortform note: The International Coaching Federation (ICF) expands on Reynolds’ assertion that coaching and reflective inquiry help clients make progress by de-siloing their thinking, arguing that creativity also plays an important role in clients’ growth and transformation. According to the ICF, a critical part of the coach-client partnership is helping clients reconnect with creativity, which they say is increasingly lost in a world that values conformity and productivity over reflection and innovation. When coaches tap into clients’ creativity by challenging and expanding their thinking, they give them the chance to experiment with new perspectives that help them adapt to and tackle challenges more effectively.)

#### Practice 1: Focus on Clients’ Underlying Beliefs, Not Their Surface-Level Problems

Reynolds argues that your top priority during sessions is to stay focused on helping your client **address deeply held assumptions, beliefs, and emotions that hinder their progress** —not fixing surface-level problems they present to you. Focusing on clients’ deeper beliefs and emotions helps them see how particular beliefs and emotions lead them into the same problems and undesirable situations over and over again. Then, they can view those problems and situations differently, expand their understanding of themselves, and make lasting change. In contrast, providing solutions to surface-level problems will address the issue at hand, but it won’t help your client understand why they repeatedly confront the same problem that masks itself in different forms.

(Shortform note: A different way of thinking about the interplay of beliefs, emotions, and behavior is through the lens of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a technique premised on the idea that clients can make positive behavioral changes by identifying and replacing negative, limiting thoughts with accurate, productive ones—a process that fuels a continuous cycle of cognitive and mood improvements.)

Reynolds acknowledges that examining clients’ underlying beliefs is an uncomfortable process because it requires clients to be vulnerable and coaches to delve into emotionally precarious terrain. But surfacing uncomfortable feelings and truths is the only way to help clients see that **their inaccurate beliefs and challenging emotions are the source of their struggle to make decisions and take action** in their lives.

(Shortform note: The issue of client vulnerability exists not just in coaching but in counseling professions, which historically were not as receptive to clients exposing their raw emotions as they are today. In _Nonviolent Communication_ , Marshall B. Rosenberg argues that until the mid-20th century, the cardinal rule of psychotherapy was clinical detachment. Therapists were trained in analysis, not empathy, and taught to respond to clients who expressed vulnerability with cool detachment, which discouraged them from sharing more.)

You can stay focused on clients’ underlying assumptions by reminding yourself as you enter sessions of core principles of the coach-client relationship that de-emphasize surface-level problem-solving, including that you’re a partner who’s there to help your fully competent client explore deeper beliefs, not an expert who’s there to solve their problems.

#### Practice 2: Reflect Back Clients’ Words and Emotions

Reynolds says that **reflecting clients’ words and emotions back to them allows clients to more objectively see and examine underlying factors that limit them** and consider new ways forward. The process begins with summarizing or rephrasing important points that your client makes, then asking follow-up questions and reflecting back emotions the client surfaces.

(Shortform note: Therapists support Reynolds’ approach for going deeper, asserting that when you listen to understand rather than respond to clients you make them feel heard and validated, which can give you more insight into the challenges they face. Similar to Reynolds, they say you can go deeper with clients by putting aside your personal feelings and agenda, suspending judgment, focusing on the other person’s perspective, asking open-ended questions to enhance your understanding of what they’re saying, and summarizing and validating what they’ve said.)

##### Reflect Back by Summarizing and Asking Follow-Up Questions

Reynolds says the first step of reflecting back is to **verbally summarize your client’s key points, then add short, clarifying questions to get a deeper understanding of what they’re thinking and feeling**. As you do this, you should allow room for your client to fill in the blanks and add additional details and explanation. This back-and-forth dialogue ensures that you have an accurate understanding of your client's position while revealing deeper motivations and emotions that your client is experiencing (perhaps subconsciously). By demonstrating to your client that you’re present and listening rather than jumping to conclusions, you'll receive helpful information that will enable you to guide them to their own realizations.

(Shortform note: Therapists assert that reflecting back is a component of “validation in therapy,” a process that helps clients see that their words and experiences matter and are being taken seriously, and that their behavior—even if inappropriate—is understandable. The process has been found to improve client outcomes and build trust and strengthen the therapeutic alliance between counselors and clients.)

To get the most out of summarizing and questioning, frame your questions to solicit the following information, which will help you help your client home in on the source of the challenges they’re facing and identify goals to move forward:

  * What are your client's needs and wants? Which of these are most important to them?
  * Do they believe they can achieve these things? 
  * What do they fear will happen if they don't achieve their needs and wants?
  * What has your client already tried, and when? What was the result?
  * Why is your client choosing now, of all times, to ask for help?



Summarizing what your client has said interrupts their automatic thought process, giving them the chance to pause and consider a) whether your synopsis is accurate and b) the underlying meaning of the thought or belief they shared. Reynolds says that summarizing entails three skills: recapping, paraphrasing, and encapsulating.

(Shortform note: In _The Coaching Habit_ , Michael Bungay Stanier adds that a good question gets to the point without feeling like it came out of a coaching manual. He recommends starting by simply asking, “What’s on your mind?,” then following up with, “Anything else?,” “What’s your central challenge?,” and, “What do you want?” Like Reynolds, he argues that coaches should trust in people’s ability to identify and rectify their challenges, and he says you can communicate this trust by asking: “How can I support you?” rather than stepping in and fixing their problems.)

**Recapping** is when you provide highlights of the issue, problem, or reason your client says they’re having difficulty making a decision or taking an action. It allows you to clarify and make sure you understand the full picture of what your client’s saying.

Reynolds recommends that you use the same words your client has used if their language is strong, for example, if they say they “hate” or think something’s “idiotic” or “wish” someone would do something. Mirroring their words allows you to tap into deeper emotions closer to the root of the issues they’re struggling with.

**Paraphrasing** is when you interpret and restate what your client said using different words. Paraphrasing allows your client to evaluate the meaning of their words and emotions and, if they don’t agree with how you’ve framed what they said, to correct or clarify what they meant.

Reynolds says that because paraphrasing is an _interpretation_ of what a client has said, you should be mindful to stay true to what you believe they meant. Guessing what they were thinking based on your personal experiences loads external meaning and judgments onto the situation. This pulls you out of the reflective inquiry process, turning you away from the important role of a partner who sees their client’s greatest potential.

**Encapsulating** is when you sum up your client’s story in a handful of words. When you encapsulate, clients can agree or disagree with your framing, clarify what they meant, expand upon what they want or need to address, and decide on a particular direction to pursue. Ways that you can encapsulate a client’s story include:

  * Stating a bottom line. For example: “Bottom line, you want to leave your wife but are worried about how she’ll react.” 
  * Making distinctions. For example: “When you say you’re _‘done’_ with your wife’s terrible behavior, are you saying you’re annoyed with how she acts or you’re thinking about leaving her?”



> **Another Use for Listening Tools**
> 
> Reynolds presents summarizing tools such as recapping, paraphrasing, and encapsulating as ways to get at clients’ underlying motivations, but you can also use them to ameliorate coaching conversations that take a turn for the worse.
> 
> In _Crucial Conversations_ , Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Et Al. explore four listening tools that can help you re-engage someone who’s shut down or blown up: Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, and Prime (AMPP). The first three of these tools correspond to Reynolds’s questioning, recapping, paraphrasing, and encapsulating techniques, whereas priming actually contradicts some of her advice:
> 
> **Ask:** When someone acts out by going silent or responding to you aggressively, you can bring them back into the fold by first asking what their concerns are from a place of genuine curiosity, to let them know you care about their thoughts and feelings.
> 
> **Mirror:** When the person responds, you can reflect back their feelings through the act of mirroring. This can illuminate inconsistencies in their words and behavior. Like recapping, mirroring can help you tap deeper into what someone’s thinking and feeling.
> 
> **Paraphrase:** When you have a sense of what’s triggered the person who’s upset, paraphrasing and encapsulating their story allows you to acknowledge and ensure that you clearly understand what they’ve said. Though Reynolds doesn’t make explicit note of this, Patterson, Grenney et al. assert that paraphrasing can cultivate a sense of safety for the aggrieved party by showing that you understand their troubles.
> 
> **Priming:** Finally, if the person isn’t sharing and you feel you’ve hit a wall with them, you can encourage them to open up by offering a guess at what they might be feeling. Whereas Reynolds says you _shouldn’t_ guess at what a client’s thinking or feeling, because it risks loading your external judgments onto their situation, Patterson, Grenny et al. assert that doing so encourages them to open up and share information with you.

##### Reflect Back by Pointing Out Clients’ Emotions

Reynolds says that when clients are talking you should pay close attention to subtle changes in their emotions and behavior, which can signal that they’re feeling something different from what they’re saying. **Drawing clients’ attention to these emotional and behavioral shifts gives them the opportunity to pause, consider how they truly feel, and identify deeper reasons** that they’re having difficulty making decisions or taking actions that move them forward.

(Shortform note: Reynolds says that pointing out clients’ emotions can help them dig deeper into their thoughts and beliefs, enabling revelations. In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves argue that emotionally intelligent people are already tuned into this deeper level of self-awareness and can recognize patterns of their own behavior that are limiting, reflect on the reasons underlying their emotional responses, and understand factors that do and don’t motivate them. This kind of self-awareness can make decision-making and collaborating with others easier, because emotions aren’t clouding their judgment or interfering with their ability to function effectively.)

Reynolds recommends three tips to reflect your clients’ emotions back to them in a way that will encourage them to examine their beliefs more deeply:

**1) Point out emotional shifts** , including changes in your client’s energy, tone of voice, and inflections and pace of their speech. For example, you might say: “I notice that you just got quiet. Can you tell me where your thoughts are right now?” or, “You’re laughing but it sounds like nervous laughter. Can you help me understand where that’s coming from?”

**2) Allow your client to experience their emotions without judgment**. You should accept—not try to change, ameliorate or interpret—whatever emotion your client displays. Your goal is to simply reflect your client’s emotional shifts back to them in as emotionally neutral and balanced a way as possible, so your client feels safe being vulnerable with you.

**3) Be inquisitive**. Being constantly curious about your client communicates that you’re interested in them. It can also ground you and help you navigate uncomfortable moments with your client. For example, if your client becomes upset or defensive, or if you find yourself feeling annoyed by or judgmental toward something your client says, it’s time to tap back into your curiosity and dig deeper into why they feel the way they do, to recenter yourself so you don’t introduce unhelpful feelings and beliefs into your session.

(Shortform note: Experts add to Reynolds’ suggestions for engaging clients emotionally by recommending that white practitioners working with clients of color take steps to engage in culturally competent practices. This begins with acknowledging, when relevant to your work together, that it will be helpful for you to better understand challenges your client faces as a person of color—for instance, whether they feel comfortable taking risks at work, and if there are places and times when they feel their voice is overlooked or misrepresented. Listening actively and not judging or responding reactively can demonstrate your interest in your client’s experience and build trust.)

#### Practice 3: Disrupt and Unpack Clients’ Narratives

Reynolds says that humans are meaning-making machines and that **each of us constructs narratives to a) understand the world and ourselves and b) justify our circumstances**. She says that we mistake these narratives for objective “reality,” when in fact they’re based on our personal experiences, social needs, and values.

**Social needs** are what each person requires to connect with others and have a sense of well-being, like wanting to feel safe, accepted, valued, and in control. Reynolds says that unmet social needs are often at the heart of problems that clients present.

**Personal values** are a person’s most strongly held, often inflexible, beliefs about what’s important in life—for example, family, power, religion or freedom.

Reynolds says that social needs and personal values shape our biases, beliefs, and assumptions, which serve as the glue that holds our narratives together. These needs and values also compose and form our identities, which harden over time, making change difficult.

(Shortform note: Whereas Reynolds sees rigid values as an obstacle to change, in _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins offers a different view. He proposes that there are two types of values: ends and means. _Ends_ are emotional states you hope to experience that make life fulfilling, such as happiness, love, and security. _Means_ are how you expect to achieve those ends. For example, one of your values might be “family,” which is the vehicle through which you expect to find happiness and love. For Robbins, the trouble comes when you pursue your means while forgetting about your ends. One of a coach’s tasks, therefore, might be to remind clients of their ends and help them find more effective means.)

Reynolds argues that coaches’ job is to disrupt and unpack clients’ thinking by helping them identify and deconstruct the biases, beliefs, and assumptions that hold their narratives together. This allows clients to question their narratives, see the situations they’re in differently, and move forward in new, more productive ways.

You can help clients dismantle long-held narratives by **positively reinforcing your client for working to improve their situation**. This encourages them to continue sharing openly. For example, you can say: “You’ve worked incredibly hard and done everything you can to improve your relationship with your brother,” or “You’ve identified and tapped into as many key resources as are available to you. What’s left in your control to do at this point?” Encouraging clients to continue to make their own decisions empowers them by making them see they’re not trapped in their situation.

> **Another Reason It’s So Hard to Unpack Narratives**
> 
> In _21 Lessons for the 21st Century_ , Yuval Noah Harari supports Reynolds’ argument that people typically see their narratives as a fixed truth and explains why they’re so entrenched: Rituals cultivate people’s belief in the stories they create.

> Harari asserts that people develop “meaning-of-life” stories—which give you a sense of purpose and put your existence into a broader context—when they’re young, in order to forge their identities. He says that most people combine components of multiple meaning-of-life stories and, as a result, end up with multiple, inaccurate identities. Because people are good at compartmentalizing, they often don’t notice or acknowledge that these identities contradict one another. For example, someone who doesn’t believe in the death penalty might nonetheless be comfortable with vigilante justice that leads to the murder of a person who’s committed a heinous crime against a child.
> 
> Harari says that most people’s meaning-of-life stories would fall apart if they truly examined them, which they often don’t because they’re supported and reinforced in rituals found in religion, politics, laws, social norms, and institutions. Our stories are cemented through the lighting of candles in religious ceremonies, the enforcement of hierarchies and standardized thought in the military, and the carrying on of political traditions through the transfer of crowns and power.

#### Practice 4: Help Clients Set Goals and Take Action

Reynolds says that coaches keep clients focused on goals and actions they’ll take to achieve them. Setting goals provides a guiding light to aim for, decreasing the likelihood of sessions turning into a laundry list review of clients’ surface-level problems. Encouraging clients to articulate what they’ve learned during a session and commit to steps they’ll take to achieve their goals leads to concrete, positive change.

##### Help Clients Set Goals

Reynolds argues that**helping clients identify goals increases the probability that they’ll make longer-lasting change** than if you simply assign them a goal. A goal can be as simple as addressing an obstacle that’s preventing the client from making a decision or moving forward, such as an emotion, like fear, that has them feeling stuck. She says coaches shouldn’t give clients goals because it may prompt resistance. This is because change triggers a survival response in the brain that interprets doing things differently as a threat. People are more likely to embrace change when they arrive at their own conclusions about how and why that change is important—because it’s less threatening than if someone imposes change on them.

(Shortform note: Leadership experts offer a different take on why change is so difficult: It makes people feel they’ve lost control and creates an uncertain future in which they’re forced to contemplate their relevance and competence. For example, if a new boss takes over an organization, employees may worry about the security of their job, whether they’ll have to take on a different role or expanded responsibilities, and if they’ll be able to manage these changes. To minimize discomfort that can come with this kind of change, leaders can be honest and transparent about what workers can expect—for example, they might announce early in their tenure that they don’t have plans to lay off workers.)

Though it’s ideal for clients to start each session with a goal, not every client has a clear goal from the outset. Reynolds says it’s okay for goals to evolve over the course of a session. When clients’ goals aren’t firm or shift over the course of a session, you can help tease out a direction they might like to move in using the following tips:

**Summarize and present choices of preferred outcomes**. If your client appears lost, listing one problem after another rather than stating a clear goal, you can sum up what you’ve heard them say then present several options for direction they might take. For example, you might say, “I understand that you’re unhappy at your job because your boss has unrealistic expectations of you, but that you also enjoy your work. Do you want to leave your job or find ways to make things more tolerable so you can stay?” Your client can then clarify that they prefer one option over the other, or present a different option.

**Listen for strong words and emotions that signal what your client really wants**. Pay attention to words and phrases that emphasize a client’s true desires, like “I wish” or “the worst thing is.” Look, too, for strong body language, like slumping or a distressed facial expression. These words and emotions are clues that, with additional probing, you can illuminate your client’s fears or unmet needs, which can help you identify goals that your client wants to pursue.

(Shortform note: Coaching experts say that another way to help clients identify a goal is to directly ask them what’s not going well in their life, what they’re unhappy about, and what keeps them up at night. Oftentimes a great goal is the _opposite_ of what your client says they’re unhappy about. For example, if they say they feel lonely, their goal might be to make friends or find a partner.)

**Invite your client to change their goals if they have a revelation**. If you notice that your client has a sudden realization that shifts or changes their goal in the middle of a session, welcome the change. A revelation might come in the form of a change of expression on your client’s face, a long pause, or laughter. You can learn more about what they’re experiencing by asking what led them to pause, or laugh. If that reveals that their thinking about their goal has changed, you can invite them to consider whether they want to revise their current goal.

If they say yes, ask how their new way of thinking differs from how they’ve thought about things up to this point, acknowledge the change, then have them restate the new goal clearly so you’re both on the same page about it moving forward. If your client knows their goal has shifted but isn’t sure what new goal to focus on, get them to commit to at least one action they’ll take to move forward, like setting aside a time to identify a new goal for your next session.

(Shortform note: Reynolds’s recommendation that coaches welcome mid-session goal changes is embraced by coaches in boxing as well. They argue that changing up goals can help boxers grow by pursuing bigger challenges they feel more passionately about, which can lead to greater development. Like Reynolds, boxing coaches help boxers uncover _why_ they’re shifting their goal, because if they don’t understand this, they’ll lack the motivation to see the new goal through.)

##### Help Clients Take Action

Reynolds says that **for clients to make meaningful change you must get them to articulate what they learned during each session and commit to concrete steps they’ll take to achieve their goals**. Failure to do this makes it too easy for clients to forget what they learned and not follow through on their goals.

Clients should have one goal in every session, even if that goal is simply to reflect on what they learned during the session. You can get clients to commit to a goal by asking:

  * What their plan is to achieve the goal
  * When they plan to get it done 
  * What obstacles they expect to confront in working toward it
  * What resources they can draw upon to overcome barriers they’ll face
  * How they feel about their plan 



Reynolds recommends wrapping up your final session with clients by asking them to describe their experience and what they learned. To reinforce their commitment to growth, remind them of the good work they did to make progress, including your reflection on a moment that their vulnerability resulted in an important shift in the process, their development over the course of your sessions together, and goals they set and achieved.

> **Set Bigger Goals to Find Greater Success**
> 
> In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone takes goal setting to a more extreme level than Reynolds, arguing that you should get in the mindset of setting goals that are 10 times higher than you’re inclined to and do 10 times what you think is required to achieve them.
> 
> Cardone asserts that people make several key mistakes when setting goals: They set their expectations too low and target things that don’t adequately motivate them, and they underestimate the obstacles they’ll face and the effort and resources it will take to meet their goals.
> 
> He says that when you set your bar higher than you normally would, even if you don’t achieve your goal, you’ll still end up in a better place than if you’d set a lower bar. In contrast, when you set your goal too low, you’ll never realize the full potential of what you could have accomplished if you’d aimed higher. For example, if your goal is to be less lonely, instead of setting out to make one friend, your goal should be to make 10 friends. You may not end up with 10 friends, but you might end up with two or three instead of just one.
> 
> Cardone goes on to say that the success you find from setting and achieving goals that are 10 times what you normally would set will fuel even more success, because being successful creates momentum. He argues that successful people look to keep their success going because they have to live up to their potential to be happy. In this context, he says, being dissatisfied and wanting more success is a positive, motivating force.
