## Exercise: Whatâ€™s Your Purpose?

Having a larger purpose beyond the specific thing you do every day motivates you and fuels your everyday life with passion. For instance, the NASA janitor mentioned in the story was passionate about his work because he felt he was supporting the moon mission.

* * *

Think about what you do every day, focusing on some specific things. What are some examples?

How do you feel about these daily tasks? Are they energizing, boring, or something else?

What difference do these tasks make to others or to your company? What personal or company goal do they contribute to?

How can you use the above answers to define a larger purpose that would motivate you each day?
