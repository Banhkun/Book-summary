## Exercise: Showing That You Care

Your employees and coworkers sense whether you care about them as individuals and they respond in kind. Ways to show that you care include: spending time with them, listening, recognizing them, nurturing their growth, and bringing out their best.

As a manager, how do you feel about your employees? As an employee, how do you think your boss feels about you?

How do you currently demonstrate your feelings about employees? How does your boss demonstrate his or her feelings toward you?

Thinking of a particular employee or coworker, what can you do to show caring and commitment to that person?
