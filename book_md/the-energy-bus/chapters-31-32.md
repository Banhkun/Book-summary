## Chapters 31-32: Things Come Together

George hoped Friday would be a new beginning and a new opportunity that would allow him to share the principles he had learned on the energy bus. Even though he’d been up working until 2 a.m., he felt energized. His wife had noticed a big difference in him—for instance, she said that he complained less, showed his love by spending more time with the family, and was positive and enthusiastic. She felt she’d regained the man she’d married and their marriage was back on track. So even if the presentation flopped, at least he had his family.

Today would be his last day on the Energy Bus. When it arrived the passengers were chanting, “Too blessed to be stressed.” He thanked Joy and the others for the letter and the positive energy. He said he was nervous but ready.

Joy commented that you succeed when your trust is greater than your fear. George should go into the meeting focused on his blessings rather than stresses. Among his blessings were: having a job, having a supportive family and team, having friends, and being healthy.

An elderly passenger gave him one more bit of advice about life in general: Have fun and arrive at your final destination as late as possible with a smile. This was, in essence, Rule #10.

### Rule #10: Enjoy Your Ride

Since we have only one life, we should enjoy it. Often, people spend their lives stressing over small or unimportant things—for instance, emails, deadlines, arguments, and trivial inconveniences—and overlook the beauty around them. But as Joy pointed out, on the day you die, you’re still going to have a pile of unopened emails. So don’t worry about such small things—focus instead on finding joy in each moment. Live each day with purpose and joy.

A professor asked 95-year-olds what they’d do differently if they could live their lives over. The top three responses were:

  * Reflect more and live in the moment
  * Take more chances
  * Leave a legacy



The bottom line is, you should enjoy each day and live with purpose and joy. Joy’s advice to George was that **your best legacy isn’t possessions you pass on or your accomplishments, but a positive impact on others**.

George was aware that today could be his last day with the company, but regardless of the outcome, he’d taken charge of his life and was ready to enjoy it.

### The Presentation

The NRG Company’s leaders expected George’s presentation to be disastrous. His performance had been slipping, and after the presentation, they were prepared to appoint someone else to take over his team and get the product launch on track. It would be George’s last day.

George could see their doubt reflected in their faces. But as his fear started to build, he remembered Joy saying that his positive energy had to be greater than anyone’s negativity.

He pictured Joy’s smiling face and a calm came over him. He knew he would have failures in his life, but today’s presentation wouldn’t be one of them.

George and his team proceeded to deliver one of the best product launches in the company’s history. The leadership had been prepared to fire him, but now they were on his bus. They asked him what had changed. He responded that he’d decided to stop being just a manager and be a chief energy officer. Since his job was now assured, he’d have time later to explain what that meant.

In appreciation, he told his team they could take the rest of the day off, but no one wanted to leave—they wanted to celebrate together. So instead, he invited them all to lunch, where they began laying plans for future successes. They were excited about where their bus was going.
