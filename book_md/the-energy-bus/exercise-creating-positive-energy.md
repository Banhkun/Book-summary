## Exercise: Creating Positive Energy

We each have a positive and negative side, as if there were two dogs inside us battling for dominance—a positive, kind dog and a negative, angry dog. To generate positive energy, you need to “feed the positive dog.”

* * *

One way to feed the positive dog is to focus on what you’re thankful for in each situation, rather than on what’s problematic about it. For instance, when work piles up, be thankful you have a job. Take a walk around your office, thinking of things you’re thankful for.

How did you feel afterward? How did this exercise change your energy?

At the end of the day, many people obsess over the things that went wrong instead of focusing on the big success of the day. What was your big success today? How can you replicate it tomorrow?
