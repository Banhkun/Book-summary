## Chapters 26-27: Love is the Answer

If you’re open to seeing them, signs or messages appear in life to guide you when you need them. As Joy was thinking of what else to tell George, she saw a road sign with the words, “Love is the Answer—God.”

The billboard was one of those messages. It told Joy what George needed to learn next. Enthusiasm is important, but love is the answer for your team’s success, she told him. It’s the basis of Rule #8.

### Rule #8: Show You Care about Your Team

To tap the power of your heart and lead with enthusiasm, you need to become a “love magnet” by demonstrating love for your family, company, employees, and customers. While it sounds trite, the truth is that what everyone wants most is to be loved, Joy said. Your employees want your love. George remembered how his lack of appreciation had demoralized José, and he realized Joy was right.

**You can give employees awards, gifts, and raises, but these are soon forgotten. What sticks with them is a sense of whether you really care about them and are committed to their future.** Your performance as a manager isn’t just about hitting your goals and satisfying your boss; it’s about your employees. When they know you care about them, they respond in kind by being loyal and doing great work. But if you treat them as just a means to your next promotion, you’ll get cynicism in return.

The more you demonstrate true commitment to others, the more you get commitment and loyalty in return. Enthusiasm will get your team on the bus, but caring will _keep_ them on it. Your caring will also improve the performance and productivity of your team.

Love is the most powerful emotion we have. It can literally make you stronger. When people try to bench press a lot of weight, they’re stronger when they think loving, positive thoughts than when they think negative, angry thoughts.

As a starting point, Joy suggested that George focus on bringing out the best in each member of his team; he should help them discover the inner value they possess.

She asked George for the rock she’d given him. After he handed it over, she wiped it with a towel and the black coating came off, revealing it to be gold. The lesson was that everyone has valuable qualities under the surface. Part of caring is bringing out the best in others, or helping them to shine. When a manager discovers and allows employees to use their strengths, the individual’s and team’s value increase.

As George stepped off the bus at his office building, a fellow passenger handed him a sheet of paper listing five ways to love your passengers, or show people you care. He sat down on a bench to read it before going inside.

### Five Ways to Show Caring

**1)** **Make time for them** : Spend time with your employees. Instead of isolating yourself behind a desk, come out of your office and get to know your team. Meet with them one-on-one and get to know them as individuals. Be engaged with them, rather than thinking of other things or multitasking. Focus your energy on them and they will feel it.

**2)** **Listen to them** : Employees and customers want to be heard. Employees who feel listened to rate their managers higher. True listening isn’t just applying an “active listening” technique (such as paraphrasing to show understanding), but listening with your heart and caring about what they have to say. It’s showing empathy. When people feel they've been heard, their eyes grow moist. Robert K. Cooper writes in _High Energy Living_ that in more than 95% of daily interactions, no moistening of the eyes occurs, meaning there’s not a genuine connection. When you ask someone how they’re doing, you can show you’re listening to their response by waiting for the answer and making eye contact.

**3)** **Recognize them** : Recognize your employees as people, not just business professionals. Don’t just give awards or trophies—make your recognition personal. For instance, managers can recognize team members’ birthdays with a handwritten card/note. Praise people when they’re doing great work and you’ll encourage more of it by making the employee feel valued and appreciated. Feed the positive dog in each person and positivity will grow.

**4)** **Serve them** : The more you advance in your organization, the greater your obligation to serve the people below you rather than expecting them to serve you. The key is to nurture their development and passion so they enjoy work and being on your bus.

**5)** **Bring out people’s best** : This is the most important thing you can do for your team. When you’re committed to someone, you want them to be successful. For a leader, that means helping your employees discover their strengths and providing opportunities to use them. The more that individuals can shine, the more your team and company can shine as well.
