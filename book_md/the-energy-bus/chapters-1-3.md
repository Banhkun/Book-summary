## Chapters 1-3: Rock Bottom

George was a gloomy middle manager for NRG Company, which manufactured light bulbs. He had the things many people want: a nice house, new cars, a family, and a job that paid well. However, over the years, he’d grown negative and discouraged.

At the start of yet another joyless work week, George had car trouble and had to take the bus to work. As he climbed on bus #11, the ebullient driver named Joy greeted him with a huge smile.

She immediately recognized George’s type: overstressed and zombie-like, lacking in energy, spirit, and purpose.

As George grumbled in response, she told him hers was no ordinary bus—it was “The Energy Bus”—and he was going to enjoy the ride. She was an “energy ambassador,” whose mission was to energize her passengers with positive thinking.

She told George she had a feeling he was on her bus for an important reason; he replied that the reason was car trouble. Undaunted by his grumpiness, Joy quoted author Richard Bach: “Every problem has a gift for you in its hands. You can choose to see the curse or the gift.”

Which you choose determines whether your life is a success or an ongoing drama or soap opera, she said, adding that he seemed to be making the wrong choice. She dropped him off at work with the parting words, “Choose wisely.”

After work, George got bad news from the car mechanic. The brakes were worn out and it would take two weeks to get a part they needed. The car problem felt like the last straw. The previous evening, his wife had told him his negativity was making her miserable and if he didn’t change, she would leave. At work, where he used to be a rising star, his team was falling apart, productivity was slipping, and he was in danger of being fired. He’d hit rock bottom and knew he had to change somehow.

Finally, his boss and his wife both gave him ultimatums: shape up or face losing his job and his marriage. With his life in disarray, he needed to pull together his floundering team at work for the introduction of a new lightbulb, on which his and the company’s future depended.

The next day, as George headed once more for the bus stop, he realized Joy was right: his life was a soap opera.
