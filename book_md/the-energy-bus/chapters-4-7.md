## Chapters 4-7: The Energy Bus Rules

## Chapters 4-7: The Energy Bus Rules

Joy was elated when George told her he’d be riding her bus for the next two weeks. While he viewed this as another problem on his ever-growing list, she was excited about the opportunity to share her 10 rules for living—one each of the next 10 days—which she said would change his life from a soap opera to a joy.

Since he didn’t have a better idea and needed to do something, George agreed to hear the rules. When the other passengers cheered, George realized they were all in on the lessons. Joy pointed to a sign at the front of the bus, which listed her principles for having “the ride of your life,” the bus ride being a metaphor for life.

**10 Rules of the Road:**

1\. You’re the driver

2\. Use vision and focus to set your direction

3\. Power your bus with positive energy

4\. Share your vision and Invite people on board

5\. Don’t waste effort on those who don’t join you

6\. Ban “energy vampires” from your bus

7\. Be enthusiastic: it attracts and energizes others

8\. Care about your team

9\. Have a larger purpose

10\. Enjoy your ride

### Rule #1: You’re the Driver

Realizing you’re in the driver’s seat is the most important principle, Joy said, because if you don’t take responsibility for your life (drive your own bus), you can’t go where you want to go. Someone else will set your course.

Instead of taking charge, many people feel they have no control over their lives. It’s been said that more people die at 9 a.m. on Monday than at any other time. The implication, Joy said, is that some people feel so powerless that they'd rather die than start another work week.

(Shortform note: There isn’t any widely accepted research establishing 9 a.m. Monday as a time when more people die. However, a study in the European Journal of Epidemiology found that the risk of a heart attack was 20% greater for men on Mondays and 15% greater for women.)

In reality, you have the choice to create your life—it’s your bus, you’re in the driver’s seat, and you determine what kind of ride it will be. As Joy was explaining this, George remarked that other people, like his boss and his wife, seemed to be making most of his decisions for him. **The power of choice is your greatest gift, Joy said. When you claim it, everything starts to change**.

### Energy Is the Key

Understanding the role of energy is important to applying the 10 rules of the road in your life. Energy is always at work in life and the world around you.

For instance, Joy explained, some people increase your energy and some sap it; some foods increase your energy, while other foods make you sleepy; some projects energize you, and some burn you out.

Energy exists in crowds, music, and thoughts. Attendees at a sporting event can feel the energy of the players, teams, and crowd. Announcers often comment that a team is playing with a lot of energy or lacks energy. Coaches know when players are in sync (feeding off each others’ energy) or out of sync.

Thoughts also are a form of energy. People can sometimes sense what a friend or colleague is thinking or predict what that person will say by picking up on their energy. Conceiving a vision for where you want your bus to go (for the life you want to create) begins mobilizing your thought energy to get there.

Energy can be positive or negative; you choose your own energy and your energy influences others. For instance, choosing to smile can change your energy and someone else’s. When you choose to take the wheel of your bus, or take charge of your life, you’re choosing positive energy.
