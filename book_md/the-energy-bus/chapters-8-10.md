## Chapters 8-10: George Chooses a Vision

Once you take the wheel of your bus (take control of your life), you need a vision for where you want to go. Joy explained that first, you must decide what you want—then you can make it happen by focusing your thoughts on it. **You have the power to create the world you want**.

To help George determine his vision, she asked him to write down three things:

1\. My vision for my life

2\. My vision for my work and team

3\. My vision for my relationships

For his personal vision, George decided he wanted to get back into shape. He had once been in great shape as a college athlete, but he’d gained weight since then. He also wanted to feel as happy and alive as he’d felt then. His vision for work was to pull his team together and successfully launch his company’s new product. For his family, he wanted to be a better husband and father. He wanted to bring love back into his marriage and have a positive influence on his kids’ lives.

Joy commented that it sometimes takes a crisis to motivate people to change direction in life. **It takes seeing what you don’t want to make you realize what you do want**. So a crisis is an opportunity to envision and create a better life.

### Rule #2: Use Vision and Focus to Set Your Direction

Turning your vision into reality starts with focusing your thoughts.

Joy explained that there’s a law of energy (also known as the Law of Attraction), which says that **by focusing on something, you attract it into your life**. Your mental energy attracts a corresponding energy outside you. For instance, people often think of someone and then get a call from that person. Or after they buy a new car, they start seeing that model everywhere because that’s the type of car they’re thinking about.

(Shortform note: The Law of Attraction, which stems from the New Thought movement of the19th century, is the basis of much positive thinking advice. It holds that positive thoughts bring positive experiences into your life because thoughts are energy—and energy attracts like energy. For more on the Law of Attraction, read our summaries of _Think and Grow Rich_ and _The Secret_.)

Simply put, thoughts are magnetic, Joy said. So she instructed George to focus on his visions for at least 10 minutes each day and visualize himself creating the results he wanted—for instance, revitalizing his marriage or uniting his team at work. Athletes often use this technique to visualize winning performances.

However, she noted that because thoughts attract like energy, it’s important to focus your thoughts on what you _want_ , rather than what you _don’t want_ or are afraid will happen because you don’t want to attract the negative. And **don’t be a complainer because complaining brings you more things to complain about**. It also uses up mental energy that you could spend creating what you want.

George didn't have a better idea so he decided to give visualization a try. The new lightbulb launch was looming.
