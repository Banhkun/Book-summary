## Chapters 23-25: Leading from the Heart

While George was relieved and excited to finally get his team on track, he still felt he was missing something. Jaime’s and José’s words had hit home and he wanted to convince his team that he’d changed; he wanted them to enjoy working for him and he wanted all of them to succeed.

He planned to ask Joy if there was a secret to being a better leader. But he had to put the question on hold—as the bus arrived at his bus stop, he could hear the passengers chanting, “I feel terrific!” Joy explained that they were charging themselves up.

The word emotion stands for energy in motion, she said; your energy determines your emotional state. Instead of letting negative emotions get a foothold, you need to take control and charge yourself up with positive energy.

Joy noted that when you’re happy and positive, those around you are happy and positive too. **Your happiness is a gift to others. Instead, many people try to please others and end up feeling unhappy themselves**. It’s better to focus on feeling good and let your happiness spread to others.

George realized he’d spent his life trying to please his boss, his wife, and others, only to feel more unhappy himself. Now, however, he was feeling good again and his team was on track.

He was a changed man—now he wanted to be a changed leader.

### The Missing Piece

Joy explained that the key to being a changed leader was to start leading from the heart.

The heart is your power center, from which positive leadership flows, she said.

The Institute of HeartMath asserts that your heart communicates your feelings to cells throughout your body via the heart’s electromagnetic field. It also projects this energy beyond your body—up to10 feet away. Your brain has an electromagnetic field too, but your heart's field is 5,000 times stronger. (Shortform note: The Institute of HeartMath promotes “energy medicine,” which some researchers have termed pseudoscience.)

What this means, Joy said, is that we’re broadcasting positive or negative energy from our hearts and people are picking up on it. We can sense or feel people’s hearts (their true feelings) and know if they’re being sincere or fake. Similarly, employees tune in to the energy of their leaders.

### Become a Chief Energy Officer

Joy explained to George that to boost his team’s energy, he needed to broadcast his positive energy by tapping into the power of his heart. **You lead from the heart by becoming the CEO, or chief energy officer of your workplace,** she said. In fact, anyone in a business can be a chief energy officer by sharing positive energy with coworkers, employees, and customers.

Energy is an essential ingredient of personal and professional success. Without it, you can’t inspire or lead others. Emotional intelligence, which is a business buzzword popularized by a book with that title by Daniel Goleman, is another way of referring to energy from the heart. (Shortform note: Read our summary of Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman.)

Several studies have found that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of performance, accounting for up to 80% of success in all types of jobs. When you act as a leader with emotional intelligence—communicating and sharing your energy with others—people like you and want to follow you. It’s the basis for Rule #7.

### Rule #7: Be Enthusiastic: It Attracts and Energizes Others

Chief energy officers tap the power of their hearts by cultivating positive energy and being optimistic and excited about their lives and work, Joy explained. They aren’t discouraged by challenges, but instead they welcome them as opportunities to learn and grow.

Enthusiasm comes from the Greek word _entheos_ , which means inspired or filled with the divine. When you bring this level of inspired energy to everything you do, others feel it and want to be on your team. People are drawn to you: You develop a reputation among coworkers and customers as someone others like working and interacting with.

The poet Walt Whitman described this power in “The Song of the Open Road”: “I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes. We convince by our presence.”

George remembered how enthusiasm had helped him get his first job—the interviewers had loved his fire. Similarly, his enthusiasm won over his wife when he first met her and tried to get her to go out with him.

Somehow, he’d lost the enthusiasm he felt in his early days at NRG Company. He realized his team was floundering because he was projecting negative energy. Joy noted that **negative people create negative corporate cultures, while positive people do the opposite.**

In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Goleman wrote that companies with positive cultures outperform those with negative cultures. Joy suggested that if you invested in the companies voted Best Places to Work, your returns would probably beat the market. A positive culture is good for a company’s bottom line. (Shortform note: Some studies have shown there is some truth to this—a portfolio of companies voted Best Places to Work outperformed the broader market. Some analysts note this may be more correlation than causation—the companies in a stronger financial position may also be able to afford the benefits that make them “Best Places to Work.”)

Besides practicing positivity and enthusiasm yourself, one way to spread it in your workplace is to let your team know that anyone can be a chief energy officer and inspire others.

Joy cautioned, however, that enthusiasm doesn’t mean acting manic or pretending to be excited. You can’t force it. You let your presence convince people to emulate you. Joy advised George to focus that day on radiating energy and enthusiasm from the heart and trust that others would pick up on it.
