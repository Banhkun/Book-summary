## Exercise: What’s Your Energy?

We project positive or negative energy in whatever we do, and other people pick up on it. When you project positive energy, it’s contagious and other people want to be around you.

* * *

Think of the person in your office whom you most like to work with. Describe the person. What kind of energy does he/she project?

Think of the person you most dislike working with and answer the above questions.

How would your colleagues describe what you’re like to work with? Where do you see room for improvement?
