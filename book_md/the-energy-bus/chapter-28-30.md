## Chapter 28-30: Teamwork

When George arrived at work, he was suddenly struck with doubt and fear that he'd be able to convincingly demonstrate commitment to his team and pull off the product launch successfully. He was caught between knowledge and action—between knowing what to do and making it happen.

As he stood in front of the elevator paralyzed, he suddenly noticed that Michael, who had quit his team earlier, was standing in front of him. Michael said he’d heard from Jaime that George was a changed man and the team was on track and moving. He wanted another chance. George agreed on the condition that Michael spread positive energy to the team by being a chief energy officer instead of a naysayer.

He realized Michael’s change of heart had been one of the signs Joy had talked about being open to on your journey. Maybe it was a sign the team was ready to follow him; maybe George’s instinct to give Michael another chance was a sign he was ready to lead.

In any case, Michael had appeared in front of the elevator at the right moment to get George’s attention and move him past his fear to embrace trust. He would trust Michael and move forward. If George had faith in himself and the team, then they could trust each other and him. His fear turned to faith and faith became resolve.

### Rule #9: Have a Larger Purpose

George had a team meeting and talked about what it meant to be a chief energy officer. He told José he’d give him a raise if he himself didn’t get fired; he promised to be a mentor and resource for José no matter what.

George shared his commitment and energy with the team and they were energized. They accomplished more in a day than they had all month. He continued working on the presentation through the night with Michael and José. His only concern was that more people hadn't stayed late to work with him—to be ready for Friday’s presentation, they’d need another all-nighter with more people helping.

Since George had worked late into the night, he overslept the next day and didn’t catch the usual bus to work. However, in his office, he found a letter from Joy, which had been delivered by one of the passengers. The letter explained Rule #9—Have a larger purpose—which turned out to be the key insight George was looking for.

Joy wrote that purpose is the most important fuel additive for your journey. Knowing your purpose keeps you energized and prevents burnout. She told a story about a visit President Lyndon Johnson made to NASA. Johnson is said to have encountered an energetic janitor in a hallway and remarked that the man was the best janitor he’d ever seen. The man replied that he was more than a janitor—by working on the NASA team, he contributed to the moon mission. The janitor was motivated to excel at his job because he felt part of a bigger purpose and mission.

Similarly, Joy saw herself not only as a bus driver, but also as an “energy ambassador,” helping people find their energy and change their lives. This gave her purpose, and her sense of purpose inspired her passengers. **Purpose infuses your everyday life with passion.**

Many companies and their employees lack this kind of spirit. Their cultures kill people’s energy and spirit, resulting in low morale, negativity, and poor retention and performance. While big projects can be inspiring, companies need to create lasting energy. Joy advised George to find the bigger purpose before the product launch and let it fuel and continue to carry the team after the launch.

As George wondered how to get people excited about lightbulbs, he found another page to the letter, which told a story about two airplane design teams. One team was given a mission to build the world’s most advanced airplane and was shown a model of the aircraft. The other team was divided into small groups and each group was given a component to design; the subgroups weren’t given an overall mission or shown a model of the end product. The team with a mission and vision of the airplane worked twice as long and hard and finished in half the time as the other group. This gave George an idea.

### George’s Team Finds a Purpose

George’s idea was to let his team come up with a shared purpose together. He told them the stories about the NASA janitor and the airplane design teams, and the group started brainstorming their own ideas. They settled on three core principles. They would not only bring new lightbulbs to the market, but also:

  1. Strive for greatness—great ideas, marketing, and results.
  2. Work with purpose and energy. Develop chief energy officers within their team and the company.
  3. Make lightbulbs that warm and brighten people’s lives. For instance, their lightbulbs would help children read, help elderly people avoid falling at night, and help people get ready for work. Everyone who flipped a switch would benefit from the light Goerge’s team created.



Discovery of their purpose transformed the team members. Infighting stopped as they focused on contributing to something larger than themselves. They embodied positive energy. That final night before the presentation, every member of the team worked late with George to finish it.
