## Chapters 33-34: Living With Joy

Two weeks ago, George’s life had been miserable. Now, he realized that things he thought were bad—his work and relationship problems, his car problems—had led to good things. He understood how adversity helps you grow. When facing a problem in the future, he would ask himself what he could learn from it. He’d stay positive and trust that he’d end up stronger and wiser.

The word “joy” stuck with him. He was determined that whatever happened, he’d live with joy by looking for the joy in each moment.

On Monday, when bus #11 pulled up to the stop, George shared the news of his team’s success. He also told them he’d decided, as one way to experience joy in the moment, to keep riding the bus to work. “While driving is great, it’s more fun on the bus,” he said.

### Steps to Building a Winning Team

To build a winning team, use these 11 principles based on Joy’s Energy Bus rules of the road:

**1) Determine your vision:** Work with your team to develop a vision. **Ask** : What are our goals; what do we hope to accomplish; what do we want for the future?

**2) Tie your vision with a larger purpose** : Ask: What do we stand for; how can we make a difference; what great things can we strive for; how can we benefit others; how will our vision help our team grow?

**3) Write down your vision/purpose statement**

**4) Focus on your vision:** Give each member of your team a copy of your statement. Ask each member to review it daily and visualize the team achieving its goals.

**5) Identify goals and actions:** Ask: What goals does our team need to achieve to realize our vision; what actions do we need to take to achieve these goals? Give each team member a copy of the goals and actions,

**6) Invite others on the bus:** Ask: Who else needs to be involved to help us achieve the goals and vision? Invite them to join the team by emailing them a bus ticket from www.theenergybus.com or print out the ticket and deliver it in person.

**7) Cultivate positive energy and enthusiasm:** Engage and energize each other daily so negative energy can’t take hold. Build a culture of positive energy.

**8) Confront ‘energy vampires:’** Identify negative team members who are hindering the team’s success. Give them a chance to succeed, but if they continue to be negative, eliminate them from the team.

**9)** **Learn from challenges:** Expect to experience challenges. **Ask** : What can we learn from this; how can we grow from it; what opportunity does this challenge present?

**10) Love your team members:** Let your team know you care about them and are committed to their success. **Ask** : How can I bring out the best in them; how can I spend more time with them and listen better?

**11) Enjoy the ride:** Remember that teamwork doesn’t need to be painful—it should be fun. **Ask:** How can we have fun and accomplish more; teamwork isn’t only about reaching a goal—it’s about growing as individuals and a team in the process.
