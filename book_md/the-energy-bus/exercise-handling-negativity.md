## Exercise: Handling Negativity

Some people increase your energy and your team’s, while others—energy vampires—drain it. You need to eliminate the energy vampires standing between you and your goals.

* * *

Think about the people you work with. Which ones are energy vampires?

How do they act? How do they affect the work environment and what gets accomplished?

Have there been instances where you yourself were an energy vampire? What were they?

What can you do to neutralize or eliminate energy vampires that keep you or your team from succeeding?
