## Introduction

Everyone encounters adversity and “down” times in life. How you respond to these tests defines you. When you respond with positive energy, you create success and happiness for yourself and others.

_The Energy Bus,_ a parable by consultant and motivational speaker Jon Gordon, asserts that **positive people and positive teams create positive results.** He shows how this works through the fictional story of George, a depressed middle manager at a lightbulb manufacturing company, whose negativity is ruining his career and marriage. When his car breaks down and he has to take the bus to work, George gets life-changing lessons in positivity from the driver and the other passengers.

The book isn’t about summoning superficial or fake enthusiasm, but about cultivating an energy that encompasses optimism, purpose, enthusiasm, and joy. Positive energy enables you to lead successful teams, surmount hurdles, and bring out the best in others. **With positive energy, you can overcome negative people (referred to in the book as “energy vampires”) and negative situations that keep you from succeeding in your work and enjoying your life**.

While this fable has a business setting, it’s written for everyone—the story’s 10 simple “rules” for creating positive energy can lead not only to business success, but also to greater happiness.
