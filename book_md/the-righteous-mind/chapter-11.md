## Chapter 11: Religion and Morality

So far, we’ve discussed the importance of _community_ in finding our foundations and our hives. One of the strongest communities—that’s sometimes dismissed as an unthinking cult by many on the left—is a religious community. Religion doesn’t exist only in churches or mosques—it’s all around us and doesn’t always have a traditional “God” at its head.

This chapter will explain that religion doesn’t always have that much to do with explaining the universe, as many people think. Rather, it**provides the social fabric that binds people together.**

A college football game is analogous to the community that’s built around religion. Students and alumni dress up and participate in rituals that have been around for decades if not a century. From the outside, it looks costly and purposeless if not dangerous. But thinking about it from a sociological perspective, it brings people into a hive where they’re worshiping something greater than themselves. It changes people’s experience with a school, which in turn leads to more donations and a better experience for everyone in the community.

Many people don’t understand religion because they focus on the spiritual and supernatural beliefs that come along with it. They have difficulty describing it or understanding it as a primarily social driver that brings people into a community around a belief.

### The Left’s Misinterpretation of the Purpose of Religion

After the 9/11 attacks, many Americans, mostly on the right, blamed Islam as a religion that encouraged violence. In contrast, many Americans on the left maintained that Islam itself is a peaceful set of beliefs, and fundamentalism was the problem.

However, certain commentators on the left took the opportunity to attack _all_ religious institutions, a movement that became known as “the New Atheism.” Scientists Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett (along with journalist Christopher Hitchens) were the leaders of this movement. Each of them studied religion as a group of supernatural beliefs. Each argued that religion essentially took over the minds of its practitioners, duping them into rejecting facts. They based these beliefs on the assumption that the rider (reason) is in charge of the elephant (emotion).

  * First, they argued, our brains evolved to detect faces, so we may see something like a face in the clouds, but we will never see clouds in a face. Humans start to talk about all of the seemingly supernatural events or objects they see in nature together and form a cogent supernatural belief out of false positives. Essentially, as humans incorrectly detect more humanity in nature, and discuss it with one another, they come to explanations that all of them can accept. This is the foundation for the beginning of organized religions. 
  * Second, cultural evolution happened. Only the best constructed and most sensical religious belief systems were maintained and mutated to become the most persuasive as possible, just like natural selection. 



Dennett and Dawkins both describe religions as viruses, forcing their hosts to spread them around, implying that science should root out religions like it does viruses.

### Religion’s Durkheimian Model

The New Atheists are incorrect that religion is a virus. In fact, religion regularly helps society become more communal. We’ll call this the “Durkheimian Model,” because it follows Durkheim’s logic (discussed in Chapter 10) that certain beliefs and practices create community.

Religion is a self-sustaining practice that can help increase community through _believing, doing, and belonging._ Each sustains the other two. When you believe in a Christian God, for example, you’re more likely to join a church. This leads you to both feel a greater sense of belonging in your community and have a stronger belief in God. A sense of belonging may lead you to volunteer work with a church group and also a greater belief in both God and the institution of the church. The table below illustrates this phenomenon:

![the-righteous-mind-durkheimian.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-righteous-mind-durkheimian.png)

This table flies in the face of the New Atheist understanding of religion. However, we can accept part of the New Atheists’ definition without understanding religion as a virus. Scientists who see religion as an _adaptation_ agree with the first point of the New Atheists’ model: Religion grew as a result of the growth of cognitive abilities that led groups of humans to misinterpret the natural as supernatural.

However, in the cultural evolution period, **the religions that succeeded were not necessarily the most persuasive, but the ones that made groups more cooperative.** Anthropologists Scott Atran and Joe Henrich believe that religion grew because of the group competition that we’ve already discussed. Having something that binds your group together will make your group more successful, so groups with less effective religions would develop or adopt more effective ones.

Gods also helped to create moral societies: They punished bad behavior and rewarded good behavior. If people think someone can _always_ see and judge them, as we’ve learned, they’ll be much more likely to act in a morally upstanding way.

Anthropologist Richard Sosis studied communes in the 19th century to prove the point that religion binds: Of those based around a religious concept, 39 percent were functioning after 20 years. Of those that weren’t religious, only 6 percent functioned after 20 years. The sacrifices that the communes demanded were much more successful when they were sacralized.

To put it another way: **All of the practices that the New Atheists wanted to root out actually helped solve the problem of cooperation without kinship.**

#### Example: Bali Rice Farming

Biologist David Sloan Wilson used the example of rice farming in Bali to explain this concept. Rice farming requires hundreds of people to operate a complicated and large irrigation system that has to be drained and filled at just the right time.

In part of Bali, the rainwater comes down a volcano through the soft volcanic rock. The Balinese, over a period of centuries, carved lots of pools into the mountain and created irrigation systems out of them. And then at the top of the volcano, they built a huge temple to worship the “Goddess of the Waters.” They had a high priest and 24 others staff the temple.

Their social organization was something called a _subak,_ which was a group of families that practiced democracy. There were a lot of small _subaks_ within the larger system, so at every fork in the irrigation system, they built a temple. All the _subaks_ downstream of these forks would worship the god in that temple (ultimately, this totaled hundreds of different gods and temples). This created a shared community amongst the Balinese and allowed them to share water and other resources more equitably and resolve disputes.

We can understand each of the gods in this system as a “maypole.” If there was only one person dancing around a maypole, they’d probably look ridiculous. But add in many more, and the maypole dance becomes a social function—**people can achieve more together than they can alone, and religion provides the social fabric to keep people together.**

50,000 years is more than long enough for gene mutations and evolution. And evidence shows that 50,000 years ago, humans were performing some sort of religious rituals. In that time, group selection worked _in favor_ of religion because religion helped with group cooperation. As such, our groups, our brain chemistry, and our religions have evolved to be bound together tightly.

If humans have been evolving alongside religion for thousands of years, it’s hard to ask them to forsake it immediately, even when it becomes clear that the supernatural principles don’t have any basis in fact.

### Religious Altruism

The New Atheists say religion is the root of a lot of evil in the world. A lot of religious believers say that atheists are immoral. Surveys show that religious people give more money to charity, but are no more likely to actually help strangers when presented the chance.

What religion _does_ do, and what we should expect from the hive mentality, is that it makes people more generous within their own communities. They’ll volunteer or give a lot of their income through their religious organizations.

The question is whether religions create bonds that allow people to turn their back on, or even prey on, people who aren’t in their group. Studies from Putnam and David Campbell show that actually, **religious people are more likely to give money to _any_ sort of charity and are more generous with their time.** Referring back to the ideas of _belief, belonging, and doing,_ they are more likely to “do” because of their belief and their sense of belonging.

In Putnam and Campbell’s study, they asked various questions about religious beliefs, like “do you believe in hell?” Or “how often do you pray?” How respondents answered these questions didn’t change how much or little they cared for others. In other words, being more committed to religious _beliefs_ does not change how generous religious people are. The only association that they found between religious people and being more community-oriented was how comfortable religious believers felt in their religious communities. The group activities that people who are religious—no matter their religion—engage in, and the friendships that religion helps to foster, promote selfless behavior.

### Demonization

Religion thus goes hand in hand with groupishness. And of course, certain kinds of extreme groupishness, like fascism, are morally wrong. However, much of what secular people blame religion for is not the fault of belief. For example, religion does _not_ lead directly to suicide bombing. Rather, it is an occupying force _destroying_ sacred bonds or principles that lead to these bombings. People with intense loyalty to principles they see destroyed agree to give up their lives for what they consider to be the good of the hive. Agreeing to give up one’s life will only happen when the individual has been subsumed by the hive. Religion doesn’t have to be the leading ideology—think of the Marxist-Leninist Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka—but it often is, because religion can create the kind of sticky bonds and total attachment to the hive that are necessary for this sort of violent action. In this way, religion can become a sort of accessory to violence.

On the whole, though, religions provide frameworks for moral behavior. People who are atheists rely a bit more on the rider than the elephant because they don’t have these strong frameworks. Relying on our own rider can sound appealing, but we have evolved to work best in shared moral matrices. When we follow our own riders rather than shared morals, it can be harder to maintain the norms of society, and _everyone_ ’s happiness is likely to decrease.

### Defining Morality

Based on all of the information we’ve learned, we can finally define morality.

Haidt argues that **moral systems work to advance the interests of the group over the self and make society possible. They use established practices, societal norms, and agreed-upon values and virtues to succeed.**

This definition is complex, but you can see how what we’ve discussed already add up to this definition. It’s also important to note that this is functionalist: Morality is defined here by what it _does_ rather than what is _moral_.

In contrast, when thinking about definitions of morality, a lot of philosophers are more concerned with a normative definition than a descriptive one. They want to know what _is_ moral, not what people _think_ is moral. Consider deontology or utilitarianism. This book, though, has been descriptive, and thus so is the definition.

Utilitarian societies use this definition, or something like it, to build society. It’s an impossible task to decide how people should live in the privacy of their homes from a normative perspective. But when considering how governments make and implement laws, especially in Western democracies, utilitarianism is the most just system. All laws should aim towards producing the most total good.
