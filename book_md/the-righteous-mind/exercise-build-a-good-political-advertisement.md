## Exercise: Build a Good Political Advertisement

As Haidt describes, sometimes politicians have trouble connecting with potential voters. We’ll endeavor to build a political advertisement that can connect better with voters.

* * *

What political advertisement or speech in the last two decades has resonated the most with you?

Why did this resonate? What moral foundations did it speak to?

Now, pick a moral foundation that you are less naturally connected to and attempt to figure out what a good ad would look like that connected to that foundation.

Was it difficult for you to come up with an ad that didn’t reflect your own moral foundations? Why?
