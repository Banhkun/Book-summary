## Chapter 8: The Sixth Taste Receptor and Conservative Morality

As Haidt began to conduct experiments and write opinions based on his five principles, he realized that liberals and conservatives understood the second principle, _Fairness/cheating,_ differently. Liberals argued that conservatives don’t care about fairness because they don’t care about _equal_ outcomes—for example, they don’t care whether every school district is equally well-funded. However, conservatives _also_ argued that liberals don’t care about fairness in this case because they don’t care about _proportional_ outcomes—for example, they don’t care that successful people have to pay a lot of their hard-earned money in taxes. Haidt realized that he needed a better definition of fairness, and with it a better definition of equality. This led him to create a sixth taste receptor.

### The Sixth Taste Receptor: Liberty/Oppression

The Fairness foundation is rooted in the wish to protect _communities_ from cheaters, while the new foundation, _Liberty/oppression,_ is about protecting _society_ from cheaters. **Fairness/cheating is about reciprocity, while Liberty/oppression is about a broader definition of equality.**

The Liberty/oppression foundation rests on human nature. There are wide differences between philosophers’ understanding of basic human nature, but it’s clear that in every “state of nature,” some humans want to _dominate_ others. When humans band together, it’s to protect each other from tyranny and also to select away from the people who would choose to dominate or bully others.

The original trigger of the Liberty/oppression matrix is domination and tyranny. People get angry when they feel controlled, which can lead to a _reactance_ —when an authority figure tells you to do something and you become interested in doing the opposite. People band together to stop this domination and can resist or even sometimes kill the oppressor. Biologically, people who couldn’t recognize this kind of oppression coming were less likely to thrive.

The Liberty foundation exists in some tension with the Authority foundation. We do recognize authority as sometimes legitimate (the Authority foundation), but we’re vigilant about authority and want our authority figures to earn our trust (the Liberty foundation). Read any declaration of independence from a colonial state, including America’s, and you’ll see signs of this foundation. It lists oppressive events and enumerates rights that a revolution will secure.

Oppression concerns both liberals and conservatives, and they express this concern in unique ways.

  * Liberals employ the Liberty/oppression foundation when arguing on behalf of traditional underdogs. They worry that the accumulation of wealth by the top 1% will lead to oppression, and they fight for civil rights and human rights. Sometimes people further to the left also fight for equal outcomes, or an equality of pay and services rendered no matter your job title, which doesn’t exist in capitalist systems. 
  * Conservatives are more concerned about their own groups than humanity as a whole. They say, “Don’t tread on _me_ with high taxes, my _business_ with regulations, or my _nation_ with the UN and international treaties.”
  * Conservatives care much more about the word _liberty_ than they do _equality._ Consider Liberty University, founded by evangelical preacher Jerry Falwell. Liberty University’s students are pro-authority and pro-traditional family, but they oppose control or authority from the government. 



#### Karma and the Tea Party

The founding of the Tea Party also explains the different ways Democrats and Republicans understand the Liberty/oppression and Fairness/cheating principles: It began with a man named Rick Santelli, who went to the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2009 and suggested that we shouldn’t be paying for our neighbors’ bad mortgages or giving anyone government handouts. Commentators on the left didn’t take Santelli seriously because his argument was to the right of the mainstream Republican party. They didn’t understand that he was arguing for _the law of karma._ Karma relates directly to the Fairness/cheating and Liberty/oppression principles. As Santelli argued, when people manage their finances poorly, it is only karmically _fair_ that they have less money. Similarly, when a group of people feel oppressed, and rise up successfully against their oppressor, they are delivering karmic justice on behalf of _liberty_.

##### A Karmic Experiment

One experiment on cooperation makes the link between karma and liberty and fairness clear _._ Economists Ernst Fehr and Simon Gächeter asked students to play a game of “public goods” that consists of 12 rounds. In this game, you’re placed in a group of four and you each get 20 money tokens for each round. You can keep your tokens or “invest” in a communal pot. After every round, the tokens in the communal pot are multiplied by 1.6 and distributed evenly among the four players.

If everyone contributes all their tokens to the pot every round, everyone makes money. However, you make the most money if you hold all of your tokens but everyone else invests. On the other hand, if you contribute but no one else does, you lose a lot of money.

No one knows who is in their group, and after every round, the groups are scrambled. The right choice is clear—everyone should just hold their tokens, as there’s much more risk to putting the tokens in. At the beginning of the game, people contributed an average of about 10 tokens. However, as the game wore on and some people got burned for contributing more than others in their group, contributions went steadily down. Cooperation declined.

However, after the sixth round of the game, players found out that they could _punish_ other players. They could pay one token to take three away from another. The right answer in this case is even more obvious—don’t pay to punish, because after every round Fehr and Gächeter mix the players up, meaning you don’t get the benefit of dissuading your partners from acting selfishly in future rounds and you may well lose tokens yourself. However, 84% of participants paid to punish. Additionally, cooperation skyrocketed for fear of punishment. After 12 rounds, the average contribution was 15 tokens.

This experiment prompts questions—why did people pay to punish? Why did cooperation go up?

  * People paid to punish because it felt good. When people take without giving back, we inherently want justice, or karma, to be served. **This was Santelli’s argument—he was referring to the conservative argument about _proportional_ Fairness.**
  * Cooperation ticked up because people were afraid of punishment. They acted better when that threat existed. This experiment proves that Glaucon, the Greek philosopher from Plato’s _Republic,_ was right—people do care more about the appearance of morality than actual morality. 



We can conclude from this data that egalitarianism exists in society more because of fear and hatred of domination and punishment than appreciation for equality. This proved to Haidt that he needed to add a receptor about liberty and fear of domination.

##### Fairness and Proportionality

The Fairness foundation supports both anger at people who cheat you out of money or possessions directly and anger at people who are leeches on society as a whole. In a large, industrialized society, “cheats” and “leeches” are mostly people who consistently rely on the social safety net, or the people who Santelli argued deserved to be punished.

The Fairness/cheating principle is thus **based on proportionality and karma rather than equality** , and it’s mostly conservatives’ domain. Everyone cares about proportionality to an extent, but conservatives care much more. Liberals are concerned about the retributive aspect of karma much more than conservatives, and, for example, feel uncomfortable with long jail sentences for non-violent crimes. This is because this sort of punishment interferes with the Care/harm principle.

### The Conservative Advantage

Conservatives have an advantage in persuasive arguments because they can tap into _all six_ of these foundations. They can talk to people with each of these taste receptors, whereas liberals concentrate significantly on the Care/harm and Liberty/oppression foundations, along with the Fairness/cheating foundation to a lesser extent. Their arguments are thus limited to a smaller group of people.

**Republicans understand—and use to their advantage—moral psychology in a way that Democrats do not. They know that the elephant is in charge, and they know how elephants work. In contrast, Democrats aim their appeals at the rider.**

Some Democrats claim that Republicans aim only to stoke fear. What Republicans are actually doing is triggering all of the intuitions described in the last two chapters.

Republicans talk about innocent victims and fairness just like Democrats. But Republicans have also essentially had a monopoly on loyalty, authority, and sanctity since they became the party of “family values” during the Reagan Administration. While Democrats direct almost all of their political appeals towards helping the less fortunate in society, Republicans direct pleas to Americans who are religious, are nationalistic, care about authority, and believe that these values are imperiled thanks to the movement towards more socially liberal policies.

#### Testing the Conservative Advantage

Haidt, working with graduate students, created a questionnaire to test this theory. They asked, on a scale from 0 to 5, “When you decide whether something is right or wrong, to what extent are the following considerations relevant to your thinking?” They then listed three statements for each of the receptors, such as “whether or not someone was cruel” (Care foundation). After creating a website and getting some press, they tested this theory with tens of thousands of participants.

  * People who called themselves “very liberal” cared much more about the principles of care and fairness than loyalty, authority, or sanctity, while those who called themselves “very conservative” cared about all five roughly equally, while caring less about care and fairness than the liberal bunch and caring a bit more about loyalty, authority, and sanctity than care and fairness.
  * Liberal and conservative institutions follow this pattern as well. In more liberal, unitarian churches, sermons use the words “peace,” “care,” and “compassion” much more than at conservative, Southern Baptist churches. At those churches, the words “duty,” “defy,” and “disrespect” are much more popular. 



As measured through brain waves, liberals and conservatives react immediately to statements they’re concerned about. Your political ideology determines how your elephant—or intuition—will react differently to different sorts of stimuli.

#### The Limits of Liberal Thinking

Haidt’s experiments proved that **liberals rely on the Care/harm and the Liberty/oppression principles.** These foundations support social justice on a broad scale and an attempt to find political equality between subcultures. They also rely on solidarity to fight elites.

Liberals suggest that it is the government’s responsibility to provide for the rights of the weak in society, where conservatives resent when the government infringes on what they believe are their liberties.

**Ultimately, liberals are using Care/harm, Liberty/oppression, and Fairness/cheating**(although they’ll trade away the latter when it conflicts with the first two)**to make their arguments, and conservatives use all six principles to make their arguments,** although they’re much more willing to sacrifice Care/harm to reach their other moral objectives based around the other five foundations.

### Why Do People Vote for Republicans?

Democrats often use psychology to explain conservatism—they say people are Republicans because they’ve been raised in strict households or are afraid of change. They use Republicans’ inferior upbringing or perceived personality issues to wave away conservative ideas as the dominion of the misguided and don’t take them seriously.

Haidt argues that Democrats would win more votes if they believed that conservatives are as sincere as liberals.

If Democrats approached conservatives sincerely, they might be able to convince more Republicans that their way of setting up society is superior. Democrats and Republicans want to set up society differently:

  * One version of society, championed by John Stuart Mill, is based on a social contract that is purposefully created for our mutual benefit. Individuals respect each other enough to come together for a common good. This version of society rests on the care and fairness foundations. 
  * The other, championed by French sociologist Émile Durkheim, suggests that the family is a model for society, which develops naturally and over time. People who exist in Durkheimian societies are born into relationships that are constraining and limit their autonomy. Durkheimian societies value self-control over self-expression. Durkheim’s version of society relies on the other three foundations (Loyalty/betrayal, Authority/subversion, and Sanctity/degradation) as well. 



American liberals believe the Durkheimian version of society is a moral disaster. They argue it’s punitive, too religious, and too hierarchical. Democrats have become the party of “many”: They consider themselves citizens of the world, support immigration without much assimilation, and don’t want to make English America’s national language. This isn’t always a recipe for success in American presidential races, though, because part of the job of president is to be head of the “American civil religion” and glorify its traditions. This understanding of the president’s role lines up much better with Republicans who believe in the Durkheim model of society.
