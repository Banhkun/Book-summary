## Exercise: Identify Your Press Secretary

Consider times in your own life that your press secretary was working overtime.

* * *

Describe a time recently when you changed your mind about something (anything from a political opinion to how you felt about a restaurantâ€™s service). What was the situation?

What did you believe before? How did you justify this belief to yourself and others?

Why did you change your mind? (Did the opinion of someone you respect influence your thinking? Were you trying to gain acceptance in a group? Did you spend time reevaluating the evidence?)

How do you justify your new belief to yourself and others?
