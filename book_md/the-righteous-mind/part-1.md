## Part 1: Morality Is Intuitive | Chapters 1-2, 5: Morality’s Origins

Clearly, we all define “morality” differently. But why are our beliefs about what’s right and wrong so different? To understand why morality is primarily intuitive, we first need to understand how morality evolved.

Moral psychologists ask where morality comes from and how kids learn what’s right and what’s wrong. The two clear answers are _nature****_ and _nurture_.

  * If you answer nature, you are a nativist, and you think moral knowledge is pre-loaded, potentially from God or from evolution.
  * If you answer nurture, you’re an empiricist. You think children are blank slates and their morality is grafted onto them from their upbringing and their life experiences. 



Moral psychologists argue that the answer is somewhere in between nativist and empiricist views. They put forth **_rationalism_ , the theory that knowledge comes from reason, not experience or intuition.**

However, Haidt argues that this common theory is wrong as well. We’ll move through three common arguments for rationalist thought and three counterarguments that, according to Haidt, debunk the theories of rationalism:

  * Rationalist argument #1: Children develop moral frameworks on their own.
  * Rationalist argument #2: Morality is only about reducing harm. 
  * Rationalist argument #3: Morality is governed by reason.



### Rationalist Argument #1: Children Develop Moral Frameworks on Their Own

According to the theories of **_rationalism_ , kids figure out and understand morality on their own, through reason.** Consider this experiment from psychologist Jean Piaget:

  * When kids are younger than age six or seven, if they see two glasses of water, they’ll always say the glass of water that’s taller has more water in it, no matter the girth of the glasses. They can’t understand the concept of volume, even if it’s explained to them. But when they get to be about seven, they learn about the concept of volume by themselves by playing with the water in the glasses. 



After more experiments, Piaget concluded that how a child learns about morality is similar to how she learns about volume—**understanding is not innate, nor is it taught. It’s _self-constructed,_** and it happens as kids socialize with other kids, learning how to play and creating and abiding by the rules of games.

If a child is exposed to enough experiences, she will eventually become a moral human being. Rationalists believe that it is the growth of _reasoning****_ that helps us gain moral knowledge.

Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg updated and deepened Piaget’s theories. He argued that children develop through **six stages of moral judgment** :

  * The first two stages are “ _pre-conventional_ ”: Kids judge whether an action is wrong by whether someone is punished for it. 
  * The second two stages are “ _conventional_ ”: This involves respect for authority but in name only:__ For example, you take your brother’s hand and hit him with it. You’re following the rule not to hit your brother (you’re not hitting him, he’s hitting himself), but you’re not respecting the spirit of the rule, the reason it was put in place. This happens around the beginning of grade school.
  * The final two stages are “ _post-conventional_ ”: Around puberty, many children begin questioning why laws exist and why authority figures have power. They also justify dishonesty if it’s done for a greater good. This is when kids get good at working out ethics for themselves. 



#### Counterargument: Rationalists Don’t Account for a Diversity of Moral Attitudes

Piaget and Kohlberg’s theories were unconvincing to cultural anthropologist Richard Shweder, who argued that **the diversity of moral attitudes across cultures shows that children don’t construct their own understanding of morality.**

Shweder argued that moral psychologists created _rationalist_ arguments based on their studies of individualistic societies, which are unique to the West. These arguments might not apply in the sociocentric societies that are common in the rest of the world. In these societies, there is less of a line between moral rules and social conventions. Shweder conducted an experiment to test this theory, with kids and adults from Chicago (an individualistic society) and Orissa, a state on the East Coast of India (a sociocentric society).

Shweder and his collaborators came up with nine short stories where someone violates a rule in either the U.S. or Orissa. Everyone condemned the actions in some of the stories as obviously wrong. But in others, the Indian subjects condemned actions that the Americans didn’t see as wrong, such as a 25-year-old son calling his father by his first name. Indian subjects as young as five believed that older sons shouldn’t call their father by his first name.

In sociocentric societies like Orissa’s, **the social order and the moral order are the same.** Therefore, it’s clear that kids **are not teaching themselves morality without the assistance of their societies.**

### Rationalist Argument #2: Morality Is Only About Reducing Harm

While developing his theories about the six stages of moral judgment, Kohlberg noticed that children who were given more chances to “role take”—step into another’s shoes and see the situation from his viewpoint—progressed through the moral stages more quickly. Kohlberg reasoned that hierarchy and submission to authority hindered a child’s moral development by keeping him from stepping into another’s shoes and resolving conflict independently. In diminishing the importance of respecting authority figures and traditional social structures, Kohlberg set the stage for decades of subsequent research that assumed that morality was unrelated (and even in opposition to) these values.

Kohlberg’s student Elliot Turiel developed a test to figure out how quickly children were progressing through Kohlberg’s six steps. Turiel presented young children in Western societies with two examples—a child not wearing a school uniform and a child pushing another off of a swing. Kids as young as five answered that it was okay for a child not to wear a uniform if the teacher said it was alright, but that it was not okay for a child to push another one, even if a teacher said it was alright.

Building on Kohlberg’s theories, Turiel thus argued that **children who are able to make choices for themselves develop a morality that’s centered around _reducing harm_ —if an action _doesn’t_ cause harm, it’s not immoral. **

This argument has some merit if we’re considering only the secular West. For well-educated, secular Westerners, ethics _does_ center around the “harm principle,” introduced by John Stuart Mill in 1859: The only way that anyone should exercise power in a civilized society is to prevent harm.

#### Counterargument: Morality Is About More Than Fairness and Harm

The issue is, almost all psychology research (including Kohlberg’s) is conducted on people from the secular West. This leads some scientists to believe that the moral code in these places is the moral code _everywhere_. We’ll call the secular Westerners WEIRD: Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. These WEIRD people, as Haidt proved, are often statistical outliers. As we’ve discussed, people who are WEIRD are much more individualistic than others, which affects their perceptions of the world—they even see objects in their environment as individual, where others see them as connected. For example, when WEIRD people see a drawing of a square, they see four lines; when non-WEIRD people look at the square, all they see is a complete square.

Philosophers who are WEIRD like Kant and Mill have helped to create societies that are individualistic (they prioritize the individual) and universalist (they believe in the existence of universal truths). Their philosophies are based on generalizations about human nature.

In contrast, philosophers who are not from WEIRD societies don’t include proclamations about how humans behave—non-WEIRD writers like Confucius offer lessons on how to behave in specific relationships or situations, but they don’t offer universal rules that apply to everyone in the world.

The view of WEIRD philosophers makes moral judgment simple: An action is either harmful or it’s not. But in practice, morality isn’t this cut and dried—particularly beyond the Western world, but in secular Western societies as well. In addition to preventing harm, moral judgments may serve to order society or resolve tension within a group (we’ll cover the functions of morality in more depth in Part 2).

**Moral frameworks like religion order society.**

  * For example, many communities that have never had contact with each other believe in witchcraft. Either this is a coincidence, witches actually do exist, or (the likeliest explanation) these societies all developed a similar understanding of how individuals should interact with one another and use witchcraft to root out people they believe to be bad actors. Members of these communities are careful to behave morally for fear that their neighbors will call them a “witch” and the group will shun them. This demonstrates how the moral frameworks arising from supernatural and religious beliefs impose order on society.



In the same way, **moral frameworks often express and resolve tension within a group by creating competition among other groups.**

  * For example, a tribe in the Philippines called the Ilongot has young men practice beheadings to gain honor. Many young men murder people with no connection to their tribe. This might seem puzzling at first, but most murders happen because when friction arises within the group, they’ll go off “hunting”—beheading outsiders—which strengthens the bonds within the group.



**Westerners also follow moral rules that have little to do with justice or preventing harm.**

  * For example, liberals call conservatives prudes for saying that anything other than missionary sex in wedlock is a sin.
  * Conservatives make fun of liberals for the belief that what they eat, from free-range eggs to fair-trade chocolate, is a moral concern. 
  * Neither non-missionary sex in wedlock nor picking up whatever you want at the grocery store has much to do with reducing harm. Yet, these issues are still legislated and understood as moral in the United States. 



In truth, in the U.S., the social order is also the moral order, as in sociocentric societies—it’s just based on a much more individualistic framework: When the individual comes first, **any rule that impedes the individual, or personal freedom, can be questioned.**

All of these disparate societies make it clear that, in fact, the modern U.S. and Western Europe are historical exceptions in their narrow definition of morality as that which prevents harm. Furthermore, Westerners are hypocritical, extending their own morality beyond this definition while disdaining other societies that do the same.

If every society has moral rules that are unrelated to preventing harm, then **the rationalist argument—that learned morality is _only_ about preventing harm—must be flawed.**

##### Haidt’s Study

Rationalists argued that Shweder’s Chicago and Orissa study was flawed because “harm” has a different meaning in different societies. To study if morality extended beyond harm in Orissa, Shweder should have asked whether people would condemn actions they thought _weren’t_ harmful. So Haidt set out to write that study himself, coming up with “harmless taboo violations,” like the sex with the chicken example previously mentioned. With Brazilian academic Silvia Koller, they conducted the study across social class and culture in Brazil (they used differently educated people from two different cities). In addition, they used Philadelphia for the Western, secular case.

The results supported Shweder’s theory. In Philadelphia, it was clear that the Americans made a distinction between a moral wrong and a social/conventional violation. The upper-class Brazilians agreed with the Americans. But the lower class Brazilian kids did not, and argued, for example, that it was a moral wrong to not wear a mandated uniform to school.

Ethics and morality are different from society to society. **Even groups within societies have different moralities from one another.** However, particularly if you’re living in a non-WEIRD society, **your morality is likely to be more expansive than just preventing harm and ensuring fairness.**

##### Finding Different Ethics

**Ethical concerns around the world, including in non-WEIRD places, are clustered in three major bunches, according to Shweder.**

  1. **The ethic of _autonomy:_** This is the concept that people are individuals who have their own, autonomous wants and needs. Societies develop “rights” like the right to liberty and justice in order to allow people to pursue their own individual wishes. This is the dominant ethic, as you might expect, in an individualistic society. Along with the harm principle, the ethic of autonomy is the foundation of morality in WEIRD societies. But there are two other ethics that are strong around the world. 
  2. **The ethic of _community:_** This is the idea that people are first part of a group—a family, nation, team, company, and so on. These _entities_ are important beyond the people who make them up. Moral concepts like duty, respect, and hierarchy are essential to this ethic. The idea that people should design their own lives is actively dangerous to the group and will weaken the social fabric.
  3. **The ethic of _divinity:_** This is the idea that people are simply vessels of a divine soul. They are God’s creations, and the intent of honoring God should guide their behavior. According to this ethic, sex with a dead chicken is morally wrong not because it hurts the community or the individual, but because it dishonors the creator and violates the universe. The concepts of purity, sanctity, pollution, degradation, and elevation are particularly important in this ethic. People who believe in this ethic view the personal liberties in Western nations as libertinism, because they often conflict with more orthodox religious teachings. 



Haidt himself learned that, while we are stuck in our own bubbles of morality most of the time, it’s actually not that hard to see other ethical foundations in action and appreciate them.

Despite knowing and understanding these systems in the abstract, when Haidt went to study in India, he felt his own identity—that of a liberal atheist—come into conflict with what he was experiencing. He had meals in houses where wives would serve him silently and retreat back to the kitchen, and he watched people cook and bathe in water that was called sacred but was obviously polluted. However, after a few weeks, natural empathy kicked in, and since he liked the people he was around, it was easier to understand their perspective. The ethics were simply different, and he found some beauty in these different moral codes.

When he returned to Chicago, he began to feel that certain objects radiated a degree of “positive essence.” For instance, it didn’t feel right to bring certain books to the bathroom. Haidt also found he could listen to social conservatives with more of a clinical detachment and understand that they were existing on a different matrix. It then began to make sense to Haidt why the American culture wars were so concerned with sacrilege. What is a flag—a piece of cloth or a symbol of our greatness as a nation, infused with divinity? Does the existence of artwork defaming the church make our world dirtier? Many Americans saw national symbols and religious institutions as sacred and attempts to destroy them as immoral. Haidt, who grew up only understanding the ethic of autonomy, began to empathize with people whose ethics were centered around community and divinity.

Many different moral matrices—or moralities formed from the ethical codes of _autonomy, community,_ and _divinity_ —exist within every nation. Each provides a complete worldview, and each is almost impossible to attack from the outside. **Based on the environment in which we grow up, there are different matrices imbued within us from early childhood.**

People can change—someone raised in a society that’s concerned with ethics of autonomy can understand and start to believe in ethics of community and the converse can happen as well—but usually we maintain our moral matrices throughout our lives.

### Rationalist Argument #3: Morality Is Governed by Reason

An ancient truth, expressed by the Greek poets and philosophers, is that the mind can conflict with itself. Desire can pull you in one direction while reason pulls in another. As Plato expresses in _Timaeus,_ feelings like pleasure, emotion, and even senses are necessary evils that separate us from reason, just like the neck separates the head from the body. Reason should be the master of emotion, even if it’s only the philosophers who can reach this mastery.

We can draw a line from Plato to Immanuel Kant to Lawrence Kohlberg—all great celebrators of reason. In the second half of the 20th century, this theory—that morality is based on reason—became particularly popular. Into the 60s and 70s, reformers at universities interested in promoting equality advanced the blank slate theory, the idea that at birth, everyone’s mind is a blank slate. If so, then everyone can learn to reason in the same way. If we could build a society that prioritized reason over all else, reformers argued, then we could do away with social problems like nativism and misogyny. People would be judged by the quality of their arguments alone, not by their gender, class, or race.

#### Counterargument: Morality Is Governed by Emotion

This sort of worshipful attitude is a **rationalist delusion.** Reason becomes so sacred that, like members of a cult, these thinkers can’t consider it clearly.

Haidt argues that, rather than being based on reason, **moral judgment is intuitive, or emotional.**

**Think of intuition and reasoning like an elephant and its rider:**

  * The elephant (intuition) is huge and moves mostly on its own. 
  * Occasionally, though, the rider (reasoning) tries to guide it somewhere. This can be useful because, from the rider’s perch, it’s easier to see far into the future (or perform logical scenarios in our heads). The rider can also learn new technologies and skills, which can help the elephant get to its goals. Finally, the rider is the elephant’s spokesperson, even though the rider can’t always tell what the elephant is thinking. 



Haidt conducted experiments to codify his theory of the elephant and the rider—he began by testing the theories of Thomas Jefferson and David Hume.

##### Jefferson vs. Hume

Two famous philosophers, David Hume and Thomas Jefferson, agreed that morality couldn’t be based entirely on reason. But they had slightly different interpretations of how reason and passion (or intuition) interacted with one another. Hume argued that reason is slave to the passions, whereas Jefferson thought of reason and passion as independent actors fighting with each other.

Haidt’s early thought was that, similar to Jefferson’s argument, reason and emotions like fear or sympathy could both lead to a moral judgment. He decided to test the role of reason in moral decision-making by asking people to make decisions in environments that made reasoning more or less difficult. For example, he had subjects make judgments while thinking of a large number that was hard to remember. Even in stressful cognitive conditions, though, people’s moral judgments didn’t change. Because reason was weakened and people still made strong moral judgments, this seemed to disprove Haidt’s original theory—perhaps reason _wasn’t_ as necessary to morality as emotion.

Haidt then explored if reason could _change_ a person’s moral judgment. He produced experiments that asked, would subjects change their minds when presented with someone challenging their immediate judgments?

  * Haidt created an experiment with an undergrad that presented UVA students with a cup of apple juice to drink and asked them to take a sip. They all agreed to do so. Then, the undergrad dipped what he promised was a _sterilized_ cockroach into the juice. 37% agreed to take a sip again, but of the majority who didn’t, the undergrad could only convince 10% to change their minds when presenting them with rational arguments about the sterilized cockroach. **Most subjects wouldn’t change their minds because they were operating on gut feeling. Furthermore, they didn’t see any reason to justify their choice.**
  * Haidt then asked about a brother and a sister having sex with each other while both of them used protection. Only 20% said this was alright, and the 80% who didn’t generated **many “logical” reasons why this wasn’t ok**. They felt the need to justify their revulsion. **People made a moral judgment immediately and emotionally,** and they backed up their moral judgment with moral arguments. Even when Haidt or his assistants pointed out that if the brother and sister used protection they weren’t violating the harm principle, students refused to change their minds. These results supported Hume’s theory that reason is slave to the passions.
  * When people saw the roaches and refused to eat them, they didn’t feel much need to justify their decision, because they felt it was simply a personal preference. However, when Haidt presented subjects with the idea of the brother and sister having sex, they saw this as a _moral_ problem. Their _intuition_ had already led most of them to the decision that the brother and sister shouldn’t be having sex. But they made a lot more post hoc arguments that were based on _reason_ because they wanted **other people to agree with their judgment.**



Haidt, through this information, came up with the concept of the elephant and the rider and decided to change his model to a more Humean one, where it is mostly intuition that leads to moral judgment. He made the model more complex, where a _triggering event_ leads to intuition, followed by judgment, and then reasoning to justify it.

### Changing Minds

If people’s intuition leads, it’s not going to do much good to appeal to their reason when making arguments. To begin to change people’s minds, talk to the elephant. (Shortform note: To learn more about this concept, read our summary of Dale Carnegie’s How To Win Friends and Influence People _._)

Even though we know it would be helpful to try to understand things from another’s point of view, **most of us shift immediately into combat mode** when trying to convince others of our righteousness. The rider and elephant can fend off attacks well—this shows our allies we are committed to our cause, but it won’t win anyone over, in particular if they shift into combat mode too.

To change others’ minds, begin to practice **empathy, even though it’s difficult to do so across a moral divide.**
