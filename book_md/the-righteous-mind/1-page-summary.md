## 1-Page Summary

In _The Righteous Mind,_ moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt explains why liberals, conservatives, and libertarians all have different understandings of right and wrong. He argues that moral judgments are emotional, not logical—they are based on stories rather than reason. Consequently, liberals and conservatives lack a common language, and reason-based arguments about morality are ineffective. This leads to political polarization.

_The Righteous Mind_ builds this argument on three basic principles:

  * **Morality is more intuitive than rational.**
  * **Morality is about more than fairness and harm.**
  * **Morality “binds and blinds” us.**



### Principle #1: Morality Is More Intuitive Than Rational

#### Morality’s Origins

To understand why morality is primarily intuitive, we first need to understand how morality evolved.

The question of where morality comes from has plagued scholars for centuries. One of the most common answers is that morality is innate. However, the truth is more complex.

In fact, morality is culture-dependent. For example, **Westerners are unique in their prioritization of individual rights over the common good.** The _individualistic****_ society, in which Westerners live now, is a product of the relatively recent Enlightenment. In individualistic societies, the role of society is to serve the individual. However, most societies subordinate the needs of the individual to the needs of the group—they are _sociocentric_.

Individualistic and sociocentric societies make different moral judgments. For example, in a sociocentric society, it might be morally wrong to move away from your family to pursue a promotion, whereas this is expected in an individualistic society. This shows that, contrary to what many people think, morality isn’t innate.

#### Intuition and Rationality

If morality is largely a cultural construct, do intuition or rationality play any part in moral decision-making? Yes, but their roles may surprise you.

The human mind functions something like an elephant with a rider on top. The elephant, which represents intuition, makes most of the decisions, guiding itself and the rider in different directions in response to all of the stimuli it takes in. The rider, or reason, can _occasionally_ affect the elephant’s path a bit, but it’s mostly there to explain the decisions of the elephant _after_ the elephant makes them. **Moral reasoning is thus not a search for any empirical truth as much as it is a method by which we justify our moral decisions.**

We only change our minds when people we respect talk to and appeal to our intuition. We’ll listen to them because we are social creatures who are desperate for the approval of our peers. Essentially, we care more about others _thinking_ we’re doing the right thing than we do about actually _doing_ the right thing.

##### How We Justify Our Moral Decisions

The fact that we’re social creatures is key to understanding why we make the moral decisions we do. We act “morally” primarily because we fear the social ramifications of getting caught acting _immorally_ —we behave in ways we know we could justify to others if we had to. In this sense, the purpose of moral reasoning is to help us advance socially, whether by maintaining our reputations as moral individuals or persuading others to take our side in conflicts. Consequently, we think much more like a politician trying to win over constituents than a scientist looking for truth. Five examples prove this point:

  1. **We are fascinated by polling data (of ourselves):** Experiments show that no matter how much someone says they don’t care what others think of them, their self-esteem will plummet when told that strangers don’t like them and will rise rapidly when told strangers do. On an _unconscious_ level, we’re constantly measuring our social status. The elephant part of the mind is concerned about what others think of us, even if the “rider,” the rational mind, isn’t. 
  2. **We all have a “press secretary,” constantly justifying everything:** In other words, we all have confirmation bias and are constantly on the hunt, like a press secretary, for evidence that justifies our way of thinking. Simultaneously, we ignore anything that might challenge it. Research shows that people with higher IQs can generate more arguments to support a viewpoint, but _only for their own side.****_ As soon as the elephant leans in a direction, the rider starts looking for reasons to explain it. 
  3. **We rationalize cheating and lying so well that we can convince ourselves we’re honest:** Like politicians, when given the opportunity and plausible deniability, most people will cheat but still believe that they are virtuous. They cheat up to the point where they can no longer rationalize the cheating: In one study, when a cashier handed a subject more money than she was due, only 20% of the subjects corrected the mistake—because they were passive participants in the transaction, they could reconcile keeping the extra money with the belief that they were honest people. However, when the cashier asked if the amount was correct, 60% of people corrected the cashier’s mistake and gave the extra money back—in this case, it was harder to deny responsibility for the mistake because the cashier directly asked them about it.
  4. **We can reason ourselves into any idea:** If we _want_ to believe in something, we ask, “Can I believe it?” and look for reasons to believe. As soon as we find a piece of evidence, even if it’s weak, we stop searching and feel justified in that belief. On the other hand, if we _don’t_ want to believe something, we ask, “Must I believe it?” and look for reasons not to. If we find even one piece of counterevidence, we feel justified in not believing it. In sum, unlike scientists, who generally change their theories in response to the strongest evidence, most people believe what they want to believe.
  5. **We believe any evidence that supports our “team”:** This is why people don’t vote based on their self-interest. Rather, people care about their groups—political, racial, regional, religious—and base their decisions on their participation in those groups. For example, when people are shown hypocritical statements made by political leaders in their chosen party, they start squirming and looking for justifications. On the other hand, when they see the same hypocrisy from an opponent, they delight in it and don’t attempt to justify it. Furthermore, when they’re shown a statement that _releases_ their candidate from something that looked hypocritical, they **get a hit of dopamine.** The brain of the partisan starts to need that dopamine—being a partisan person is literally addictive. 



These rationalizations don’t lead or create our morality. Rather, rationalizations happen _after_ we make decisions in order to justify our intuition and convince others (and ourselves) that we’re moral beings.

### Principle #2: Morality Is More Than Fairness and Harm

Even once we know that morality is both intuitive and socially constructed, it’s natural to believe that everyone’s morality is at least based on the shared principles of not harming others and ensuring fairness. This section proves that, actually, groups around the world operate according to different moral frameworks, and that we need to consider these differences when we’re thinking about how to get along better with one another.

#### WEIRD Moralities

People who grow up in places that are Western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic (or WEIRD) are significant statistical outliers. However, they are the subjects of the grand majority of social science research. This means that research gives us a narrow and inaccurate understanding of human nature, causing us to believe that WEIRD morality is the normal or “right” morality.

For well-educated, secular Westerners, ethics centers around the “harm principle” introduced by John Stuart Mill in 1859: The only reason anyone should exercise power in a civilized society is to prevent harm. However, if you’re living in a non-WEIRD place, **your morality is likely to be more expansive than just preventing harm and ensuring fairness. (** In WEIRD societies, morality also sometimes extends beyond the harm principle, but this is more foundational in non-WEIRD places.)

Rather than _just_ the harm principle, morality actually centers around three types of ethics:

  1. **The ethic of _autonomy:_** This is the concept that people are individuals who have their own, autonomous wants and needs. Societies develop “rights” like the right to liberty and justice in order to allow people to pursue their own individual wishes. This is the dominant ethic, as you might expect, in an individualistic society. Along with the harm principle, the ethic of autonomy is the foundation of morality in WEIRD societies. But there are two other ethics that are strong around the world. 
  2. **The ethic of _community:_** This is the idea that people are first part of a group—a family, nation, team, company, and so on. These _entities_ are important beyond the people who make them up. Moral concepts like duty, respect, and hierarchy are essential to this ethic. The idea that people should design their own lives is actively dangerous to the group and will weaken the social fabric.
  3. **The ethic of _divinity:_** This is the idea that people are simply vessels of a divine soul. They are God’s creations, and the intent of honoring God should guide their behavior. According to this ethic, sex with a dead chicken is morally wrong not because it hurts the community or the individual, but because it dishonors the creator and violates the universe. The concepts of purity, sanctity, pollution, degradation, and elevation are particularly important in this ethic. People who believe in this ethic view the personal liberties in Western nations as libertinism, because they often conflict with more orthodox religious teachings. 



**The Western attempt to ground society in just one principle, like preventing harm, leads to societies that are both unsatisfying and potentially inhumane because they ignore so many other moral principles.** Additionally, it’s hard to accept that another morality is possible or moral (for example, a WEIRD resident traveling to a non-WEIRD place might have trouble understanding the ethic of divinity). This is part of what makes it difficult for us to understand one another.

#### Morality’s Taste Receptors

Another reason people from different backgrounds have so much trouble understanding each other’s values is that, in addition to the three types of ethics, the righteous mind has six “taste receptors” like a tongue. These receptors are the foundation of our personal moralities. People respond to these foundations in different ways, just like people’s tongues respond to food differently. Here are the foundations:

**1\. The Care/harm foundation** prioritizes the values of kindness and nurturing. Humans have innate feelings of protectiveness and understanding of distress or suffering. This helps children to survive (because their parents or even strangers feel the need to take care of them) and makes groups more tight-knit, brought together by caring for one another. In the U.S., liberals rely much more on the Care/harm foundation than conservatives. For instance, a liberal might have a bumper sticker with a message like “Save Darfur” or “Peace” or even “Save the Planet.” The Care/harm foundation is part of the conservative morality as well, but it’s not as foundational. For example, conservatives might have a bumper sticker that reads “Wounded Warrior,” which asks that we care for people who have sacrificed for the larger group.

**2\. The Fairness/cheating foundation** prioritizes the values of rights and justice. The left and the right are both concerned about fairness in American society but in different ways. The left is often angry that the rich don’t pay their “fair share.” The right argues that Democrats are trying to take money from Americans who work hard and give it to lazy people or illegal immigrants. Fairness is utter _equality_ on the left but _proportionality_ on the right (people are rewarded for their contribution to society).

**3\. The Loyalty/betrayal foundation** prioritizes the values of self-sacrifice for the good of the group and patriotism. For thousands of years, humans created groups in order to fend off rival groups. This creates an intense and innate sense of loyalty within all of us. However, the left has much more trouble using the loyalty foundation to their advantage because they often disparage nationalism and sometimes American foreign policy. Because they admonish American policy, some conservatives see liberals as disloyal.

**4\. The Authority/subversion foundation** prioritizes the values of leadership, deference, and tradition. Cultures vary significantly in how much authority and hierarchy they demand. Authority comes with responsibility. People in a hierarchy have mutual expectations of each other—those at the top are expected to protect those at the bottom, while those at the bottom are expected to serve those at the top. Again, it is easier for the right to adopt this foundation than the left, because the left defines itself against hierarchy and the inequality and power structures that result.

**5\. The Sanctity/degradation foundation** prioritizes the values of purity and sanctity. This foundation is based on the idea that, unlike mere animals, we have a soul. Sacredness helps us build communities around a shared principle—often that humans have a creator or creators who ask them to perform specific rituals to honor them and their creations. Certain cultures are more likely to believe immigrants will bring disease or dishonor to their society than others. Certain actions are untouchable because they are too dirty (like drinking straight from the Hudson River in New York City) and others are untouchable because they are too sacred (like a cross for Christians, or even the principle of liberty). American conservatives talk about “the sanctity of marriage” or “the sanctity of life” much more than liberals. Religious conservatives are more likely to have this foundation, as they are likely to view the body as housing a soul.

**6\. The Liberty/oppression foundation** prioritizes the value of and right to liberty. We recognize legitimate authority, but we want our authority figures to earn our trust. We are resistant to control without purpose, which can lead to a _reactance_ —when an authority figure tells you to do something and you decide to do the opposite. People band together to stop widespread domination, and they may resist or even sometimes kill the oppressor. Biologically, people who couldn’t recognize this kind of oppression coming were less likely to thrive. Oppression concerns both liberals and conservatives. Liberals are more worried about large systems of oppression that are helpful to the 1% but keep the poor without opportunity. Conservatives are more worried about the oppression of their own groups. They say, “Don’t tread on _me_ with high taxes, my _business_ with regulations, or my _nation_ with the UN and international treaties.”

Conservatives have an advantage in persuasive arguments because they can tap into _all six_ of these foundations. They can talk to people with each of these taste receptors, whereas liberals concentrate significantly on the Care/harm and Liberty/oppression foundations, along with the Fairness/cheating foundation to a lesser extent. Their arguments are thus limited to a smaller group of people.

### Principle #3: Morality “Binds and Blinds”

At this point, you might be viewing morality cynically, believing that humans are inherently selfish and that morality is primarily self-serving and blinds us to reality—we make decisions with our guts and then rationalize them so well we think we made them using reason; we cheat when we think we won’t get caught and then convince ourselves we’re honest; we care more about others _thinking_ we’re doing the right thing than we do about actually _doing_ the right thing.

But this portrait of morality based solely on self-interest isn’t complete. **In addition to being selfish, people are also _groupish._** We love to join groups—teams, clubs, political parties, religions, and so on. We are so happy to work with lots of others towards a common goal that we _must_ be built for teamwork. We can’t fully understand morality until we understand the origin and implications of our groupish behavior and how our moralities bind us together, as well as blind us.

#### Groupish Behavior

How did we become groupish? Darwin argued there are multiple reasons humans first banded together.

  * First, we developed social instincts: Predators targeted loners more often than people who stayed close to the group.
  * Second, we discovered reciprocity: People who helped others were helped in return.
  * Third and most importantly, we developed a desire for social approval: People are concerned with what other people think of them and eager to find praise and avoid blame. People who lacked these traits were selected against because they couldn’t find mates or even friends. 



Thus, evolution selects for people who act for the good of the group. Since Darwin’s time, researchers have found further evidence that humans do have groupish tendencies:

  * **Evolutionary Transitions:** Biologists see eight clear examples of major evolutionary transitions in the last 4 billion years (from single-celled to multi-celled organisms, and so on). The final transition is the development of human societies. These transitions all move in the same direction—when individual units find ways to cooperate, selection begins to favor cohesive “superorganisms” or groups that can work together for success. Then these superorganisms begin to compete with one another and evolve for greater success, bringing about more groups. 
  * **Same Interests:** One of the human conditions that distinguishes us from other primates is called _shared intentionality._ At some point in our evolution, we learned that we would do better if we split up tasks. After this, collaborative groups got larger to defend themselves against other groups. Natural selection then favored more “group-mindedness.” Through developing a common understanding of norms and values, shared intentionality laid the groundwork for living in the societies full of moral matrices that we have today. 
  * **Coevolution:** Coevolution is the process by which species affect each other’s natural selection. Imagine two species—we’ll call them species A and species B. Species A is taking resources that both species need to survive and attacking species B. Species B then evolves to defend itself and develops an advantage over species A. In response, species A evolves to regain its original advantage. This is coevolution. Humans evolved to work together because other species were evolving to work together better as well. As part of their coevolution, humans developed shared intentionality in order to hunt together and share their resources. Humans also learned to domesticate animals in a group. Groups were forced to work together to keep cattle alive, which in turn helped them to win competitions with rival groups. A more group-friendly nature developed due to coevolution and replaced our more primal, selfish one, which has greatly influenced our ideas about what’s moral and what isn’t. 
  * **Quick Evolution:** Genetic evolution in the Holocene era, which started about 12,000 years ago, shows that humans were quickly exposed to new foods, climates, people, predators, and forms of warfare and social structures. This led to a population rise, as fewer humans died young, thanks to cooperation, and they procreated more. Along with the population rise came opportunities for much more gene mutation. If genetic evolution was this fast, it’s possible that human nature could change in a few thousand years as well. Researchers theorize that human nature changed quickly at the realization that acting in groups would be beneficial to individual success. 



Remember that while groupish thinking is part of our evolution, we are still mostly selfish and individual. **We’re about 90 percent chimp, who is self-interested, and only 10 percent bee, who is group-interested.**

#### Flipping the Switch

Humans have the ability to flip a switch from being that self-interested chimp to working like a group-interested bee. We’re only hive creatures in certain surroundings. There are probably times in your own life when you flip the switch from “chimp mode” to “bee mode”—maybe when you’re walking alone in nature and you feel removed from temporal worries and connected to the universe. Or perhaps you experienced the flipped switch while you were at a rave, dancing with others together and feeling a shared exaltation. Lots of hive behavior, like dancing together, comes _naturally_ to humans and serves to break down social class and difference.

There are appeals to the hive all over. Successful corporations will make their employees’ jobs specific and also make them feel as if they’re contributing to the output of the company, thereby reinforcing a feeling of togetherness. Politicians also frequently employ the hive. Think about JFK’s “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.”

The most successful nations are ones with lots of little hives that cross with each other—someone can be part of a family unit, a workplace, a sports team outside of work, and on and on. In contrast, nations with no hives, or those with one huge hive, are much more likely to break down.

If we have a switch that allows us to work together in a group, and if we can be members of different hives simultaneously, it’s possible we can also flip the switch to act in certain situations according to a shared morality. This suggests that we can find common ground with one another and that our moral frameworks are not always set in stone.

##### The Cons (and Pros) of Groupish Behavior

In sum, we have evolved to cooperate with members of our group and prevail over members of rival groups. Given our groupish tendencies, it’s not surprising that tribal thinking is so prevalent in modern society. We were not made to love everyone equally and unconditionally—rather, we were made to feel kinship with and loyalty to those with similar traits, and our righteousness springs from this tribalism.

For some, this idea is a depressing one. But, as we’ve seen, a lot of moral good comes out of our groupish behavior. Without tribes, there would be no community and no cooperation. Our groupishness pulls us out of our self-interested individualism and, for many, provides a higher purpose.

#### Making Better Political Arguments

Despite their benefits, our moral frameworks are increasingly making us more blind to how others understand the world.

**Largely because of gaps in moral foundations, there’s significant evidence that America is polarizing rapidly, with the gap widening between political opinions on the left and the right.**

For example, liberals and conservatives in America have different foundational stories about the country:

  * Liberals argue that there used to be dictatorial, oppressive regimes that governed the world, which virtuous people through time and effort overthrew. They then founded democracies and started fighting for equal rights for all, creating laws and government programs that could lift all boats.
  * Conservatives since the Reagan era say that America used to be a beacon of liberty, but liberals have attempted to ruin it by creating bureaucracy and tax burdens that stunt growth while also opposing faith and God. They took money from good, hard-working people and gave it to lazy people living on welfare while lionizing evil promiscuity and a “gay lifestyle.”



There is significant value to the liberal understanding—it promotes a narrative of heroic triumph over the powerful through the weak banding together. In doing so it often is in a better position to secure rights and material gains for the less fortunate in society.

Nevertheless, liberals have more trouble understanding the concept of _moral capital,_ defined as **the resources that are necessary to sustain and grow a moral community.** Conservatives argue that **people need outside constraints to behave properly and thrive.** Without them, people will cheat, and _social capital,_ or trust, will begin to decline. Moral capital is what promotes these constraints. If we don’t promote constraints like laws, traditions, and religions, society will come apart at the seams.

A lot of left-wing policies fail because they don’t seriously consider these constraints and the quick changes to them that their legislation brings. As a nation, we must find a way to understand moral capital while also promoting ideas and laws that benefit all sectors of society. This will only happen if we can productively talk across party lines.

##### Finding Civility

Haidt offers three recommendations for improving bipartisan collaboration in government:

  1. Change how we run primary elections.
  2. Change how we draw electoral districts.
  3. Change how candidates can raise money. 



However, Haidt primarily focuses on how individuals who disagree can find civility and common ground. We live in more polarized areas than we used to—in 1976, only around a quarter of Americans lived in a county that voted overwhelmingly (by a margin of 20% or over) for one presidential candidate. By 2008, that number was almost half. These counties maintain distinct cultural differences. In the 2008 election, 89% of counties with a Whole Foods voted for Obama, while 62% of counties with a Cracker Barrel voted for McCain.

It’s easier to live with people who share our moral matrices, and as we’ve discovered people with the same moral matrices regularly have the same political beliefs. Even if we can’t find like-minded people in our communities, we can now easily find them online. We think increasingly that the other group is blind when talking about politics, but truthfully, _everyone is blind_ when discussing “sacred objects” like political candidates or policies. If we can remember our own blindness, though, we may be less inclined to judge the blindness of others. When you disagree with someone else on a moral or political issue, first consider which of the six moral foundations are at the heart of the issue. Then, try to practice empathy. If you have a friendly interaction with someone with different moral matrices, you’re much more likely to understand them better. You might not always change your mind, but you will respect their opinion more.
