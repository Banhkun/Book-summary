## Exercise: Consider How to Sharpen Your Learning Skills

Experts in the field of education agree that learning requires a positive mindset, the ability to focus, and a combination of various learning strategies. Think about how to apply all of these to any current or upcoming learning project you may have.

* * *

What is your opinion about your own learning skills? Do you have any specific self-beliefs that may inhibit your ability to learn new ideas? (For example, you may think that you can’t learn a skill because you weren’t born with a specific talent.) How might you reframe those beliefs in a more productive light?

To optimize your learning time, what would you have to do to rearrange your schedule? What particular distractions are you prone to, and how might you best avoid them?

In the past, what difficulties have you had in memorizing and incorporating new knowledge? What techniques do you think would be effective to improve your mental retention?
