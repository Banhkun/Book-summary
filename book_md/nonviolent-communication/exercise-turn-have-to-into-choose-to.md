## Exercise: Turn “Have To” Into “Choose To”

Practice self-compassion by reframing obligations as choices.

* * *

List one to three tasks you do regularly that you don’t enjoy (like doing laundry, exercising, driving in traffic, and so on).

What need or value motivates the choice to engage in those tasks? (For example, if you hate doing the laundry but choose to do it anyway, you might connect that choice to a need for clean and appropriate clothing.)

For each of those three choices, does changing your mindset alleviate some of the dread? If not, what changes could you make to the tasks themselves that would help?
