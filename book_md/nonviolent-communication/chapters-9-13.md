## Chapters 9, 13: Showing Compassion for Yourself

Up to this point, we’ve explored how to use Nonviolent Communication in dialogue with others. You can also use NVC as a way to approach your own self-talk. Many of us tend towards violent communication filled with judgment and criticism when we speak to ourselves, which makes it even more difficult to relate compassionately to others. Our ability to connect to other people stems from our core humanity and the belief that there is some spark of good in everyone; when we lose sight of our own inherent worthiness, we risk extinguishing that spark in ourselves.

Healing those internal wounds is especially difficult because cultural programming actively discourages talking about feelings and needs. The imperialist roots of the English language play a role as well—we use “needy” as an insult and view anyone who says “I need” or “I feel” as selfish or immature. Over time, we internalize those judgments and learn to distance ourselves from our own needs as much as possible.

### Self-Criticism Prevents Learning From Mistakes

Making mistakes is part of being human, but many of us chronically punish ourselves for not being perfect. Over time, that critical self-talk can evolve into debilitating shame that prevents us from showing up authentically for others. **Shame is an unproductive emotion that blocks our ability to learn and grow from our mistakes.**

It’s true that guilt and shame can sometimes motivate us to change our behavior. We may even see it as simply “tough love.” But even when we have good intentions or are trying to respond more compassionately to other people, shame is a selfish motivation—we do good for others to alleviate our own pain, not out of genuine care for their wellbeing.

Creating a more compassionate internal dialogue begins just like interpersonal NVC—by withholding judgment. Self-judgment is easiest to catch when it takes the form of criticism (like “I can’t believe I did that, I’m so stupid!”). The more insidious form of moralistic self-judgment comes in the form of “should”—as in, “I should have known better” or “I really should exercise more.” These statements are demands, not true requests, because we know we’ll punish ourselves severely if we don’t comply.

To heal your relationship with yourself, treat it just like any other relationship by focusing on feelings and needs. When other people act in ways that contradict our values, NVC asks us to empathize with them and understand the feelings and unmet needs that drove that behavior. You can do the same for yourself: **Instead of thinking, “I’m so stupid,” practice thinking, “What unmet need prompted me to act that way?”**

Bringing awareness to your unmet needs gives you a healthy, compassionate way to grow from the experience rather than getting mired in self-hatred. In the language of NVC, this process is known as “mourning,” and it can be a very emotional experience as shame and self-hatred give way to sadness, disappointment, fear, or grief. Allow yourself to feel all those emotions about what happened without raking yourself over the coals for it.

### Rewriting Judgmental Inner Dialogue

Transforming your inner dialogue using NVC is powerful. For example, the author once worked with a deeply depressed woman who was wrestling with her choice to stay at home with her children. At the root of her depression were two judgmental voices: the “career woman,” who told the woman she was wasting her education by not working and that she should be doing more with her life, and the “responsible mother,” who told her she couldn’t possibly handle the responsibility of being a working mother. These voices were a constant source of internal criticism that left the woman feeling miserable and stuck.

As a first step to alleviate that misery, Rosenberg asked the woman to translate the words of those critical voices into the four steps of NVC: observation, identifying feelings, identifying needs, and making requests. The simplest way to do this is to phrase the issue as, **“When _a_ happens, I feel _b_ because I need _c_. Therefore, I would like _d_.” **See how you can rewrite those critical voices using this formula:

Critical Self-Talk  | NVC Statement   
---|---  
I’m wasting my education. I should do more with my life.  | **When** I spend this much time at home, **I feel** depressed **because I need** professional fulfillment. **Therefore, I would like** to get a part-time job.   
I can’t handle the responsibility of being a working parent.  | **When** I think about going back to work, **I feel** scared and overwhelmed **because I need** to know my kids are still being taken care of. **Therefore, I would like** to find quality child care options.   
  
Rephrasing those inner judgments in the language of NVC takes the focus off blame and criticism by acknowledging the reality of the situation, examining feelings and needs nonjudgmentally, and using those observations to make a plan. Empathizing with your needs and feelings helps you naturally move toward a solution instead of staying stuck in a cycle of self-judgment.

You can also use this technique when those inner voices direct their criticism at other people. If someone cuts you off in traffic, you might instinctively react with anger and blame—which, over time, takes a toll on your physical and mental health. Instead of blaming others for those feelings, try showing yourself empathy: “I’m feeling terrified because we almost crashed just now. I wish people would drive more cautiously because I need to feel safe.” Empathy can act as a pressure release and defuse the stress of the situation.

### Making Choices That Contribute to Self-Compassion

The way you speak to yourself is only one part of being self-compassionate. Another important part is your external reality—the choices you make about how to spend your time. Rosenberg’s advice is, “Don’t do anything that isn’t play!” In other words, joy and compassion should motivate your choices rather than duty, shame, or obligation.

At first glance, this may sound like a ridiculous philosophy, or one that’s only possible for millionaires. The rest of us are accustomed to working hard on tasks we dread; we see that as normal because our culture encourages the “daily grind.” But **NVC recognizes that constant drudgery as a form of self-violence because of the mental, physical, and spiritual toll it takes on us.** That doesn’t mean you should quit your job and move to a tropical island somewhere—it’s about transforming your _relationship_ with the way you spend your energy.

Language creates and reinforces the way we think about our everyday lives. When you say you “have to” do something, it immediately becomes a chore; in contrast, if you “choose to” do something, you acknowledge that you are responsible for the way you spend your energy.**Transforming “have to” into “choose to” is a powerful, practical tool for increasing self-compassion and turning obligation into play.**

#### Connecting Choices to Needs and Values

Again, turning “have tos” into “choose tos” may seem impossible because some things seem like true obligations—we can’t just choose not to eat or not to go to work. But “choosing to” do something in the context of NVC doesn’t imply that you could simply “choose not to” do it without consequences—it means connecting that choice to the needs and values underlying it. We make active choices about even the most basic activities: We _choose_ to eat because we value staying alive and healthy; we _choose_ to go to work because we value having a place to live (which costs money).**Evaluating the needs and values behind the choices we dread gives us an opportunity to either change the situation or change our mindset.**

Notice that the need behind the choice to go to work isn’t “to make money.” **Money, itself, is not a “need”—it’s a _strategy_ for meeting a much more fundamental need. **If you have no other strategies to meet that need, taking responsibility for your choice to go work (rather than miss rent) can at least help you feel less helpless in the situation. If you _do_ have other strategies for meeting that need for a place to live, becoming aware of the motivations behind your choice to work might prompt you to meet that need in a different way.

Take a moment to think about the things you do regularly that feel like “have tos.” For some of them, identifying the underlying need or value might help you reframe the act as play. For example, maybe you dread having to drive your kids to school, but you realize that you choose to do that because you value quality time with them. That naturally shifts your mindset to one of gratitude for having the chance to spend that time together.

On the other hand, some of the needs and values underlying your choices may be less joyful, like the need to gain approval, escape punishment, avoid shame and guilt, or fulfill a sense of duty. If you discover one of these motivations, you have the same two options: **Change the situation or change your mindset**.

For example, if you realize you hate putting on makeup and only do it to gain others’ approval, you might decide to prioritize self-compassion and change that habit. On the other hand, if you realize you only pay taxes to avoid punishment, you could choose to change your mindset by focusing instead on the essential services your money supports (like hospitals, schools, and roads) and all the people that might benefit from them.

### Using NVC in a Therapy Setting

Many people seek out therapy to help tame their inner critic. Today, most therapists are trained in methods that are compatible with NVC, but that wasn’t always the case. **Until the mid-20th century, clinical detachment was the cardinal rule of psychotherapy.** Therapists were trained to keep their feet firmly planted in the realm of analysis, not empathy, and to think of themselves as a mirror—an inanimate object that reflects clients’ feelings back to them in an organized way.

This practice continued until prominent psychologists began to question whether clinical detachment was really the best way to help someone deal with emotional difficulties. They worried that the hierarchical patient/therapist relationship prevented therapists from being authentically present with their clients, which in turn prevented clients from feeling fully seen and heard. **When clients expressed vulnerability, they were met with cool detachment, which often discouraged clients from sharing more.**

Psychology has evolved since that time, and modern graduate programs now train aspiring therapists to respond to their clients with empathy and to focus on feelings instead of analyzing and diagnosing. This isn’t universal—in medical contexts where a particular diagnosis determines treatment options or insurance coverage, psychiatrists and psychologists often spend more time debating diagnoses than empathizing with a person’s feelings.

There is a big difference between the diagnostic mindset and the Nonviolent Communication mindset. A psychologist who is focused on diagnosing someone will think in terms of “What’s wrong with this person?” In the same situation, a psychologist practicing NVC would think, “What is this person feeling? What do they need? And which of _my_ feelings and needs are being triggered by this situation?”

**Showing up authentically like this requires the therapist to be vulnerable, which evens out the balance of power in the relationship.** Obviously, therapists still need to be careful not to overshare or to take up clients’ time with their own issues, but overall, using NVC in a therapeutic relationship is helpful. Making a genuine human connection with a client in pain can be more powerful than years of detached analysis.
