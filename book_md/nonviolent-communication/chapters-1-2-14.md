## Chapters 1-2, 14: Nonviolent Communication vs. Life-Alienating Communication

Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a way of interacting with other people and ourselves with empathy and compassion. The author, Marshall B. Rosenberg, was drawn to the idea of encouraging compassion after witnessing the deadly 1943 Detroit race riots as a child. He founded the Center for Nonviolent Communication, a nonprofit organization that trains community leaders in NVC.

In the first few chapters of this summary, we’ll discuss the philosophy behind Nonviolent Communication and how it differs from “life-alienating communication.” In Chapters 3-6, we’ll learn how to apply the four steps of NVC: observe, identify and state feelings, identify and state needs, and make requests. Then, in Chapters 7-8, we’ll learn how to use NVC as a listener rather than a speaker. Finally, we’ll discuss practical applications of NVC, including practicing self-compassion, resolving conflicts, and expressing anger.

### What Is Nonviolent Communication?

The purpose of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is to foster authentic connections with ourselves and others. These connections have to start with compassion, which NVC naturally creates. You can use NVC in almost any relationship or environment, including in families, schools, governments, businesses, and personal relationships.

NVC is about communicating, but it is also a framework for attention. In communicating, we often fixate on unhelpful things (like judgment and defensiveness), but these behaviors won’t get us what we need and want out of the conversation. Nonviolent Communication helps us refocus on what will.

In this context, the words “violent” and “nonviolent” don’t just refer to physical conflict. Any communication that causes pain or harm to anyone (including ourselves) is “violent,” while any communication that stems from true compassion is “nonviolent.” **On a philosophical level, the core idea of NVC is to keep your attention focused on a sense of common humanity when you communicate (instead of getting distracted by strong emotions) because that human connection keeps you grounded in compassion.**

For example, imagine someone has just insulted you. If you focus on your anger, you’re likely to communicate violently by hurling an insult right back. But if you focus on the feelings and needs you have in common, you might recognize that insulting you was this person’s way of expressing their insecurity and their need for self-esteem. Keeping your attention on that common humanity allows you to tap into empathy (since we’ve all felt insecure at some point), and empathy makes it easier to respond with compassion.

This doesn’t mean you can’t _feel_ strong emotions in NVC—feelings are a core component of this framework—it just means that you don’t allow those strong feelings to stop you from communicating in a compassionate way. That way, you can communicate with anyone, even people you have serious disagreements with, without compromising your values around how human beings should be treated.

For any communication to be truly nonviolent, it has to come from a place of compassion, _not_ from a desire to make another person do what you want them to do. Paradoxically, when done well, NVC has a much higher chance of resulting in a satisfying outcome for everyone. In other words, to get what you want, you have to forget what you want and focus instead on the other person’s humanity.

We’ll explore this paradox in more detail in later chapters, but the basic reason NVC is more likely to help you get what you want is that **people are much more motivated to be compassionate and empathetic when they are first shown compassion and empathy themselves.**

In practice, NVC applies both to expressive and receptive communication, which means we can use this framework as both a speaker and a listener.

### What Is Life-Alienating Communication?

Before we dive into each step of NVC in detail, let’s look at the types of communication that can _prevent_ us from relating to others with compassion. Rosenberg uses the phrase “life-alienating communication” to describe any form of communication that blocks our ability to focus on our core humanity and establish real connections. Many of these ideas are so embedded in our language and culture that we’ve lost sight of how they create distance between ourselves and others.

#### Types of Life-Alienating Communication

##### Moralistic Judgments

These judgments stem from the belief that our values are good, and anyone who doesn’t share our values is wrong or bad. This can take the form of blame, labels, insults, criticism, or diagnoses. Moralistic judgments are different from value judgments, which express our beliefs about the world rather than a specific person or group. For example, “violence is bad” is a value judgment; “violent people are evil” is a moralistic judgment.

Making moralistic judgments of others is really a roundabout way of expressing our own values and needs (for example, if we label one political party as “bad,” that’s a way of communicating that their values don’t align with our own). Unfortunately, when we express our values and needs through labels, it creates conflict and moves us even further from getting our needs met.

The moment we label someone, we create distance between them and us, which allows us to forget our common humanity. This distance is dangerous—**the root cause of violence is attributing “wrongness” to another person or group.**

This kind of communication is especially prevalent in societies with strong hierarchies of power because it upholds the notion that some people are “good” (and so “deserve” to be in power) and some people are “bad” (and “deserve” whatever punishments they get).

Rather than label someone based on our own beliefs or analyses, NVC asks us to stick to pure observation. For example, instead of saying, “Sarah is so lazy,” someone practicing NVC would say, “Sarah has been late to work three times this week.” This is an objective observation of what someone does, says, or believes, rather than a judgment of who they are as a person.

##### Comparisons

As the saying goes, “Comparison is the thief of joy.” When you compare yourself to other people, you’re really making a moralistic judgment about whether they are “better” or “worse” than you are.

##### Denial of Responsibility

When you attribute the causes of your feelings and actions to an external source, you deny your own responsibility. For example, the phrases “He makes me so angry,” “I was late because my partner took too long getting ready,” and “I have to wear a skirt to church because I’m a woman” are all denials of responsibility. Taking responsibility for your feelings is a major theme in NVC because failing to do so can cause all kinds of conflict.

One way to practice taking responsibility for your thoughts, feelings, and behavior is by replacing the words “have to” with “choose to.” For example, instead of saying, “I have to get up early,” you can say, “I choose to get up early because getting to work on time is important to me.” That way, you remind yourself that you’re responsible for your own choices and that many of the things you do out of “obligation” are actually choices that serve your higher values.

This exercise might feel strange at first because we’re so used to thinking in terms of obligation. You might even be thinking that some things really _are_ “have tos,” not “choose tos.” But underneath everything you do is a choice you make based on your needs or values. Even something as basic as eating is something you choose to do because you need energy and value being alive.

##### Making Demands

Expressing requests as demands is life-alienating because it implicitly threatens blame and punishment if the person refuses (for example, a parent asking their child to clean up the kitchen is a demand if the child assumes she’ll be punished if she doesn’t obey). In fact, the concepts of reward and punishment themselves are forms of life-alienating communication because they depend on moralistic judgments. The idea that someone “deserves” reward or punishment stems from our judgment of whether they are “good” or “bad.”

#### Compliments: An Unexpected Form of Life-Alienating Communication

Surprisingly, compliments are also a form of life-alienating communication in NVC because **compliments are really a type of judgment**. If someone calls you “brilliant” or “talented,” they’re making a judgment about _who you are_ as a person. The fact that it’s a positive judgment doesn’t change the fact that it prevents you from forming a genuine human connection with the person making the judgment.

Another reason even positive judgments can be life-alienating is that **people often use compliments as a tool of manipulation.** Managers might compliment their employees as a way to increase productivity; parents use praise to encourage their children’s “good” behavior and discourage “bad” behavior. But even genuine appreciation and praise can be difficult to accept gracefully because it directly contradicts that self-critical inner voice.

A secondary reason for avoiding positive judgment labels is that they give the person very little information about what they did right. If you tell your child, “You’re so smart,” they may have no idea what they did that earned them the label “smart” and be confused about what you expect of them.

In Nonviolent Communication, the focus of every interaction is feelings and needs. Instead of relying on compliments, you can show appreciation nonviolently by telling someone which of your needs they’ve met and how that made you feel.

Similarly, when someone else expresses appreciation for _you_ , don’t get caught up in whether or not you “deserve” that appreciation. Reframe their praise by asking them to articulate which needs of theirs you’ve helped to meet and how that made them feel. That way, their appreciation isn’t a judgment of who you _are_ , it’s an expression of gratitude for something you’ve _done_. By reframing praise in this way, you can celebrate the joy you’re able to bring other people without worrying about their judgment of you.

##### Expressing Appreciation Authentically

Expressing appreciation with NVC doesn’t involve compliments. Instead of making positive judgments about someone, tell that person how they have specifically improved your life. This requires three pieces of information:

  1. What the person did
  2. What need their actions fulfilled
  3. What positive emotions that fulfillment created



You can express these statements in any order and in varying degrees of detail. For example, imagine you’ve attended a lecture and want to compliment the speaker afterwards. Your instinct might be to use a positive label like “You’re so brilliant!”, but that doesn’t give the speaker any valuable, specific feedback. Instead, recognize a specific action, the need that action met, and the positive emotions you feel as a result: “When you talked about ways to resolve a conflict, I felt hopeful because I’ve been arguing with my son and your words showed me a new way to connect with him.”

It might feel awkward to express appreciation in this way because talking plainly about needs and feelings is a vulnerable act. If you feel hesitant to tell someone just how important they are to you, take a moment to imagine how you might feel if you never got the chance to express your appreciation to this person. If you think you’d feel regret, let that inform your choice to express your appreciation while you have the chance.

##### Receiving Appreciation Authentically

Have you ever felt uncomfortable after receiving a compliment? That’s a common reaction in a culture that encourages emotional detachment. You might squirm or worry about living up to the complimentary label in the future. **When someone expresses appreciation, your ability to accept it stems from how you feel about yourself.**

Typically, people respond to compliments in one of two ways: They let it inflate their ego, or they shrug it off and downplay their accomplishments. This is often a form of false modesty that stems from being uncomfortable with the compliment, not a genuine evaluation of their efforts.

Despite how much we struggle to accept compliments gracefully, we all have an instinctive desire for genuine appreciation. Human brains naturally focus on the negative. You’ve experienced this if you’ve ever been in a situation where you received loads of praise and only one piece of criticism, only to find yourself dwelling on the criticism hours later. Receiving genuine appreciation helps balance the exaggerated weight of negativity.

How can we accept appreciation without squirming away? Reframe how you view your accomplishments. Instead of seeing others’ appreciation as a judgment of your worth (that you may or may not agree with), think of yourself as a conduit for goodness in that person’s life. That way, **you can celebrate the fact that you helped connect someone to the wonderful parts of life without fretting about whether or not _you_ are wonderful as a human being. **In other words, think of yourself as the messenger, rather than the gift.

For example, imagine someone compliments your skill as a musician. Instead of focusing on whether you’re talented enough to “deserve” that praise, focus on the fact that music itself is life-enriching. When someone compliments your skill, they’re really thanking you for bringing the gift of beautiful music into their life.
